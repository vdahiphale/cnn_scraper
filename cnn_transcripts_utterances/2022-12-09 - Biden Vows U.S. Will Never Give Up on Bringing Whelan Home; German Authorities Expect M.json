      "sentences": "He ended up taking a group of them as part of their tour through the Kremlin. And then that evening, he disappeared.SCIUTTO (voice-over): Russia's Federal Security Service accused him of being a spy. Whelan had visited Russia before, including as early as 2006 while on a two-week leave from a deployment to Iraq. Born in Canada to British parents, Whelan moved to the U.S. as a child. He has U.S., Canadian, British and Irish citizenship. Whelan joined the Marine Reserves in 1994. He did multiple tours in Iraq. And during the 2006 deployment, he was accused by the military of attempting to steal more than $10,000. He was court-martialed and discharged for bad conduct two years later. After the Military, Whelan worked in corporate security. First as a senior manager in the global security firm, Kelly Services. And in 2017 he began working for automotive components supplier BorgWarner, eventually becoming Director of Global Security. According to his brother, Whelan was a world traveler with friends, in Russia. He was also active on Russian social media. After his arrest, Russia claimed Whelan was caught, quote, \"Red- handed,\" with a flash drive, with State secrets. Whelan maintains he was set up. D. WHELAN: One of the friends that he had made in Russia visited him the night of the wedding, right before the wedding happened, and gave Paul a USB, just a USB stick. And said that they were photos from a previous trip that they'd been on to another part of Russia. And as soon as he was given the USB stick and put it in his pocket, his door was opened, by the FSB and he was arrested and that was it. SCIUTTO (voice-over): On June 15, 2020, Whelan was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years of hard labor in prison. In the years since his arrest, the U.S. government has also maintained Whelan's innocence and made repeated attempts to secure his release. Today, CNN's Jennifer Hansler spoke to Whelan, by phone from the penal colony where he's being held. P. WHELAN: I have to say I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release. especially as the four-year anniversary of my arrest is coming up. I was arrested for a crime that never occurred. I'm happy that Brittney is going home today, and that Trevor went home when he did. But I don't understand why I'm still sitting here.

      "sentences": "It didn't live up to the hype but of course it got volume to next weekend. So, we'll be doing this all over again and perhaps that's where those bombshells will be dropped. With regards to this, what did we learn? Nothing particularly new. But it really just underscored how the couple feel about the Royal family, how they feel about the press.In terms of the Royal family, more damaging claims of unconscious bias when it comes to race. Also, lots of anecdotes that we can get into about members of the Royal family and the experience of Meghan joining that family. I would say there was a really deep contempt for the press which was quite shocking. It wasn't just about the tabloid press. It wasn't just about the paparazzi. And we saw them being followed actually in America, not the U.K., by a paparazzi. But it was also just about mainstream media, international media even the Royal Rota which is the press that's accredited by the palace to cover their events. In fact, at one stage Prince Harry called them an extended PR arm of the Royal family. Now within the series within the three episodes we've seen there were some beautiful footage of them and their children and their home. We learned a lot about their relationship. How they met actually on Instagram and their first date. We learned about the proposal. We saw -- we had comments from Meghan's mom which was really nice. There were some really beautiful moments. But woven into that lots of sort of digs I'd say at the Royal family. For instance, at one point Meghan talks about meeting that now Prince and Princess of Wales for the first time at Kensington Palace. She says she was barefoot, ripped jeans, very informal. She went in for a hug. She says she didn't realize how jarring that would be for a lot of Brits. Suggesting that the hug wasn't welcome. And she made the point that the formality on the outside of the Royal family carries on in the inside. So, that's possibly a bit of a dig at the Royal family. There's also this moment where Prince Harry says of the men of the Royal family -- and you can work this out whether to dig at the father or the brother here -- there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold as opposed to someone you perhaps destined to be with. So, kind of drawing comparisons there with his relationship and other relationships within the Royal family. The reaction from the Royal family of course in terms of the right to reply that journalist would want to get from the people that have allegations laid against them. It's hard to come by. They don't really comment. They have said though that while there is a slate at the beginning of the first episode saying the Royal family members declined to comment, they say they weren't really made aware that there was some email from a third-party production company. They couldn't verify whether it was to do with this production from Archetype Productions or from Netflix. So, they weren't actually able to make any kind of response there. Make of that what you will -- Kim.",

There's one moving through the Midwest and impacting Chicago. There's another impacting the Rockies today. And then the large storm system that's going to be the big instigator heading into the weekend and early part of next week.Just entering into the equation along the West Coast, later today and certainly through the course of the weekend, this is going to bring multiple feet of snowfall to the Sierra Nevada mountain range, the Cascades, tricky driving through let's say Lake Tahoe for instance. But you get into the lower elevations and that's where you start to see the heavy rainfall impacting the coastline and that will overspread San Francisco all the way to Los Angeles as well. With our typical rainy spots Portland to Seattle with this particular system. You can see the 9 million Americans under winter weather alerts. Those are winter storm warnings by the way. Avalanche watches in effect for some locations across the Sierra Nevada range. And then I want to shift your focus towards what's more of an immediate threat. This is the ongoing storm system that's taking place across the Midwest and into the Central Plains as well. You can see the winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings for northern Iowa, southern Minnesota and the northern suburbs of Chicago. Here's the latest radar -- and I want to point out to you, because the bulk of this precipitation into Chicago is going to be rainfall. Maybe a snowflake or 2 mixed in at times. But I think the real mixture is just going to be north near the border of Illinois and Wisconsin. So, there is the initial storm system and then look at the wet weather developing across the deep south, Little Rock to Texas. And then I want to put your attention towards Monday into Tuesday of next week. This is all from the storm system that's impacting the West Coast. This weekend it advances east. There is a severe weather threat for Oklahoma and Texas on Monday. But Tuesday's the big day we need to keep an eye on the sky. Houston, Dallas, Shreveport, all the way to Little Rock, we have a high likelihood of severe weather on Tuesday -- Kim.",
