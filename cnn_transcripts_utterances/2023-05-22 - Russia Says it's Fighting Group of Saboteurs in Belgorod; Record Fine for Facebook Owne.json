This hour claims and counterclaims as Ukraine'sDeputy Defense Minister says his forces are still in control of some parts of Bakhmut after Russia claim to capture the city. The eastern city has been one of the most fiercely contested and bloodiest battles in the war in Ukraine. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp has been fined a whopping $1.3 billion for data privacy breaches. This is the largest fine ever handed out under a U.S. landmark data privacy law. The world waits to see President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are any closer to reaching a deal on the debt ceiling. Two leaders are preparing to hold their next round of high stake talks later today. And any minute we are expecting to see the second ever private astronaut crew enter the International Space Station. Among them is the first Saudi woman in specs. Russia's claim of a big battlefield victory in Ukraine is under dispute. Ukraine says its forces to control pockets of Bakhmut and more importantly, according to the Deputy Defense Minister movement around the outskirts. Totally capturing Bakhmut would give Russia a symbolic if not strategic victory, after months of fighting that has left the city in ruins. The Head of Russia's Wagner Mercenary Group says his troops are going to leave Bakhmut by June 1 to cede control to the regular Russian army. Well, external power has been restored to the Zaporizhzhia power plant after it was temporarily cut. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog chief calls the situation there extremely vulnerable. And Russia says it's fighting a group of saboteurs that have crossed the end of the Belgorod region from Ukraine. Our Sam Kiley is back with us this hour from southeastern Ukraine covering all those developments. Good to have you with us. I want to start first with that nuclear power plant. The power has now been restored. Just explain what happened.",

That is essential to drive the cooling operations of the power plant because in particular, the reactors are all in a dormant state. It's happened before. And what it means is that first of all, it was lightly cut by artillery fire. We don't know which side fired it. But it means that only the diesel generators on site stand between the reactors and a meltdown. Now in over the previous occasions, as I say this is the seventh first generators have not had to run for very long before power has been restored. But the International Atomic Energy Agency is also saying that the numbers of people maintaining that nuclear power station the biggest in Europe, are dwindling and are now below the level that really will be required to keep it going safely over the longer term and demanding once again that the Russians withdraw their occupying forces from that location, Lynda.",

      "sentences": "Well undoubtedly getting agreement on the F-16 fighter aircraft was the single biggesttakeaway for President Zelenskyy at the G7. In fairness, there was a lot of diplomatic legwork done in advance. But by virtue of having all those leaders there together, it gave a focus point to bring an agreement to conclusion. And President Zelenskyy spoke in a press conference afterwards, not just about the importance of the F-16 aircraft to help give the Ukrainian Air Force better reach better able to tackle the threat for the Russian forces. But he said that he by virtue of being there in the room face to face with the leaders; he gets better results that way. So bringing everything together, bringing allies and partners together, showing unity to Russia that they unified behind Ukraine was important. But for Zelenskyy, I think just having this meeting, being there in person; with so many allies is a bolster. And certainly, that's what we hear on the ground here. Talk to commanders and troops at the frontline, that F-16 very important for them and knowing in this very, very hard fight against Russia, a much bigger enemy in this hard and tough fight. They know they've got allies and partners in the rest of the world that are supporting them. But I think the other takeaway from the G7 was that President Zelenskyy was able to meet with people like the Prime Minister of India, the leader of Indonesia as well. And tried to break the Russian narrative of victimhood, that Russia is the victim of Western and NATO aggression, to put it plainly to these leaders and say, look, Russia has invaded our territory. And this is going to be very important when President Zelenskyy is looking at these nations around the table of the United Nations, ultimately trying to get a peace deal agreed with the U.N. And for these other countries that put some kind of pressure and bring some reality to bear on Russia. So the takeaway for Zelenskyy a big trip, a big reach around the world, a big diplomatic reach and take away success is where those F-16s actually arrive and are in service, not clear. But for Zelenskyy a good trip to Japan. Nic Robertson, CNN, eastern Ukraine.",

Moscow and Beijing meantime lashed out at the leaders from the world's most powerful democracies meeting in Japan over the weekend. Beijing accusing the G7 leaders of hindering International Peace, or Russia slammed them for \"Indulging in their own greatness\". Well, CNN Politics Senior Reporter Stephen Collinson wrote about co-wrote about some of the major takeaways from the summit in our Meanwhile in America newsletter. He says in part, a new great game is underway that could write the world's rules for decades to come. And the struggles of many Western nations to contain populist anti-democratic movements at home will only complicate their efforts to hold on to power abroad. Big summits like the G7 might come across as dull but they could be just as crucial as the wartime get-togethers of U.S., British and Soviet leaders that wrote the international rules that would run the world for the next 80 years. Stephen Collinson joins us now from Washington. Stephen, so much to cover, but I do want to start on the two biggest talking points of this summit about being obviously Russia, Ukraine, and the threat from China. In terms of Ukraine, the President of Ukraine showed up at this summit to not only pleads for more support from the West, but also to convince those on the fence to get off the sidelines.",

      "sentences": "Definitely. And I think what it shows is the way that the U.S. effort towards Ukraine has evolved. And it's always been conditioned on theneed not to further inflame the situation between the United States and Russia. So we've gone incremental steps. Right at the beginning of the war, it was ammunition and various weapons systems, and it was patriot missiles, then it was tanks, eventually, its F- 16s. I think there's a question about how quickly those F-16s will arrive on the battlefield. But they're also an important part of the post war situation in Ukraine whenever that comes. It's clear now that although it is not a NATO member, as it uses some of NATO's most sophisticated military kit, Ukraine is really in the western orbit in the NATO orbit in Europe, even if it's not a full member. And that's also important, because obviously, one of the goals of President Putin's invasion was to stop Ukraine moving towards the west, both towards the EU, and towards NATO. So while it's unlikely, anytime soon that Ukraine will be in the Western alliance, it's almost a client state of NATO. And it will be for as long as the United States especially and Western Europe wants it to be and continues to support it. That, of course, has been put into a bit of a question by remarks about by former President Trump recently raising doubts about how strong he would support Ukraine if he's reelected to a non- consecutive second term in 2024.",

With the Philippines, for example, with Australia, Papua New Guinea clearly is an important strategic spot that were very useful to U.S. forces in countering Chinese activity in the area. The fact that the president was unable to go there was clearly an embarrassment. And I think it symbolically was important in Asia. But the fact this defense pact is still going on is also important. I wouldn't be surprised to see in a future trip to Australia that President Biden includes a stop in Papua New Guinea, given the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping has already been there. And China has spent a lot of money and infrastructure projects, for example there to try and pull P&amp;G -- closer into its orbit. But again, what we saw at the G7 with the condemnation of some of China's activity in the eastern South China Seas, a warning about economic coercion. Coercion from the G7 leaders also aimed towards China shows that the block is really advancing, as on Ukraine, another one of the Biden Administration's foreign policies.

So Lynda it's going to be that, it's probably going to focus the minds of those in the United States and in the European Union currently trying to hammer out a fresh framework that would allow for data flows between the United States and Europe. This comes back to an issue where on one hand; you have the legislation surrounding in the United States data. And what access agencies like the NSA, the spy agencies have to it. And on the other the increasingly strict European laws to try and protect the privacy of European citizens. And those two frameworks keep clashing. So for years, fresh frameworks have been found to try and allow those data flows to go more freely. Another one is currently under review. Now, it could be that some solution is found as early as July; it could be that it takes as long as October. And that will have a substantial impact, of course, on the fallout from this ruling for Meta, and its ability to carry on transferring data from Europe and its European users to American servers. So first of all, there is of course their appeal that they will be hoping to win. But then there's also what the evolution of those talks between the Biden Administration and the von der Leyen Administration will deliver in terms of the ability to get around those two issues to square that particularly difficult circle, Lynda.",

So the ceasefire, if anything, maybe we'll just help them regroup, recovers, you know, gets their men in place. But it means nothing, because it's just a short term. It's a plaster on an open wound, it's not going to end this war is not going to make the lives of 44 million Sudanese any better. It hasn't. So far, the aid hasn't reached those who need it most, there are still millions of Sudanese trapped inside Sudan. Supplies are running short, medical hospitals are literally, I think, the whole country, there's something like 29 hospitals still working in a country of 45 million. So you know, fighting has escalated in therefore, you know, looting and rape of females has increased, the reports are coming out, they're harrowing to read. So, I mean, these are the basics of any conflict, and neither side have abided by them. So I don't see how anyone can expect them to abide by these, you know, basic, you know, dealings at this moment in time, a month on since the conflict first started.",

And it's all come to a head right now. So the only way this ceasefire can work is for them, you know, to be basically like school children you know, you hold the ruler over their hand and tell them you need to do this.

My understanding is they're pretty much stuck in Port Sudan waiting for the ceasefire to take effect so they can start moving if possible. The U.N. also really re-edited its report saying they now think half the population of Sudan will be in need of humanitarian assistance in some shape, or form. Now, that's a staggering number, you're talking about nearly 25 million people needing help, be it food, medical supplies, access to safety. It's just we already had IDPs, because of the war in Darfur 20 years ago, and now it's the opposite has happened. Its taking place, you know, those from the center are moving out, and other cities as well are being hit. So and the rainy season is coming up. And there's nothing in place. You know, I don't know how I mean, my, what I envision what's going to happen in the next few months, it's not actually comforting, if anything, I think it's going to get worse before it gets any better. So I do hope this ceasefire holds, but hope for the worst, you know, plan for the worst hope for the best so to speak, but it's not looking good.

On Sunday, they dumped black coloring intothe water of the Trevi Fountain trying to draw attention to the hazards of fossil fuels, but officials are calling the protesters eco vandals. Our Michael Holmes reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Black clouds spreads through the waters of one of Rome's most iconic landmarks as climate activist's dumped charcoal into the Trevi Fountain. All seven were arrested and charged with vandalism. City officials are referring to the protesters as eco vandals, calling their acts of protest of worrying escalation. And Rome's Mayor is calling it an absurd attack on the city's artistic heritage. The activists condemned the use of fossil fuels, pointing to the recent situation in northern Italy, where deadly floods have displaced tens of thousands which researchers say is a sign of the accelerating climate crisis. This latest protest comes after the same activist group dumped charcoal in the fountain of four rivers in Piazza Navona in May and in the Barcaccia Fountain near the Spanish Steps in April. And while the Trevi Fountain has now been cleaned, the climate crisis and the mounting anger of activists are far from over. Michael Holmes, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Peggy Whitson, the American commander, she was the first one to make it onto the ISS, and she said that she is excited to be here. She was followed by the mission pilot John Shoffner, who said that this is a dream of his, a dream that he has had since he was eight years old. The two Saudis have also made it onto the ISS. Ali al-Qarni, he is one of the two Mission Specialists, he spoken Arabic and in English saying that he was making space friends. And then Rayyanah Barnawi, the other mission specialist, she also had a few words for the seven astronauts that she is now joining for the next couple of days as well as some words for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Lynda, as you noted, the four member crew and the other seven astronauts they're going to be taking part in several experiments over the next eight days at the International Space Station, the four member crew is going to be looking at a number of things when it comes to cancer research. They're also going to be taking a look at the effects of microgravity on the production of stem cells. And they're also going to be taking a look at a new communication system.
