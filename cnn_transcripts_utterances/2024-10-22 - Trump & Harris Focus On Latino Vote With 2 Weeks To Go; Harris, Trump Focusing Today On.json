The campaigns are putting the finishing touches on their closing messages to the shrinking sliver of undecided voters. And we're learning that Bruce Springsteen will campaign with Kamala Harris this week and hit the streets of Philadelphia with Barack Obama next week.Plus, Texas holdup. The Harris campaign is going all in on their bet that abortion rights will bring people to the polls. We have brand new reporting on their plans, including a trip to a reliably red state. And the richest man in the world is using his time, influence, and of course, money, to push Donald Trump's campaign. So, what does Elon Musk want in return? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, two weeks to go, less than 330 hours left in this wild presidential race. And today, both campaigns are focusing on the Latino vote. A force in battleground states like Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris will sit down for an interview with Telemundo in a few hours where she is expected to announce new economic opportunities for Latino men. Donald Trump is speaking of what was described as a round table event with Latino voters at his Doral Golf Resort in Florida. His focus has been on the familiar grievances and misleading attacks that you can see at any of his rallies. I want to start with CNN's Kristen Holmes, who is in Greensboro, North Carolina. Kristen, what have we heard from Trump so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, as you said, Dana, a lot of this is just his general campaign rhetoric. He did thank the Hispanic community, and we should know that this is a key voting demographic. As we head into November, both sides, both Harris and Trump, believe that Latino voters could be a determining factor in who goes to the White House in November. And when you talk to the Trump team, they feel very confident in what they say is a significant increase in the support from this community. Now, Donald Trump was sitting down with these Latino business leaders, faith leaders in Doral, but then he seemed to stray off topic. He spent a lot of time attacking Kamala Harris, saying she was sleeping because she's not on the campaign trail today.As you said, she is doing an interview with Telemundo and as well NBC later today, but she is not traveling on this day. But the other thing that he really went into is his border policies and attacking what is going on in the border. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I actually think that the biggest thing is the border because the border is destroying our country. But I really think that the biggest problem this country has is what they have allowed to happen to us on the border. They have allowed our country to be destroyed. They are allowing thousands of murders and drug dealers and terrorists and people from mental institutions. They are emptying out their jails into our country. They are emptying out their jails.

That when we talk to voters here on the campaign trail, we're traveling around. We talked to Hispanic voters in particular. They say that kind of rhetoric doesn't bother them.Now, remember, we are at Trump rally. So, it's people who are coming to see Trump. They say we know who he is and that he's not talking about them. He's not talking about them. And even if they are new U.S. citizens, they came and they immigrated here. She doesn't believe -- they don't believe that he is talking about them specifically, but about other people who are crossing the border. And some of the recent polling that we have seen shows that these Hispanic voters care more about things like the economy and inflation and immigration policies than they do about anything else, which might show you why Donald Trump is gaining support there, because those are the policies, or those are the issues in which he pulls ahead of Kamala Harris on. So, but interesting still to hear him using the same kind of language, even at an event like this.",

You have a lot Hispanics, even in the Rio Grande Valley, who are more pro-Trump than pro-Harris. Again, it is Texas. Florida, different dynamics. So, you see these different dynamics everywhere.

You want to make sure that they are actually turning up to vote.And I think, on the economic message that is being tailored by both campaigns to Latino men, for example, you're seeing a really interesting, looking backwards versus looking forward. Contrast between the Trump message and the Harris campaigns message. Trump is essentially out there saying, hey, for your community, you did pretty well economically when I was president for four years in terms of jobs and wages and opportunities. The Harris campaign is saying, when I am president, I will make sure that you have all of the economic opportunities that you don't. I mean, some of the things that you just put up on the screen, you know, opportunities for people that may not have college degrees, opportunities for training. I think there's an interesting sort of fundamental human psychology here are people more willing to buy into something that they thought they might have had before.

I was talking to one senior campaign source this morning, and they said, you know, we only have 13 more wake ups left.
