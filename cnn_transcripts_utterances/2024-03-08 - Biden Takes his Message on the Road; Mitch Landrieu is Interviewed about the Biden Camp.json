The fact that he was making these arguments that the economy is starting to improve for voters. Of course, it comes at a time when many Americans don't feel that the president's policies are personally paying off for them. So we're still waiting to get an exact reaction to this jobs report, but it is likely welcome news.But really what the president is now facing is a key test in carrying on that fighting and fiery spirit that was seen in his State of the Union Address last night. A little bit later this afternoon he will face his first test when he travels to battleground Pennsylvania for a campaign speech where he's expected to really talk about some of that similar themes that he discussed last night. One of the central focuses of the president's remarks really were trying to make this contrast with former President Donald Trump, even as he did not name his predecessor by name, he simply use that term, \"my predecessor,\" as he referred to Trump. And part of what the president was stressing is that democracy is under threat here at home and abroad. And that a large part of the reason why is the former president. Take a listen.

And he used this speech to try to address those concerns about his age head-on, saying that this is not a campaign about age, it's a campaign of whether there are old ideas in this country.Now the president will hit the road over the course of the coming week to put this message directly in front of American voters. Today that begins with that push in Pennsylvania. Tomorrow he will be on the battleground state of Georgia. Vice President Harris, for her part, is traveling out west to battlegrounds Arizona and Nevada. We expect that there will be more travel from Harris and the president in the coming weeks. And really the Biden campaign is trying to use this as a moment to build off of the momentum of last night and take their message directly to voters. One thing officials have pointed to was the fact that they saw their best online fundraising in those two hours around when the president was delivering that State of the Union. They say that's a sign of energy and enthusiasm for the president's message. We will see how that translates out on the road as he prepares this blitz a little bit later this afternoon.",

He actually kind of laid out for the country what the stakes of this election are about. And basically said, very simply, you know, you have a choice to make. We're in an existential crisis. You can re-elect me, because I'm a person that believes in everyday Americans, that works hard for them, or you can elect Donald Trump again, who basically thinks about himself, thinks about revenge, thinks about shilling for the top 1 percent in this country. You can be for me, who thinks about going forward and including people, or you can think -- be for Donald Trump, who's all about the past, making us smaller, making us darker and making us more narrow as a country.And then he laid out exactly what he inherited when he got there, what he has done, including the incredible jobs number today, and then what he is going to do in his second term. So, I thought he did great. And let me just say this so we can just clear this up right now. In the last week-and-a-half, everybody in this country, pundits and everybody else, is acting like Joe Biden's got a half a foot in the grave. And last night he showed up and demonstrated to the American people that not only is he fit but he's ready. So, I'm hoping that we could just put that to rest.

He said that he took office during a catastrophic economic downfall. And when people were dying from Covid, he got shots in arms. He passed the American Rescue Plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, the infrastructure bill, which, by the way, has 46,000 projects rebuilding the roads and the bridges and the airports and the ports, which are creating 15 million jobs, the lowest unemployment rate. We have an economy that is growing faster. But he recognized, and he said very clearly, that people are hurting, which is why he's fighting so hard to lower the cost for people. And this is what the big issue is. Donald Trump's fighting for the big guy. The president's fighting for the little guy. He took on big pharma so that they could actually reduce prescription drugs for people, lower the cost of insulin, lower junk fees, lower student loan pain for people, really work hard to get the cost of living down.

Regardless of what you think about Donald Trump, Republican voters are standing by him because of his policies and what his policies have done to help the economy, with inflation, with regard to immigration, national security, and safety. And Republicans are standing behind him.What we're going to see now with the RNC, in my view, as someone wanting the Republicans to do well, this is important for a lot of reasons. Now we have the RNC and the Trump campaign uniting forces. And what this means, the Trump campaign and the RNC have a joint fundraising agreements. So there's access to new lists and new donors who may have not given to Donald Trump in the past, now are able to do so. He has access to their election integrity units that are out there to make sure that our elections are run free and fair, which, in my view, they always have been. And also the communications team at the RNC, which is really powerful. And they take credit a lot for pushing out messages of Joe Biden, which led to his very low approval ratings.

It was perfect meat for the bones of what they wanted to do. But the problem is, he needs to expand on that base. He needs to reach out to independent voters. He needs to appeal to the Nikki Haley voters. But he came across as angry. He came across as divisive, loud. He came across as someone who is forcing his issues on the American people when they don't believe it. And these are all the things they talk about Donald Trump. And the -- I think one of the biggest problems he had is - is not being able to recognize that his numbers that he's talking specifically about the economy, that is top of mind for people, he says were the envy of the world. He says were coming around. He says that America is doing great on the economy. That's not how people feel. That -- his rhetoric does not match reality. And when he doesn't understand that people are still hurting, no matter what he says about the numbers, that's not a good way to convince people that your policies are going to help them further down the road.",

He was a little bit screechy. I agree with that. He had a microphone. He didn't have to yell as much as he did. But what was the yelling about? He said, not reaching out to Nikki Haley voters. He started out with Ukraine. He started out with NATO. He started out with her core issue. That's reaching out. He's tone deaf on the economy. Look, groceries are too high. He's got a commission going after the price gougers. Medicine costs too much. He talked about that. He talked about getting housing. And that's a big problem.
