President Biden also signing a potential TikTok ban into law. It requires the social media company based out of China to find a new owner in the next few months or users in the U.S. will no longer be able to download it. Next, we head to Kenya, where more than 30 people have died after heavy rainfall led to a series of flash floods that swept almost half of the country. In total, more than 100,000 people have been affected by the severe weather. CNN`s Larry Madowo shows us the devastating impact in Nairobi, Kenya`s capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

What`s getting cleared back there, that debris that`s left over, that`s what used to be their homes. In these informal settlements around Nairobi, the houses are made of wood, they`re made of iron sheets. They`re very easily swept away when there`s flooding like what was experienced. It`s a cycle. If it`s not the flooding, it`s a fire, and then flooding and a fire. And it goes on and on and on. You see a lot of people trying to collect whatever little is left of what their homes used to be, some iron sheets, maybe some valuables, trying to figure out how to rebuild their lives after a devastating situation where every single thing they owned was swept away by these flash floods. JECINTER, AGUNJA, FEMINIST ACTIVIST &amp; MATHARE RESIDENT:  Nothing has come from the government. We only help ourselves because nobody has come to the rescue. You feel like you don`t come from this country, you are maybe inferior, because if it was somewhere else, maybe middle class or the highest class, government could have responded asap.",

At least 28 whales died. Rescuers rushed to hold the animals upright to keep their blow holes clear before getting them back in the water. Experts say the animals can only stay on land for about six hours before their health diminishes. Ten-second trivia. Which of these foods items is NOT included as part of the National School Lunch Program? Chocolate milk, bean burrito, potato chips, or cheese pizza? If you said potato chips, you are correct. This is a tricky one. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, potato chips do not contribute to any of their approved meal patterns. Mmm, lunch time. What`s your favorite school lunch? I was definitely a pizza day guy, or grilled cheese day, or turkey day. There`s not much I didn`t like. Anyway, the U.S. government wants to make school meals healthier. The Department of Agriculture just announced new rules limiting the amount of sugar and sodium in breakfasts and lunch that are served to nearly 30 million students K-12. The changes will be implemented in phases over the next few years. By the 2027-2028 school year, added sugars can`t make up more than 10% of the total weekly calories for breakfasts and lunches. The same school year, sodium needs to be cut by 15% in lunches, 10% in breakfasts. It`s the first change to school meal standards in 14 years. Today`s story, getting a 10 out of 10, has a tentaclizing twist. Nine-year- old Cal Clifford wanted a pet. A pet octopus. And he thought he got one. But he ended up with a whole lot more.
