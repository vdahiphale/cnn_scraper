      "sentences": "Americans looking to step into the new year with a new home are in for a bit of sticker shock. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is now nearly 7 percent. At 6.85, it's the highest it's been since July. It's the second consecutive weekly increase.You compare this rate to just four years ago, it means less than encouraging news for potential home buyers. CNN's Matt Egan is here. Matt, all those Fed cuts, all those Fed rates that were cut, were supposed to, you know, bring some kind of relief. What happened?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica, the market lately has just been living and dying with these magnificent seven stocks. You see that again today with the Dow down 400 points, about 1 percent. The NASDAQ is down around 2 percent. And this is coming as big technology companies have sold off.Now when we talk about the magnificent seven, we're talking about Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. And as you can see, all seven of those stocks are down today, led by Tesla, which is down around 4.5 percent. Now, these stocks have really been dominating the market. They've accounted for the vast majority of the gains since Election Day. And more than half of the gains so far this year, the combined value of these companies has now surpassed $18 trillion. Trillion with a \"T.\" With some -- some context there, that is more than the entire GDP of the economy of China. It's pretty staggering. And when this group is doing well, they can carry the whole market higher. And we have seen that happen. But the problem is the market has become so concentrated. I think that chart shows that right there that the -- the top-10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 account for the very, very high -- a record percentage in terms of the total value of the market. And so, you know, in a perfect world, you'd have broader participation. You wouldn't want the market to rely on just a few stocks to go higher. It would be like a football team that can't score a touchdown without their running back doing well. What if the running back goes down? What if the running back's in a slump? You can see how that would become a problem. And so this all exposes a potential vulnerability when it comes to 2025. Because for the market to continue to power higher and continue to make new record highs, either the rally is going to have to broaden out or these seven stocks are going to have to stay magnificent -- Jessica?",

A series of Pacific storm systems will continue to affect the west this weekend, with periods of strong winds, low elevation rain and heavy mountain snow. Meantime, severe thunderstorms are expected to hit the south on Saturday, with possible tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail from Louisiana to Alabama. Rain from that storm then stretches up the east coast by Sunday and could cause some minor travel delays. The FDA is pushing a new proposal aimed at making sure all cosmetics are asbestos free. The new rule would require standardized testing on products like makeup, baby powder and other personal care items that contain talc. The FDA says the asbestos exposure can lead to illnesses such as lung and ovarian cancers. The issue coming to light after more than 60,000 claimants sued Johnson and Johnson, claiming their talc powders products caused cancer. The company has denied those allegations and is looking to resolve the claims through an approximately $10 billion settlement in bankruptcy.

But, you know, on Christmas Eve, no one won that $1 billion prize. And as you mentioned, Erica and Jessica, the chances of winning tonight, unfortunately, are slim. Just to put it into context, you have a higher chance of winning the U.S. presidency. You have a higher chance of getting struck by lightning, getting eaten by a shark, or becoming a movie star.
