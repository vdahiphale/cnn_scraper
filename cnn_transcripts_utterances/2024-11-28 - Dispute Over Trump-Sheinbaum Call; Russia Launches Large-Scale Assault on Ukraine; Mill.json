Trump said the promise had been made during their phone call. Sheinbaum now saying, quote, \"Everyone has their own way of communicating, but I can assure you, I give you the certainty that we would never, and we would be incapable of it, to propose that we would close the border.\" She went on to say, quote, \"It's never been our approach and of course, we don't agree with that.\"",

      "sentences": "That's right. There appears to be a widening chasm between how she described the call and how President Elect Donald Trump described their interactions. Because take a look at what Donald Trump said he got from that conversation, he said, quote, \"Mexico's President has agreed to stop migration through Mexico and into the United States, effectively closing our southern border.\" In his second post, he added, \"Mexico will stop people from going to our southern border effective immediately. This will go a long way towards stopping the illegal invasion of the USA. Thank you.I guess the word effectively closing the border, effectively might be doing a lot of heavy lifting in Trump's social media posts. It's not exactly clear what actual policy concessions Trump believes he got out of the Mexican President because she has essentially said they are keeping the status quo, which she believes has helped stem the flow of migration across the U.S. border. She cited a statistic that said the number of border crossings has dropped in the past year by 75% and did not offer, at least publicly yet, any suggestion that they are changing their tactics in order to appease the former President and now President Elect Donald Trump. So it'll be interesting to see what happens in the coming days. Because this was described by both sides as a positive call, it will be interesting to see if the relationship sours some because of their discrepancies and what actually transpired.",

But I asked the Trump transition team if that was the case and have so far not received a response. It's interesting because as well, Donald Trump threatened those tariffs on Canada, and he had what both sides described was a positive conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well.But what is absolutely clear is that Donald Trump, three weeks into being President Elect, is already inserting himself into U.S. foreign affairs, into trade, into negotiations with our allies in anticipation of taking over.

Steve, thanks so much.As Steve just outlined for us, the President Elect and those close to him have been touting this call as a victory. Look at this. Trump's Deputy Director of Communications, Margo Martin, posting on X, quote, \"One phone call. That's how it's done, folks.\" Let's discuss this with CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem. Juliette, it seems just from the readout that it's not as simple as this one call because there isn't an agreement to close the border. And it seems like Mexico's President is coming out and saying that they're simply enforcing rules that have been put in place because of communications with the Biden administration.

That began a few days ago when President Elect Trump, in the middle of the night or whenever, sends out this threat to Canada and Mexico of a 25% tariff.You wake up or that night, everyone realizes what that would mean. It's a ridiculous -- that just from policy, not politics. From a policy perspective, it's a ridiculous thing to announce 75% of Canadian and Mexican imports come from the United States, meaning we benefit from trade. And it means they could have retaliated back. So what you see is the other leaders sort of adapting to Trump's style. They have to give him an out. So what's that out? Friendly phone calls, good phone calls, of which Sheinbaum, the new President of Mexico, is smart enough to know that border crossings are down by 75% under the Biden administration. She'll let Trump take credit for that, and it gives Trump an out. So that's basically what happened. We're going to see a lot of this in the next four years as other leaders recognize that they just have to give Trump either a way that he can tweet out a win. But Mexico and Canada, but let's just be clear here, and the United States all won, those tariffs would have been a disaster for American workers. We shouldn't view this as Trump won, Trump lost, the American workers won because Trump is not going to do this tariff.",

They're calling me, they're saying, you win, I give up, uncle. And that's one thing to sell to the electorate. But in practice, this is brutally difficult. Again, we benefit so much from our exports to these countries. A country like Mexico would be hurt so much if they had to slap retaliatory tariffs on corn. Think about the position of hunger in Mexico. Think about textiles, think about the supply chain. Think about the things you buy at a Walmart, which by itself would be one of the largest trading partners on the planet if Mexico and Canada were to be compromised.

There's so many moving parts in this, you want to induce U.S. EV production, but you need the Chinese supply chain to do that. China cannot afford.

That's where we've had those soggy turkeys all morning and all those Thanksgiving morning parades.Temperatures might not break freezing in places like Denver, Minneapolis, 24 degrees for a high. Today, they are 40 degrees in St. Louis and you've got temperatures in the 40s in New York City with that rain and the snow in parts of interior New England. As far as travel goes, hasn't been too bad. You can see most of the country is dry. The problem spot is up in New England where we've had that snow just really pumping. You've got some several inches of snow possible in upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire here, all of that rain there from Boston down to New York City. Finally clearing New York City right now, but again, still heading up the I95 corridor up towards Boston. Winter storm warnings are in effect for Most of Maine, 6 to 10 inches of snow there. Upstate New York, 3 to 8 inches of snow. Again, so shoveling with your Thanksgiving turkey this year for parts of New England. Once the storm exits, cold air comes over the warm lakes and that's going to pump lake effect snow all weekend. We're talking about several feet of snow for places along the Great Lakes here off of Erie and Ontario, Watertown south of Buffalo, Erie east of Cleveland, all in lake effect snow right now because we're going to get the cold air coming over the warm lakes that picks up the moisture and dumps that snow. Again, look at some of these numbers. We're going to be measuring the snow in feet. So if you are traveling in the Great Lakes area on the back end of the holiday weekend, be mindful that there could be some travel delays for places like Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, because we'll have that snow pumping around the Great Lakes. Those will be some problems Friday and Saturday. You can see the rest of the U.S. though, is doing all right. Really just what we're watching is all of that snow pumping in the Great Lakes and there's the cold that's coming with it. All of us will feel the cold even down to the Gulf Coast. Guys.",

That's the weapon system that is now allowed to target Russian -- targets on Russian soil. And that particular weapon system is something that the Ukrainians have used before, and they're pretty capable of using it, but what they need is the munitions to use that. They need to put it in the right places, and they need to select the right targets. They're very capable of doing that, but they needed (ph) the equipment to make that happen. And a lot of that is in the pipeline, but it has to get there in order for it to be effective.

And if they can be stopped by the Ukrainians, that would be a place where there would be such a demilitarized zone.That is something that could happen. Another possibility, of course, would be that the Ukrainians agree to transfer the territory that they've captured in the Kursk region of Russia, if the Russians give back some of the territory that they have taken over in Ukraine. So there are a lot of different aspects that could happen. But if things are frozen in place, there's a very high likelihood that there would be some kind of a demilitarized with Russia gaining some territory that it has captured during this latest period since February of 2022.",

In other words, that they don't give away too much to the Russians and don't let themselves get rolled by them.That is something that the Biden administration has sought to avoid with some degree of success, but that is the kind of thing that, you know, could very well result in some kind of a ceasefire at some point.
