They spent more than half an hour viewing this property that you see here. It includes the dogs kennels and the shed where Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were killed. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is outside of court in Walterboro, South Carolina, for us. We're just getting that video in, Dianne, of the media's trip to the crime scene, separate from the jury.

When they're visiting the shed and the dog kennels, which you can see on your screen, they didn't have anybody pointing any out to them. But according to the pool, they were able to see from the road, one of the juries standing in the door way of the feed room area where Paul Murdaugh was killed, glancing up at the door frame, something that has been talked about over and over again during testimony. According to the pooler, the grass has grown up around the area. They described it as feeling almost haunted. There was still a deflated football. But there was no sign of the massacre that happened on June 7th, 2021. No blood is left in there. There is some changes, they said, that had been made with some new shelving and things like that, plywood in the area. But according to the pooler, both she and another member of the media took steps, from that concrete slab at the feed room where Paul Murdaugh was killed to where Maggie Murdaugh was found, there by the edge of the shed. And they said their bodies would have been about roughly 12 feet, 12 steps from each other. So extremely close when they died. These are things that we expect the prosecutor, Creighton Waters, to bring up when we return from lunch, and his closing arguments begin. He spoke for roughly an hour today, before we did break for lunch, trying to set the scene for the jurors as to why they say Alex Murdaugh, in their words, had so much stress and pressure mounting on him that he killed his own wife and son.

Sara, this is interesting. From the media pool, actually seeing a member of the jury looking up at a door of a shed where Paul Murdaugh's body was found. What did the jury see at this crime scene? What would they have been looking for? How could that affect their view of this trial?",

It really is in these types of cases, for a lot of reasons.Because, up until now, the jury has been hearing this two-dimensional account of intimate details of people, of the scene, how they were shot, et cetera. Today, by virtue of this visit, they get a better sense of the spatial relationships, the distance, the timing. The door of the feeding room is critical -- there was a lot of testimony about this -- and the position of the shooters and the two- shooter theory that the defense is going with, and how Maggie and Paul were killed. This is something that makes it more tangible for the jury that they take back to the deliberation room, that they can have a better frame of reference, if you will, for all of the evidence that they've had heard. That they can put that in the context of what they physically experienced because of this visit. So it's very important.",

You know, many factors can raise the risk of colorectal cancer-- diet, exercise, environmental factors, and so much more.But the American Cancer Society does project that, this year, we'll see more than 150,000 colorectal cancer cases diagnosed. More than 50,000, sadly, deaths are expected this year. Many of those may be among people younger than age 55. Because when you look at the proportion of colorectal cases, there has been at rise in those diagnosed among that age group. The proportion was 11 percent in 1995. It went up to 20 percent in 2019. And then when you look at the proportion of all new cases diagnosed at advanced stages, that the on the rise as well, 57 percent in 1995, 60 percent in 2019. So those two areas seeing a rise in colorectal cancer among younger ages and then at advanced stages, are two areas where researchers, Brianna, are continuing to investigate.",

Very common for mummies to be found in that country to be prepared that way. This guy said, oh, I had this for a while, and I keep her with me. Let's see. He says he sleeps with it, hangs around with him all the time. She's in my room. He told another news agency that his father originally had this mummy and he that he somehow just came into it here. Nonetheless, the authorities, I'm not sure they're buying any of this. So they scooped this mummy up and they took this guy into custody for further questions -- Brianna?",
