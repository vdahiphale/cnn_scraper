      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, hope for the hostages. Negotiators say they're nearing a deal to release some of the 237 people being held captive by Hamas terrorists. Plus, President Biden turns 81 today. He's keeping a pretty low key with the White House hoping to minimize concerns about his age, as he fights for reelection.And an equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. That's how former President Jimmy Carter is remembering his wife of 77 years. Rosalynn Carter died yesterday at the age of 96. Tributes are pouring in highlighting her incredible legacy as first lady, mental health activist and humanitarian. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start today in the Middle East where more than two dozen newborns are now safe from war. The first group of Palestinian babies evacuated by Israeli forces from Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza arrived in Egypt this morning, dozens of ambulances help transfer the babies to where they're now receiving medical care. It comes as Israelis are trying to show the world that they value life and also what the IDF says is proof that Hamas terrorists were running operations under the exact hospital where those babies were being targeted -- excuse me, were being treated. And new footage that the IDF says, show Israeli hostages taken by Hamas arriving at the hospital. CNN cannot confirm the individuals in this video or their affiliation but the timestamp on it is critical, October 7, the same day of the barbaric Hamas attacks inside Israel. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is covering all of these developments out of Sderot. First, Jeremy, what can you tell us about that that footage that is coming from the hospital?",

      "sentences": "Well, that footage that Israeli military release of that tunnel under Al-Shifa Hospital is certainly the most concrete evidence that the IDF has presented so far about its claims that there is a vast tunnel network below the Al- Shifa Hospital medical complex.So, you can see in it what appears to be a drone going down into the tunnel along a spiral staircase. And then inside that tunnel itself, you can see over several meters, some kind of asset, whether it is a robot with a camera or perhaps an animal with the camera going down this tunnel. You can see the kind of signature curved ceiling that is typical of Hamas tunnels in Gaza. And then it arrives at a door which the Israeli military says is a door that they have yet to open because they fear that it may be booby trap. Now, what we haven't seen yet is the evidence that there is some kind of a massive underground command and control center of Hamas, but Israeli officials maintain that it does exist, and that eventually they will be able to provide that kind of evidence down the line. Now meanwhile, we know the negotiations are still ongoing between Israel and Hamas mediated by Qatar, with the assistance of the United States on a deal to potentially free dozens of women and children being held hostage in the Gaza Strip. So far, a draft of a potential agreement suggests that there could be a four to five day pause in fighting in exchange for the release of at least 50 hostages. But I can tell you from speaking with officials today that these negotiations are very much still ongoing. There has been a lot of optimism, of course in the last 48 hours. But these negotiations remain extremely complex, extremely sensitive, and could of course still unravel.",

Let's bring in our panel of great reporters, Seung Min Kim of the Associated Press, CNN's Alayna Treene and The Washington Post's Leigh Ann Caldwell. How are you? Nice to see you all.Let's start with what we saw come out over the weekend. There was a new poll. And it just kind of reinforces a lot of what we have been talking about with regard to President Biden and the political sort of conundrum that he's in. Is that a TV word? It is now that he's in with regard to his own party and how he's approaching the Israel-Hamas war. He has been pretty steadfast, really steadfast in his support for Israel's right to defend itself, but to have some caution. Let's look at how Democratic voters see that, approve 51 percent, disapprove 41 percent. So, he still has the majority of support, but it's considering that his fellow Democrats, it's not as high as maybe he would like. Let's look at the young voters now. This is what is the most stark. The question about young voters on Biden's handling at the war between Israel and Hamas. Approve 20 percent, disapprove 70 percent. young voters as we've talked about a lot on the show. They're a very important part of his coalition for reelection.",

      "sentences": "Certainly, and that's why it's certainly the -- his handling of the war -- the Israel-Hamas war that's led to an overall decline and his disapproval rating among young voters. If you look at the general approval rating of President Biden, people 18 to 34, in September 46 percent approval rate among those voters provided, now 31 percent. That's a pretty significant drop in a demographic in just a couple of months. And certainly, it's attributed to his handling of the war.The thing about Joe Biden is his staunch supporter of Israel is not something that's going to change. It is really ingrained in his political personality, his broader experiences in foreign policy. He talks a lot about his time meeting Golda Meir, the first female Israeli prime minister. So, but you see -- so that's not going to change. But you see how the White House and the president himself is really trying to emphasize the other parts of their policy towards the war in terms of emphasizing the humanitarian issues at play and the careful diplomacy that they're doing. But this is a really tricky issue for the president right now.",

Because in this new poll, there was a matchup question between Joe Biden and Donald Trump because one of the questions has been, OK, so young voter who has voted for Joe Biden before is not really enthused about him now.The question is, is that voter going to stay home? Or is that voter going to go out and vote for the Republican, no matter who it is? So, let's this hypothetical matchup between Donald Trump and Joe Biden among young voters. Look at this, I mean, it's incredibly close, it is within the margin of error. Now, we don't know in this subset what exactly the margin of error is. We haven't gotten it from NBC yet, but it's close we know that.",

The fact that so many Democrats are divided is a really problematic thing from of course, were -- you know, about a year out from the election. Just a little under that, there's a lot that can change from now and then. But I do think that when -- even looking at Congress, the division in Congress of Democrats, it's something that's going to be difficult for him to deal with, even with his support -- you know, being his support, you know, for Israel being very consistent.",

And what -- going back to young voters, I had talked to voters in the past who had participated in the AP poll, just kind of their perceptions about President Biden.And what you hear oftentimes when you talk to young voters is not only just kind of dissatisfaction of what hasn't been done, like the student loans issue that Leigh Ann mentioned.
