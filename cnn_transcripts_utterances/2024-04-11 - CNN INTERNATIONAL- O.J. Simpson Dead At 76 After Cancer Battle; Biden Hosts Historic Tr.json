He was one of the most defining figures of 20th century American popular culture, someone who transcended sports, culture, race, of course, a huge part of O.J. Simpson's legacy, his fall from grace, a dramatic one after making a fortune on the football field and on movie screens. His life changed forever when he was charged with killing his ex-wife and her friend, leading to what was arguably the highest profile criminal trial in us history. CNN's Stephanie Elam has more on his life. And, Stephanie, also just right at the most fractious points in the relations among the racism this country, too.",

First of all, the speed the verdict was returned, surprised everybody after a long trial, a very intricate trial where it took them a week or two to present DNA evidence because that was so new to people at the time.

And I remember when he was first charged in Nevada because I'm actually licensed in Nevada, so I know the legal community at the time, and I was the correspondent that covered the trial. But I remember everyone's said, oh, now, now we're going to get justice because in Nevada, it is law and order here and you be careful because were going to get you. And that's exactly what happened. I mean, this was a serious case. It was kidnapping. It was armed robbery. He wanted to get his personal trophies and pictures back, and he and his cohorts, his golfing buddies decided they were going to go to the hotel room where the -- now owner of them where he was, two of his cronies actually had guns. I don't even know if O.J. knew that they were going to carry the guns. Well, one of the guns was pointed at the owner of that property, and so the charges theoretically correct to be charged and probably a correct conviction because it was kidnapping. There was under the law, armed robbery. But no one was hurt in all of that and I think people were surprised that the charges went to the degree they went and the conviction because it was a life felony. But he was there at the courtroom every day for the trial.

And previously, that definition did not include people that were selling guns at gun shows and people that were selling guns online. And now, this rule change does require and does put those two venues under the definition of engaged in the business of selling firearms in a way that forces those sellers to get a federal license in order to sell guns in those venues going forward. And what a license does is it requires the sellers to conduct a background check to potential buyers. The Biden ministration is making the case that this is going to impact somewhere between 20,000 people who are currently selling guns in those venues without a license. And they do think that this will have a significant impact. The Justice Department also touting this announcement, Attorney General Merrick Garland, making the case and emphasizing that look, now, no matter if you're selling a gun online or you're selling it at a gun show, you have to have a license and you have to do a background check. But, Jim, look, again, this has been an issue that has plagued the United States almost uniquely for decades. This is not a one fix problem. At least history has proven that out.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a hard-line conservative, has warned him not to move ahead with any additional Ukraine aid, or she might pull the trigger on forcing a floor vote on his removal. Now, Johnson is taking some steps behind the scenes to make sure thathe has people like Donald Trump in his corner. He's going to head down to Mar-a-Lago tomorrow to do a press conference with the former president. But I'm told that allies close to Johnson have been encouraging him to keep Trump in the loop on everything he's planning to do on Ukraine aid. And notably, one thing that Johnson has floated is structuring the aid as a loan, which is an idea that Donald Trump has supported. So the idea here is that Johnson's probably going to try to load up this package to make it more attractive to get Republican support and to try to keep his hard-line conservatives happy or at least not angry enough to try to oust him, but it's a really difficult balancing act because they need it to actually pass. So that means support of Democrats, not only here in the House but also in the Senate as well. And now you have Israel aid, which is becoming increasingly harder in the Democratic Party. So they also have not decided whether to tie those two issues together.

It's a tough thing to do, not to strike back out.But Ukraine doesn't have the resources. For the past six months, they haven't really been getting fulsome support from the West. And really those scores of air defense systems to defend the skies.

The city of Kharkiv is being pounded. The Russians of our founding, finding some successes on the tactical battlefield. They're using these glide bombs, massive glide bombs. The U.S. employees typically 250, 500-pound bombs. They're using 1,500 kilogram bombs, significantly heavier. They're basically blockbusters to destroy swathes of territory on the battlefield.

I think the Ukrainians on the ground here still have quite a bit of faith in U.S., but that doubt is it started creeping. And I also fear that the domestic politics in this country where the president is going to be under increasing pressure especially absolutely U.S. support. You could see a turn in the leadership, frankly with regards to the U.S. and the U.S. becoming a scapegoat. I think were still quite a ways from that, but I could see the warning signs.
