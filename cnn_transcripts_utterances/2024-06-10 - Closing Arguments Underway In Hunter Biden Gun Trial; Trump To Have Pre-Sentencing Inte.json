Right now, prosecutors in the Hunter Biden trial are giving their rebuttal after defense attorneys wrapped up their closing arguments moments ago. Biden's team is trying to prevent the president's son from becoming a convicted felon and keep him out of jail. The defense telling jurors that the prosecution's case is built on suspicion and conjecture, and they accuse prosecutors of taking Biden's words out of context.Now, Hunter Biden faces three felony counts of illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing or being addicted to drugs. He's pleaded not guilty to all those charges. Once the prosecution makes its final points, then the case will be in the jury's hands to decide. Let's get you outside the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, right now with CNN's Paula Reid. So Paula, take us through what's happening right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, prosecutors are back up for their rebuttal. This is the final word that the jury will hear from lawyers before they begin their deliberation. Now, earlier today, prosecutors got up and gave their closing arguments. And it's interesting, they started by pointing at some folks in the gallery.I was in court earlier today, and I can tell you, this is the most crowded courtroom I have been in throughout this trial. The first row was so packed with the first lady, one of Hunter's sisters, you had his wife, so many people wanting to show their support that the Secret Service barely fit on the bench. And the prosecutors started their argument by pointing to the gallery and saying, those people don't matter. It is clear that prosecutors might be concerned that the first lady being here most days and this enormous show of support for Hunter Biden could harm their case. Instead, they directly addressed one of the most challenging things that they need to prove here. And that is that Hunter Biden knowingly lied on that form when he purchased this gun. They argue that he knew that he was using and or addicted to drugs when he purchased this gun. They also said, look, if he hadn't just been to rehab, maybe we could buy the idea that he didn't realize he had a problem. But they believe not only did he know he had a problem, they believe they have presented enough evidence to the jury to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was using illegal drugs during the time he owned this gun. Then Abbe Lowell, Hunter's lead defense attorney, had a chance to get up and he used the comparison of a magician arguing to the jury that prosecutors were trying to perform some sort of trick, a sleight of hand, and pointed to the fact that they have presented no direct evidence of Hunter Biden using drugs while he owned this gun. He went after specifically two of Hunter's former ex-girlfriends who testified during this trial. First, a woman that he met at a gentleman's club who took a lot of the photos that we saw throughout this trial of Hunter using drugs. And he pointed out, look, there are no photos from October 2018 when he owned this gun. He also went after Hunter Biden's former sister-in-law and former girlfriend or sister- in-law and former girlfriend, Hallie Biden, saying, look, she couldn't even get details about when she found the gun and alleged drug paraphernalia in Hunter's car. She couldn't get certain details right. So they closed their argument, reminding the jury that their client should not be improperly convicted here. Now, Boris, the jury will probably get this case in the next hour or so, but that's towards the end of the court date. It's unlikely, though still possible, that we'll get a verdict today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. So this is very customary for these probation officers to conduct these interviews after someone has either pleaded guilty or is convicted in the case of the former president. And questions are really going to go into what's the former president's background, what's his work history, what's his family background, has he abused drugs or alcohol, a lot of questions like that. There might even be a question where he asks the former president what does he think his punishment should be, where, of course, the former president can say that he wants it to be lenient. Who knows?It doesn't - we don't know exactly what questions are going to be pertinent to this interview, but what we do know is that this is very customary again. And this is what is going to sort of make the report that's given to the judge in this case, Judge Juan Merchan. And it's just one aspect of what he will consider as part of the sentencing when that finally happens on July 11th. Remember, the former president is facing anywhere from community service up to possibly four years in prison. So this is one aspect of it. We know also that the Trump team is going to hand in their recommendations for sentencing later this week.

And during his meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated that the U.S. and other world leaders stand by the comprehensive ceasefire and hostage deal that President Biden laid out so publicly. Are you learning anything more about today's meeting here in the aftermath of this raid to get these hostages?",

Of course, Gantz just resigned from the War Cabinet in protest of Netanyahu's policies and his inability to obtain a ceasefire and hostage deal. Has Gantz's resignation really, you know, done much? What's the aftermath been like?",

And a lot of his voters went to his - to other opposition parties.And in average, he lost four seats by - in the polls by withdrawing from the government. And those four seats did not go to Netanyahu. They went to two other of Netanyahu's political rivals. So for Benny Gantz, it is pretty clear that, you know, if he wanted to leave the government, he should have done it, you know, long before.",

Over the weekend, of course, as we saw that hostage rescue that we just watched the video of, we now know, right, that the U.S. aided Israel in terms of mainly intel support, no boots on the ground. The U.S. has been very clear that even though there was a helicopter extraction near that pier that was built by the U.S. to deliver aid, that pier had nothing to do with the operation. What do you make of this sort of dance of tough rhetoric and negotiations, but obviously quite enduring military and intel coordination?",

And when you go and ask families of hostages, that some of them are dual Israeli-U.S. nationals, they will tell you that they feel that Biden cares much more about them and about their family members who are held hostage than some members of the Israeli government. And this is something you hear from many, many hostage families.And I think that when it comes to Biden, he wants to get the hostages out. And more than that - and you hear it from all of his team, that they want to get justice for October 7th and this means taking out Yahya Sinwar and other Hamas officials.",
