She's an actress, a film maker and an athlete who also happens to be the first partner of California, a title she coined after shunning the traditional \"first lady\" term. She is Jennifer Siebel Newsom and her husband is a key Democrat force right now, Governor Gavin Newsom. Before heading to the governor's mansion in Sacramento, Newsom lived through some very deep personal trauma. She witnessed the tragic death of her oldest sister, just eight, who was run over by a golf cart. And then her encounter with predator Harvey Weinstein, who she accuses of raping her in 2005 and she testified against him in 2022. Newsom spent week this Davos speaking to other women and allies on the urgent work of gender equality. She joined me from there to explain this is a crisis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So you know, if we think about what's happening in our world with geopolitical instability, a political divide, mental health, climate crisis, extreme wealth inequality, part of that I strongly believe, and I have, you know, data to back it up, is we haven't had diverse enough folks, in particular women seated at the tables of power making decisions when it comes to both the private and public sectors. And so if we can move more women into leadership, more of a care orientation into leadership, we will fix some of these seemingly insurmountable global problems that we're all confronted with today.",

We have some of the strongest equal pay laws in the nation in California and we're trying to turn that gap into the smallest pay gap in the nation.Similarly, we have been championing women in public company boards. There was legislation SB 26. What we have seen as a result of this legislation and our advocacy is that in 2018, 15.5 percent of board seats were held by women. Today, over a third of public company board seats are held by women. And interestingly in 2018, 29 percent of boards had all-male boards in California. And today only 1 percent of public company boards are all- male boards. AMANPOUR: Can I ask you a little bit about how you have become so resilient? You have had quite a lot of trauma in your life. Your own sister died in a sort of very tragic play time incident, you know, with a golf cart. You yourself testified and took the stand against Harvey Weinstein in his sexual assault case.

And that we can cannot have this culture anymore and that there is a culture of silence and complicity that enables those men to perpetuate the harm the that they have done. And I'm a firm believer that most men are good men. I have two sons myself. I'm married to a man. I have a very close relationship with my father. But sadly, it's a few men that do so much damage. I believe there's a statistic that 94 percent of sexual assaults are committed by 4 percent of perpetrators. And to me, if we can just hold those few bad actors accountable, and educate more men and women for that matter to speak up and out and not be complicit and not enable, that we could create a healthier culture for women and girls. There's a study that came out recently that suggests that the cost to society of domestic and sexual violence is in the billions. The tangible costs are in the billions. But the intangible costs to a woman's work performance and her life are in the trillions.

That they have been convinced that Donald Trump is the right president of this time and that his questioning of the legitimacy of joe Biden is something that he's taken to Iowa.So I think all the reporting that we do should come actually from that prism (ph). That he is an election denier. That he has managed to convince people of the lies that he's been telling for the last three and a half years. That he's using his 91 indictments as a fundraising tool.

They have been surprised before.Politics is inherently predictable. U.S. politics these days is particularly unpredictable. So I think that sophisticated analysis of this in the world at large acknowledges that nothing is inevitable here. A president who, as Emily says, is facing 91 criminal counts, the idea or -- rather a candidate who is facing 91 criminal counts -- that he could emerge as president, there's something slightly incredulous about that. So I think that it is more of an emotional feeling. That if the country was capable of doing this once before, and they see these kinds of numbers, this kind of incredible, resilient, unshakable loyalty on the part of MAGA nation, I think it just -- it more resides in the pit of their stomach.

She has he's basically broken ranks in a very surprising way. Coming out and directly saying that Trump would pose a direct threat to the European continent and to the alliance if he was elected again. And she specifically said just look at the trade tariffs. Just look at the commitment to NATO service. Just look at the fight against climate change. If only in these three areas in the past, American interests have not been aligned with European interests.

It's easy to imagine that in the coming months he might begin to think of that. That might enter his calculations even in so far as he's waging the war in Gaza.

But actually what I overwhelmingly saw was children. And on one day, I was thinking this is New Year's Day. And there was one moment where I just looked at my watch, and it was about 2:00 in the afternoon, and we had mass casualties coming in. And in fact, it was from a school shelter where there had been bombardments and blasts, and we had mass casualties coming in. Then I looked around the resus room, which is where all the sickest patients are taken. And out of the five patients in the resus room, four of them were children. One with an injury, with a horrendous injury, a shrapnel injury to the brain, weren't going to survive. And then, the other children with horrendous mix of, you know, open fractures, partial amputations, open chest wounds, horrendous lacerations from shrapnel to the sort of chest and head and burns. And that was every day. You know, looking around the emergency department, my overwhelming impression was, why are there so many children here? You know, there were so many children.",
