At least five people have been shot and killed by police according to human rights groups. Dozens of others have been injured. CNN teams reporting paramedics were beaten and arrested by police as well. As lawmakers approved the tax bill, angry mobs stormed government officers setting fire to Nairobi City Hall, the governor's office as well as parliament. Kenya's President later describes the protests as treasonous, and accused organized criminals of hijacking the protests. CNN's Victoria Rubadiri has a closer look at Tuesday's protests and a warning her report contains some graphic images that may be difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VICTORIA RUBADIRI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): loud bangs ring out through the streets of Nairobi. Police firing tear gas and water cannons at dozens of protesters who gathered to condemn a controversial finance bill that would raise taxes. Demonstrators marched through the streets denouncing lawmakers for approving amendments to the draft law earlier in the day. Police responded forcefully with one officer firing a gas canister directly at the feet of a protester. Some even fired live rounds at the crowd. Throughout the day, several bodies were seen lying motionless on the ground. The clashes would escalate leading to a shocking scene at the parliament building. Dozens of demonstrators bypassed police and stormed the legislative building, with some entering the assembly chamber. Lawmakers in the building were evacuated, some of them escaping through an underground channel. According to CNN affiliate NTV Kenya, parts of the parliamentary grounds were vandalized, even set on fire during the chaos. Elsewhere more scenes of destruction at city hall, the office of the governor of Nairobi was also burning and near Kenya's Supreme Court, a store was looted and parked vehicles were set ablaze. Authorities ordered the public to return to their homes by sunset. Many who remained outdoors were detained, even those who were there to help.",

The U.S. military says are sitting in an open air warehouse across from the pier. World Food Programme paused its operations at the pier more than two weeks ago, citing safety concerns. Across Gaza humanitarian aid groups say Israeli military operations and a rise in lawlessness and looting are bringing their aid operations to a crawl. And it couldn't come at a worst time. As experts say people in Gaza are once again at high risk of famine. The U.S. military invited CNN to the pier for the first time to show how it is ramping up the flow of aid to Gaza. And how it is getting this beleaguered project back on track after rough weather damaged and took the pier out of service for weeks. CAPTAIN JOEL STEWART, U.S. NAVY: The sea is a difficult task mistress. Unpredictable, each wave is different than the last. So dealing with that is a challenge. But we've adapted to that. And I think we're in a better position now than we were initially. DIAMOND (voice-over): About 40 truckloads are now arriving at the pier each day. Still well short of the military's initial estimates of 90 to 150. A complex effort aid officials say would have been best spent pressuring Israel to get more aid in buy land.

But he doesn't -- is not able given the situation in the war, to actually build a majority for granting such a blanket exemption.So unless there's an alternative legislation, the Supreme Court said that the Israeli law, the recruitment bill, the current recruitment bill, needs to be applied equally. And for those who decide to dodge service or trying to not do their share, the state can no longer subsidize them. One has to understand that this community heavily relies on state subsidies.

Sunday, two weeks ago, they're quite catastrophic score in the European elections precipitated that decision, that's the election where Macron is paid incredibly badly.

Like I think after 15 months in pretrial detention, even though it might seem counterintuitive down in a country where less than 1 percent of criminal trials end in acquittal, I think there is probably an element of relief for making it this far.As you say we've seen Evan Gershkovich in-person this morning in that courtroom in Ekaterinburg in that characteristic glass box that you see defendants in Russia. The reason why I say an element of relief as well is because Russia likes to go through this process in cases like this to lend an air of legitimacy. And I have made it extremely clear certainly in past cases that no diplomatic discussions could start on any potential prisoner swap or could at least progress on any potential prisoner swap until after the trial is over. So this is now beginning. The charges were approved last week by a judge. The prosecutors in Russia say that the FSB has proof that Gershkovich was operating, they say under instructions from the CIA. This is something the U.S. government and the State Department has strenuously denied. And that he was not trying to obtain secrets related to a Russian tank factory in that region. Again, the \"Wall Street Journal\" has strenuously denied that he was doing this. Take a look at this statement in an op-ed from the \"Wall Street Journal\" editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker. She says about the trial, \"It will be held in secret. No evidence has been unveiled, and we already know the conclusion. This bogus accusation of espionage will inevitably lead to a bogus conviction for an innocent man who would then face up to 20 years in prison for simply doing his job.\" So I think look, again in a country where most criminal trials don't end in acquittal, the focus will be significantly on the sentencing. And of course, the more serious crime that Russia can convict Gershkovich of the higher the value here is for them in a potential future prisoner swap. So I think that is the calculation here. The U.S. government say that embassy staff have traveled to that region to attempt to be part of this. But as we are hearing, it is a closed-door hearing and it's not clear if any part of it will be open to them.",
