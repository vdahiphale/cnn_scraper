Now, here's the thing that I will note, however, I have one of the best views, but I am also very much afraid of heights. You mentioned 100 stories. I'm going to take a little bit of a walk over here, take a little bit and say, okay, we are very up and I have some statistics to sort of illustrate how high up we are. Although I am a tall man, at six-foot- two, you can line up nearly 200 of me and you can fact then finally hit the ground. We're talking over 2,000 hot dogs to finally hit the ground. And of course, the Statue of Liberty, which is over my left shoulder. You can have nearly four of those and you still will only then reach where I am right now.
