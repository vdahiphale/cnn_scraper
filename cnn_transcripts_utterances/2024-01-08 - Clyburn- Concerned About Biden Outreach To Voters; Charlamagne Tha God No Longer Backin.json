You're looking at James Clyburn, the leader -- former leader in the United States House of Representatives. He is introducing the president, so we're going to watch and listen for that, which should happen momentarily.Of course, we should remind our viewers that this is where nine congregants were killed in 2015 in a massacre by a white supremacist. And let's talk as we wait for President Biden to start speaking and discuss the fact that he, the president, last week, gave a big speech on democracy. Today, he is going down to commemorate what happened again almost a decade ago and to talk about extremism, to talk about hate and to obviously court black voters. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes. First of all, I can't believe that was a decade ago.",

Democrats rules in this going first, but President Biden knows that -- well, first of all, I'd say this is very important to him personally, of course, but also President Biden knows that black voters are also critical to his reelection.There has been polling that has showed that black voters are not as engaged or excited about President Biden, and it also plays into an issue that President Biden has focused on as well with little results. It's also gun violence. Something that Congress has been unable to solve. So this is an issue, of course, that is important to President Biden, but it's also important politically, too.",

Clyburn, for those who don't remember, kind of single handedly resurrected Joe Biden's political career before the South Carolina primary four years ago, endorsed him and helped get him elected and then Biden never looked back.Clyburn talked to Jake about his concerns with the Biden reelection campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D), SOUTH CAROLINA: I have no problem with the Biden administration and what it has done. My problem is that we have not been able to break through that MAGA wall in order to get to people exactly what this president has done. So this president is keeping his promises, but keep -- people keep focusing on the one or two things he did not get accomplished.",

And I do say back with numbers because the percentages show that he slid with black voters since the last election.And on the point, though, about course correction, I talked to some Biden folks earlier this morning, and they are over the moon that after that first democracy speech, they raised $1 million. I said, that is a very good sign that this new framework that the Biden campaign is going to be using is going to be very effective, especially when look at what happened today. We're cutting between Donald Trump talking about civil war, using the words hostages to describe the January 6th rioters and that is going to be the juxtaposition now that's just naturally going to unfold during the campaign is that it really is about a choice between democracy and potentially autocracy and a more authoritarian type tilt in this country.",
