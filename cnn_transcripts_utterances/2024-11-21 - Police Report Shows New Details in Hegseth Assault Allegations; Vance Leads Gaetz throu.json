Ukraine says Russia launched a long- range missile capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. All right, 6 a.m. here on the East Coast. A live look at the U.S. Capitol on this Thursday morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. New this morning, we are learning more details about the sexual assault allegation that was made against Pete Hegseth, the man that Donald Trump wants to be the next secretary of defense. CNN obtained the police report from 2017. It was made to Monterey Police in California. Hegseth wasn't criminally charged but did later enter into a settlement agreement with his accuser. The accuser is identified as Jane Doe in the report, and she told police that she got into an argument with Hegseth following an after party at a Republican conference at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. She told officers that Hegseth took her phone from her hands. Then she said she tried to leave the room, but Hegseth blocked the door with his body. She said that she remembered saying \"no\" a lot but did not remember much else, according to the report. Republican senators don't have to wait long to question Hegseth about this. He is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill today alongside V.P. elect J.D. Vance. Vance has been stepping into the role of sherpa -- it's an unofficial term -- for some of Trump's key cabinet choices, bringing them to talk with Republican Senate colleagues this week. He also is bringing a message to senators thinking about rejecting Trump's nominees, posting on social media that the president-elect, quote, \"deserves a cabinet loyal to the agenda that he was elected to implement.\" On Wednesday, it was Matt Gaetz, Trump's choice for attorney general, who made his pitch to senators. Gaetz is facing his own sexual misconduct allegations. A House ethics report is going to stay behind closed doors for now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, I've kind of thought of them as the pretenders, which is that these are not people who actually -- not only would they -- if they got vetted, they wouldn't pass. But they also just don't have the experience necessary to run these massive agencies. And so, when you hear Gaetz saying in private, don't worry. On week one, I'm not going to go. Yes, it is an ominous disclaimer, obviously, because what is week two, three, four? And if he lasts to month six, what is that all going to look like? And what we're seeing here is a Trump administration that is very, like, not interested at all in competence, not interested at all in how efficient anyone's going to be. And very interested in the communication strategy. And very interested in getting people out in front. And in that sense, I do think Gaetz fits the bill, because I think, actually, I do think he's going to be -- go through. And I think it's -- he's going to go through, because it's going to force all the Republicans to bend the knee early, which is what he wants.

Gabbard, a former Democrat, left the party in 2022, and she's since become a staunch supporter of Trump, serving on his transition team. If confirmed by the Senate, Gabbard would become the head of the nation's intelligence agencies. Her confirmation, though, might be an uphill battle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): If we bring in somebody like this, who smells to other intelligence agencies like someone who will compromise their sources and methods, and be far too cozy with Russia and other adversaries, then they're going to hold back information that could be really critical to our success. This is a choice that actually puts Americans at risk, because we won't have access to intelligence that could be critical to our safety. I think Republicans will likely begin to come around.

So, I think a lot of these nominations, whether it be Gaetz at DOJ or Tulsi Gabbard, it's a way that the Trump administration is saying this time it's going to be different.
