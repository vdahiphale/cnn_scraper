In a historic speech on Capitol Hill, President Zelenskyy thanks the U.S. word support and makes a passionate plea for even more aid. We'll bring you the top headlines from his visit. Plus, Benjamin Netanyahu beats the deadline to form a new government. And it's expected to be the most right-wing in Israel's history. And the lines of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border are getting longer and it is unknown when or if U.S. immigration policy will change. Ten months after Russia invaded his country, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared that Ukraine is \"alive and kicking\" as he addressed the U.S. Congress in a historic visit to Washington. A rousing reception on Capitol Hill as Ukrainian leader was greeted by cheers from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Mr. Zelensky thanked the U.S. for its continued support, and made it clear that Ukraine will never surrender. Russia's ambassador to the U.S. responding to the visit, saying it shows neither Mr. Zelensky nor the U.S. are ready for peace. Out here as part of the Ukrainian president's address to congress.

So, there were no clear moves towards some type of peace pathway. That is simply not on the table. So long as Vladimir Putin and the Russian military continue the pathway they've pursued.

And that underscores and other critical component. Zelenskyy making clear they would be asking for more assistance.

And he backed it up with concrete evidence.He said he was blunt. He said, Russia -- he said Ukraine is out gun Russia has the upper hand when it comes to artillery and ammunition, providing evidence for his ongoing requests for more weapons. And he said Russia repeatedly used the word terrorist. He said it's a terrorist state, not only in its actions in Ukraine, but also at home in Russia. So really, along the lines that we've seen from Zelenskyy throughout this conflict, presenting it, there's an existential struggle, not just for the future of Ukraine, but the future of democracy. President Biden also steadfast saying that they will stick with Ukraine for as long as it takes. But politically, I think he also has to bring forward some evidence that this is working, that it's not just as the House -- the House Republican leader has that a blank check.
