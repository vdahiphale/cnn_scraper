We'll be listening, of course, to every word that's coming up later tonight. And when Trump accepts his third presidential nomination and delivers his remarks in primetime, we'll get a better sense of what's -- what's -- what's -- what's about to happen. His son, Eric Trump, also is speaking tonight and will help tee up his father's speech.

But also to see the reaction, how the former president is doing certainly in the wake of the traumatic events of the attempted assassination, but also how he responds to people like Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, former opponents, or his new vice presidential selections. And tonight will be dramatically different. And one really particular sense and that is, as you noted, Melania Trump, Donald Trump's wife will be in attendance, will be sitting up there.

Our system was not set up for a unit -- for unity, divided government, separation of powers, checks and balances. The Founding Fathers believed to paraphrase St. Augustine, in essentials is unity, in all else, liberty. That's why we have federalism in this country.And what we need to paraphrase by my colleague at the American Enterprise Institute, Yuval Levin, is we need to be better at how we disagree with each other, not try to impose this false notion that we're going to all unify and rally around some one politician, particularly Donald Trump. The idea that Donald Trump can be a unifying figure in American politics is preposterous, and that's not really a criticism on me. He's simply an avatar of the culture war now. Presidents are avatars in the culture war and the idea that you're going to get a tribalized country that is so deeply polarized and full negative and partisanship to see him as some sort of unifying figure is just literally important.",

There's this bit of him that I do see sort of a soberness coming off of the assassination attempt, but let's also think, he announced his reelection, no major figures showed up. I think Matt Gaetz was one of the only sitting congressmen. It basically was seen as he was so weakened just 2-1/2 years ago, we thought it was me the summer of a January 6 trial, of a documents case, a Fulton county, none of that appears to be happening now, he's got the Supreme Court immunity ruling.

Obviously, he will be the finale tonight, closing out this convention. With his speech, that's slated to go a little over an hour. But you'll see his son, Eric Trump, Dana White, Tucker Carlson, all of them coming out to speak beforehand, and that is all by design. He has had a role and a direct role in that selecting every single person who was coming out. It really just speaks to obviously, Donald Trump is a showman.
