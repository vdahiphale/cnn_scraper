Here's how he's firing back tonight, on that line of attack. Both campaigns are nearly colliding in Michigan, this evening. And a top Michigan lawmaker is going to be our inside source on the latest, inside the race, in that state. And also, check your sources. Fox News is fact-checking Trump, for something that Donald Trump said about Fox News, on Fox News. I'm Kaitlan Collins, live from Tel Aviv, Israel. And this is THE SOURCE. Good evening. We are coming to you live from Tel Aviv, tonight, where we are learning new details about the death of Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas mastermind behind the October 7th attack, and what happens to his body now. CNN has spoken with the pathologist, who performed the autopsy on him, initially identifying him after conducting a DNA test on his finger that was cut off by Israeli soldiers. We're also learning more about how Yahya Sinwar's remains could be used as a potential bargaining chip, to help bring home the remaining hostages. We're going to have all that reporting for you, in a moment, straight from the ground, here in Tel Aviv. But first tonight, there are new developments, on the campaign trail, with just 18 days left to go in this 2024 race. Both Harris and Trump are barnstorming the critical battleground of Michigan, tonight, where the Harris campaign has opened a new line of attack on Donald Trump. That he's just too tired, too exhausted, and too all over the place, to be president. Here's Vice President Harris, moments ago.

If you're leaking against your candidate, you shouldn't be around much longer.But look, I think a lot of what Harris and Obama's saying, I agree with. The 30 minutes of swaying was weird. But Donald Trump has been doing and saying very weird things for a long time. Remember, he was supposed to be toast after the Access Hollywood tape, and he wasn't. And so, I think this is a mistake to lean in this hard for Harris, for two reasons. One, it raises a question about the person, who is still the President of the United States, if anything globally happens where we need American leadership now. It's not Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, who is going to have to respond. It's Joe Biden, who lot of very fair questions of whether he's up to the task. And two, it doesn't answer what voters are still saying that they want from Kamala Harris. Who are you? And what are you going to do? And she struggles to answer that question, even when she's asked very basic questions of, What is your economic policy and how are you going to implement it?

So, I would not expect the last week to be anything different. Here's what I will say about the approach that the Harris campaign is taking. And I think it's a pretty different approach than most traditional campaigns. They are doing a diversified strategy. So, I think when she talks about his exhaustion, and she talks about him not being the same person he was eight years ago? She's speaking to those voters, who did not want a rematch of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And so, she's saying, If you were tapped out, if you said, I didn't want anything to do with this race, and now you're starting to pay attention to it, because Election Day is just a couple weeks away? And she's saying, Look, you didn't want the old guy on my side, but you sure don't want the old guy on the Republican side. So here I am. Is it going to sway a large majority of voters? No. But because this race is so close, and we're talking about the margins, it is effective. I also agree with Doug that it can't be the only thing that they're saying. And it's not.

Again, I agree with Doug that I do think some of this is baked in. But I think we have to continue to call it out, even if he is to win in November. We still need to call it out if he becomes the next president. And even if he doesn't win, and he says these things, we should call it out. We cannot normalize this type of language. But I will also say this brings -- I've been saying this a long time, is that this is a -- there is a double standard, quite honestly, with Donald Trump, and anyone. But I think it is magnified right now with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. She can do interviews, in enemy territory, so to speak. He can go on Fox News and say crazy things. And it doesn't matter.

We heard from Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian figure, earlier today, who was talking about the fact that this image, of Sinwar throwing the stick at the drone, is kind of like the image of someone making his last stand, a resistance fighter, a hero, who is fighting until the last moment. And it also contradicts the kind of narrative that Israel has put out, and that U.S. officials have also agreed with, that Sinwar was hiding in a tunnel, over the course of the last year, while Palestinians were suffering above ground, which may, in fact, still be true. But in this case, they are now presenting this image of a man, who was effectively fighting back, in his last moments, not hiding underground, but rather fighting back as a resistance fighter. And that -- and this is kind of a Rorschach test for the region, certainly, about how he's going to be viewed, what his enduring legacy will be. And certainly, this presents an opportunity for this kind of myth of Sinwar to persist because of the existence of this video.
