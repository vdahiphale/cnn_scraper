And if you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with the top stories this hour.Southwest Airlines has canceled more than 4,500 flights today and Thursday. The company's CEO issued an apology for their system's meltdown and hoped to get services back on the regular schedule by next week. He also said the company was working on processing refunds. And new transcripts released by the January 6th committee revealed the extent of the coverup from the Trump White House. Including testimony that Trump White House aide Mark Meadows burned documents in his office fireplace. The winter storm hammering the Northeastern U.S. is over but the country's weather worries are not. Here's CNN meteorologist Tom Sater. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "From one weather extreme to another, as fast as the temperatures drop, they're warming up. High temperatures today. Still hold enough for the snowpack to hang around. Chicago 24, St. Louis, the freezing mark, Buffalo, only 24 degrees.But look at Denver already a high of 60 today. Rapid City 57. Overnight they had a windchill of minus 10 degrees. Snowpack across the U.S. and of course in Canada still very high and getting heavier in the mountains from British Columbia down to the central Rockies. A lot of snow in the upper Midwest. Winnipeg picked up 200 centimeters of snow. That's the earliest they picked up that much snow and then you get into Ontario. But of course, travel bans still in place in and around Buffalo. The governor of New York has opened up the freeways, thank goodness, but the only advisory in it is just an advisory is Watertown and the surrounding counties. The warm up begins but with problems. We're not going to see temperatures warm up and refreeze. They get up above freezing in Buffalo and stay that way. But however, rain comes in Saturday, Sunday and Monday. And with this massive warm up coming of course the flood problems we could see with ice jamming. The drainage areas, we can see the water main breaks and that could be a big problem. But above average, how about much above average for the East is staggering. Out to the West however, the first in a series of storms have moved in. Heavy mountain snow, heavy coastal rain, about 100,000 lost power in coastal areas of Oregon because trees are down and winds are so high. But this atmospheric river is like a fire hose. Again, it's not one system. It's a series of them. This is a multiday event that will see this atmospheric river plow into the area. With all the fires we've had out West, burn scars could really create some debris flows. But it's going to be flash flooding, as heavy rain already in San Francisco was sliding down toward L.A. all the way to the Mexican border. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And he played the entire game. It's unclear if he'll be able to face the Patriots this weekend.
