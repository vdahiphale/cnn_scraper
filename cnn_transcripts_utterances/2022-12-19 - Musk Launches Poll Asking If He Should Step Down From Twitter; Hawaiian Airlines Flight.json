One thing to ask about is, you know, this idea that Elon, when he puts these polls out there, he's already kind of decided what he's going to do. Like he's already decided that he's going to step down as a thing.Ben, what is your sense of whether or not that is what Elon was doing here? Did he already decide to step down as CEO? And does it really have that much of an impact on the company itself? BEN SMITH, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF SEMAFOR: I mean, I don't think that that he is -- he seems like he's living moment to moment. And, you know, I mean, he is -- he has this experience of Twitter, there's a lot about adulation. And if you look at what he's -- how he behaves on there, he is largely replying to people who are saying, you are great. And he says, I am, or here is a wise quote from Elon Musk. And he says, very wise. So I don't know if he thought he would lose a poll like that. But I think it'll have a huge impact on Twitter. I mean, it's been around obviously, just sort of out of his pocket for the last couple of weeks. And you can tell that he's -- that there's no one around him who ever -- who can -- who would just able to say, boss, I'm not sure that's a good idea, just based on a series of terrible ideas. He's sort of acted on and backed off. Totally strange situation. LEMON: Yes, something. I just want to say, can you -- can you put this in context for us? Because I'm sure you heard Kaitlan and I speaking. Look, I think that there, obviously, is a huge place in society, for Twitter, especially if you look at journalists, especially if you look at people like the women of Iran, if you look at countries where people don't have a free press, like there is a huge plays for Twitter. I think that he should be taking it more seriously. I think that these polls and all these antics is just to, you know, it's very -- it's right out of the Trump playbook, which is what I feel and that he is manipulating the media in order to get attention. So can you put this into perspective? Should we -- should journalists pull out their Trump playbook in order to deal with what Elon Musk is doing at Twitter? Is it a -- is it a page out of the same book?",

And there's one particular thing Trump would do, which is he would just violate some long-standing norm in order to largely get attention and drive, you know, the keepers of the norms, including journalists, totally nuts, and get a ton of attention and then sort of walk it back.And I think one difference, I mean, Kate [ph], you covered this with Trump's first term in particular, is that Trump actually didn't really know how to be an executive yet. And he would say he was going to do something caused massive outrage and then not do it. One thing about Musk is he knows how to run a company, just in a technical sense. He knows where the buttons and the levers are. And so when he has made an outrageous decision, he's been able to implement it very, very fast. And you've seen, you know, his decision sort of ripple through the actual functioning of the operation. That was actually kind of not true of the West Wing in 2017. It was much more Trump saying things people being outraged, and then nothing happening. I mean, you know, what you say about Twitter is important, it's certainly true. It's been this vital, vital part of the public conversation for 10 years. But it's not like a rule of nature that there has to be one big social platform that everybody in the world is on. I think it's -- and, you know, most of human history, there has not been one.

This was an Airbus A330. This flight from Phoenix to Honolulu. And we can tell from the flight aware track that some of this happened only about a half hour before the plane landed.

A lot of different causes of it, thunderstorms, rising currents of air, different speeds and layers of wind, wind shear. So that's a huge problem here. They're trying to sort of get a wrangle on this. But this sort of underscores why flight attendants tell you and the flight crew tells you, keep your seatbelt buckled even if the air is smooth.

We don't have an estimated figure as to how many of these 300 tourists are American, but the State Department is in touch with them. They have updated them with information about how to get out based on what the Peruvian government is setting up here in terms of evacuation routes.

It goes on to say avoid areas of demonstration as protests and demonstrations can be unpredictable and quickly turn violent.\" Now, Cusco is the city that's closest to Machu Picchu that has an international airport. So the question here, the problem here is that even if folks are getting on these trains out of Machu Picchu, they may still have some issues getting to the airport due to these expected demonstrations.
