Later, Sunak will also have an audience with the king where he will officially be appointed to the post.

But Sunak will soon need to address the very serious challenges facing the U.K. including a major economic crisis and political turmoil.

But there is definitely a problem about how he speaks to the nation now. Because this particular leadership contest in particular, it all took place behind closed doors. None of the candidates spoke directly to the public. Rishi Sunak's comments yesterday were the first time that he had done so.

With Liz Truss, she had that clear approach. She had conviction, but as one of my colleagues put it, that clear direction just marched them off the top of a cliff. So, with her, it was too much of that conviction. Not listening to the evidence, not listening to key advisors. Rishi Sunak has got to learn from both of those examples. Yes, he needs to set a clear direction, but he also needs to be able to listen to advice and to be ready to change if the facts change. And it is a difficult approach, it does need a mature mind, a calm mind. And he certainly has shown that in his time in British politics that he is able to give better direction. The treasury certainly appreciated him when he was chancellor, so I think he's got a better chance than both of them, but there are still some very choppy waters ahead.",
