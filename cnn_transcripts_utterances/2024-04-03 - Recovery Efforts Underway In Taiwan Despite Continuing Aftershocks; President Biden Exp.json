But because we're seeing aftershocks -- very powerful aftershocks that the Taiwanese authorities have warned could last for the next several days.

      "sentences": "Yeah, we've got showers that will be in the forecast for the next couple of days. And while this magnitude ofearthquake is so rare, we actually are in an area of the world where earthquakes themselves are pretty common. The area there in Southeast Asia is prone to earthquakes. We're looking at the Ring of Fire. Basically, we've got the plate tectonics of the Earth -- the Earth is split into plates. And once those plates kind of hit up against each other or they move, that's where you get the earthquakes. And if you look at Eastern Asia, Southeast Asia, all of these islands here are really prone, ground zero for all of that shaking. More than 450 of our volcanoes are in that area. Ninety percent of the world's earthquakes happen in that Ring of Fire. Like I mentioned, that seven-point magnitude earthquake is pretty rare. Only happens 15 times a year worldwide. But when it does happen, this is the destruction. I mean, we're looking at buildings that are crooked upside down, just totally toppled and destroyed, landslides being triggered from this. And the aftershocks that will come is even more vulnerable, because even though they might be lesser quakes than the original seven-point magnitude, you have buildings that look like that. So, they're more susceptible now to even more damage because they are losing their foundation and their structures. Seven-point magnitude on the east coast of Taiwan, any tsunami alerts have been lifted. But we have had about 29 earthquakes since then, the aftershocks that have been four-point magnitude or higher. So, they've been pretty significant. An earthquake like that on its own could do a lot of damage. Here's that three-day forecast going through the next couple of days. Temperatures at and a little bit above average in the middle 20s, but we are looking at some showers through Thursday, Friday and Saturday across the island as we go through the next couple of days. So, that could be a problem for rescuers trying to go through the rubble, clean-up efforts, as well, as we're looking at some showers that come off of mainland China and then cut across the island. And this will be through the next couple of days. But those aftershocks will continue. And again, like at our last check, most of them have been pretty strong, that four-point magnitude or higher, a lot of them five-point magnitude.

A lot of that threat for the tsunami threat there is pretty imminent, right, because you just shook all of this land and that can slosh the ocean back and forth. It might be something that they need to monitor for these aftershocks, depending on how strong these aftershocks can be, which, like I mentioned, some of them have been five to six-point in magnitude, which is pretty significant. So, they'll need to keep monitoring for that. But in that near term right now, all of those advisories and warnings have been allowed to expire.",

In a statement, he added that even more tragically, this was not a stand-alone incident. CNN's M.J. Lee joining us live now from the White House. The President saying that he is quite simply outraged. Obviously, those words, not in a vacuum. It comes at a time when there are there has been so much criticism from progressives, from Muslim Americans, from Arab Americans about the way this war is being handled and also the fact that the President continues to stand by Israel, especially in places like Michigan. Just talk to us a bit more about the political ramifications of this for the president, MJ. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. You know, first of all, our reporting is that this incident and the deaths of these seven aid workers has really touched off a fury and indignation inside the White House. And you saw President Biden's statement last night, really speaking volumes. He said that he was outraged and heartbroken. I should note the word outrage is not one that he has actually used often throughout the course of this war. And what I'm told by a senior administration official is that the frustration for the President and his top officials has really reached new levels after this incident. And what was striking about that statement we saw from the President last night is how explicitly he blamed Israel for what happened. He said in this statement that Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers, that it has not done enough to protect civilians. And he said, quote, \"Incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen. Now, this fury that I'm describing inside the White House certainly comes at a moment of bubbling tensions already between U.S. and Israel. This has been going on for months, of course, over the way that Israel has been conducting its war and its military operations in Gaza. But what's notable is that so far, at least today, the White House is making very clear that it is not announcing any kind of sort of policy changes when it comes to the U.S.' overall support of Israel and the war that is currently conducting for the goal of eradicating Hamas in Gaza. White House spokesperson John Kirby just told reporters moments ago that, yes, U.S. wants Israel to do things a little bit differently, to make sure that they are doing a better job of preventing these civilian casualties. But he said the U.S. still believes that Israel has a right to defend itself. And he said, quote, \"Israel is going to continue to have American support.\" Now, in terms of just the actions that the U.S. might ultimately take in response to these deaths, Kirby also said that it depends on the investigation that the Israelis are conducting. Of course, we already know a lot of the details that would come out of this investigation. But still, the administration's view right now is that they need a full accounting of what exactly happened before they can have that conversation.",

So, for some answers, let's bring in IDF spokesperson, Peter Lerner. Peter, it is good to see you. So, we heard from the IDF Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Halevi, say that this was a mistake that followed a misidentification, and that an independent body would investigate these killings. A very outraged President Biden went on to say that these deaths were not a standalone incident, and that he's calling for a swift, accountable, and public investigation. What is the IDF doing now, and what guarantees can you make that this investigation will be swift, it will be accountable, it will be independent, and it will be made public? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Thanks, Bianna. It's great to be here with you. So, I think, first of all, I'd like to echo what President Biden actually said. He said it simply shouldn't happen, and that's exactly what the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Halevi, also said. It was a mistake, it was an unfortunate tragedy, and that is precisely what we're doing now in order to try and learn from the mistake that happened in the attempt to try and deliver humanitarian food supplies to the people in need. The IDF is currently involved in, I would say, two core efforts to learn those lessons and take the necessary steps. First of all, an operational debrief, understanding what the operational conditions were, what the level of coordination, what went wrong. We have to get to the bottom of it. So, that we need to do very swiftly. We need to do it so that we can continue our operational effort hand-in-hand with the humanitarian effort. And the second level of investigation or inquiry or probe that we're conducting is an independent investigation made up of former senior military officials that are no longer in service, but understand the nature of warfare, understand the prism of conducting complex operations in densely populated areas. And indeed, we need to get to the bottom of what happened to the convoy, to the staff of the World Central Kitchen. It shouldn't have happened. It was a mistake. Our Chief of Staff said that we are sorry for this and we need to make sure that it doesn't happen again. I'm sure you understand that I can't go into specific details at this time, Bianna, as the inquiry, as the probe proceeds, but I expect there to be some results within the next couple of days.",

Now, there were two aspects of the law that the judges said could be thrown out, including issues of privacy and health. But in the main, they let it stand. Despite the incredible pressure coming from Western governments and others, ever since President Museveni signed the law last year and extensive reporting by CNN has shown that LGBTQ Ugandans have been harassed, evicted, and beaten, and in some cases, even had to flee the country to seek asylum elsewhere because of the conditions in Uganda. Now, it's likely the lawyers will appeal this ruling at the Supreme Court. David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg.",

Now, one of them that I like to talk about is on our WB-57 high altitude research jet. And this jet will be flying across the path of totality while imaging the solar corona, that upper atmosphere of the sun. Now, taking pictures of it helps us to understand what the composition is of the solar corona, how it's heated to extreme temperatures, and perform other experiments to really understand physics that's going on at the sun in a way that we can't do these tests every day. Now, we're also trying to study the upper atmosphere of the earth and understand how the sun and the eclipse impacts the upper atmosphere. We're launching three sounding rockets from our Wallops Flight Facility, and they'll be launched before, during, and after that peak eclipse. When they reach their launch height, what they'll be doing is actually measuring that electrically charged region of the upper atmosphere so that we can see how the sun impacts these layers of the earth's atmosphere.",

If you're within the other 48 contiguous U.S. states, you'll be able to see a partial eclipse, which means when you look up at the sky, you'll see part of the sun covered by the moon, almost like a crescent sun. And so if you're in that path of totality, during totality, you're able to look up at the sky and experience the eclipse.
