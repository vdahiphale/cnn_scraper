Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.338,000 children, that is how many American kids have been exposed to gun violence at school since the Columbine tragedy. Now, imagine this. You survived a school shooting in high school only to arrive at college and be the victim of another one. That is what happened to at least three students at Michigan State University last night. I'll talk to the father of one girl enduring that nightmare tonight. Also, Parkland Survivor David Hogg will be here with his thoughts on the five-year anniversary of that school shooting. Plus, Nikki Haley throwing her hat in the ring for 2024 against Donald Trump. How will she now deal with her head-spinning contradictions and positions on Trump? And Ohio's governor says he would not drink the water in one part of the state. So, what are the people of East Palestine supposed to do 11 days after that toxic train derailment started spewing hazardous chemicals? Erin Brockovich is here tonight with us. But I want to get right to the aftermath of the mass shooting last night Michigan State University. Joining me now is Matt Riddle, whose daughter, Emma, is a freshman at MSU and was a senior at Oxford High School during the school shooting there just 14 months ago. Matt, thanks so much for taking the time to talk tonight. It is almost unbelievable that you all endured this nightmare 14 months ago when she was a senior in high school and then you have this recurring nightmare last night. How do you and she even process what has happening to her in the past 14 days?",

And I think one of the things that has been heartbreaking for me is for her to acknowledge that this time may be easier because she has tools that she developed last time she went through this.And I can remember thinking after the Oxford shooting that, okay, you survived, and it is tragic, and you lost friends but this will never happen again, right? It just can't. So, we've been through it, this trauma is something that we've experienced and, you know, you are done, right? That's kind of what your brain tells you.

And then when there was confirmation that there was indeed a mass shooter on campus or a shooter in campus, that is when she did call. As a parent, it is heartbreaking to hear that fear in her voice again. It is something that I will never forget the first time and now there's a second time. And you're just -- you're heartbroken because all you want, as a parent, is to protect their children and to keep them safe, and you know you can't. You're handing them off to college and you want them to have experiences and live but it takes a piece of you that they are going to go through something like this and then to have it happen again and have to relive some of the things that happen the first time is just tragic that we've allowed that to continue occurring.",

I was able to stay off this week and be with her.So, there's not a lot you can do. It is going to take time and it's going to take -- you have got to go through some things. And to your point, that trauma is going to stack up on top of each other, you are going to have things that occurred that reminded you both of those events at the same time.

I met every one of those families, spent time with them all. And a lot of you here had to confront violence in your communities every single day. We took a big step towards passing the most significant bipartisan gun legislation in 30 years, ghost guns and other things, background checks. But there is a lot more work to do.

[22I think that we need to change the conversation and break the cycle that we have inaction and debate. And we need to realize that there is common ground for us to work on here even if it is small in the first place. Most of us have agreed that we need to fund mental health to prevent gun suicides, for example. We need to get more information and research to figure out how to stop these shootings in the first place. And I would say to anybody that is out there, especially Republican lawmakers, that if you're interested in working beyond with me on that, D.M. me on Twitter. I've had conversations with Republicans privately and I know that there is room for progress here.

You've been trying to get any lawmakers who will listen and who are open, to try to come to the table and have common sense solutions.Speaking of research, here is another staggering bit of research. The Washington Post quantified how many kids have lived through a school shooting since Columbine, so a school shooting at their high school. I mean, we tend to think in terms of the victims who were killed but these are the kids who survived. You are one of these figures. So, since this is the children exposed to gun violence since Columbine, in 2018, when the Parkland massacre happened, there were 187,000 children who had lived through a school shooting. Today, it is almost double. In 2023, there are 338,000. That is just such a staggering number. I mean, that is the ripple effect, David, that you and I've talked about. It is not just the victims and their families, it is all of you who carried this memory with you.",

Look, it is time for us to end the debate that has brought us here and it's time to spread the dialogue that will get us out of here.I just have a special message from the Republicans and conservative gun owners who don't agree with me in the first place. Look, I can respect people who don't agree with me but I can't accept that there is nothing we can do as Americans to keep the number one thing we all care about, which is our loved ones, and especially our children safe. But if we can continue this debate over and over again we are just going to remain here. We need to turn this debate into a dialogue and a conversation to make progress on this. We've acted in a bipartisan way after Parkland. Our GOP state legislature passed a red flag law that has now been used over 6,000 times in Parkland. And one time, Alisyn, it was used for somebody who sent a death to my own mother. That law that we passed after Parkland may have prevented me from having to bury my own mother. Is any law perfect? No, obviously. But we can make meaningful progress in a bipartisan way on this. We did this summer with the bipartisan Safer Communities Act. But until we put our politics aside and start pushing for what we can agree on together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united to protect our kids, we're going to remain here. And the reality is we have to put those politics aside because your town could be the next Parkland. And I do want anybody else to have that reality. So, if you're a GOP lawmaker that is interested in figuring out where we can have common ground and have a good faith conversation about what we can do as Americans to address this issue, let's do it. Because I don't believe that is anything that we can't do in this country. And if we can land a man on the moon, I think it stop our kids from getting shot too.",

We need to start by getting the right answers and funding research more.
