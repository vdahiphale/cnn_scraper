This is the closest margin we have going into a first debate ever, ever, ever, ever. I think you might have to even, even in 1960, JFK led by a few points, although those were very different times back then. But the fact is, there's a ton at stake tomorrow night. We're dealing with a historically close race, in which any small movement could make all the difference in the world if in fact a few minds get changed.

For the first time in history, a sitting president is debating. A former president for the first time in history, a general election debate is in June. I will also now add and for the first time in history, it really seems that more voters than ever would prefer that these were not the two choices that they had standing on that debate stage.

He's got an A be able to show fitness for office, which is not just age, but the ability to stand on stage which and debate Donald Trump, who's pretty aggressive and can carry the tempo of a debate for 90 minutes.Number two, he's going to have to talk about his vision for future. And I think that's where the presidents had a hard time so far, which is he's really wanted to go back to his record and try to defend it. He's got a pain of a vision for the next four years. What a second term would look like? But lastly, and most critically, the president and frankly the former president are both going to have to defend their records and right now with issues like immigration and inflation, top of mind immigration, top of mind and even what's going on across the globe being top of mind of voters, that's a real problem for them right now, because there's a great deal of dissatisfaction. So he's got the chance to turn that around tomorrow night, and that's the way he can climb back in the polls. The last thing I just say, because four years ago at this point in the race, Joe Biden was up by ten points. This is a much different race than it was the last time these gentlemen debated. It's a different country, it's a different electorate, and it's different political environment. So it's a great chance for the president to turn this thing around if he's got a chance to do it.",

And so, Joe Biden has to show that he's not Trump light. He's not just sort of imitating Trump that he's reacting to a problem that he did propose legislation for on day one of his administration, and that his approach is still humanitarian, that there's something distinct, that he's not simply imitating Trump, which of course just gives Trump credit for the moment.
