It's in an area of the east of Ukraine where the north and east of Ukraine where the Russians have been putting a huge amount of military pressure on the big town there, Kupyansk. In fact, Ukrainian officials had asked elderly people, women and children to move out of that area recently but this village -- 40 kilometers away from the frontline. The Interior Minister says about 330 people live in the village. So, when you hear that death toll of 51 people, you can understand that about one in seven people in that village, as far as we know, have been killed. He said that there was a funeral underway for a villager that everyone represented as families in that village have gathered in the cafe of a shop nearby. They were hit by this missile and we've seen Russia do this before. It has hit in nearby towns, popular restaurant that have been full of people. This happened at about 1:30 in the afternoon. It's not clear why Russia targeted because this is a precision missile that would be carefully aimed at a particular location so far from the frontline. It's not clear why Russia has done this. But the carnage that has been created as you say is just absolutely horrific. Interesting that the Prime Minister has, you know, called this Russian terrorism and said the only way to deal with this is -- and this, of course, he's saying this in the light of the fact there's concern in Ukraine about the fact the United States might be going a little softer on supplying weapons. So, then, look. The only way to combat Russia's terrorism here is to be -- to do it in a coordinated and systematic way for all our allies and partners to work together in a coordinated and systemic way.

And just give us your best guess at this point who will become the next Speaker. Who do you support and how does the person who does become the next Speaker avoid the same sorts of political constraints that led to McCarthy's ouster? GREG MURPHY, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN:  Well, sure. I think to put this in perspective, Speaker McCarthy -- former Speaker McCarthy, when we began his term as Speaker has handicapped several individuals, specifically Matt Gaetz and was under the microscope the entire time. Remember, the Speaker of the House has to manage not only the different factions within the Republican Party but those in the minority party -- the Democratic party. So, the new Speaker is going to have to be somebody that is going to be able to have to unite the Republican party because there are many individuals that are upset with these few individuals, less than four percent of the caucus who essentially railroaded the party into expelling McCarthy. That's it, you know, as with the phoenix, it dies and then rises with the ashes and that's what we're hopeful for. And what we need is we need to unite a front because, you know, guys, look at what's happening to our country. Look at the border. Look at the absolute invasion of what's going on. Inflation's out of control. Our interest rates are killing the average American and killing our economy, and then plus crime in the city, so many different things that need to be affronted. You know, this is a demonstration of democracy, and democracy is messy, and this is how the sausage is made.

Our southern border, our absolute invasion. I mean, sanctuary cities are now crying for help. And so, it's the content of what's going on and the destruction, in my opinion, of the Biden administration of the very fabric of the country. We don't know who to call boy or girl. We don't know where inflation, where we're going to get our food from. We don't know where housing is going to come from. So, yeah, we have some fighting. Absolutely.

I don't think anybody can argue with this, but Ukraine started with our disastrous withdrawal in Afghanistan. So, yeah, in some ways, we do have an obligation to clean up that mess that we caused, I think, or lend the conditions to.

And that's what so many of the individuals, right now, there's no accountability. There's no accountability. The money goes over there, and we hope it goes into the right pockets and into the right hands, but there's no accountability.

That is going to certainly be added to the nearly 63,000 people that are still in the care of New York City in their network of shelters. The reason why we continue to see these numbers, according to officials, are multiple factors. Obviously, we have a recent surge that continues to be noticed along the southern border, but also some of those border municipalities, including the city of El Paso, which has seen many of these crossings, has resumed its offer to bus some of these asylum seekers into interior cities like Denver -- you mentioned Chicago, and certainly New York City. But then lastly, another factor here that's at play is politics. Republican Governor Greg Abbott in the state of Texas has resumed, at least really intensified would be the better word, those efforts to bus migrants. This is According to the city. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAMILLE JOSEPH VARLACK, CHIEF OF STAFF, NEW YORK MAYOR'S OFFICE:  Last week, Texas Governor Abbott centralized the dispatch, command and control functions of the deployment of buses through the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and he has significantly ramped up the number of buses that are being sent, not just to New York City, but other cities, as well. While before, we may have received a few hours' notice that buses were coming through back channels in different organizations, even including information on the manifest numbers of how many people were going to be on those buses.

For more on this subject, joining us now is Mark Esper, former Defense Secretary under President Trump.Secretary Esper, it's good to have you on the program. So, as we noted, the CR passed without $6 billion in funding for Ukraine. The Pentagon has warned that there is no more money to train Ukrainian soldiers and just $1.6 billion left to replenish stocks of U.S. weapons. Ammunition supply is running low around the world with U.S. and Western allies. How concerned are you that this continued hold-up in Congress will deprive Ukraine of the weapons that they need right now, especially given that it takes time to even procure these weapons? MARK ESPER, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  Well, thank you, Bianna. I am concerned on a number of levels. You know, first of all, on the practical matter. You cited some numbers. There are other numbers that say that the United States has about $5.4 billion left to provide for Ukraine, which could get Ukraine through the rest of the year. They're burning about $2.5 billion a month, and the United States provides about half of that or so. So, that is in the process, in the pipeline, if you will. But I'm really concerned about the bigger issue. That's the political issue of dwindling United States support, at least from the Republican party in the House of Representatives, with regard to funding Ukraine. If you look at vote after vote over the last few months, you see that the number of Republicans opposing aid to Ukraine continues to increase. And that's what troubles me more, because look, the United States is like the big block in the bottom of a Jenga tower. And if you pull out our assistance, then I'm afraid Western support crumbles or at least collapses over time. And that can't happen because Ukraine's success is important, very important to our own security. And that's really what concerns me.",

Both parties share that view, bythe way, and the importance of having a fence or a barrier on the border for years. This divide is only a recent one coming over the last five, six, seven years because I worked in Congress for, for a period of time. And so, it's interesting to see President Biden reversing core person now wanting to build more wall. And I think a lot of it is politics, but it also in some ways, helps address concerns of Republicans on Capitol Hill who seem to be making a false distinction between border security and support for Ukraine. Now, set that aside. Look, I -- President Trump mentioned that issue of attacking the cartels with missiles to me privately. I talk about it in my memoir. I push back on it. I thought it clearly is an act of war. I didn't think it would solve the problem in the long term. And we need to work, rather, with our neighbor, Mexico, to the south. And I have often cited a plan that I knew fairly well, which was Plan Colombia in the early 2000s, where we worked with the Colombian government and others with DOD supporting an effort led by State Department and the DEA to curtail the flow of drugs coming in. In my view, that's the way they approach it because if you really militarize the situation and take actions without Mexico's cooperation, it just bleeds into so many other issues we have with Mexico, not least of which is the immigration, the illegal immigration problem on the southern border. So, I think it takes really careful diplomacy. You got to focus on it. And you got to -- you need to take a whole-of-government approach, working with our partners to the south.

What we do know is the 16-year-old, Armita Geravand -- she was hospitalized on Sunday. She is in a coma. And what you have is two narratives. You've got the activist groups, opposition groups, human rights groups in Iran who are saying from Iran, who are saying that she was assaulted by the morality police or the enforcers of the mandatory hijab in that metro station in Tehran for not wearing the hijab and that she was admitted into hospital according to one of these groups with head trauma. And on the other side, you've got the government that appears to be pushing this narrative that her blood pressure dropped and she fell, hit her head and that's how she ended up in a coma and in hospital. And they seem to be really trying to push this hard. We have seen over the past hours or so, these interviews being released, including with her parents coming out on state TV saying that they believe, they've been told that this is what happened, that her blood pressure dropped, that they hadn't seen an altercation. We also saw state media releasing interviews, they say, with friends of Armita who were there, that there was no assault, no physical assault there. But people are finding this very hard to believe. There's a lot of skepticism, Zain, and it's understandable when you look at the history of the regime, especially over the past year, as well. You know, they've been accused in the past of really putting pressure on families, on parents, of protesters who were killed to come out and make these -- sort of statements under pressure. We don't really know what the conditions were under which her parents gave this interview, but there's a lot of questions that remain unanswered. And when you consider the history of the regime, you can understand why so many people are asking questions and they still don't really know or believe the government's narrative about what happened.",
