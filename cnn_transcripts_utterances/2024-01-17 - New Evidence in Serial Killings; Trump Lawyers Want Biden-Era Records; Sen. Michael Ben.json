It's the intelligence community. It's the White House Counsel's Office, the Biden White House, the National Security Council. They also want to see interactions between the Fulton County D.A., that's prosecuting Trump, and the White House, the Secret Service, the Archives. They want the judge in this case to tell the prosecutors, go across the administration, the Biden administration, and make everybody give over their records around this classified documents case. Whether that's going to actually happen is a big question. It's going to be up to the judge. The special counsel's office is certainly going to be pushing back for it. But Trump is making a very big ask here, which they're able to do in the way that you prepare for a trial, but nobody asks for this amount of stuff.

Judge Karen Henderson joined with three other conservative appointed judges on the D.C. Circuit in a totally different case to write a statement saying they want there to be a lot of deference by special counsel's offices that are pursuing a case like this against someone like Donald Trump, a former president. There should be a lot of deference around the executive branch, around the presidency. Judge Pan has already written on this topic and has not said that. She's all for allowing criminal prosecutors to do what they're going to do. So, a big question of how they'll split on what happens with this presidential immunity question.
