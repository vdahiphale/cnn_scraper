And that new date is June 5th, according to the Treasury Secretary. In a letter to congressional leadership, including the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, Secretary Yellen writes, quote, \"Based on the most recent available data, we now estimate that Treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government's obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5th.\" A senior White House official telling me on Friday that this new timeline doesn't fundamentally change the negotiations, but it certainly does inject a new sense, added sense, perhaps, of urgency to those talks. This official also said that they are now in the final stages of negotiation and that they believe they are on track to reach a deal to avoid default by June 5th. We know that one of the major sticking points in that final stage of negotiations has been this issue of work requirements for those social safety net programs. I asked President Biden on Friday, as he was leaving for Camp David, what he says to Democrats, who tell him that they don't want him to bow to McCarthy on work requirements.

Democrats have -- we've only seen this kind of blackmail when we've had the circumstance of a Republican-controlled House and a Democratic president.When we've had the reverse circumstance -- under Bush or under Trump, when the Democrats controlled the House -- they did not do this. It is another measure of something I've believed in American politics for the last 15 years, which is that any weapon that can be used now must be used. There's enormous pressure from the base of each party to do so. But it is kind of a crazy process when you consider that this is raising debt to fund spending that we have already done. You know? It is not that we are authorizing new spending here. We're paying off bills for things that we have already appropriated or expended. When you add that dimension to it, it looks even more irrational. Democrats had the chance in the lame duck session to avoid this by either eliminating the debt ceiling or extending it past 2024. And for whatever reason, presumably resistance from Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, they chose not to do so. And that looks more and more like a blunder. Although as I say, the final deal is close to what is being discussed. It is a pretty minimal set of concessions by Biden to Republicans, given the fact that Republicans control the House.

But instead of a swastika, it has two crossed hammers, which is part of the imagery of that album. It is meant to be satire. It's something that Waters has been doing for decades now. But it is the first time that it has attracted a German criminal investigation. But the Berlin police justified it by saying, in part, that \"context of the clothing worn is deemed capable of approving, glorifying or justifying the violent and arbitrary rule of the Nazi regime in a manner that violates the dignity of the victims and thereby disrupts public peace.\" The performance has been controversial for a while, so much so that city officials in Frankfurt tried to get the venue to cancel it this coming Sunday. It ended up in a German courtroom and, according to \"The Guardian,\" the court ruled in Waters' favor, saying that, though the performance uses \"symbolism manifestly based on that of the National Socialist regime, it did not glorify or relativize the crimes of the Nazis or identify with Nazi racist ideology.\" After that court ruling and earlier this month, Waters went on a podcast, where he responded to the criticism.

The White House does not want to have this fight again. It appears Republicans would allow for a two-year debt limit increase.

These are closest advisers to Putin, usually current and former members of the intelligence and security services as well as the military.So the oligarchs themselves don't have armies; they have economic power to a limited extent. But they don't have the actual physical powers that, for example, some of these siloviki, some of the closer elites have. So the real question is, when will guys like Patrushev, guys like the head of the FSB and the SVR, the intelligence services, begin to say, you know, he's gone too far? Or are they saying, perhaps Putin has gone too far and Prigozhin might be the go-to guy at some later date? There's a lot going on in the background.",
