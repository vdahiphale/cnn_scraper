      "sentences": "Hi, Fredricka.Well, I just arrived here in New Hampshire at an Nikki Haley event to get the news and I'm looking at my phone right now because Ron DeSantis' campaign just put out a video. And in the video, he says that he is suspending his 2024 presidential bid, and he explains a lot more in the video, which we just got. We are waiting to actually look at it with the details that he is giving. But the headline is that Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who has been -- had been when he got in the one to beat Donald Trump, and now what we're seeing is that he only survived one contest, only survived Iowa and he is dropping out of the race before voters even go to the polls here where I am in New Hampshire, a day after tomorrow. This is a really stunning decision, a stunning decline for a candidate who had millions and millions of dollars, all of the donors who were kind of not into Donald Trump at the beginning of this process way before he even got into the race back in May. They said Ron DeSantis is our guy. But he clearly felt that that was not going to happen for him. The money was drying up, and the polls were making clear that he was not going to be able to make it very far. And that is a deadly combination when you are running for president. Just in our poll today, Fredricka, he got only six percent here in New Hampshire. He has not been advertising here, for example, since November, and that just kind of gives you a sense of where things are. You go back to Iowa, just last week, Fredricka, he went to all 99 counties, he made a very big push there, and he didn't win one of them. And so the combination of that, all of the money that he spent and the lack of traction that he has been getting, made it very clear to him and the people in his campaign, the people in his family that it was the end of the road for him in this particular race, and he is suspending his campaign, Fredricka.",

He says, \"We don't have a clear path.\" But at the same time, he also said, Trump is superior to President Biden.So clearly, he is throwing his support behind Trump who in every indication, through so much polling that he is still the leading figure in the race for the nomination in the GOP, and so just a couple of days ago, you heard Nikki Haley saying it's a two-person race and so it is now. Dana Bash back with us now. So we're hearing with some clarity there from Ron DeSantis that he is out. He had some real criticism for government, still works for itself, not for you. Yet even with that criticism of government, he is no longer on the path to try to promote some sort of change with him in the White House. But you know, it is still curious as to why he made this decision now, when immediately even after a poor showing in Iowa, he goes to South Carolina, and then he comes to New Hampshire today for at least one campaign event, canceling on television appearances, and now has this very constructed television announcement that he has suspended the campaign. So what happened in between all of this?",

And you know, look, Fredricka, David, I'm sure will talk to this as well, but in terms of a larger picture here, we're really seeing this race, we are really seeing -- I'm sorry, Trump really taking hold of this race and things really falling into line in the way that Trump and his campaign would hope.

He was very much running on fumes.And running 30-points behind Donald Trump in Iowa, which is the state where he put everything on the line did not result in getting infused with a whole bunch of new cash because he didn't get much momentum out of Iowa. The other reality: You don't need a what or a whom, it's just the basic math here. This is a battle to collect enough delegates to become the Republican nominee, and when you look at the path ahead, how Ron DeSantis was going to be able to move on in a truly contested race against Donald Trump if he didn't have the funds to do so and if his supporters in large part are totally good with Donald Trump and Donald Trump is racking up victories. I mean, this is the reality of how Ron DeSantis chose to run this race for the last year, which was to try and be Trump, but without the baggage, rather than making a case against Donald Trump from the outset. He's done that in recent days more vociferously, but certainly that wasn't the thrust of his entirety of the last year of this campaign. And that meant that a lot of supporters who feel aligned with what DeSantis is selling, they just have the actual original version in Donald Trump to sign up for. So, he was in a complicated position by the way he structured the strategy of his campaign. And I would just note when we now look at this arc, Fred, of the last year, remember Ron DeSantis, in November of 2022 just over a year ago wins resounding victory for re-election as Florida's governor, you know, one of the largest states in the country. Nineteen-point victory over his Democratic opponent, precisely as Donald Trump's legal woes were beginning to mount precisely when a lot of Republicans had concerns that Donald Trump- backed candidates in the midterm elections in '22 were not winning their elections. There was this looking around from Republicans, who else is out there other than Donald Trump? And Donald Trump saw that too, which is why he announced his campaign for the presidency, his third campaign for the presidency, right in November on the heels of that DeSantis big victory to start trying to squash the oxygen that was forming around DeSantis. And DeSantis, a year ago was sitting so pretty, he was actually really competitive with Donald Trump, and all of that, just if you look at the entirety of the DeSantis campaign over the last year, it has been nothing but a straight decline of support downward as Donald Trump strengthened inside this Republican race.",

He says, you know, he is here to fight for the forgotten. I mean, those are words of Donald Trump. And so it's no surprise, I guess that he would now be behind or backing or throwing his endorsement behind Donald Trump, but then, at the same time, it is a little surprising because he tried, it seems as though Ron DeSantis, tried really hard to distance himself or make a distinction that he was unlike Donald Trump in these last few weeks of this race to the White House.

Seeing him yesterday on the campaign trail, there was just something missing from him. He didn't have the swagger that he had going into Iowa. He kind of had adopted this sort of underdog mindset going into those final weeks of the race when he really thought that there was a chance that this ground game that he had built there would materialize into some late support. But I'm told that as early as Thursday, DeSantis, after Iowa made this trek back to Florida, and it obviously sparked a lot of speculation. His campaign said, no, no, he's still in it. But during this trip, he did meet with a number of his closest advisers, back home in Tallahassee, and they had a lot of conversations about what comes next. And it was really the first time that he entertained conversations about dropping out is what I'm told. One person is telling me, I think he just needed to get a bit more time to collect his thoughts and determine a path forward. He got to the decision on his own, and he determined it is in the best interest to get back to governor. I'm told the mood around DeSantis supporters right now and his advisers is disappointing, but the belief had set in that this campaign was over. So clearly, not a shock to those who have been trying to raise money for him since Iowa, those who are planning the events. Obviously, the confusion around his movements, what state he was going to even be in today, and the decision to drop those interview plans with \"State of the Union\" and NBC clearly sending a lot of signals that something was amiss. And today, he made this decision himself, he finalized it and not only making the decision to get out of the race, but also to also to throw his weight behind Donald Trump in a way that not only suggests that, that he will support the former president going forward, but he really came out critically of Nikki Haley. Let me read you a little bit of what he said in his announcement because I think it's quite stunning: \"I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear or repackage form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.\" So not just supporting Donald Trump, but coming out with this -- immediately with this attack of Nikki Haley aligning himself back with the MAGA crowd that made him such a popular person to begin with, a rising star and clearly with a looking ahead to 2028, and that's got to be part of the calculus in that decision there -- Fred.",

There is a movement among Republicans who are working really hard to not align themselves with Trump.And so they're hoping that Haley might be able to gain more momentum.

I would just note, it is going to be a very tough climb. What we've seen in the numbers out of the results in Iowa, and perhaps we'll see what the voters do in New Hampshire is that the Trump wing of the party is more dominant than those that want to coalesce around an anti-Trump alternative. It is a larger share of the party. That's one. Two, if you look at the contests coming ahead in this race, there are some of them through the end of March, Fred, where yes, Independents can indeed play in Republican primaries, especially in states where you don't register by party. But there will be a whole slew of contests that will be closed, and it will be Republicans only and what we've seen out of Iowa, and what we see out of the polling in New Hampshire, and we'll see the election results on Tuesday is that Nikki Haley right now is performing a lot better with Independents, with moderates than she is with tried and true conservative Republicans. Well, as these contests go over, the conservative Republicans are the more dominant force inside these contests in this battle for delegates, which may make it very tough for Nikki Haley to amass the kind of momentum that she would need to really suggest that this is an effort that should be funded all the way through to the convention. Right now, Donald Trump is sitting pretty in this race, and Nikki Haley is going to need convincing evidence beyond just getting kind of close to him in New Hampshire that she can stay the course in this race.",

Yes, some campaigns may try to absorb some of DeSantis' staff, there is also the reality that DeSantis' staff has just put their heart and soul into something for the better part of the year that didn't work out, the staff of the super PAC. And so, there may be a moment where they want to catch their breath and not jump in the next 48 hours into somebody's campaign. I think it's more Donald Trump's mission, should he emerge as the nominee here, and he is obviously the clear frontrunner to do so, to bring all factions of the party together.

We know that Donald Trump had really viciously attacked DeSantis throughout 2024, really in the lead up to Iowa. He had focused the majority of his attacks on DeSantis. And a lot of that was of course, he was a little bit concerned about DeSantis' candidacy, but it also was for personal reasons. Donald Trump has a lot of personal animosity toward DeSantis. He views him as disloyal for running against him after Trump offered his endorsement of the Florida governor as he was running for governor in 2017. And so I think a big question moving forward is, will the Trump campaign use him as a potential surrogate, embrace his endorsement and tout that on the trail? When I asked Trump's advisers about this just moments ago, they told me it's still unclear.

Perhaps not John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, but you noted Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, you know, they were all there at the end of the day, and no doubt so too, will Ron DeSantis and the Trump campaign I'm sure will be happy to deploy him. He comes from a critical big battleground state, now the former president's home state, although it is a red leaning battleground state of late, so I'm not sure how much the Biden operation will actually invest resources in Florida. But obviously, DeSantis became a more nationally known figure among Republicans and conservatives throughout this year, and so he may be helpful to the Trump campaign going forward. Listen.

And if indeed, your poll numbers are not great, it doesn't look like you have a ton of momentum, there's not a lot coming in behind to replenish the coffers.And so, DeSantis spent early also on a big operation. The super PAC did, the campaign did. They clearly, in the summer saw that that had to get scaled down. I remember, in August, around the first debate in Milwaukee, the DeSantis super PAC never backed down. It putting out pleas for an additional $10 million in the imminent future or they were not going to be able to execute on their plan as they had hoped. And it turns out, they weren't able to execute on their plan as they hoped. Never mind all the drama around the leadership of these organizations that got shuffled around multiple times. This was never a well-oiled machine. The DeSantis campaign, the DeSantis super PAC, the DeSantis political universe from the get-go was never a well-oiled machine here, and it showed that to us in real time. That's not something we're learning now when we look back and do obituaries on the campaign. That is something we all covered in real time. And part of that was the spending of resources. I mean, one of the reasons Nikki Haley, and she says this often on the trail has some money now at the end, not only because she was getting hot at the end, and that's one of the biggest reasons, but also because they were holding back a bunch of their resources and not going on air until they were deep into the fall, understanding that they wanted to spend it when it might have its most crucial impact.",
