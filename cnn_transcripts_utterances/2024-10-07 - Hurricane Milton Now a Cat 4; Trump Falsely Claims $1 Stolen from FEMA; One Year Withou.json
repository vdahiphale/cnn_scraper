And here's just one example.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank so they could give it to their illegal immigrants. They want to have vote for them. We're missing a billion dollars. They gave them to the migrants that came in. And now, we don't have the money. We'll do it. But when they don't have the money to take care of, that's why they're giving you lousy treatment in North Carolina in particular. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, first of all, there is no Biden administration illegal scheme to illegally register undocumented people to vote in this election. Non-citizen voting is a felony. It's rare. There's no conspiracy here.And then, this bigger claim. So, there is no basis for saying that money was stolen from FEMA, money is missing. Let me give you the facts here. So, there are two separate pots of money we're talking about, each of them specifically appropriated by Congress for a specific purpose. So, there's more than $35 billion in disaster relief money that was appropriated to FEMA disaster relief in this fiscal year. And then there was a much smaller pot of money, about $650 million that Congress said, we're going to give to Customs and Border Protection to shelter and support migrants, and we're going to have Customs and Border Protection transfer that money to FEMA to administer the program, because they have experience administering grant programs. Again, two separate pots. There is no reason, no basis for saying that there's some sort of hanky-panky, some sort of theft here. Just not happening.",
