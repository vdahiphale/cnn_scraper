Now, we did interview him today, and he categorically denies making these post. I'll get to that in just a moment. But first, I want to walk people through just some of them. Take a look at this right here in one post, Robinson called himself a, \"Black Nazi\". And when discussing then President Barack Obama in 2012, writing, \"I take Hitler over any of the shit, that's Washington right now.\" It even really goes beyond that. In another disturbing post, Robinson defended slavery, writing, \"Slavery is not bad, and I wish they would bring back slavery. I would certainly buy a few\". Now, all of these and many other comments you can read on CNN.com were made of the message board of a porn website called \"Nude Africa\". And, Anderson, in addition to those posts, he also expressed views on \"Nude Africa\" that sharply contradict his current policies as a socially conservative candidate for governor. For example, he has been vocally anti-transgender, but look at what Robinson wrote on the porn message board a decade ago, writing that he liked, \"watching transgender porn\", adding, \"Thats F--ing hot\" and calling himself a \"Perv\". In another thread that was discussing the story of a woman who said she had been raped by her taxi driver while she was drunk, Robinson wrote, \"And the moral of this story, don't F a drunk White bitch\".",

And now, they are saying that that decision is expected to hold, but of course very notable that Donald Trump is going to be in the state just days after this bombshell reporting from our own Andrew Kaczynski. Now, I've also been told that many people within Donald Trump's campaign and those close to the former president has long had reservations about Robinson's gubernatorial candidacy, particularly because this isn't the first time that he has made very controversial and pretty damaging remarks. Remember, he has previously mocked victims of school shootings. He has been very demeaning to the civil rights movement. There's a lot of other examples I can point you to, but that has already led to a lot of unease within Trump's orbit, but that hasn't stopped, I should argue Donald Trump from continuing to support Robinson. He endorsed him earlier this year, so there's a lot of questions about that. Now, I am told that Donald Trump's team wants to continue to try to distance him -- distance the former president from Robinson.

I met a voter in Vegas who has never supported a Democrat for president ever in his life and he is supporting Vice President Harris this cycle.

I mean, look, from a strategic perspective, what Donald Trump needs to do is if he's asked, address it, say if it's true, he doesn't agree with it, and try to pivot and move on.I think at this stage, trying to withdraw an endorsement or something like that is just going to continue this story and I'll say, you know, having done politics now for almost 20 years, rarely do you see a down-ballot race impact a ballot above it. You often see an impact from top to the bottom if you have a bad federal election year for Republican or Democratic Party, maybe down- ballot that has an impact, but very rarely do you actually see an impact up ballot. So I'm not sure how much this is truly going to impact Donald Trump's campaign in North Carolina. Except to say, that he's got to somehow find a way to keep Republican volunteers enthused while also trying to show some distance between him and some of the obviously extreme comments and rhetoric of Mark Robinson. Now, I'll just say one quick point. Where he stands today is not a surprise to the point you made, Anderson. I mean, we polled this race, my firm polled this race about a year ago for a different client. He was down a couple of points already. Earlier this year, he was already down by five and that's because of some of the controversial comments that the Stein campaign has been playing for the better part of a year now.",

I've worked a few Senate races there and spoke to more than one North Carolina current elected official and a former elected official today. And I'm reminded of being in North Carolina in Chapel Hill and Raleigh, North Carolina, the day of and the day after the Access Hollywood tape came out.Big difference though, we've had a lot of these little Access Hollywood tapes from Mark Robinson and Mark Robinson isn't Donald Trump. Matt is right, he was probably toast before today. Now, he's just a bigger piece of toast. The problem is that this isn't about the governor's race. That race is over. Josh Stein will win. The question is does this affect up ballot? And I think potentially it does. And I know for a fact that the Trump campaign is and has been worried that it does because not just these comments that distract Donald Trump, he obviously makes some weird comments from time to time as well. But also this campaign has no money. It has no ground game. It can't drive out their own voters. They're not all rowing in the same direction and that's a real problem for Trump. And I've heard this on the ground, not just for the past day or a few weeks. I've heard this months and months ago that they were worried about what would happen when the Robinson comments came out. They were worried about what effect it might have if Donald Trump were to cut Mark Robinson loose and you can certainly understand why Trump wants to win. He cares about his own winning first and foremost, no surprise. So that's where Republicans have put themselves in and ultimately, yes, this is a making of Donald Trump because he endorsed him. Donald Trump's endorsement doesn't determine who the nominee is, but it sure helps and, this is another example, Anderson, and I'll wrap up. I'll shut up here in a second. This is another example of Republicans taking their own fists and saying stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself. We saw this in the Pennsylvania governor's race. We saw it in the Maryland governor's race. This cycle, last cycle, the cycle before, these kinds of candidates sink Republicans.",

He said get them down to zero, this is the guy who said he wanted to restrict birth control for women and girls. And this is a guy who said he wanted to unwind the Medicaid expansion, which affects hundreds of thousands of people in North Carolina who have healthcare because of this.

It would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border.Let me tell you, those border agents are working around the clock. It would have just been about giving them some support and relief. Which is probably why the border agents actually endorsed the bill. It would have allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl. And I'm looking at people from all over the country here, so I don't need to tell the folks who are watching this what fentanyl has done to families, to kids in our country and the need to take seriously stemming the flow coming into our country and addressing that extraordinary and tragic issue in terms of its effect. The bill would have allowed us to have more resources to prosecute transnational criminal organizations.  And it would have been part of the solution.

But I think what was also important about this event tonight is they partnered with win with black women. They of course are an organizing force in this country. They had that zoom call several weeks ago when it was announced that the vice president would be the candidate. More than 90,000 women tuned into that call. They raised $1.5 million in just about three hours. And black women are just going to play such an important role in this election. So many democratic women have often said that they don't feel as though that they are invested in when it comes to them being candidates. Well, now the top of the ticket is a black woman.

We saw that yes, she was. And then the next question was, was she going to be able to extend that gap? And we haven't seen that that has happened. We haven't seen that she's taken a five, six-point national leader in these state polls, as Harry pointed out. And so that means that with seven weeks left, the key is getting people to vote. And so when she makes those comments to that group of people, they're in that room saying, hey, it's up to you. The obvious point here is we need you to go vote. And that's what it is.

And now if you take an average of polls, her net favorability rating is actually positive. It's because of events like tonight. The only other thing I'll mention, you know, Eva was mentioning black women. One of the more interesting sort of nuggets that we've seen in the crosstabs, we've seen in Pennsylvania, is Kamala Harris has certainly improved upon her standing with black voters overall versus what Joe Biden was doing early on in this year, but she is still falling short of Biden's benchmark in 2020.

You know, I think, to Jamal's point, this is an era in which not only are people getting their news through social media and through sort of these fragmented channels. You know, I work for a newspaper. I'm sitting on a cable news channel. I'm cognizant of the reality of the world. But that said, it is also a reality that a lot of people are sort of isolated in their own spheres of conversation, right? Particularly on the right. I think it is a more dramatic problem on the right.I think when you have Trump doing these things and doing these odd little podcasts and things like that, part of it is about him being comfortable in that space. Part of it is, to the point I was making earlier, that it's about engaging people and turning people out to vote. That it's about ensuring that his folks are motivated and energized in the same way that we're seeing Kamala Harris do that tonight. I think that's a central issue. And quite frankly, the people, if you are the Harris campaign and you are trying to get your voters to come out to vote in November, it is better to do something that's going to go viral on social media with Oprah Winfrey than it is to have a piece in the Washington Post. No offense to the Washington Post.",
