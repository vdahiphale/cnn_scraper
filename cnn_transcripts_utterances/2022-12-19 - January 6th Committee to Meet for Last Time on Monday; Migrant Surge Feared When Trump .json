A source tells CNN that they are expected to refer former President Donald Trump to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution on at least three charges. Those include insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government.Now, these referrals don't necessarily carry a ton weight with the Justice Department. DOJ does not take its cue from lawmakers on who is going to bring criminal charges against and who it is going to prosecute. But lawmakers have said they think that this is important for the historical record. Also, in talking to some of them, they believe that they found evidence of criminal wrong doing and it's part of their duty to lay that evidence out and lay these referrals out the Department of Justice. Now all of this comes as a sort of politically and legally perilous time for former President Trump. You know, we know he's already under DOJ scrutiny for activities around January 6, efforts to subvert the 2020 election. We're also learning from sources familiar with the matter, that a special grand jury that has been investigating Donald Trump and his allies in a criminal investigation there is set to wrap up its work. It will be up to the district attorney there to decide whether he's going to bring charges against Donald Trump or his of his allies. Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Activists and politicians alike are warning of a looming humanitarian crisis on the U.S. southern border. A Trump era policy known as Title 42 is expected to end on Wednesday.

It's been constant group of 20, 30 people are taking several times an hour. We see the border patrol dealing with them here at the border to be taken into El Paso where now the mayor has declared a state of emergency. Arguing that the number of people crossing over is more than the city can handle. And he fears that come Wednesday the number is going to be much greater and the situation could get out of control. On the Mexican side, city and state authorities in the state of Chihuahua are telling me that the migrant situation is not different for them. Yes, there are more than in other times, but their main concern is what's going to happen if more border agents are having to be moved to deal with the surge of migrants and abandon or not do their daily duties at the crossing -- at the legal crossing points, creating a longer waiting time for the people who want to go and spend their money, spend Christmas with their relatives in El Paso or in other parts of the United States. This is high season for crossings in this area. And on the Mexican side, that is the main concern. Gustavo Valdes, CNN, Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And really every trip that he takes overseas should be closely watched.But Belarus is of course, a very close ally of Russia. They've been very supportive of this war as Russia has becoming increasingly isolated. And some of the original invasion was actually launched from Belarusian soil. It's the closest land route to Kyiv. And of course, we know that Ukrainian officials are increasingly concerned that this relentless aerial bombardment that we've seen from Russia could proceed a new ground offensive. Now, we don't know. There's no indication yet that Belarus would join the fight. They haven't yet. There's no sense of mobilization there. But they did conduct snap drills last week. There is a new grouping of Russian forces on Belarusian soil. They have new images published by state media this morning showing them conducting exercises. So, there are various things that are sort of raising concerns, but perhaps it's also that Russia just wants to keep Ukraine focused on a potential threat from this northern border.
