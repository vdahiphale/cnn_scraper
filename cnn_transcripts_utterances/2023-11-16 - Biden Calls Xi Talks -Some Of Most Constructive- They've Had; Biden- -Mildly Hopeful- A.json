And both of these countries -- both of these presidents came out saying that they are going to take efforts to curb fentanyl production. And that's a really big deal just considering how Republicans had been openly criticizing Biden and saying that he's not doing enough to curb and mitigate the flow of fentanyl coming into the country and being produced in the U.S. And so that's a really big deal. And especially, seeing the steps that they've taken to open up proper channels of communication when it comes to military operations just really emphasizes what Biden was trying to achieve, and that was to diffuse the tension between these two countries that have been heightened in the last few months.",

Obviously, he said that the Qataris have been very helpful in that -- in that effort. He has also said that he's been deeply involved himself. And he went on to say later on that five or six times a day he is working to try to be helpful in actually securing the release of those hostages.He didn't really give us a lot of detail though on where things are at. You heard him mention the Israelis agreeing to a pause but then he kind of cut himself short there. We have heard in recent days from U.S. and European officials that there is at least some level of optimism about getting a deal done. The broad parameters would be that Hamas would release a number of prisoners, primarily women and children, in exchange for a pause -- a prolonged pause in the fighting -- perhaps as long as five days. Hamas has also quoted the number of prisoners it's willing to release at 70. And during the course of that pause in fighting those 70 would be released -- or whatever the number is -- in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisoner -- prisons as well. Part of what's slowing this down, of course, is the indirect nature of all this -- communication -- the difficulties with communicating with Gaza as well. But there is some level of optimism at this stage. Kasie, the president also mentioned during that same press conference that it is fact that Hamas has a command center underneath of the Al Shifa hospital. Perhaps he knows something that we don't know but there is no publicly available evidence at this stage to suggest that is, in fact, true. The IDF has put out a video yesterday showing what it said was weapons inside of the hospital itself. But there is no evidence thus far that there is a complex, sophisticated tunnel network underneath that hospital that serves as a Hamas command and control center -- Kasie.",

Thanks very much for your reporting.And for more on the hostages and the situation at Al Shifa hospital, let's bring in CNN global affairs analyst, Kim Dozier. Kim, good morning. Let's talk about these hostage negotiations. I kind of -- I want to dig in on that and questions around whether and how what's going on at the hospital plays into them. I mean, this has been something -- it's bubbled up. It's receded. It's come back again throughout the 30-plus days of this conflict. What do you see in how leaders are talking about this that tells us more about where it might stand? KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I'm also hearing from my sources that there is a deal that's done for the swap of several dozen women and children from -- who are being held hostages, and those in Israeli jails being held in Israeli prisons. But the deal getting executed is dependent on Israel being at a state where it is willing to pause military operations. You can see from the Israeli Defense Force's perspective and the government's perspective there that perhaps they thought after proving to the world that Shifa hospital was, as they'd said, a center for Hamas operations that then they would pacify critics at home who want them to press forward with the war and say this three-day pause is worthwhile and we're going to get something out of it and hey, we just have this huge victory. But at this point, since they've only found a handful of weapons -- maybe a few dozen that they've shown the media, which could be dismissed as personal weapons from patients who were brought to the hospital, that's not the evidence that they need to then feel that they can rest on their laurels for a few days and allow a pause in fighting and an exchange in hostages and prisoners.",

It means that Congress is going to again have to avert a partial shutdown by mid-February, by mid- January, and another partial shutdown by the beginning of January. And as we saw that was a heavy lift back in September, and again this week, it's going to be an even heavier lift in January and February for a couple of reasons. A, Speaker Johnson has said that he's done with continuing resolutions. He said he's not going to do any more short-term funding bills, which is really going to put pressure on lawmakers to finish their work with these 12 appropriations bills -- these single-subject appropriations bills -- which I'll note, at least in the House, have come under a lot of controversy.
