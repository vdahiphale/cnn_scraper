It's a sign of the growing despair as the very few aid trucks continue to trickle in, very few. It's nowhere near meeting the need of the more than two million people trapped there right now, more than half of them children. CNN's Melissa Bell is joining us from Cairo right now. She's covering the humanitarian crisis that's unfolding. But I want to start with CNN's Nic Robertson, who's joining us from Sderot in Israel, not far from Gaza. Nic, as we wait for Prime Minister Netanyahu to take the podium, I want to start with the breaking news we're following, that a female Israeli soldier has just been released in Gaza.

Now, the IDF is saying that she was released during a ground operation, that she has been taken and given medical checks and appears to be fine. In fact, she's met with her family, again, quite remarkable. So, this seems to indicate that the IDF -- I say indicate because the IDF's not saying -- that they will likely have had active, timely intelligence about where she was. Of course, they may have part of their operations, they're now -- because they're now on the ground in Gaza, that they may have stumbled across her. But the fact that she is released, has had medical checks and is with her family is quite a stunning turn of development. It's the first time that the IDF has been able to release any of the hostages, and this is one of their own. And this must give some comfort and some hope to all those other families who are waiting for news about their loved ones, Wolf.",

Again, we don't know if she's speaking under duress, but she makes it clear that they -- that they have been held since October the 7th. She clearly identifies that. She also says -- and this will be information that apparently she will have been told by her captors -- that there was supposed to be a cease-fire. And she's been told, because she says this, that the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, didn't go along with the cease-fire, and that's why they're still hostages. She becomes very determined in her delivery, telling the prime minister that he and his government is responsible for security failings and the fact that they were taken hostage, that there wasn't a speedy enough military response. So, again, you begin to get the picture that this is the sort of language that Hamas wants to spread, and this unfortunate hostage may not have a great deal of choice about what she's saying. But she closes with an incredibly emotional appeal, essentially:  Help free us. Don't allow us to be killed.",

That is up from the 118 trucks that we saw earlier today. But, look, we're hearing also there are a couple dozen extra waiting for inspection. Even, if by the end of today or tomorrow, we get towards 200 trucks or just above, that will be all that's gone through since the start of this conflict. Bear in mind, Wolf, that the U.N. estimates you need 100 trucks a day minimum to meet the very basic needs of the population. We have just been speaking to the World Food Program. They say that, even before this war began, 80 percent of Gazans were dependent on some kind of food aid. And, at the time, there could be up to 400 trucks a day that went in. So it gives you an idea of how little there is now for people to survive on. And I think what you mentioned a moment ago, those images we have seen over the course of the last few days of U.N. warehouses being swarmed by desperate civilians in search of those most basic supplies speaks to that. The World Food Program says their very own staff now is sheltering in some of those parts of Southern and Central Gaza, people unable to get water, unable to get food, unable to get to toilets, the hygiene situation extremely concerning. And it is really only a cease-fire that would allow the kind of change in the amount of trucks going through that would allow that to change. The problem is, the bottleneck at the Rafah Or crossing is very unlikely to get any better as long as the fighting continues, Wolf.",
