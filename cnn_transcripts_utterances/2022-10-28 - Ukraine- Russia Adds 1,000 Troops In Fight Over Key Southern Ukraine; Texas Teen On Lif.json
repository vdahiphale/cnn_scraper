Russia is adding a thousand additional troops to the fight -- to the frontlines trying to hold on to the strategic southern city of Kherson against Ukraine's ongoing and successful counter-offensive. CNN's Nic Robertson is live in Kyiv for us at this hour for the very latest. Nic, what are these additional troops mean?",

      "sentences": "They mean that it will be harder -- a harder fight for the Ukrainian forces moving into Kherson. It depends on how well-equipped and how well-trained they are. We know that President Putin today met with his defense chief Sergei Shoigu. Shoigu said that they had now trained 81,000 troops and 41,000 of those have been moved forward to units in Ukraine. So the implication is that Russia has more troops that it can send to -- into this fight. Russia officials from Kherson say that they've now evacuated all the civilians.And the way that all this is being interpreted by Ukrainian officials responsible for the Kherson region, they're saying now that the civilians are pushed out, this gives the Russians the opportunity to put all these new recruits into civilian homes inside Kherson. Why is that important to Russia? Well, I think we got a big clue on that today from one of President Putin's big military backers, the Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov talking about how he lost 23 fighters killed in one incident, 58 injured in Kherson. It tends to create the impression that there was one large incident explosion potentially at a barracks or type of place where the troops were collected. So clearly, a dispersal around the city in civilian homes of new Russian troops makes an attack harder.",

And we've asked -- we actually tried to stop, not ask that anymore because there's just no determining. Just as Tuesday, we weren't expecting that to happen. You know, he had developed that and no one saw it developing. And before you know it, here we are in emergency surgery later -- on hours later, you know, to help curate that. And after that, he gets out of surgery, and it just goes downhill from there. His body goes into septic shock. And here we are trying to control his blood pressure and keep it from going too low and then going too high and it's just -- it's a battle every day. This kid is amazing and he's super strong.

However, whenever he does try to communicate by sign language or by whispering, it's unfortunate, but he's reliving and he -- the moment that he keeps on and he cannot get out of is the incident itself.

But you know, my son is not a problem child. I mean, he's a regular teenager, and you know, regular teenage -- doing regular teenage stuff, like, eat in the parking lot with his girlfriend.He's not capable of doing that. His intent was not to do that night. Unlike the intent of the officer that had those capabilities that he built into his head before he even pulled on that door handle. Those were his intents. We didn't have no intent that way. He didn't have no. He -- the video shows he clearly did not have that intent. He was scared, he was fine, and he moved. Unfortunately, he did. But you know this gentleman decided to act like he was in Wild Wild West hunting down Billy the Kid. And here we are, and where is he? He's out there living his life taking care of his son. He can hold his son. We couldn't even see our son for three days because of the privilege she has. And that's where we feel we are today. And unfortunately, we can't let this get swept under the rug.

The leaked audio, you'll remember, was released earlier this month by the LA Times. That scandal has already forced out the former city council president, but two other council members involved in that conversation refusing to resign. And a recall effort has now been launched by some constituents.Joining me now is LZ Granderson. He's a columnist for those -- for the Los Angeles Times. It's good to see you, LZ.

You know, the city went through a really ugly period during the 1990s in particular, when there was hostility between the black community and Latinos, largely because of gang culture, stemming out of prison. And the leaders -- the grassroots leaders in Los Angeles worked together to get over that hump. And so to have this tape leak is really reminding us of those terrible times during the 1990s. It was heartbreaking.",

And so the emotions that you're seeing interrupting the city council meetings, the emotion that you're seeing in the streets, and as you mentioned earlier, that we heard from constituents during the town hall meeting last week, people are very upset because it's an affront for everything that the city stands for.And I've been writing about this conversation because it's my feelings that the dynamics of these other races meeting that held, in other words, an effort to get Latinos to have more political power in large cities like New York or like Los Angeles or Chicago, these are issues that are going -- are going away anytime soon. And so we've got to figure out, Kate, how we are able to bring in a larger voice from the Latino community when it comes to both municipal as well as national politics without it meaning black eraser, without it many other minority groups have to lose power in the process.",

We talked a lot about that. But we -- you explore in this. What you explore is that this didn't start with Ron DeSantis -- Ron DeSantis's - his efforts in Florida. This started in Texas years prior.

Wade started off, Kate, as an experiment in a small town in Texas. And it continued to grow in Texas and then it picked up around the nation and now here we are in this conversation.And so when you look at the police -- the voter fraud police, which we all know was created based upon lies from the former president, it started in a small town in Texas. And now people are talking more and more. You mentioned Florida, but it also had been talked about in Arizona, has been talked about in Georgia. It's beginning to pick up in a very similar way that the anti-abortion legislation picked up in a small town in Texas. And so I wrote a piece because I wanted to draw attention to this. [11:55:02] Because if you really look at the rate that the election that police that they use in Texas and in Florida, it feels nefarious, and we need to address it now before it becomes much larger and interrupts elections on a larger scale.",
