      "sentences": "Thank you for joining us and welcome to our coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. I'm Julia Chatterley in New York.It's Monday morning in Gaza where Israeli forces are pressing into the Palestinian enclave. CNN has also seen evidence of Israeli ground forces more than two miles inside Gaza in the north. This video of airstrikes was taken just hours ago by CNN producer in Khan Yunis in the south of Gaza. Israel also says it killed several Hamas fighters who emerged from a tunnel near Gaza's Erez crossing. Meanwhile, there are growing cries in the international community for Israel to do more to protect Gaza's civilians. The Palestinian Red Crescent says Israeli airstrikes are causing damage to the Al-Quds Hospital, one of the biggest in Gaza City. Israel is told that the Red Crescent to evacuate the facility and as warned, Hamas fighters are hiding in and around the hospital. Israel is warned of a long, difficult conflict to take out Hamas and ensure its security in response to the brutal October 7th terrorist attack. But Israel's stepped up military campaign is also having devastating consequences on the ground. CNN Scott McLean has the latest on the increasingly desperate situation inside Gaza.

People inside the neighboring apartment blocks weren't spared either. Roofs were ripped right off. Everything now covered in a pale shade of gray. More than a dozen were killed and more injured according to medical staff at the local hospital where outside the bodies of those killed are wrapped in white sheets and marked with their names.Both the IDF and the Israeli Prime Minister have renewed calls for civilians to urgently evacuate Northern Gaza. The apartment buildings next to the mosque were filled with people who had heeded those warnings, believing central Gaza would be safer. There were no warnings at all, this survivor says. We have seen the entire thing collapsing on us. We didn't know exactly where the hit was. We started running to get our children out. It's a miracle they survived. This man said, there were no warnings. It was a strong airstrike. The people pulled us from underneath the rubble and took us to the hospital. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Israel said that, overnight, some 450 terror targets were hit and say that some strikes were directed by troops now on the ground inside Gaza. This was the aftermath of one of those strikes on a family home in Khan Yunis in Southern Gaza. A desperate scramble to move slabs of concrete hoping to find survivors. Instead, they found at least one body. By daybreak, the urgency has gone. A pile of rubble is all that's left. Hospitals already at the breaking point are only getting more overwhelmed. In (INAUDIBLE) Saturday, doctors operated on this boy on the floor. The Palestinian Red Crescent now says that Israeli authorities called Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City twice with a clear and direct threat that the hospital must be evacuated at once. Otherwise, the Red Crescent holds full responsibility for the lives of everyone inside. That amounts to hundreds of patients and thousands more people taking shelter. Israel says it called more than twice since the war began and says the Hamas is shielding themselves inside hospitals. Foreign aid is entering Gaza at a trickle. The desperation apparent in this video of people ransacking a U.N. warehouse carrying out bags of food. Maybe a temporary lifeline for those people but the U.N. calls it a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down. It's a situation in Gaza only gets worse. Scott McLean, CNN, London.

It's understandable in many ways the World Food Program has also seen the same. Have you seen any risks to your supplies too? And I guess you're not surprised by what we're seeing. COURTOIS: No, absolutely. This is really a drop in the ocean of needs. Before the escalation on the violence, we used to see 600 trucks entering Gaza every day. So you can imagine 20 trucks or even six trucks a day as -- is a good gesture, but it's definitely not nowhere near matching the scale of needs of the people. And people are just simply desperate. It's even an understatement at this stage. They are looking for water to drink, to give to their children food, medicine, doctors operating without painkillers on patients with their flashlights. You can imagine how desperate the situation is. And what can also bring people to do to get those basics to their families while they try to survive at all costs.",

There's another one.And the sort of the tempo, the battle tempo, if you will, is not as intense tonight or through the day, actually, as it was over the previous 48 hours Friday and Saturday. So it does seem to have eased off. But that said, there's been a lot of fighter jet activity this evening. We've seen explosions behind us in Gaza, heard the detonations. We've seen Apache gunships in the sky today and heard gunfire apparently coming from them joining the fight on the ground. Now, that place that the IDF has now raised a flag over a building in Northern Gaza is about two miles from the border with Israel, two miles from the fence. Interestingly, when you look at where that on the map, where that flag was raised, it's sort of in a beach area. And it -- and it appears as if the IDF, so far, at least, from what we can see, have avoided concentrations of civilians. They haven't gone in, it seems as yet, to some of the small villages or smaller towns or even the larger cities like Gaza City. There's still several miles away from -- away from -- away from there. And I think there's a lot of pressure, international pressure, as your last guest was just talking about there on Israel to avoid civilian casualties. It is the President of the United States, Joe Biden, spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today and talked about the importance of avoiding civilian casualties. And this slow, step-by-step process of the incursion that Israel is going through at the moment. We don't know how far it's going to go. We don't know what the next steps are or even what these steps are specifically designed to achieve. But so far, it seems that the ground troops are avoiding major confrontation or conflict with the civilian population. Of course, the death toll of civilians we've seen through the day in Gaza has gone up. Say the children are calling for a ceasefire, the U.N. agency that handles humanitarian relief from refugees inside Gaza's warehouse was looted yesterday, food looted by people, and saying there's a breakdown in the fabric of civil society at the moment in Gaza. So all these concerns raised. But it does feel to us today as if the tempo of the advance over the past few days has slowed down a little bit, Julia.",

We should not have to be, nor should my parents be confronted with that horrific prospect in such an undignified and inhumane way. This is the only home we've ever known. My father is 80 years old. He is older than the state of Israel. We predate the British mandate. We predate the Israeli state. We've been there all along. So we're not knowing anywhere. And quite frankly, the question that should be asked is, how do we remove the circumstances that are leading reporters asking us, why can't your people leave? Why should we? This is our home.",

Indiscriminate, without distinction, without regards for laws and regulations, without regards for humanity, without regards for anything that, you know, with a full prediction to all sorts of people in the Gaza Strip. We've seen ambulances being destroyed. We've seen paramedics being killed. We've seen babies and women being killed. We've seen U.N. workers being killed. We've seen schools being attacked.

The reality of the matter, it was all preventable. I think this is the greatest tragedy of it all, besides the loss of human life. It was preventable. Had the State of Israel been held accountable for all its violations, we wouldn't be here. Had the State of Israel lifted the siege on the Gaza Strip, we wouldn't be here. Yet, here we are. We have been talking to the world for decades about our suffering and about the violations that are being inflicted against us. And now we see what has happened. We have warned people that the Gaza Strip is a pressure cooker that will blow up, not because we wanted it, but because this is the natural course of things that happen once, you know, you impose a blockade of that nature and expect them to point to many people that have been suffering. Dorgham, your voice is an important one, and more talking and less violence, I think, is some form of way of progressing from this awful moment.

There's no food. There's nothing. What do you have? Food and water and some toilet paper and some dishes.
