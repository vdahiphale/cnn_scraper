You write in a new piece out today: \"Treating climate change as a national security problem is not a liberal position, but a hardheaded, realist one.\" Where do you think the government is, the U.S. government is, about taking this threat seriously enough as a national security priority?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think you had Lloyd Austin is saying it is existential.And the Pentagon actually for many years has actually focused on climate change as a national security issue, for two big reasons. One, the U.S. Navy, one of its most important ports is in Norfolk, Virginia, very much affected by climate change and rising waters. The U.S. Navy's SEALs are in Virginia Beach, also very much affected by climate change and rising waters. So they have to plan for a contingency where they can still operate these ports, even though the water is rising significantly. Secondly, the Pentagon is aware that a lot of crises are amplified by climate change. So the big -- the most lethal war in the going on in the world right now is not -- very undercovered -- is in Sudan, where you have got millions of people displaced by climate change and the conflict simultaneously. So it kind of complicates the conflicts that exist. And there's a school of thought that the civil war in Syria began with a drought, which then sort of prompted people to rise up against Assad. So the Pentagon is definitely treating this issue seriously. I was arguing in the piece that we should all sort of think it -- when we think about security, it's not just freedom from attack. It's, are we able to live our lives in a way that it isn't interfered with by a pandemic? The pandemic, the COVID pandemic, killed 1.2 million people. That's more than every American who died in every war since the American Revolution. That -- to me, so pandemics and climate change are, I think, national security issues.",

And the reason we have Social Security is because he thought it was important for people to live in their older years with some security. He had a more holistic view of national security. Once the Cold War happened, it got more narrow-focused. It was a threat from the Soviets. And then, of course, 9/11 happened. It was a threat from terrorists. But I think we can all agree that, if people aren't secure from pandemics, floods, they're not really secure.",

And then pivoting, he was moment -- just moments ago talking about theauto industry, about manufacturing, and what the Harris/Walz administration would offer on that front. So, he spent some time there, as you heard, attacking the former president for his remarks, but then pivoting to what the campaign would do, perhaps as expected. But it is this type of appeal that the campaign saw in Walz that he brings to the ticket and that they are trying to lean in on again in this final stretch, so he can pull from his own roots to talk about this candidly. And you heard that there when he was discussing manufacturing and the Midwest, as someone who knows the region, who knows about this industry. Now, of course, Tim Walz is in Michigan. Michigan is a state that former -- or President Biden won narrowly in 2020. It is one that the campaign is keeping a very close eye on, one, of course, where the polls have, like many other of these battleground states, been quite deadlocked. So him delivering these remarks in this battleground state was important. I will also note, Pam, that the vice president will be heading to Detroit next week as well. So we will keep eyes to see if she also responds to what former President Donald Trump said this week.",

It's actually the first time that the counterparts have met and this latest sign of a warming relationship between the two countries. And it comes as the crisis builds in the Middle East. Much of the world is waiting right now for Israel's response to Iran's barrage of nearly 200 missiles last week. Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed retaliation, adding to fears that Israel's offensive against Iran- backed groups could lead to a wider war in the region. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. He also served in the Marine Corps. Congressman, thanks for coming on. So let's begin with a meeting of Israel's security cabinet to consider how best to retaliate against Iran. A source tells CNN that the gap separating the U.S. and Israeli positions is closing. Do you believe that could be critical in preventing a regional war? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA):  Before we talk about the tactics, I do think it's helpful to level-set on the objectives, because objectives are upstream of both strategy and tactics in warfare. What are Israel's objectives here? I think they're threefold. One, they want to get the hostages home from Gaza. Two, they want to demilitarize both their southern and northern border areas, because both Hamas and Hezbollah have been launching rockets and precision- guided ammunitions into Israeli population centers for years. And then, three, they want peace with their Arab neighbors. The Abraham Accords was an important start, but they want to extend it into Saudi Arabia and beyond. Now let's compare that to what Iran wants. Iran wants to destroy Israel. There's no positive agenda. There's no benefit, betterment for the Iranian people. It's just simply a genocidal agenda. And because of that asymmetry in the two countries' agendas, Israel needs to be able to strike back at Iran when it senses vulnerability and liability to prevent Iran from acquiring the means to destroy Israel. Now, the time, place and manner for those strikes, I think, should be maintained as a closely held state secret. You don't want to signal what you're going to do to your enemy. But, certainly, Israel has the right and the responsibility to hit back.",

I want to go to this copy of the Bob -- that CNN obtained of Bob Woodward's book \"War.\" And ahead of its release, we obtained it. President Biden, in the book, privately referred to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as a \"son of a B,\" calling the Israeli prime minister \"a bad effing guy.\" Netanyahu has consistently ignored Biden's calls for restraint.

And as you said, they're legally bound. Local stations have to carry political ads, even ones they believe are false or disgusting. I will give an example from earlier this week. ABC's \"The View\" had to run a commercial paid for by a fringe presidential candidate. It's an anti-abortion ad that compares the hosts of \"The View\" to Nazis. It also attacks some of our colleagues here at CNN. CNN came out and called the ad deplorable and antisemitic. But the point is that ABC had to run the political ad. That's the law. So it is so striking that the Florida Department of Health was trying to violate essentially that law. And that's why the FCC commissioner, the person who actually oversees government licensing of stations, came out and said the Florida proposal, the Florida letter, the legal threat is against the First Amendment, Pamela.",
