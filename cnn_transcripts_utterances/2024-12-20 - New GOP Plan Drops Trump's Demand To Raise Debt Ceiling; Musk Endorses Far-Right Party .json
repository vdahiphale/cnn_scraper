And that one thing is not invest in our schools or upgrade our nation's infrastructure. It's to pass along a brand new tax cut to billionaires and corporations.

Trump seemed to be on board with the bill, but then when Musk opposed it, Trump followed suit. So that to me is a pretty clear story. The people you have to negotiate with if you are Republican leadership in the House or the Senate is not the incoming president of the United States, it's his billionaire overlords that were not elected and are frankly working with Trump because they want to protect their own interests. Why did Elon Musk not oppose the defense bill, which has loaded with lots and lots of spending, but oppose the continuing resolution? Maybe because his bread is buttered in the defense bill. That's where there are programs that help his businesses and pad his profits. So you have billionaires right now that seem to be in charge of Trump's policy and Trump's positions that are conflicted.",

And I'll just read a quote from it. \"Mr. Biden has absented himself from the debate convulsing the country. After warning again and again that Mr. Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy, he has now gone silent on the matter.At times, Mr. Biden bristles at the constraints. Before the election, when he had been regulated to the sidelines of the campaign, the President told an ally that he was bored and asked if there were any events for him to attend, a comment that seemed only particularly facetious.\" ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: This is the point, particularly that first point, is what Democrats and allies of this White House behind closed doors are expressing concern and frustration of. And that being that after years of warning that the president- elect, that Trump was a threat to democracy, that now it appears that you have a president that is almost leaving the stage before the final curtain call. The fact that we haven't heard much from him, even though the president-elect that's coming into office has threatened to prosecute his political opponents, has, you know, signaled many of the things that Biden warned about during the campaign. We still haven't heard from him address, really, a constituency base and voters that believed him and did vote for him in large numbers. I traveled with him through Latin America, kind of the finale of his finale on the global stage, through Latin America as well to Angola. He answered only two shouted questions that combined 14 words to reporters, including about Trump. The other point that we found is also just his condition and his fitness. We have to remind people that for years, the President and his allies said, I am the best person to defeat Donald Trump. And that resulted in a tight campaign schedule as well for Vice President Harris. The President did seem exhausted on these trips. And, yes, anyone would, but we're talking about someone who said that he had the ability to serve for another four years. And what we found was somebody that just appeared exhausted at the table with fellow global leaders, at one point putting his head into his hand, closing his eyes briefly. Somebody that I was told as well, you know, just at one point at a slave museum in Angola, you know, they basically did planning where he would give a speech and leave because he didn't have the ability to get up a steep flight of stairs as well. And then we also sought to just get into his mindset as well. This is a president that is moody as well, was frustrated for being sidelined during the campaign, you know, and also is frustrated at some fellow Democrats that have continued to heighten criticism against him for his decision to stay in the race and also for the decision to pardon his son as well.",

Barack Obama, the Health Care Act, of course, which Joe Biden once famously called a big f-ing deal, was viewed more favorably now.But we will see. I mean, what -- the biggest question here is the reason that Joe Biden came back from private life or -- from private life into public life was to stop Donald Trump. And he's taking his leave with Donald Trump coming back to the White House. So I'm not sure how history will view the Biden presidency, but I think that is what he's hoping for, that it'll look better in the long run.",

That's what happened earlier this week, of course, when Elon Musk took to the social media platform that he owns to torpedo the Republican backed spending bill.And this is just the latest in a very series of glaring examples of how information is spread. Axios put it this way this morning, quote, \"This reality highlights the difference between media, what people consume and reporting a set of standards for pursuing fact-based information. In the new world order, media and reporting are tossed together with a mix of truth, opinion and nonsense\". Joining me now to explore this is CNN Chief Media Analyst Brian Stelter.

So when Elon Musk says, hey, you're the media now, he's not saying something new or novel, he's saying something that's self-evidently true. We all have social media accounts. We all have phones. We're all members of the media.The concept of citizen journalism has been around for years. But I think what Axios is pointing out that's really important is the distinction between reporting and talking, right? Someone like Elon Musk is doing a lot of talking. And in the case of Musk, in particular, he seems to believe whatever scrolls past him on his phone. That's why he sometimes shares misinformation, including about the spending bill situation. So there's a lot of talking out there, a lot of noise, sometimes nonsense, a lot less reporting. I think it was valuable for Axios to make that distinction. You know, if you ask me what's been the biggest change in our society during our careers, it's been the flattening of information. Everything looks the same now, a well-researched paper by a professor versus some random person's point of view. And in some ways, that's a beautiful thing. And people like Elon Musk have benefited from it. All of us have benefited from the flattening of information. But it's also caused a lot of information pollution and confusion.
