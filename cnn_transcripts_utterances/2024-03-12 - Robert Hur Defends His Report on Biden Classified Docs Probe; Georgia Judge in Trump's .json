      "sentences": "Thanks so much, Anderson.There's something that Democrats have been talking about for weeks now, really, that I want to clear up, and there are really two parts of it. Let me start by saying, obviously, the loss of Biden was a horrible loss for anybody who knew him. I knew him. It's very sad. He was a really good guy, a great father, a great husband, and his loss is a tragedy. That said, his loss has been used by people defending President Biden as a cudgel against a special counsel. So let's just talk about how this actually comes up. On page 82 of this interview, they're talking about where documents were kept. The special counsel is trying to find out where documents were kept. President Biden says he starts trying to figure out when this was. He says, this is what, 2017, 2018, that area? Mr. Hur says, yes. President Biden says, remember, in this time frame, my son has either been deployed or is dying. And so it was. And by the way, there were still a lot of people at the time when I got into the Senate. They were encouraging me to run for president, et cetera, et cetera. And then he goes he goes on a little bit. And then he says, what month did Beau die? Oh, God. May 30th. And then somebody says 2015. Somebody else is 2015. President Biden says, was it 2015 he had died? Somebody else says it was May of 2015. President Biden says it was 2015. His lawyer says, or I'm not sure the month, sir, but I think that was the year. All right. Now, look, losing a son is -- losing a child is unfair. It's horrible. And here he is being asked about all sorts of dates thrown about 2015, 2009, 2020, whatever. But it is true that for a moment there, he seems confused about the year that his beloved son, Beau, died. Now, Robert Hur didn't bring it up, despite what we've heard from Democratic members of Congress. Robert Hur was trying to find a date. Joe Biden has that as a point of reference. He's trying to figure out the times he brings this up. He seems unsure of the year. And that's where this all happens. So that's point one. Point two, Paula, let me ask you. If Robert Hur had not mentioned this in his report, had not mentioned the fact that Joe Biden at one point seemed confused about what year his son had died. If he'd not mentioned that. And this transcript came out today, clearly suggesting that Joe Biden at one point -- and people get confused. I understand. But at one point he seems confused about what year his son died in. Robert Hur would have been ferociously attacked for covering it up.",

But it is the context. In some ways, the most -- some of the most important things that happened in this hearing today were parts when Democrats pointed out things that were not in the special counsel's report but were in the transcript. I'll just give you one example. When Democrats said Eric Swalwell pointed out at some point along the way, Robert Hur actually praised Joe Biden's photographic understanding. That was Hur's word, photographic reconstruction of the geography of the Naval Observatory. Americans didn't get that from the special counsel.",

And that's why it was also so hurtful for the president. When you go back and look at the transcript, that's exactly what a lot of Democrats, frankly, mentioned it today as well. And the fact that this prosecutor, special prosecutor, special counsel talked about how he also looked at how President Biden recalled several events from way years back, talked about the details of those, praised him for having a photographic memory. So then Democrats continue to go back. And why -- why was there the need to talk about him in that way in the final report?",

He's on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.He was going back and forth between D.C. and Delaware on an Amtrak. This was literally a delineating time I would imagine his life. Saying, did this occur when you were the sitting vice president living in the Naval Observatory? Or was it when you're in a new house and you didn't have a job? It's a very big defining line. So the defense that, well, maybe he was just missing up the dates and he was trying to get around it. These are some very key moments to think about the context around it. And I just point out one other thing. I think what this is, is the Democrats on that committee today looked pretty good when they stuck with the facts and they tried to confirm the facts. I think they actually hurt themselves when they tried to undermine the credibility of Robert Hur. You saw Adam Schiff do that, I'm sure, in part because he needs to raise a lot of money for U.S. Senate race in California after a nasty primary.

Different judges have decided that different ways in Georgia. A lot of legal analysts have said it has to be an actual conflict.

How do we get to the D.A.'s romantic life and finances? This is a conflict of interest argument. And conflicts of interest don't necessarily have to have anything to do with the allegations. In fact, ordinarily, prosecutors will acknowledge a conflict of interest, say, yes, I have some crossed wires here. I have a personal relationship. I have a financial relationship. Hence, I'm out. It's rare that you see it fully litigated in a mini trial like this. And the key issues -- and I was trying to read the tea leaves there in the judge's statement. He's being, as he should be, cagey. But the judge is going to have to decide, did Fani Willis have some sort of financial conflict here? Did the fact that she chose Nathan Wade, who she had a relationship with, there's a dispute about when. Who was in turn paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to work this case, over $600,000.

Not only is Fani Willis up for re-election, but also Scott McAfee. And it was last week that we learned McAfee had a challenger to his post there as a judge. He was interviewed about that on WSB radio. And during the course of that interview, he did mention about how this case has affected him personally. He talked about -- which you've been talking about there with the panel -- that this is going to take time. You know, it was almost as though he signaled that two weeks, the self-imposed deadline that he gave himself, wasn't going to be enough time. And there's a theory that he could potentially be writing new Georgia case law. If you remember, during those disqualifications hearings, it was talked about how a district attorney had never been disqualified in the state of Georgia over forensic misconduct. Steve Sadow, the attorney here for former President Trump, has requested that Fani Willis be disqualified in part because of forensic misconduct.

      "sentences": "Jake, this is the first Ukraine weapons package we have seen from the U.S. since December 27th.And that's because the U.S. had effectively run out of what's called replenishment funding. It had more money and more authority to give weapons to Ukraine, but it couldn't backfill it. And that is a critical part of all of this. And that's where this money came from. Effectively, over purchasing contracts and weapons bought from arms manufacturers, the U.S. was able to recoup $300 million of that money. And that is what allowed for this $300 million weapons package to be announced earlier today, according to the Pentagon and the White House. It includes critical munitions for Ukraine. The weapons we have seen play such a critical role, from 155mm artillery ammunition that Ukraine is firing at a far lower rate than Russia. Also HIMARS, that's for the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. Anti-aircraft missiles. Those are absolutely critical as Russia continues to launch aerial assaults with devastating impacts. So those are the weapons needed to keep Ukraine in this fight and make sure they can fight back against Russian forces that have had some significant advances as Ukraine has been waiting for aid.",

      "sentences": "It comes from that savings in effectively the purchase of weapons. The Pentagon estimates how much these contracts will cost, and then through negotiations with these arms manufacturers, they are here and there able to get essentially a better price on what is effectively bulk buying of weaponry.And that adds up. It adds up very slowly here, and $300 million is only a fraction of what the U.S. has sent to this point, but it has added up to this level. It gives the U.S. some replenishment money to work with, so it's able to use some of the authority it has to send money to Ukraine. And that's a critical point here. The U.S. has $4 billion in authority to send equipment to Ukraine, but it needs to be able to replenish that. And that's the money that the U.S. warned for months had run out. They were able to get back $300 million so they can send a little more aid here to Ukraine.",
