That fire is burning as we speak and it looks like we're even losing that shot, which -- oh, there, it's come back. It's obviously been very difficult and dangerous out there to cover these fires as so many thousands of people are now fleeing their homes. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is wonderful to have you with us. And we are going to continue to track that extremely dangerous and life-threatening fire that is sweeping across Southern California. There are a number of them. The fires exploding in size. They are fueled by winds that are gusting up to 100 miles an hour overnight forcing more than 30,000 people to flee from their homes. Among the evacuees, 95 senior center residents. As you can see, many of them wheelchair bound. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, good morning, Kasie.It's definitely a dire situation here in the Pacific Palisades and it's kind of surreal one as well. We are just steps away from the ocean. In fact, it is dark right now, but I can hear the waves crashing. All of this happening as we are just steps away on the other side of these raging fires as you see behind me. Now, here on the scene we've seen dozens of fire trucks just on standby hoping to contain some of this fire, but at this point it is zero contained. And as you mentioned, it's only growing in the hour that we have been here. We've actually seen some of it contained but you can see how rapidly the situation is evolving because as soon as some parts get contained other flames are flaring up as you can see on camera right now. And as you mentioned those winds -- those dangerous and life- threatening winds, as officials have called them, only fueling this fire. Now, as we know right now, this Palisades fire has been burning at five football fields a minute. Nearly 3,000 acres burned. And firefighters are not only dealing with this fire but also two other ones that have popped up overnight -- one in Hurst -- the Hurst fire north of San Fernando, and the Eaton fire in Altadena. That one has grown to 1,000 acres in a matter of hours. As you mentioned, those wind speeds reaching nearly 100 miles per hour overnight with isolated gusts across the highest elevations approaching triple digits. Now, Los Angeles has declared a state of emergency. Governor Gavin Newsom securing federal funding to help firefighters on the ground try to protect those homes and try to protect people's lives more importantly. We know that this has been ongoing since yesterday morning. Those rescue efforts have been ongoing as people have been fleeing their homes. Thousands -- tens of thousands of people leaving their homes, evacuating -- some as precaution, others under those evacuation orders. We also saw some of those cars being left on the side of the road and along the road as people are trying to leave frantically. A bulldozer even being used in some of those situations to remove those vehicles. Now, what you don't see right now is what's happening on the other side of this mountain along the roads. As we were coming here downed power lines, downed trees -- difficult to drive through. There's power outages. Thousands of people right now are without power not only here but stretching across a large area of Los Angeles County. And as we mentioned, more than 1,400 firefighters are on the scene right now trying to combat those fires. Zero percent contained. Right now the effort and the focus is on helping people get out and get -- make it to safety and try to protect those lives -- Kasie.",

Several shelters are open now for animals and also for the people that need somewhere to go. There's also the schools. Schools -- at least five schools in the Los Angeles County area have now closed. But definitely heeding those evacuation orders. We also know that hundreds of thousands of people are without power so that is just another thing that people are battling here in this area.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Well, when you have hurricane-force wind gusts fueling the flames -- (coughing) excuse me -- obviously, this is going to have rapid spread on any kind of additional fires that form within Southern California as we speak.We heard Marybel talk about wind gusts in excess of 60-70 miles per hour. Look at this. This is some of the highest wind gusts that we have experienced so far. Of course, these are mountaintop ridges but remember, when that wind goes up and over these mountain ridges it compresses, it dries out, and it actually speeds up as it reaches the valley floors as it warms up. So you could just imagine the imagine incredible extreme fire behavior that firefighters are contending with, with these types of winds. So we've kind of put in a localized view here. So this is Los Angeles County, Ventura County just to the west. And I want you to see the direction of the wind -- more of a northerly component coming right over the Santa Susana Mountains right down towards the coastline near Santa Monica where the Palisades fire is. Of course, we have three out-of-control fires at the moment. And then I want you to see as we take you through time. This is Wednesday morning local time. That's the current gust. They expect those winds to pick up in speed through the course of the morning. That is typical with Santa Ana wind events. We get that peak wind gust as we edge towards dawn hours, right? So that's typically what happens. Right now we have this particularly dangerous situation. We're all well aware of this. But it's the combined factors of low humidity values, the extreme winds, and the intense, ferocious winds that are just driving these incredible, incredible flames. Right now, Kasie, this is amazing. Only 10 percent of average rainfall for Southern California so far this water year that's led to these scenes we're seeing on our TV screens this morning. And I'll leave you with this. This is what it looked like outside of a passenger window of a flight approaching Los Angeles last night.",
