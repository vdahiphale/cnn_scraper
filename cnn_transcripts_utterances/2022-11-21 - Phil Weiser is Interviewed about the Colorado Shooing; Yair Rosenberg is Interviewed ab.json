The idea that we can say to someone that they're less than human or they don't have a place in our society is a very dangerous road because we know that sets the preconditions for people to think, oh, this person's not worth living. I can use my own - and you've heard people use this phrase, Second Amendment remedies or other such phrases, justifying hate crimes, violence. We can and we all must recognize that everyone has a right to be their best authentic selves, to love who they love and not have to live in fear that they are going to be demonized.Colorado has been working on making progress. We recently ended what had been a so-called gay conversion practice that we said was inhumane and illegal. We've, obviously, been working hard on this issue. We were once known as the hate state in the early 1990s, having passed a law that limited civil rights protections for gays and lesbians. That law was deemed unconstitutional. We've come a long way in Colorado. We now have the first openly gay governor elected in the United States. But, obviously, we know we've got more work to do.",

Anti-Semitism has that component, but it's also a conspiracy theory about how the world works, which says that there are these sinister string-pulling Jews who are behind all of society's problems, economically, politically, socially. And if you believe a conspiracy theory about how your society works, you won't be able to fix your society because you'll be chasing after invisible Jewish culprits instead of solving your actual problems in a rational way.And so in that way anti-Semitism sort of undermines our ability to collectively address our problems because if you think say Jews are behind the financial collapse, you're not going to take the actual reforms and steps that are needed to fix your economy.
