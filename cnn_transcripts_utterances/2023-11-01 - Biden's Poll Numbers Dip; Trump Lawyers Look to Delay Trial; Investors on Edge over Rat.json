So, we've seen again a double-digit decline.Now, what states are we looking at that may be most important for black voters, right? Black voters were ten percent plus of 2020 voters in these key swing states, Georgia, 29 percent, North Carolina, 23 percent, Michigan, 12 percent, and Pennsylvania, 11 percent. So, the decline among black voters that we've seen for Joe Biden could see a big effect in these key swing states.

Good morning, guys. Akayla, how worried should the Biden team and Democrats be? AKAYLA GARDNER, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"BLOOMBERG NEWS\": I think the Biden team is very unhappy to see these numbers. You know, as Harry mentioned, South Carolina was huge to his 2020 win. It turned around that - those primaries for Biden. And so he knows he needs to win this again. And I think the same trends that we're seeing in South Carolina is also true of the trends that we're seeing it Georgia when it comes to black voters. It's systemic of a larger problem that he has with this very key demographic. And a lot of the things that I've heard from black voters is student debt relief.

If you look basically since the end of August, it's been about 30 points in Iowa, South Carolina and whatever the -- New Hampshire, of course, right. You've seen this pretty consistently. What we're really seeing in Iowa is, yes, Nikki Haley has surged relative to Donald Trump to some extent, but mostly to Ron DeSantis. DeSantis stayed flat for the most recent Iowa poll. Nikki Haley gained on him by sort of eating into other people's support. And so I think the dynamic here really - I mean, obviously, South Carolina, something of an outlier because she used to be governor there. She's very well known. Really I think what we're seeing is, Ron DeSantis has lost the mantle. He had the mantle of, I am the non- Trump. I am the guy you're going to consolidate around behind. I am the guy who can win this thing. And I think he was always in danger of losing that. You know, there's only one Trump. There's an infinite number of non-Trumps, right? Anyone could be that person. I think Nikki Haley's that person. You see her support is often very soft in the Iowa poll. It's not like people are like I'm gung-ho for Nikki Haley. They're just like, I'm supporting Nikki Haley. That suggests that they're just looking for someone.",

They want to move this trial at least until mid- November. That's what they've told her in recent weeks. They're saying that the prosecutors are trying to have a rush to trial. The other thing that they're saying is that they haven't had a lot of time to do the sort of work that they need to do pretrial. They're very busy. They want to make sure they're access classified documents. Now, the Justice Department has come back in court filings leading up to this hearing saying, these guys are dragging their feet. They 're being hyperbolic about how much work they're able to put in as a defense team. And, in fact, Donald Trump and his lawyers were in Miami yesterday at what's called a SCIF, so a specialized compartmented facility where they can access classified information in this case. That's something that you do as a defense team to prepare for trial, a necessary step. Trump's team wants a little bit more time. They want to move the deadlines back. And then, ultimately, they hope that that will convince Judge Cannon today to move the trial date back from when it's set in May. But we're going to have to see exactly how she responds. She's given Trump a lot of leeway. We don't expect to be him -- to see him here in person today at this federal courthouse as of now.
