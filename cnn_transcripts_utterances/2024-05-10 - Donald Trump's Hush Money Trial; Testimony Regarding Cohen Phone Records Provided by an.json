Going out of his way to say he doesn't want to embarrass him over certain things when he's mouthing, you know, curse words as Stormy Daniels was testifying.What is it like when there is such a tense relationship like that between the defense team and the judge?",

I think that's just human nature, at that point. I think, at bottom, he understands they have a very difficult client on their hands.

And the worst thing that you can do on cross- examination is lose witness control, right? Lose control of how the witness is responding to your questions.

You can hear the lion's roar, we are told by -- from this -- where this prison is. I mean, it's safe to say he did not think that he would be in this position. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  No, absolutely not. I mean, I think that they kind of went with the same strategy that Donald Trump himself does, which is deny, deny, delay, delay. Push this as far as we can. I certainly think Peter Navarro never thought that he would be reporting to jail at any point. I mean, they kept pushing this through. I think, as you said, the Supreme Court saying, no thanks. It's likely that they would do the same thing with Bannon's case. And he could likely be in jail as well. I think the other thing to point out here is that both of these people are still Trump loyalists. They're still around Donald Trump. Now, they're not nearly as close to the former president as they used to be, but it is interesting that you have these two people who are in Donald Trump's orbit. Close to him. Revere him.

It was, sort, of establishing how these records work and, you know, sort of a fact witnesses for the jury. And Jeff Zeleny, I did want to go to you because Susie Wiles is also in the courtroom, we should note that that is interesting. I mean that the -- I've said this a number of times and I'll say it again, the campaign is the courthouse and the courthouse is the campaign, it seems often with this business. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  For sure. And she is of -- I mean, if you're wondering who Susie Wiles is, she was a long time of Florida Republican who is effectively running this campaign. She's the adult in the room, probably the biggest example of the difference in this Trump campaign than his previous two campaigns. She keeps things on track. She calms him. She advises him. So, I think what we're seeing, we saw Florida Senator Rick Scott in the courtroom yesterday. It's part of the effort to ensure the former president is not alone in the courtroom as we saw in the first week. So, she's very important to this. And look, she probably also a lot is writing on this. What happens on this case is going to depend a lot on how this campaign unfolds. But I think it's mainly just being around him in his orbit there, certainly important. She was not involved in the 2016 campaign at all. She's a newer figure. In fact, she worked for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis then, that's a whole another story. But I think her main value is to just, sort of, be there for her client who is a candidate for president.",
