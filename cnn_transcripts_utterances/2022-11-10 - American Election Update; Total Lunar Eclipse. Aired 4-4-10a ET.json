Winter solstice, summer equinox, solar eclipse or lunar eclipse? The answer here is lunar eclipse, but not all eclipses are created equal. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A lunar eclipse is when the moon passes through the earth`s shadow. This only occurs during a full moon. Two factors decide which of three possible eclipses the moon will experience: the tilt of the moon`s orbit around the earth, and which of the earth`s two shadows the moon falls behind. The earth`s darker inner shadow is known as the umbra and the lighter outer one is called the penumbra. The penumbral eclipse is when the moon passes through -- you guessed it -- just the penumbra. NASA says this type of eclipse is so subtle that if you didn`t know it was happening, you might not even notice it. A partial eclipse is when the moon only gets covered by part of the earth`s umbra, so only part of it is shaded in darkness by the earth. A partial eclipse happens at least twice a year. And then there`s the big one, the total lunar eclipse. These are rare, often separated by years, and require the moon, earth and sun to be in perfect alignment. But don`t think this blocks out the moon, as the moon shifts deeper into the umbra, it takes on a red hue which is sometimes called a blood moon. The moon turns red because the atmosphere is filtering out color at the opposite end of the visible spectrum, the blue light. The short wavelengths of blue don`t travel as far as the long red wavelengths, so they scatter before reaching our eyes, leaving behind the red glow. Not everyone on earth can see a lunar eclipse at the same time. You`ll need to be in an area facing the moon during the moments it`s shaded by earth. Unlike a solar eclipse, you don`t need any special equipment to enjoy a lunar eclipse. They`re safe to watch at any stage, although a pair of binoculars might make it more fun. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

On Tuesday, the moon turned a coppery shade of red also known as a Blood Moon.This happened when the entire moon was in the Earth`s shadow. Check out this stunning imagery. By the way, the next total lunar eclipse won`t happen until March 14th of 2025. Be sure to mark your calendars. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse can be enjoyed from anywhere in the world that the moon is present during the night. All right. We have an extra mini quiz for you today. Environmentalists are battling a dangerous and invasive species in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, upsetting the balance of the ecosystem there. Any guesses? Maybe it`s a type of shark? No, it`s not. Maybe jellyfish? Nope, not it either. A type of algae? No. Humans? No. It`s actually something you may have seen swimming in an aquarium. We`re talking about lionfish. They`re taking over, but experts may have developed a system to help contain the lionfish population and in turn created an opportunity for local restaurants and your belly. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) NICK WATT, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  These ecowarriors are heading into an unusual battle.
