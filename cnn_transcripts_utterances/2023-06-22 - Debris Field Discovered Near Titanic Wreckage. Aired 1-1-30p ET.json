It was spotted by an ROV, a remote- operated vessel. We're going to get an update from the U.S. Coast Guard just two hours from now at 3:00 p.m. Eastern. And we have CNN's Jason Carroll, who is standing by in Boston for that. CNN has a team in all of the key places involved in this mission. CNN's Miguel Marquez is in St. John's Port in Canada. And while we don't yet know if the debris that's been located is indeed the Titan vessel, we do know that the crew trapped inside has exhausted their estimated oxygen supply. Officials, though, are preparing for all scenarios. There are doctors, a hyperbaric recompression chamber all at the site right now. Meantime, CNN's Veronica Miracle is in Washington state, where OceanGate is headquartered. And she just spoke to a former employee. You're going to hear his explosive comments about the Titan's experimental design. Also, CNN's Paula Newton is getting more details about the five people trapped inside the Titan. We begin, though, with CNN's Jason Carroll in Boston. So, Jason, what are you hearing from the U.S. Coast Guard right now?",

Previously, Boris as you know, when we have been out here, it's been another one of the captains that's been doing the briefings. But, today, the rear admiral will be conducting it, this after they released a tweet saying that a debris -- that debris was found near the Titanic. That debris field is now being analyzed. We will have more information about that analysis once that briefing gets under way. The Titan, as you know, went down 96 hours ago, four days ago, the oxygen supply at this point all but exhausted. Throughout this, there's been a huge, massive effort by sea, by air to search for the missing submersible. There -- throughout the past 24 to 48 hours, we have been hearing reports of banging, reports of noises coming from the area, this after a Canadian search plane dropped sonar buoys on the surface and detected noises. Now the question becomes, what happened? What were those noises? Did that play any role in what happened here? We don't know. Again, still waiting to hear what's going to happen when the rear admiral gives his briefing. That's going to be getting under way, again, at 3:00 here at Coast Guard headquarters -- Boris.",

And that's the expertise. The families had been taking comfort in the fact that, if you were going to have experts on board, that two of them right, the CEO, the founder, the person that designed this Titan, was on board. That is Stockton Rush. And that was of comfort not only to the other families, but his family and friends. We heard some of them speak to CNN to say he would know what to do. He would know the best way to survive. And other than that, you had the person nicknamed Mr. Titanic. You're talking about more than 30 dives to that Titanic site. It is P.H. Nargeolet. He is that French -- French expert who is legend when it comes to trying to explore the depths of the deep sea and, specifically, the Titanic. Right now, the families in the last 48 hours when they had heard there were those noises and the fact that they may not have been natural noises really kind of thought, yes, there is a chance. And as they saw more and more resources deployed, resources that could actually get to the bottom of the sea, they thought to themselves, OK, we might have a chance here, given the expertise on board. And, again, it's worth repeating what the conditions would have been, already quite stark. It's dark. It's cold. You're running out of oxygen. You're trying to really save your energy at that point. What we are waiting for now is to learn from the U.S. Coast Guard exactly what they have found, exactly what it is, and then keeping in mind that, no matter what happens, an investigation will start here. I will say it will be a measure of peace if the families can get any information at all. What has been so unnerving for so many has been the lack of information in the last few days.",

Even Hamish Harding, who is an incurable explorer who has a lot of experience, the British billionaire who was on board there as well, they would have known what to do because they had two experts by their side actually giving them advice on what to do to conserve that oxygen. Again, in listening to our experts, you had something that was built from carbon fiber and titanium, right?

Virnig, the subcontractor who worked on the Titan, he said that he worked on the development and also the testing of the Titan back in 2018 here in Everett, Washington.In fact, he was part of the team that actually was testing the Titan and went down in the Everett Bay Marina about 30 feet or so. And he said that, as this development was happening, it was moving very quickly. And he knew at the time and the team knew at the time that these design choices that they were making were controversial, innovative, however, not tried-and-trued methods. He explained to me that what they were trying to achieve was a really lightweight submersible that could fit a lot of people, like five people, in this case, in the Titan. And in order to do that, they had to make specific decisions, like using carbon fiber. Here's what he had to say about that controversial decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DOUG \"D.J.\" VIRNIG, SUBCONTRACTOR:  The pressure hull itself on Titan is made out of primarily carbon fiber. Various people from around the world felt like that was a very experimental choice. Now, to Stockton and Titan and OceanGate's credit, they actually answered that to the best of their ability. But then the question is, well, if you do that repeatedly, then what happens? But if you really are pushing the envelope, there's no time to -- you're answering those questions in real time.

It would allow people to go in and out of the submersible. If they made it to the surface, it would have allowed them to open the hatch and let oxygen in. But, as it is now, the Titan had to be -- has to be opened from the outside, which is another controversial decision. I think one thing that was interesting, he said that this was never the -- excuse me -- adventure tourism was never the goal of OceanGate. In fact, it was a means to an end. What -- the mission he felt and what he believed from Stockton Rush and the company was to really go out and explore the undiscovered parts of the ocean. And selling high-ticket items like going to the Titanic would allow them to do that. Lastly, I did ask him if he himself would have been comfortable going down in that submersible in the Titan down to the Titanic in those depths. And he said, with somebody as a -- who has an engineering background, knowing everything that could go wrong, he would not feel comfortable -- Jim.",

If you have sufficient CO2 scrubbing materials, then, in -- periodically, somebody, presumably the leader of the expedition, will have to move to change out the scrubbing materials or the scrubbing cartridges. Maybe they have the newer lithium hydroxide curtains that are a little bit easier to handle. Otherwise, everybody would have to go in a semi- hibernating, trancelike state, if they can, to conserve as much oxygen as possible.

But can you talk about the difficulties of navigating at that depth on a site that has so many dangers lurking on it? CREMER:  Yes, certainly. The premier hazard around large wrecks, especially if they were not scuttled, is entanglement. At Hawaii Undersea Research Lab, we operated two submersibles in tandem. So, one submersible would go in, as we said, to get closeups, or do the work in and on around the wreck, where the other submersible would stand off and back and observe the site and advise the other submersible if there were, in fact, entanglement hazards anywhere near it. So, that -- we were fortunate in that way that we had -- that we could do tandem dives, sort of like a buddy dive system. I mean, no professional diver would go all by themselves.
