Weakness is unacceptable,\" he says. \"What should be done in this situation,\" he's asked. \"Talk from a position of strength,\" he answers. But how much power does Russia still hold in Syria? Kremlin-controlled TV strategizes over what might come next, with maps showing Russia's bases in Syria. A guest acknowledges Moscow was caught off guard again. \"Thinking about how it all happened in Syria reminds me about how it all happened in Ukraine in 2014,\" he says. \"I want to highlight one universal lesson for world powers. Don't take wishful thinking for reality. When a power is crumbling in days and can't protect itself. This is a verdict.\" For years, it was the Russian military that kept the Assad regime afloat. Russia's air force pounding rebel groups, its navy firing cruise missiles at ISIS militants in eastern Syria. In return, Assad gave Moscow a 49-year lease on both its main air base near Latakia and a military port in Tartus, allowing Vladimir Putin to project power throughout the Middle East. The fact that Russia has its military assets in Syria also makes Moscow a key player in the Middle East. But now the Russians acknowledge that that status is in jeopardy. Once a key ally for the Russian leader, Putin now allowed Assad and some of his family members to flee to Moscow, a decision folks in Moscow told us they support. \"We don't abandon our men,\" he says, \"he is our man. It was the right decision. He has nowhere to go. He would have been killed.\" But even here, Syrians living in Russia telling me they're happy Assad's been ousted. \"We will be able to live in calm and peace and be able to safely visit our country,\" he says. \"We don't have to worry that someone can throw us in prison because they don't like what we said. We're happy that the dictatorship is over.\" Moscow hopes the end of Assad's rule will not spell the end of its military engagement in the Middle East while acknowledging it's still too early to predict.
