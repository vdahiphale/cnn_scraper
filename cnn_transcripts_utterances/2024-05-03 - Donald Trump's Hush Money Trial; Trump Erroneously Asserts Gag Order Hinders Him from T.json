The 53-day mission plans to take the rocket to the far side of the moon, where it will collect samples to bring back. China would be the only country to ever land there, and they hope to take astronauts to the moon by 2030. Look at that.All right. Let's go now to our big news today. In just a few hours, Donald Trump's hush money trial resumes with the judge considering whether to hold the former president in contempt again for allegedly violating his gag order again. Yesterday, jurors heard Trump's team attack Stormy Daniels' former attorney, Keith Davidson. Trying to paint him as someone with a long history of extracting money from celebrities. Insinuating he was extorting them. They also listened to a series of phone calls between Michael Cohen and Davidson about where the two can be heard discussing the deal. Trump was asked yesterday whether he still plans to testify at his trial. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, I'm not allowed to testify. I'm under a gag order, I guess, right? I can't even testify to that. No, we're going to be appealing the gag order. I -- I'd love to answer that question. It's a very easy question. The easiest question so far. But I'm not allowed to testify because this judge, who's totally conflicted, has me under an unconstitutional gag order. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, the gag order relates to conduct he engages in outside of the courtroom, right, with respect to, as we very well, not chastising or mentioning witnesses, not mentioning jurors, not mentioning family members, et cetera.He is permitted, of course, to attack Alvin Bragg, the district attorney of Manhattan. He's permitted to attack Biden. He's permitted to attack the judge as he regularly does. But with regard to his in- court conduct, of course, he has the right to testify. It's a fundamental right. I believe at the end of the trial, right, when we get there, the judge will ask him whether he wants to testify. He will be given that opportunity. He will be given time to assess whether that's in his interest, which apparently, he's already assessed, which is why he's spinning that he cannot. And so, yes, in the event that he wanted to testify and tell his story, he has the full and fair opportunity to do so. And to suggest otherwise is just a blatant misrepresentation.",

      "sentences": "So, I think there's a couple of ways to parse it out. The first way is that you can look at the issue, let's start with the jury, as that -- just this generic rendition of this liberal, according to him, jury that is not going to be fair. That, though, can be looked at the other way which is, you know, there has to be confidence in a system in order for what that system decides to be credited and taken seriously, that's number one. And number two, in the event that you're waxing poetic about how unfair they are. And if a jury verdict is rendered that's adverse to you and find you guilty, that can cause significant problems for jurors. If jurors are outed, right? I know they are working anonymously now, that doesn't always work. And the public becomes -- they become known to the public, they are in danger. Particularly if a person who has a bully pulpit, like the former president, and there's 70 million people are riled up, it could represent a danger.So, whether you're specifically targeting a juror or a number of jurors, targeting them blankly because of the fact that it could instill a lack of confidence in your support to say, hey, you just did it because he was Trump. It's intimidation for the jury and it could be threatening to the jury. What -- so, that's a problem, right? And the judge can assess it that way. The other thing as it relates to Cohen, that's well known, right? Obviously, Cohen likes to attack him, though he stopped to his credit. The president certainly likes to attack him back, though he must stop. And if he doesn't, he'll continue to be fine. But I think overall, Kasie, the judge is -- needs to and is, right, seemingly getting this under control because Trump has, kind of, tampered down the rhetoric. He had a rally, as we know, on Wednesday. Didn't seem to be any violations of the gag order there. And so, maybe it's working. And I just think in terms of what the judge does, I think the judge will assess additional fines. I don't see jail in this instance, right, because of the timing of these potential violations. But if we move forward and Trump continues to challenge the judge, we might see something far different.",

And so, the White House, the campaign is trying to make very clear where the president stands. But you're right, any sign -- any scenes of disorder, of chaos are complicating for the president. Whether or not he's directly involved in what's happening, he's a leader of the nation.And so, people vote based on how they're feeling, how they -- what direction the country is headed.

And when you look at the map, there are states the President needs to win, the chief among them being Michigan. And Michigan is a state with a huge Arab-American and Muslim-American population. And there are some concerns that this issue is more salient for those voters, where the margins are really small. And so, writ large, the Biden campaign and Democrats feel confident that this is not the most animating issue for their base of voters.
