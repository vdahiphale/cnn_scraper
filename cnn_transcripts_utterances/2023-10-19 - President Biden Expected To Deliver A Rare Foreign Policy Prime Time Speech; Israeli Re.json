But I think what'sdifferent about tonight is President Biden really working to convince Americans why they should care about this conflict, not only in Israel, but also Ukraine, why they should feel invested in these wars half a world away. And as he comes and prepares to ask Congress for $100 billion supplemental package that includes assistance for Ukraine and includes assistance for Israel. And I think his aim, really, his objective will be to try and convince Americans that it is worth this amount, this astronomical amount of American taxpayer dollars to support these conflicts that on their face don't have any effect on the American homeland, on Americans lives. And he will try and sort of bridge that gap, convince Americans why, for example, protecting democracy in Ukraine or, for example, protecting the Jewish state is important to their own lives and it will be a tall task. And he has chosen this most prominent, sort of stage, for this address in primetime. He has only done one before that. So, I think that tells you the importance that he is placing on that speech. And I think the other thing that I'll be listening for in this address is whether he accounts for this historic trip that he just got back from in Israel. Now, I was on that trip with him and we talked to him at the back of the plane as he was coming back and it was certainly clear that he did feel like he accomplished quite a bit on this trip. But a lot of what he says that he accomplished remains to be seen. It will be seen in the coming days, coming weeks as this conflict proceeds, guys.",

In fact, this speech that he's delivering tonight actually predates the conflict in Israel. He had been planning to deliver what he called a major address on Ukraine over the last, you know, month or so. And it got delayed and it got delayed and eventually got combined with this speech that he'll deliver tonight. And I think what you'll hear from him is the message that he has been trying to drum up over the last, you know, 600 days of this war, which is that protecting democracy in Ukraine matters to the entire world and that if you let a state like Russia impede Ukraine's sovereignty, that that's a slippery slope and that President Putin could certainly have his eye on other countries. And so, certainly, President Biden will want to reinforce this at a moment when the world's attention for the first time in a long time isn't necessarily on that conflict.",

Not every Hamas objective was achieved. Nearby kibbutz Sa'ad wasn't even attacked, although we now have documentary evidence that Hamas intended to inflict the maximum possible human casualties there and to hold hostages. A highly detailed street map found on another Hamas gunman and obtained by CNN shows individual buildings in Sa'ad identified and assessed for their military value. The communal kitchen, for example, is described as the main place suitable for holding hostages. Inside the guard room, the soldiers must be neutralized, the Hamas instructions say, while the kibbutz dental clinic is designated a place for first aid for both enemies and friends. Israeli residents of Sa'ad say they also found that level of detail astounding. SARAH POLLACK, KIBBUTZ SA'AD RESIDENT:  Shockingly, the details are very accurate. The map is a map of our kibbutz.

Let's bring in \"New York Times\" Magazine Staff Writer Ronen Bergman. He's also the recipient of the Sokolov Prize, Israel's most esteemed award for journalism. Ronen, thank you so much for being with us. I know that you didn't -- you weren't able to see that piece fully by our Matthew Chance, but it was incredible. It really just sort of painted. a detailed picture in terms of just how much these militants knew about just various kibbutz in terms of where they were going to target, where they were going. How did they know so much, Ronen? How did they know so much? RONEN BERGMAN, STAFF WRITER, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" MAGAZINE:  Well, you know, Israel is an open country. It's a democracy and much of this information with meticulous and continuous work and collection from open source, also the social media you can just get. It's out there. I am by far more surprised to -- from the information they gathered on military installations. Those orders that were given to assign to each of the teams, the Hamas teams, there were something like 100 teams, each one with different location, with different target. And I saw some of the orders that were given to raid military installations, including the secret intelligence hubs. In \"The New York Times\", we published some screenshots from the GoPro that was on the head of the head, the chief of that team from Hamas. He held a map of a secret intelligence space. This takes us to a different realm of collection, of intelligence gathering by Hamas. I think one way to gather such information is, you know, the ongoing daily traveling of day workers from Gaza to Israel. This could be one way using the aerial satellite, photography is another, and breaches in Israeli intelligence is a third. This is a collapse, a total failure of different parts of the Israeli establishment, the military establishment and intelligence establishment. It will be, I'm sure it will be investigated, but so far. Just from our investigation, the gaps are so enormous. The underestimation of Hamas is so severe. The lack of visibility into their communication is so tremendous that I think when people get exposed to the whole thing, people will be shocked as much as they will be when more testimonies and more videos and more pictures will be released from the atrocities. Your correspondent said something about an assumption or a claim by Israeli authorities that Hamas is going through some kind of a jihadist transformation to ISIS or Al-Qaeda. That might be from the theological, from religious point of view, that Hamas is not a Salafi organization. It might be so. But if you compare the atrocities that the Hamas perpetrators have conducted, and I just returned from the front, spending every day there today, in one of the villages, I attended the funeral of six members of the same family that were slaughtered together and burned afterwards. And the stories are just really horrible. And so, at least from that side, I think there's abundant proof that Hamas is getting very close to ISIS in time.",

The permits are being given after somesecurity screening done by Israeli intelligence and military. It's not being given, of course, to any Hamas member or someone who knows to have an affiliation with Hamas. But trying to figure out how come in reading the orders and the feeds of intelligence that were given to the perpetrators before they went all this horrible, offensive on October 7, I'm trying to figure out exactly what you asked at the beginning of this conversation. How come they knew so much? And this is not based on knowledge. It's totally speculative and I don't know if you will have any answer, any real evidence on that. But this could be the ability of Hamas to recruit people that are not known to be Hamas, but are getting -- that have a permit to come and go to work in Israel. Now, this doesn't solve the mystery of the information on military basis, but people working in kibbutz, again, it's a very free country, very free society, can get a lot of information. This is open. It's not this -- nothing of that was ever tagged as secret. But they know from those orders -- they know how many people, where they live, how kibbutz is built, how many people, how many soldiers are present permanently in kibbutz.

He is now pivoting with his strategy. We are told that Jim Jordan is now getting behind a resolution that would temporarily empower the Interim Speaker, Patrick McHenry. Right now, Patrick McHenry only has the power to oversee floor votes related to the speaker's race, but he does not have the power to pass legislation, including government funding or critical aid to Israel or Ukraine. So, at this moment, they are meeting behind closed doors Republicans are talking about this idea. But this is kind of a risk for Jim Jordan here. Jim Jordan's allies think that this idea will give him more time to build support for his speakership bid. This resolution would empower from Patrick McHenry until potentially January or until a new speaker is elected. But it is very unclear whether this would do anything to win over Jordan's holdouts. I talked to one of them Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican. He said this does nothing to change his opposition to Jim Jordan. And meanwhile, this resolution is already sparking fierce pushback from conservative hardliners, conservative hardliners who are backing Jim Jordan for speaker. So, you start to get a sense of just how messy this situation is on Capitol Hill. And because there's Republican opposition, that means Democratic votes are going to be needed for that resolution to empower McHenry. Democrats had a meeting of their own. They are kind of in a wait and see approach right now. They have not made any decisions or thinking it over whether they're going to supply those key votes to be able to pass this resolution. But at this point, this looks like it's the only potential viable option to finally end the chaos that has reigned here in Capitol Hill for two weeks now, guys.",

As an American, I believe that it's the most powerful force for good on earth. And I thought the President was pitch perfect in a moment of crisis, of standing with America's democratic ally in the region. Now, he's got to, having been there, he's got to build that out, start with the strength and then also show the compassion. He has brokered a deal we're reporting, right, to get aid through the Rafah gate in Gaza, to help all these innocent Palestinians while we're going after the terrorists. It's a two-step thing. He's got to show that steely resolve. I think also he needs to now speak as the American president, not only the leader of the free world, by which I mean Americans were slaughtered by those Hamas terrorists. Americans have been kidnapped by those Hamas terrorists. America also has a right to punish those terrorists. Now, right now, he's not doing that. He's not sending any troops in. It's probably a bad idea. I also think he needs to lean into his age. You know, everybody, it's the first thing they say about Biden. He's old because he is. But I think he can make the case, maybe not explicitly, but that with age comes experience, with experience comes wisdom, and wisdom matters in his job.

But just in terms of part of the President's job, tonight, obviously, he has to unite the country. I mean, people are really entrenched in terms of their opinions about Israel. And not only is the country divided, but even the Democratic Party. There are so many divisions within the Democratic Party. You think about Cory Bush. You think about Ilhan Omar, some of their comments, Tlaib, as well. How does the President not just unite the country, but unite the Democratic Party, too, in terms of his approach?",

There is a fringe, and I counted itabout eight or nine in the whole 212 in the House who don't support Israel. And I say that because they didn't even vote for the Iron Dome, which is a purely defensive weapon. I don't know if it could kill anybody. All it does is save Israeli lives. By the way, it saves Palestinian lives because by interrupting those missile attacks, there's much less of an Israeli call for vengeance against Palestinians under which innocents are often harmed and killed. So, that's a fringe. But he needs to state clearly, and I think he has, that his party, our country, is pro-Israel, period. Now, he's also got to broaden it. By the way, to Ukraine, where it's the Republican Party that's starting to go wobbly on aid to Ukraine. It's a 600-day war so far, and he's got to show us how the fight for freedom and democracy is America's fight. At least, thank goodness he's not putting boots on the ground. And I thought he had a really powerful message for the Israelis, which is, you know, we went through 9 11. We know how you're feeling. Don't make the mistakes we made. You know, America overreacted and then we invaded Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9 11. And it would be as if today Israel invaded Belgium. I mean, it's the greatest foreign policy mistake America's made since Vietnam. And I think he doesn't want our allies in Israel to make the same mistake out of understandable desire for vengeance, but it's not, it's not, and it was not a strategic success for America, and I think he's trying to ward the Israelis off that, too.",

Wehave Russia invading our friends in Ukraine who we are helping. We have, as you reported earlier, a Congress that is completely dysfunctional, broken down and leaderless. So, I really would say let the politics take care of itself over time. As I look back, you know, Bill Clinton was in terrible trouble the year before his reelection. And there were two things that turned it around. First, it's hard to talk about, but the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing where right-wing terrorists attacked the federal building in Oklahoma. He handled that with such grace and strength. And that really got people to look at him differently. And then at the end of that, that was in April of 95, at the end of that year, the radical Republicans shut down the country, shut down the government rather. And he handled that with real strength. And I think those two events really turned his positioning. I'm not saying that the same thing is going to happen to Biden. But we look at these presidents in these moments of crisis. And he's, I think, showing a terrific strength and I think Zain is right, it's wise for him to look into the page.",
