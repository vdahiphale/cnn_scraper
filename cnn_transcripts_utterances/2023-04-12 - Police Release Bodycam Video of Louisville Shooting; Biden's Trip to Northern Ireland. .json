It did not get into the residential area as far as the fire is concerned. It did not get past the complex that it is in. So, our efforts there were successful. Today our plan is to get the excavators in and pull apart and make access to the burning areas. Yesterday our access was very hampered by the rubbish and the piles of plastic that were surrounding the complex. Yesterday we only had one way in to the entire structure.

And I just want to, I guess, they - they did a great job. This fire, because of the nature of the contents of the building, was a fast-growing fire. And so they got in, surrounded it and cut it off from the residential neighborhood, which just speaks volumes of the work that they did yesterday, is getting their troops in, being able to deliver the water where it needed to cut this fire off because it was going to be a total loss, but it could have grown further than just these buildings here. And so just kudos to the fire department and their efforts and their tactical decisions to cut this fire off. Again, this fire, it takes a lot from the community, the mayor, the street department, emergency management, and a lot of different agencies. And they've done a wonderful job communicating, pulling their team together to deal with this. And currently it's in the short term, but it will go into the longer in just being able to pull that together. The other thing I want to cover too is media questions, after this press release, that Indiana Homeland Security PIO will be a contact for the media. And you can call 463-202-4063 and that will be your contact for a while because the local agencies were busy trying to manage an emergency situation and we're getting tons of phone calls.

We also know he texted a friend, he called a friend, and he left a voice message saying in part he wanted to kill everyone at the bank and that he was feeling suicidal.It was Officer CJ Galloway that fired the shot ending the shooter's life. We know members of law enforcement executed a search warrant on the shooter's home and determine the gun that was used in the shooting here at the bank was purchased six days prior to the shooting. So that was last Tuesday, on April 4th. The gun was purchased legally from a dealership here in Louisville. And it was the same weapon he used to kill five people who worked here at the bank. And later tonight, a vigil will be held to honor those five. Meanwhile, the shooter's family releasing a statement saying that they are working with members of law enforcement. His family also saying they knew Connor struggled with depression and they were actively, according to them, working to address his mental illness. But they say they saw no signs and they did not know their son was capable of such violence. I want to read to you part of that statement that was released from the family. It says in part, quote, no words can express our sorrow, anguish and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people.
