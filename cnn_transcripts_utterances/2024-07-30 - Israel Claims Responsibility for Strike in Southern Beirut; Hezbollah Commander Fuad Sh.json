      "sentences": "Hello and a very warm welcome, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we begin with breaking news out ofLebanon. Israel is claiming this hour responsibility for a strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. It says it was targeting the Hezbollah commander responsible for a rocket attack, you remember, in the Golan Heights that killed a dozen children. Hezbollah has denied responsibility, but that is not stopping scenes like the ones you are seeing on your screen right now. Debris and wreckage pretty much strewn across a packed city street. This is in Beirut in Lebanon, as you can see there. Lebanese state media report, the strike was conducted by a drone that fired three missiles, and that at least one person was killed. We've just got that in the last few minutes. So, let's just get more as this is developing stories, a breaking news story. I want to go to our Jeremy Diamond who's standing by in Jaffa in Israel. Our CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton and our global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance. Jeremy, let me go to you first, because we do have the statement from the IDF basically saying they are responsible, they carried out what they called a targeted strike. They were looking -- they were attacking I think a number -- well, pardon me, targeted strike in Beirut on a commander -- pardon me, commander responsible for the   murder of the children in Majdal Shams. But it says at the moment, there are no changes in the home-front command defensive guidelines. What does that mean, Jeremy?",

      "sentences": "Well, effectively, the home- front guidelines are the guidelines issued to civilians in Israel to tell them effectively what the risk level is at this moment in terms of militaryaction. It's to tell them whether to cancel large gatherings, to not go to school, to be within reach of a bomb shelter at all times. And in this case, the Israeli military has decided not to make any changes to those guidelines, which indicates at least for the moment that they don't anticipate that this will immediately escalate any further than it already has. But make no mistake that possibility is certainly in the air tonight as we have seen this very significant Israeli strike hit the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Dahieh, which is notable in and of itself for the location, given its proximity to Beirut. But also in addition to that, it is the fact that they are targeting a senior commander in that area. They say that this commander who they have not named in this statement, it was responsible for this rocket attack that killed 12 children in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights in the Syrian Druze community of Majdal Shams. It has been clear since this weekend when that rocket attack took place. When we saw the number of civilians killed, the fact that these were all children who were killed as well, it became immediately clear that there was a possibility of escalation. And since then, we have heard clear statements from Israeli officials vowing that there would be a severe response, vowing that Hezbollah would have a price to pay even as Hezbollah, of course, denied responsibility for this attack. And so now, we have finally seen what shape that response has taken as the Israeli military in just the last couple of hours carried out this strike and then very quickly confirmed it, making clear that they wanted to send a message that as the Israeli Defense Minister says tonight, a red line was crossed by Hezbollah in this rocket attack over the weekend, and an Israeli response was merited.",

And you know, the whole region is on a knife-edge, you know, trying to grapple with that question. I can certainly tell you -- and I've been up to northern Israel several times since the October 7th attacks. There's a great deal of political pressure inside northern Israel -- inside Israel in northern Israel, particularly to strike at Hezbollah, to push that group back from the northern border of Israel. It's under -- northern Israel is under constant, not just the constant threat of missile attack, but actually under constant missile attack as well. And it's led to whole communities being evacuated. They're not able to go back into their homes, that fright, fearful, that what happened in -- you know, from Gaza in southern Israel could happen to them in northern Israel as well.

This is a timewhen the streets are crowded with people and the neighborhood where it happened, Haret Hreik in southern part of Beirut is a very crowded populous neighborhoods. Now, that is where many of Hezbollah's leaders operate out of. But that's also where hundreds of thousands of civilians live as well. Now, we're hearing from the national news agency, the official Lebanese news agency that at least one woman was killed and several others injured. There are reports in the local media that hospitals in the area are calling for donations of blood as well. Also, I'm hearing that people are lining up, queuing up at petrol stations to fill because  this is an event that although it comes to their surprise in   terms of the time and the place, the fact that it happened was no surprise at all because it was widely expected that there would be some sort of Israeli response to the attack on Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights. They left 12 people dead. But the other day, I was speaking with the Foreign Minister of Lebanon who told me that they --the Lebanese government had received assurances through diplomatic channels that Beirut, the Beirut Airport, and specifically the southern suburbs of Beirut would not be struck.

The Israelis, as I say, are exhausted because of their battling in Gaza. The Lebanese government, Hezbollah, they don't want to get him embroiled in a potentially very destructive conflict that could have massive impacts, have a massive impact and perhaps lead to, you know -- you know, enormous costs for the Lebanese people.

The impact from an operational standpoint, I was based I think on Israeli Intelligence, I -- they believe that they had indications that their target, this commander that they're talking about, that, that person was in that area and perhaps in a specific apartment or a specific office in the development in the suburb of Beirut. If -- you know, there's some reports that may indicate that the Israeli student not achieve their goal if that does turn out to be the case, then you know, all that's basically off when it comes to this. And it does show that there are certain limits to this kind of warfare. And you know, as far as drone operations are concerned, they live and die, they succeed or fail based on the precision of the Intelligence that they have access to.

I think that's pretty likely that they might do that kind of an operation because that's basically what they're able to do. They might also conduct several other types of terrorists or terrorists-like attacks. And that could, of course, escalate things and really result in, you know, escalated situation on Israel's northern border. And as Matthew was talking about, Israel should be wanting to avoid a front war, but they also have to respond to attacks like this. So, on, you know, civilians in -- within their territory, that's the kind of situation, kind of the wave point here   where one could go one way where there's less conflict and less of an escalation, but the other -- I'm afraid more likely path is that there will at least be the degree of escalation that could result in further conflict and further attacks like we're seeing tonight.",

He -- we understand, however, was involved in the operations room, the central operations room for military operations of Hezbollah. So, if that was the case, he's obviously very much involved in the day-to-day decisions about where to strike, what to strike with. Now, today, Hezbollah is reporting that they have conducted 11 strikes on targets in Israel or Israeli-occupied territory, which is a number somewhat larger than the daily average. Now, obviously, this is the kind of commander that Israel would like to strike. Until now, the Israelis have killed perhaps as many as 400 Hezbollah members since October. Some of them fairly senior field commanders, not necessarily sort of the men who oversee the broad width of the operations that Hezbollah conducts. However, this man, Fuad Shukr, it does appear to be the most senior commander yet that has been targeted by the Israelis. Now, we haven't heard officially from Hezbollah whether he survived the attack, but certainly, we're hearing from multiple other sources that we cannot confirm, including Iran and others that he is survived the attack.

In fact, in September 1997, I interviewed Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary- General of Hezbollah in that very neighborhood, of course, reaching him involved getting into a car with the blinds tightly shut, so, I don't know exactly where we interviewed him, but I suspect it was probably in that area. So, this is an area of intense interest to the Israelis. They keep a very close eye on it, to the extent they can -- now, we heard that in the hours before this strike, there was Israeli war planes in the air that broke the sound barrier above the southern suburbs of Beirut. So, this is an area the Israelis have always been very interested in, and it's also an area because of the presence of so many important officials from Hezbollah where security is very tight. For instance, in Beirut, when you go out with a camera, you can shoot almost anywhere, nobody ask you any questions. But if you go into that part of town, you have to inform Hezbollah that you're going, to avoid any trouble. So, it's known as sort of a high security zone. There are Lebanese army checkpoints on the outskirts. Now, they were set up in the aftermath of several car bombs going back more than ten years in the area.

The IDF says it carried out what it called the target to strike in response to the weekend attack, if you remember, that killed 12 children in the Golan Heights. Hezbollah had denied responsibility for that attack. Now, Lebanese state media report that today's strike was carried out by a drone that fired three missiles and that at least one person was killed. That's what we're hearing. We've been here in the last 10 minutes or so. Now, CNN cannot independently confirm those details. A source telling CNN Israel notified the United States of its plans ahead of that attack. Meanwhile, we have received new video of the strike that really set this off. And I just do want to warn you that the video is distressing. The video shows the moment that rocket struck the football pitch this weekend. The first few seconds show -- if we're going to play it, children playing, then an air raid siren starts to sound. Apologies. That is not the right video. As soon as we have the right video, we should bring to you. Guys, let me know when you have that video so we can play it out. It is important to add the context, to be -- it explains really some of the tit for tat that we are seeing between both sides. Here is the video playing.

Maha, to you first. You're in Beirut. Just give me a sense of what you're hearing, of what you're understanding from your contacts, your sources on the ground.",

Imean, the city's been a state of heightened anxiety for the past -- since the -- I mean, the unfortunate and horrific attack in Majdal Shams. And tonight, everybody's just back at home waiting to see what's going to happen next. I think everyone was hoping -- we were very much hoping that the -- Israel would not attack the southern suburbs of Beirut, that they would stay away from highly dense -- densely populated civilian areas. Because then that is going to probably solicit a much stronger response from Hezbollah than would have been the case had the attack happened in a less populated area against the weapons depot, et cetera. So, there's a lot of anxiety. There's a lot of concern. There's a lot of worry. Now, the fact that Hezbollah is saying that the strike did not succeed and taking out Fuad Shukr, who support -- apparently was the target, may lessen the impact a little bit, but not a lot because we're hearing of at least 10 injured and two civilian -- I mean, 10 civilian injured and two killed so far. And most likely, the toll will go up given how densely populated the area is.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's certainly an expectation that Hezbollah would respond, but in speaking withofficials over the past few days, as this response was expected, there was a hope that Hezbollah would read the Israeli response in a way that they would respond rationally. So, the big question now is whether this official has been killed. And I just heard those reports that he has not. I should note that Fuad Shukr, if he was indeed the target, he's not just wanted by Israel, he's officially wanted by the United States as well. He's on the U.S. State Department's Rewards for Justice website with a $5 million bounty on his head. If he was not hit and killed by Israel tonight, does that -- that begs -- then begs the question, will Israel go farther? I think what Israel is trying to telegraph here in a -- in what is a very precise strike, albeit in Dahieh, in the Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut, is that this is possibly the extent of their goals. If they were to go broader than this, if they were to target civilian infrastructure, if they were to go after the center of Beirut or the airport, then you could certainly be in a situation where we'd be very worried about an expanding conflict. But what we've been hearing from U.S. officials in the lead up to this and since this strike happened is that they don't seem terribly worried that this is going to spiral out of control. Just yesterday, the White House's John Kirby saying. that fears of that expansion are exaggerated. In the moments following the strike, we, again, heard from the White House, from Karine Jean-Pierre in the White House press briefing room, saying it is not inevitable that this turns into a larger conflict. So, they do appear to be relatively confident that this will stay contained, at least for now. But of course, Isa, as you know, so many uncertainties.",

I mean, that is one of the going to be -- that is always one of the first questions that we hear in Washington ask to U.S.officials, to what extent they're aware of Israel's plans, and they're not always aware of Israel's plans. Of course, these are two very close allies, but the U.S. and Washington are not always kept abreast of what Israel is planning. In this case, according to our colleague, Jennifer Hansler, there was a message sent via security channels from Israel to the United States that this was going to happen. It's unclear when that message was sent. But this is a good sign that Israel is keeping the U.S. abreast of what it intends to do. And likely is an indication, certainly when you hear what Karine Jean-Pierre then said, that this might not escalate farther. This has been the nightmare scenario, Isa, that one of these Hezbollah rockets would hit Israeli children and cause this situation to spiral out of control. What I've been told by officials in the past few days is that they believe this was an errant Hezbollah rocket, that this was a mistake, that rocket that hit and killed those 12 children in Majdal Shams. And of course, it's worth noting that this is what is considered internationally as Israeli occupied territory and the Druze community there, in many ways, rejects Israel and rejects Israeli citizenship. But Israel certainly saw this as an attack on Israeli territory. And then, we heard Prime Minister Netanyahu threaten what he called severe retaliation. What we're seeing now, is that the extent of it or is there more to come? We have to wait and see.",

There's a parallelsimultaneous effort led by an official named Amos Hochstein, who has been shuttling back and forth between Israel and Lebanon for the past few months, trying to get to a place where there is quiet. Now, so much of it, it is believed, hinges upon the war ending in Gaza. But Israel certainly wants to separate those two, essentially, and see an end to the fighting up there in a way that those tens of thousands of Israelis can return home. We should note tens of thousands of Lebanese citizens have also had to move away from the border. The outlines of a deal that has not yet been accomplished are that Hezbollah would move back from the southern border of Lebanon about six miles or 10 kilometers. But at the same time, when you see the intensity of the cross-border skirmishes, there is concern that Israel is simply going to say, well, diplomacy doesn't work. We need to go in militarily, whether that's on the ground or from the skies, and that could precipitate a war that would be very, very different from the one we're seeing in Gaza because of the staggering arsenal and capacity that Hezbollah has.

Israel has invaded Lebanon multiple times, 1982, 1978, '82, '96. So, it's been it's been recurrent. So, there is a lot of concern and fear that this may happen. There's also a lot of cynicism about Israel using this -- the horrific attack in Majdal Shams for its own purposes to try and get rid of a commander or target an area that it has not targeted in the past, primarily because, as Alex mentioned, this is occupied territory. Internationally, is it's an occupied Syrian territory. Many of these children in -- or the residents of Majdal Shams that don't even have Israeli citizenship. So, there is a lot of cynicism around that. There are more than 20,000 children who have been affected at least in one way or the other in Gaza over the past eight, nine months. On the part of Hezbollah, their calculus is they really do not want to escalate. They understand that an escalation and the conflict, you know, to quote the Israeli defense establishment, can easily send Lebanon back to the stone age and it will affect all Lebanese, not just Hezbollah areas. I think on the part of Israel, and we've seen that over the past -- again, almost now 10 months. We've seen that on the part of -- in the way they've responded. Israel has been carrying out targeted assassinations. Almost 400 members of Hezbollah have been killed so far. And the retaliation has remained within certain limits.",
