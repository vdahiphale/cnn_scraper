And they're both likely to talk about the strike on Damascus that killed very senior Israeli -- Iranian commanders.And I think this is something where France potentially can play a diplomatic role because of its relationship and involvement in Lebanon. Macron has visited on several occasions. So the French diplomatic political outreach to Lebanon it can be useful because this is where Iran's principal proxy Hezbollah is located. And, of course, the tensions between Hezbollah and Israel have been escalating. There are elements within the Israeli military and political structures who would like to see a bigger confrontation with Hezbollah because they see them as a potential threat going forward, and that this would be the right time to diminish that threat. So, if Iran is to follow through on its statement that it will take decisive action, and there will be a response because it alleges that Israel was responsible for that strike in Damascus yesterday, then Hezbollah would likely be the proxy that they would choose to do that. So in that context, France can play a role there. But, of course, bringing a ceasefire to Gaza is important. And the French have a U.N. resolution that they're preparing at the moment. So, undoubtedly, the text of that will get some discussion as well. But a lot of this meeting between the defense minister, foreign minister and the president of France with Secretary of State Antony Blinken is going to focus on Ukraine. And I think we've got a sense of that when he met with the defense minister. They looked at artillery shells and Secretary Blinken spoke about he'd never seen in 30 years, you know, so much burden sharing in terms of supporting Ukraine. But at the same time, there's a bit of a nudge here for France because some European nations, Germany in particular, feels that perhaps France isn't doing enough to support Ukraine, although over the weekend, France did announce a new packet of security measures, armored vehicles, used armored fighting vehicles to be given to Ukraine, more missiles to be given to Ukraine. So that's, I think visually, that's the theme of the meeting here. But talking about the coordination, talking up the good points, I think behind the scenes really making sure that all European partners doing everything they can. And the United States sees France as a leading European partner that sets -- helps set the trend and agenda within the European Union.",

The appeals court said that they will hear the arguments in September, and he is challenging the judge's finding that we found him liable for fraud and imposed that large amount of money, half a billion dollars that Trump has to come up with.

It just says that Trump couldn't make comments about potential witnesses about prosecutors in the case, but not the district attorney.He's a public figure and about court staff members and also said that prosecutors' family and the court family members were off limits. And the reason why the judge imposed a gag order was because prosecutors came forward with some data showing that when Trump was making a lot of comments last year after he was indicted, that the office had seen a spike in threats. They'd received envelopes with white powder that turned out to be non- toxic, but they saw an increase in threats. So, the judge imposed this limited gag order the day after Trump began making comments on his social media platform about the judge, who is not covered by the gag order, but also the judge's daughter because she works for a Democratic political campaign. Trump was posting photos of her. He released her name on one of his post. And so, prosecutors then went back to the judge saying, you know, we think the gag order should include these family members, does it? And the judge came back last night saying it didn't include them, but it does now. And part of the reason is the judge had said that this is no longer just a mere possibility or reasonable likelihood that there exists a threat to the integrity of the judicial proceedings. The threat is very real. Admonitions are not enough, nor is reliance on self- restraint. So the judge putting in place this gag order, also because he said prosecutors had represented to him that some witnesses have been concerned that if they testify in this case, they will be under attack and their family members will come under attack. Judge saying that his job here is to ensure the integrity and the fair trial in this case. And so that is why he is limiting what Trump can say. Now, Trump is out with a statement today where he is again critical of the judge, but he does not touch the judge's daughter or any other family members in his post this morning.",

The first case dealt with whether Florida's Constitution has the right to privacy and therefore guarantees the right to an abortion.The conservative leaning court here in Florida said that the right to privacy in the state Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. And so it allowed Florida's current 15-week ban to take effect. As you noted, last year, the Florida legislature passed a stricter six-week ban on abortion. But that legislation, that law was put on hold until the Florida Supreme Court decided on the constitutionality of that 15-week ban. And so as you also made clear, this decision clears the way for that six-week ban to take effect here in Florida in about 30 days. Florida now joins a list of states across the southeast of the United States, where abortions have some type of restriction, if not an outright ban. And Planned Parenthood of Florida here said that this is not just going to impact women that live in Florida, but women that have been traveling to Florida from some of these other states across the southeast, noting that the access to abortion services in Florida is about to get a little bit more difficult. Now, abortion providers really anticipated the court's decision yesterday, saying that they have a plan in place to try to get women to other states that currently do not have a restriction on abortions. Now, yesterday the Supreme Court -- the Florida Supreme Court rather also issued a separate ruling clearing the way for a constitutional amendment to go before the voters in November. The language around that ballot would allow for the expansion of abortion rights in Florida. Essentially, the court said that the current understanding of the Florida state -- the Florida Constitution rather, does not -- the privacy under that does not guarantee the right to an abortion, but that voters will decide in November if the right to privacy under the Florida Constitution should must protect the right to an abortion. It is important to note here, Amara, that in order for this ballot amendment to pass, it would require 60 percent of voters to approve it. We can expect this issue to, of course, no doubt play out in the presidential election cycle here in Florida going into November, and we expect the issue to come up later today when Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra talks about this issue during a stop here in Florida.",

The decision by Florida's Supreme Court to allow a vote on a state constitutional amendment in November relating to abortion is an issue that the Biden campaign believes can work in their favor.That is something that the campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, outlined in a memo last night, where she tried to argue that this -- these rulings by the state Supreme Court have basically imposed a ban on abortion across the Southeast, including in states like Georgia and North Carolina, where there are stringent limits relating to abortion. Now, the Biden campaign has long argued that they believe reproductive rights will be a galvanizing issue for voters in November, especially among women, independent and moderate voters. And they've talked about other ballot initiatives in battleground states like Arizona and Nevada that they believe could work in their favor as well.

I mean, it's just so volatile that it's really going to be hard to predict. There's going to be really wild ups and downs.And what's interesting is one of the reasons why I think this stock fell so sharply yesterday may have had to do with a little bit of confusion. Accountants put out a warning in the SEC filing where they said that Trump media's losses are so severe that they, quote, \"raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\" Now that is Wall Street speak for they could go out of business. But I think there's a big asterisk here because that warning likely predated the blockbuster merger of last week. And that merger didn't just bring Trump media public, it also led to a cash infusion of $300 million and experts tell me that that cash infusion should buy this company time to try to build out its infrastructure. And analysts tell me that 2024 is really going to be a make or break year for this company. So listen, Amara, I think everyone should fasten their seatbelts because this wild ride is just getting started.",

But the criticism hasn't deterred viewers entirely. During opening weekend in Japan, the movie grossed $2.5 million. Abroad, the highly lauded film won seven Oscars this year, including the coveted Best Picture and Best Actor awards. Christopher Nolan, who also took home Best Director, will receive a knighthood in Britain for his services to film. But despite the film's global accolades, Japanese viewers tread lightly, wary of how the West remembers and depicts history from 78 years ago, a past far from forgotten in Japan.
