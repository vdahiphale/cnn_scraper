      "sentences": "It is 8On CNN NEWSROOM, and let's get right to the news. From Gaza to Lebanon, to northern Israel, the wars in the Middle East are intensifying on multiple fronts following a deadly weekend, yet one more in the region. Earlier today, Israel struck a Christian majority village 62 miles north of Beirut, killing 19 people. The strike destroyed an entire building, housing people who had the bombardment earlier in southern Lebanon. In Tel Aviv, sirens blared as the IDF intercepted three projectiles fired from Lebanon targeting central Israel. This comes a day after a Hezbollah drone struck and Israeli army base killing four soldiers there. As Israel fights Hezbollah in the north, it is ramping up its war in Gaza in the south. On Sunday, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 40 people well, 13 of them, children. One strike targeted the Al Asa hospital, setting the courtyard there ablaze, as you can see. The IDF said it was a precise strike on a Hamas command and control center. That is language the IDF has repeatedly used to justify attacks on civilian infrastructure since the war began, often with civilian casualties. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem. Nic, there was some reporting that Israel might pause strikes on Beirut amid understandings, quote, unquote, with U.S. Now, Netanyahu says Israel will continue to strike Beirut. Do we know what the truth is here?",

This is important to Israel because Iran launched ballistic missiles more than 180 just about two weeks ago, and if that continues, Israel feels it needs a better defense system and the THAAD will be part of that.And there was an understanding that seemed to come about because of the way the Prime Minister Netanyahu was getting a lot of criticism because the IDF has been striking in the southern suburbs of Beirut, but now been sort of striking targets, chasing targets into the central Beirut right up until this weekend, a high civilian death toll. And the sense was that maybe there's some kind of quid pro quo here. But when the prime minister visited that IDF base, where Hezbollah drone killed four soldiers and wounded more than 60 other people. Eight of those soldiers very seriously wounded. The prime minister struck a very, very tough position in a strong response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Then for the prime minister here, there's probably little doubt in his mind that that is a place that cannot be off-limits because Hezbollah may just choose to hide out there.",

The U.S. has made it clear that it wants to consult with Israel on how it responds to the Iranian ballistic missile launches from the beginning of October and have a sense of how this will all play out. So, this at least the deployment of a THAAD, a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense System to Israel, at least in theory, gives the U.S. some leverage on these discussions and some consideration within Israel's own planning for this.We've also reported that the Israeli security cabinet hasn't come to an end. Agreement or a final decision on how to respond to that Iranian ballistic missile barrage from earlier this month on October 1st. Israel had been asking for this system for at least several weeks according to a U.S. defense official and a source familiar with the conversations. The defense official says it goes at least as far back as the Israeli strike that killed Hassan Nasrallah in late September. So now it has this system there. It will add quality. It is a very capable anti-ballistic missile system, but also quantity, the number of ballistic missiles that Iran is capable of launching can simply overwhelmed Israel's own system to the U.S. adds to that. As for the timing, we are all very much expecting that at some point, Israel will carry out its own response to the Iranian ballistic missile barrage, but they're clearly taking their time about this. And then Iran itself has vowed to respond on its own it. So, is a critical moment and the U.S. has made its commitment clear, it will stand by Israel's defense as the White House has said, it will do. And, Jim, it's worth pointing out the U.S. doesn't have many of these systems. So to deploy it to one place, frankly means you don't have it somewhere else. So, this is very much a statement of where the U.S. sees the need and where the U.S. sees its own priorities at the moment no question.",

Oren Liebermann, thanks so much.Here to discuss the state of this expanding war, retired Colonel Peter Mansoor, former aide to General David Petraeus during the Iraq war, a senior fellow now at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies. Good to have you back. Hezbollah has more military capacity than Hamas, but still both of them significant and you now have Israel fighting Hezbollah in the north, Hamas in the south as it has for more than a year now, it is carrying out strikes against the Houthis all the way in Yemen, more than 1,000 miles away, and now contemplating a large retaliatory strike against Iran. Can Israel and how long can Israel carry out a war on four fronts? COL. PETER MANSOOR (RET.), FORMER AID TO GENERAL DAVID PETRAEUS: Israel can, Israel clearly is on a full war footing. And I think what they are doing is sequencing the, these events. So the war in Gaza continues, but it is scaling down to more targeted strikes against identified Hamas positions. The war in southern Lebanon now, it takes precedence against Hezbollah. They've done a lot of decapitation of Hezbollah's leadership. And now they're seeking out arms caches, rank and file members, and so forth, in order to degrade its capacity. And the war with Iran is one that is probably the most important, but I think Israel is being very cautious in terms of its response. It doesn't want a full blown escalation and two constant interchanges of ballistic missiles back-and-forth. But on the other hand, it can't just allow Iran to target Israeli territory without response.",

U.S. officials have said there is no evidence Iran right now ispreparing for such a step. But I wonder, is it possible in your view that Iran might be more likely to do so, given the increasing threat from Israel, and Israeli consideration, it seems, striking its nuclear facilities, that unwittingly, in effect, the response could bring about the outcome, the -- certainly Israel, perhaps the region and the U.S. doesn't want, which would be a nuclear Iran?",

It'll get U.N. condemnation. It may get a military strike, including U.S. forces.So I think these Iranian leadership would have to think long and hard before going that route.

That includes, for example, forgivable loans to entrepreneurs have up to $20,000, promoting apprenticeships and also legalizing recreational marijuana, among other measures. Taken together, it's a sweeping proposal to, again, try to lock in those Black voters. Now, polls show that she has the majority of Black voters behind her. But the erosion of support is the reason that some of her advisers remain concerned, concerned, especially that they'll sit out the election or vote for her Republican rival, Donald Trump. So in addition to her unveiling of those proposals today here in Pennsylvania, also head to Michigan tomorrow to participate in a radio town hall with Charlamagne Tha God, who has millions of listeners, many of whom are Black and later throughout the week, she will also be making additional stops in Michigan. Now, of course, the other line of attack that were likely to hear from the voters vice president today and over the course of the week, is that former President Donald Trump is not being transparent by not participating, for example, and a \"60 Minutes\" interview as she did or releasing his medical records as she did this weekend. So the Vice President expected to also lean in on that over the course of the week. But the focus certainly in this travel blitz lets over the course of the week to the blue wall states, which the campaign sees as one of the surest ways to victory and to 270 in November is the vice president doubling down with these proposals and again, trying to reach those voters who perhaps still remain unconvinced -- Jim.

And at the end of the day, talking to his senior advisers, they believe that it doesn't really matter where Donald Trump is, that, that the message will get across. That national media will cover it, that it will be across the airwaves, that it will be cut and put on social media. And again, to bring this back to those low propensity voters, part of the reason its hard to reach those voters is that they don't engage with politics in a typical way, meaning the Trump team is relying on things like podcasts, like YouTube streamers, like interviews with specific celebrities that are just on social media to try and reach those pockets of people. So they believe that an event like Coachella, California, once its clipped, once its put out there on social media, could reach just as many people as they an event in Pennsylvania in a swing you say talking to voters.

But, you know, similar as when she talked about home health care, a significant policy idea last week on the new aimed at older women.I think more important was her reminding those Black voters about everything else that comes with Trump beyond, their assumption that he is better on the economy. I think one of the most ominous trends for Democrats in the final weeks really has been going on for months, Jim, of this campaign is that Trump's retrospective job approval is rising both in swing-state polling like \"The Wall Street Journal\" poll last week and national polling like the NBC poll. And what that says to me is that voters are primarily viewing him now through the lens of what they don't like about what's happened the last few years under Biden, principally inflation and the border and everything else, they didn't like about Trump when he was actually president all the other factors that kept his approval rating from ever reaching 50 percent while he was actually an office, those are fading in memory. Harris has not really put a lot of emphasis on reminding voters about everything else that comes with him. But you saw in an interview with Roland Martin that she was doing a little more of that.

Now, they're perhaps at best weeks away. I wonder what your view is ofIran's power right now given that Hezbollah has been struck, so decisively. I think we could say reasonably with the leadership from top to bottom struck many of them eliminated, many of their weapons caches eliminated. Is Iran -- is Iran's ability to strike Israel actually reduced? Has Israel successfully reduced that, that strike capability, not just by weakening Hezbollah, but also by an in each of these Iranian ballistic missile attacks being able to shoot down the vast majority of them before they hit their targets.",

Israel is internationally condemned. There's divisions within Israeli society with protests every day in Tel Aviv. And so when they talk about the destruction of Israel, it isn't necessarily with a bomb that would take out a city, but its actually with the facts that these -- these different fissions in the Israeli society and what's been happening on an international front is actually helping with the destruction of Israel.
