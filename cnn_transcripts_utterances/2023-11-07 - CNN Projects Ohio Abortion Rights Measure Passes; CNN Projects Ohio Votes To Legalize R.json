But in States that have trended blue, in the last 20 years?

VIVEK RAMASWAMY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look, I voted no on that, earlier today, before flying down here to Miami. But my view is on the merits, our pro-life movement, and I am part of it, needs to be better about the way we discuss this issue, actually talk about greater access to adoption, to child care, further -- even go further to sexual responsibility for men. I think that too few of us are talking about these issues that can say \"We're not in this.\" It's not about a men's rights versus women's rights issue. It's a human rights issue. The fact of the matter is Clarence Thomas brought up an example, in the Dobbs case, of a pregnant woman, who was assaulted, and asks the question of \"Who in this country would say that that criminal doesn't deserve liability for that death?\" I haven't met one yet, Kaitlan. And so, I think we're more united on the pro-life instincts than the pro-life movement has actually been good at representing so far. But we need to talk about the issue very differently, in order to bring people along here. I will say that it was also outspent in Ohio, by many multiples, the yes versus no.

That means counties, where we have no votes at all. So, you just want to be cautious, and wait. Again, especially, this is the big one. And it's a Democratic stronghold. But you'd have to see something quite overwhelming there. But you still count them. And we see how we go. You look around elsewhere. You come down, just looking in the blue counties, to see what you do, is, at this point in the night, you're looking, so what's blue, right? The Democrat's behind.

So, my theory on these things is, it looks like Governor Reeves is out to an early lead. However, with the largest counties still out, and a Democratic stronghold still out, where we saw from our own reporter on the scene, long lines, let's let them count votes.
