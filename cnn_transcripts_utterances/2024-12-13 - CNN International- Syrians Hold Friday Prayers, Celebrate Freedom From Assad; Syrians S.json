But, as life slowly begins to return to normal, the UN chief says that he is concerned about, quote, \"violations of serious sovereignty\" following Israeli airstrikes and the deployment of the IDF troops behind the buffer zone. Despite that, Israel's Defense Minister is ordering the military to stay on captured territory. Meanwhile, America's top diplomat and the Turkish Foreign Minister wrapped up a meeting a short time ago on the future of Syria. Antony Blinken is in the region trying to get Middle Eastern nations to support a peaceful transition.

Another man points to their tattered clothing, evidence he says that most were detainees at the much feared Saydnaya prison. Even in death, they are still only identified by numbers.

Turning now to the latest on the investigation into the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, two court dates are now set in Pennsylvania as the suspect Luigi Mangione fights extradition to New York. The first hearing concerns state charges brought against him by Pennsylvania. A few days later, he will return to court to challenge the judge's decision to deny him bail.Now, separately, according to ABC News, prosecutors in New York have started presenting evidence against Mangione to a grand jury. We've also learned that neither Mangione nor his mother were insured by UnitedHealthcare, the company whose CEO he is accused of murdering. Meanwhile, we are hearing that the alleged killer is not interacting with other inmates in prison. CNN's Jason Carroll has more details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Luigi Mangione is fighting extradition to New York. While that happens, this is the prison where he is being held. It's the State Correctional Institution at Huntingdon, the oldest operating state prison in Pennsylvania. Mangione's cell looks much like the one you see here, according to a law enforcement source. His actual cell is 15 by six feet. A Department of Corrections spokesperson says he is in a single cell and not in solitary confinement. He is not interacting with other inmates at this time. He has a bed, a sink, toilet and a desk with a seat. STEVE BOHNEL, PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE: It's always interesting to see a prison in your backyard that frankly most people wouldn't be able to pick out of a map or wouldn't know the name of, and now everyone is interested in the type of food he is eating, the cell block that he is in. CARROLL (voice-over): Meals at the facility are served three times a day, 06:15, 1040, and supper at 05:15. On the menu, Mangione has a choice between chicken parmesan and a dish called pizza beans. The Department of Correction says Mangione has taken his meals in his cell and is not interacting with other inmates, adding, all inmates are afforded time outside their cells, even if they are a higher custody level. Mangione's case has received a great deal of national attention. So, perhaps no surprise, he is already known to some inmates. That type of notoriety is also an added security concern at a correctional facility.",

The prison just can't risk it.CARROLL (voice-over): Huntingdon's inmates have made headlines before Mangione. Cosmo DiNardo, who was convicted of murdering four men and burying them on his parents' property, served part of his life sentence there. Nick Yarris also served time there. Yarris was wrongly convicted and sentenced to death in 1982 on rape and murder charges, his sentence overturned in 2003 due to DNA evidence.

Something to keep in mind is that there is a wide variety of drone technology that can be used to assess threats in the airspace. They all have limited capabilities that they don't see for an infinite amount of distances. And so, you really have to have those technologies deployed at the critical infrastructure locations that need to be protected. So, you can't rely on a detection system that's 20 miles away to be able to detect a drone or suspected drone that's 20 miles away. It's just -- that's just not really -- I mean, it's possible, but some of that equipment is really expensive and more meant for military purposes.So, we have to change the laws that would allow owners and operators of critical infrastructure to use, as well as public safety, to use a wide range of detection technologies. And then the other thing that needs to happen is we need to begin a pilot program that would authorize state and local law enforcement under the direction of the DoJ and the DHS to begin to thoughtfully and carefully deploy this technology, to assess and then, when necessary, respond to threats in the airspace. Something to keep in mind is that this technology is -- can be -- increase the risk to the national airspace as well as the people and infrastructure that we're trying to protect. So, it's got to be deployed very carefully. Just the fact that there is a drone in the airspace doesn't mean that it needs to be defeated or brought down. There needs to be a more careful thought process that goes into this.",

His national celebrity really is attributable to the success of his reality TV program. And I think Michael Wolff wrote a book in the first Trump administration. It was one of the first sort of tell-alls to come out, and he said something that I think is true, that Trump regards every day as like a television episode with a beginning, a middle and an end, and he is intent on holding your attention and getting you to come back tomorrow.Can you imagine if Xi Jinping were sitting there? First of all, where would he sit? That would be just an interesting dynamic. Actually, the more that I think about it, I'll bet that Joe Biden, President Biden, would give him his seat, and probably Secretary Clinton would give him her seat. There are a lot of individuals. It's going to be so awkward. Kamala Harris, here, Xi Jinping, you can have my seat. But, seriously, like, where would you put him? What would the protocol be? But, for Trump, it would be a must-watch TV moment.",

I would like to think we can appropriately mourn what was an assassination, horrible, horrible event at the start of day in Midtown Manhattan, and say that that violence is never justified, and at the same time recognize there are so many shortcomings in the United States' healthcare delivery as compared to other nations. We spend so much more, and yet have less of a life expectancy, among other metrics.But, I'm uncomfortable. I'm really -- I mean, there are wanted posters being posted today in Midtown Manhattan of healthcare CEOs, and I worry about the contagion, and I worry about the message that it sends, if all of a sudden we respond to the criticisms that were being raised by this gunman. But, I've been overwhelmed with telephone calls on my radio program for the last 10 days of people who say what happened to that CEO was terrible. But, may I tell you what happened to a member of my family with coverage? Everybody, it seems, has a story of discontent.",
