And we just learned he will soon launch a 27-day blitz with every key battleground state in his path to support Kamala Harris.As for Harris, she's waking up in battleground Michigan this morning, fresh off another endorsement, this time from the boss, Bruce Springsteen, as new reporting from over 30 states finds that more than 1 million Americans have already voted, just 32 days now left to go. Some context to that 1 million number, that is less than 1 percent of the roughly 158 million votes in 2020, because I know that you were counting. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us right now for much more on this. Priscilla, what's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Kate, there are multiple strategies at play going into Election Day. One of them, campaign aides tell me, looks a lot like what happened yesterday, going to those red rural counties, counties that voted by Trump in some cases overwhelmingly in 2020. But their strategy here is to compete everywhere and lose by less, just narrow the margins in some of these counties, again, including those that voted for Trump in 2020. So, that is one strategy that is unfolding. We're seeing bits of it yesterday, and we will see more of it in the coming weeks. The other part of this, too, is continuing to mobilize voters in those Democratic areas. You'll see that today with the vice president in Michigan, where she is going to have a rally. But, of course, the other part of this is surrogates, and you mentioned it there, former President Barack Obama, he is one of the party's most popular leaders, and he is going to be hitting the trail in a blitz over the next several days where he is going to kick it off in Pittsburgh next Thursday.It'll be his first public campaign appearance since the Democratic National Convention. And there is no doubt that it is exactly these types of mobilizations that the campaign is looking for to galvanize voters, to get them excited, and most importantly, to get them to the polls, especially with early voting already underway in some states. Now, aides say that it's an all-hands-on-deck moment. That is certainly what we are seeing unfold. Again, as they target specific areas, those red rural counties, they go to those Democratic areas, keep the voters going and excited there, and then also use Obama across the country.",

As you pointed out, it's the first time that we'll have they'll have some sort of joint appearance since 2020. But, I mean, I've covered Trump for a very long time. I was on the Hill during the House January 6th committee hearings.To see Brian Kemp and Donald Trump together today in Georgia is pretty stunning. It's something I never would have imagined four years ago while covering all of this. But they're going to be in Georgia today together for a briefing on the ground about the state's hurricane recovery efforts. Now, I am told by a source familiar with the planning that the two men were invited separately by officials on the ground in Columbia County, but, of course, they will be appearing together. There's expected to be some sort of press availability after this. And, again, and you mentioned this, John, but Donald Trump has had very, very harsh words and criticism for Brian Kemp over the last four years. Even as recently as August, Donald Trump, during a rally in Atlanta, was criticizing Brian Kemp, calling him a bad guy, you know, claiming that he is not a true Republican, criticizing his wife. I mean, there's been, you know, a lot of love lost between these two men. However, really, Donald Trump has changed his tune in recent months as he realizes that, one, Brian Kemp is a very popular Republican governor in the state. A lot of voters in the state are fans of Brian Kemp. And Georgia, of course, is a state that both Trump and the Harris campaigns see as crucial to finding victory in their path forward to 270 electoral votes in November. So, Trump has sort of embraced Brian Kemp in recent months. We've seen Kemp doing some fundraising events for the Trump campaign. I will argue that, you know, over the last -- in the beginning, in the primary, Brian Kemp did not come out and endorse Donald Trump early, but he had always said that he would support the Republican nominee. And so today you're going to see these two unlikely, I guess, allies now appearing for the first time again since 2020. John?",

Three former Memphis police officers have been acquitted on the harshest federal charges that they faced in the fatal beating death of Tyre Nichols last year. Video of the incident showed officers punching and kicking Nichols and also hitting him with police batons after a traffic stop. Autopsy results showed that Nichols died from blows that he suffered after that violent encounter with police.Though, the officers were acquitted on the most serious charges, all three of them, you see, there were convicted on charges of witness tampering related to the cover up after the fact seen instrument.

You have multiple defendants mixed verdict and on the top count, which really deals with the civil rights violations of Tyre Nichols and his death. All of the officers were acquitted on that. The prosecutors just did not meet their burden.This was a fairly quick verdict. About six hours in, the jury comes back with their verdict. You know, one of the officers, Demetrius Haley, he's convicted of civil rights violations, but for the injuries to Tyre Nichols, sort of like an assault, and also for not giving him the care that he needed in the immediate afterwards. And then obviously all of the officers here are convicted of essentially a cover up here. They try to hide what they did with their bosses on body camera footage. You can hear them saying turn off your camera. You can also see them and hear them coming up with a story of what happened here. And so on that, the jurors convicted all three officers. And keep in mind, there were five officers in total involved in this. Two of them actually pleaded guilty and wound up cooperating with the government, with the United States.
