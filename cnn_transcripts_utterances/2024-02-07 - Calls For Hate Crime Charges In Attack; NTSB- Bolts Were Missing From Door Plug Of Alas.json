      "sentences": "Yeah. Well, for the companies, Poppy, there's very little risk. They're going to get the same dollars that they're going to get from distributors on cable for this venture. So going into it, it's likely going to be pretty profitable.The downside, though, is the pricing. So for something like this, you'll probably going to have to charge around $45.00 or $50.00, and people are already paying around $70.00 if you get something like YouTube TV -- maybe $70.00 or $80.00 if you're getting cable. So it's not that much cheaper I think that you're going to be able to pull people necessarily out of the cable bundle. What these executives at these companies are hoping is that they're going to capture more dollars from people who aren't paying for cable. Now, the downside for the consumer, of course, is that we're missing two major sports players. CBS is not involved. You know, CBS is airing the Super Bowl. They have a lot of major rights. And then, of course, Comcast NBC is not involved. And so you're going to get a huge sampling of sports but you're going to be missing some. And so you're going to have to make the decision about whether or not it's worth paying for this thing -- standalone -- if you still pay for cable because with cable you're getting everything.",
