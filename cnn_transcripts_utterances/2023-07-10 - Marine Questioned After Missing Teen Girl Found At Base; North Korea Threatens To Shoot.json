Pyongyang said it will shoot down U.S. surveillance planes that violate its air space.This comes amid already heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula as the U.S. and South Korea have been solidifying their defense alliance. CNN senior international correspondent, Will Ripley, joins us now from Taiwan. Will, I wonder, if this was a manned flight, that would be seen by the U.S. as an act of war. Does the U.S. consider this threat from North Korea genuine? And how are they responding?",

It was the largest loss of life during the Cold War when it comes to U.S. air crew. Thirty-one Americans died. So this does have historical precedent. And we are at a moment in time where, despite the fact that the eyes of the world are focused on China, focused on Ukraine, yet the tensions on the North Korean Peninsula and the militarization of the North Korean Peninsula is at an extraordinary level. I mean, you think about the fact that North Korea has tested about 100 missiles since January of last year. And now you have this. North Korea's leader's sister, the second most- powerful person probably in North Korea, she basically says that North Korean war planes repelled these U.S. spy planes that she accused without evidence of crossing into the North Korean Exclusive Economic Zone. The area within 200 nautical miles of their coast where they also control the natural resources. North Korea saying this happened just before 9:00 a.m. local time on Tuesday. And she's warning of what she said would be shocking consequences and decisive action, in her words, if the U.S. reconnaissance planes were crossed into the exclusive check zone. And she also said, if U.S. spy planes stay out of that area, they're not going to attack them. But still, this is incredibly concerning. You have North Korea responding to certain steps by the United States and South Korea in recent months. You had the announcement in April that for the first time since the 1980s, the U.S. is sending nuclear ballistic missile submarines to visit the Korean Peninsula. That is very angering to the North Koreans. These B-52 strategic bombers, which participated in South Korea and the United States military drills and you had the B-52 actually flown up, Jim, in response to the satellite launch. It was a failed launch but North Korea has vowed to put a satellite in space. Of course, you know, that has been accused for a long time of being a ballistic missile program in disguise. So certainly lots to be concerned about right now.",

Police say a gunman opened fire as bars and restaurants were closing in the city's popular warehouse district. There have now been at least 365 mass shootings so far this year in this country. This, according to the Gun Violence Archive. What a year. Also, former U.S. gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, was stabbed multiple times at a federal prison in Florida. The head of the local Corrections Officer Union tells CNN Nassar was stabbed twice in the neck, twice in the back, six times in the chest. He did survive. He is now hospitalized. He is serving decades in prison on state and federal charges. More than 150 women and girls said in court that he sexually abused them, including Olympic medalists. He admitted to criminal sexual contact and separately pleaded guilty of possessing child pornography. And former AT&amp;T executive, Randall Stevenson, has resigned from his position on the PGA tour's influential policy board. A source familiar with his resignation says that Stevenson wrote that he has quote, \"serious concerns about the tour's controversial partnership with the Saudi-backed LIV Golf.\" This comes as PGA Tour officials are set to testify tomorrow on that very topic to a key Senate subcommittee.",

And, Boris, we know, in this case, timing is a real point of tension between the two sides.The special counsel, Jack Smith, said he wants to have a, quote, \"speedy trial.\" He wants to move this along as quickly as possible. Former President Trump and his associate, Walt Nauta, have every incentive to want to delay this at least until after the election. That happens in ways both large and small. Here, right, this may feel incremental. Well, what is a few extra days, a few extra weeks? We saw, with his arraignment, it took a month for Walt Nauta to be arraigned. And all of these delays over time add up. The special counsel knows that, which is why we're seeing this rare pushback in this request. Saying, look, no, this is not in the public interest to delay this. You understood what was at stake. This hearing is about how classified materials will be handled. You need to get your lawyers and their clearances all in order. That is not a \"me\" problem. That's a \"you\" problem. It will be very interesting to see how the judge decides on this. Because everybody is watching Judge Cannon. She is a Trump appointee. And we have always known this would be one of the big things she would have to contend with. Trump is famous for delaying and drawing things out. Will she put limits on that, guardrails? Boris, we'll see what she says.",

We know, from talking to our sources, that there were several people willing to help him and his D.C.-based attorney, Stan Woodward, get through these proceedings, but it took, again, a month. It's all part of the strategy. But there is someone here calling balls and strikes and that's the judge. Let's see what she says about Friday's hearing.

But what the vampire facial is, I will break it down into three steps. It involves, number one, having your blood drawn. Number two, having platelet-rich plasma extracted from your blood. And number three, having that plasma then reinjected into your skin using micro-needling pins on your face. So that's how the procedure is performed. And at any point during that process, if blood-related waste is mishandled or if sanitation is not happening in between clients, that can raise the risk bloodborne infections like HIV spreading. And in New Mexico, health officials are urging any former client at the VIP Spa who has had an injection-related procedure, whether that's the vampire facial or whether it's Botox, that former client should get tested for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Health officials say that free testing is available at the Health Department in Albuquerque for patients, at South Valley Public Health office, to really, really track and diagnose any potential cases that might be related to that spa -- Jim?",
