Now a Category 5 hurricane, the highest category possible, with landfall in Florida just two days away as Tampa lies directly in the storm's path.",

And a year later, more than 100 are believed to still be held captive. Across Israel, people are gathering to commiserate and reflect, holding memorials at the Nova Music Festival and the Kibbutz, Nir Oz, sites where so many people were slaughtered. The survivors reliving their shared trauma on this solemn day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NOA ARGAMANI, FORMER HAMAS HOSTAGE (through translator): The entire country is in mourning. We've all lost someone close to us and we are all left with a huge hole in our hearts. I still don't know where to start picking up the pieces, how to find hope and how to look forward. I'm still asking why, why this happened, why it happened to our loved ones, to those dearest to us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And tonight that sentiment is palpable once again, as we are hearing the testimonials of so many of those who have lost loved ones on October 7th, and we have been witnessing extremely emotional scenes in this crowd as people have been breaking down, as they are continuing to grieve one year later.In addition to that, of course, we have also heard directly from former hostages and the families of hostages. I spoke today with Aviva Siegel, a former hostage herself, whose husband, an American-Israeli named Keith, is still being held hostage today, one year later. She told me that when they were in Gaza, he had told her not to cry when Hamas wanted to film a hostage video, and then in April she saw a video of her husband. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's just been hard to find words to describe the eye, the symmetry, like it is just incredibly strong right now. A Category 5 hurricane with 160 mph winds gusting up towards 200 mph.The rapid intensification this morning has been mind-blowing. We have seen an increase in the center winds, almost 100 mph in just 24 hours. It has just exploded in those incredibly warm ocean temperatures. It scrapes the Yucatan Peninsula as this massive Category 5 storm. It weakens some as it gets towards the Florida peninsula here, but we're still dealing with a major hurricane, a Category 3 or 4, in that Hurricane Watch area there in the pink. We'll start to find those impacts again going into Wednesday. That's when we'll start to find some of those outer bands coming in, that landfall somewhere on the west coast of Florida, sometime late on Wednesday. We are incredibly worried about this storm surge. The current forecast is for 8 to 12 feet for parts of Tampa Bay. They have never seen storms surge that high. They just hit records in Helene, and this could surpass that. Boris?",

That's why it's so critical that people move.And they don't have to go hundreds of miles. They just need to get out of those evacuation zones and move to higher ground. We can rebuild from the devastation, which I will not be surprised of astronomical numbers. We can't get people back if we lose them. And that's why as much as everybody is talking about what's going to be happening after the storm, I think we've got to stay focused on evacuation, move to higher ground if we hope to keep the loss of life as low as we can.",

But you've got to remember when they did the continuing resolution, they allocated about a quarter of the funding for the disaster relief fund going into next year.So initially it looks as though they have funding for the response. They definitely don't have money for recovery and there's a lot of federal programs besides FEMA that are going to need additional funds. So if the -- again, FEMA's watching that balance they're talking to White House OMB, they're talking to the congressional appropriators and they're all watching that level in the disaster relief fund. And if it gets down too low where it would start impacting response I would expect Congress to come back and work on something immediately. As long as that funding level continues to allow them to continue to respond, then coming back and going into this and deciding are they going to do this in the regular order of a budget or are they going to pass a special supplemental? And again I've lived this in previous disasters. The one thing I can tell you is Congress has yet to let FEMA run out of money in response.",
