The Republican lawmaker filed the request after an appeals court ruled that the grand jury could seek his testimony and that his phone calls to Georgia election officials are not constitutionally protected speech as he claimed. His request was filed with Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, who is considered likely to referred the matter to the full court. Election Day in the U.S. is just around the corner. At stake, control of Congress. Right now the Senate is split 50-50 between the two parties, with the vice president giving Democrats the tie-breaking vote for a majority. This year 35 of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs. CNN estimates 12 of those are Democrat or leaning that way and 20 solidly Republican or leading toward the GOP. Three states, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada, are still seen as up for grabs. In the House each of the 435 seats are in play. Every two years Democrats currently hold 220 seats. They need 218 to keep the majority. Right now looks like Republicans are slightly ahead with 212 seats. But with 18 others up for grabs it is far from a done deal. President Biden said his Democratic Party can pull out wins in the midterms, especially as the economy shows signs of improvement. On Friday he took credit for a drop in the federal deficit and claimed that Republicans would reverse those gains. CNN's Phil Mattingly reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

First, an acknowledgment that, as seemed clear by public polling over the course of the last couple of weeks, momentum is swinging back toward Republicans with just 18 days until the midterm elections.The president predicting it will come back toward Democrats, something we saw in the summer in large part because of the economy, something that has been a primary  vulnerability for many Democrats running in their districts or states over the last several weeks. Implicit in that comment was a reality that gas prices have started to tick down. They see a clear correlation between the president's approval, Democratic prospects in the midterms, really the mood of the country when it comes to the prices at the pump. The president also making clear something else that, in his view, this is not necessarily a referendum on his administration or on Democrats in power; it is a choice, a choice between Republicans and Democrats. The president, as he has held smaller, not major campaign rallies but smaller, policy driven events over the course of the last several wreaks, has been trying to make the point that they have delivered on a lot of the things the president campaigned on. On Friday that was talking about student loan cancellation:  over 22 million borrowers have already applied for cancellation of up to $10,000 in student debt. That is young voters, young Black voters. We talked about abortion earlier in the week; that's women, independents. You're seeing the White House very carefully calibrate events. They will be expanding those events, larger campaign events, in the closing days leading up to the midterm elections. It is still very much anyone's guess how things are going to end.

And then, of course, the third candidate, the lesser known one, Penny Mordaunt, the only one who has made it official that she wants to run. Each of these candidates, each of these individuals has to get 100 MPs to back them by Monday 2 pm in order for them to qualify. What happens after that is really a lightning speed process. To give you an idea, Kim, the last leadership contest, the one that brought in Truss, that took about three months. This is going to take about a week when it is all said and done. So Monday afternoon, depending on how many nominees there are, if three nominees, Conservative Party members are going to hold a vote, whittle that down to two nominees. And then there will be a second vote that will be the indicative vote to find out who MPs really want, who Conservative MPs really want. But again the indicative vote, because if it comes down to two nominees, it will go to Conservative Party members that will have an online vote. This is only about 200,000 people, Kim, who will get to determine the future of this country, who will get to determine the next prime minister of this country. That's why you hear so much controversy around this. People say this party simply doesn't have the mandate to rule anymore, they should call for a general election. That is the right thing to do, that is what the Labour Party says. But it is absolutely not required by the rules.

We're not talking of a dip in an Apple share; we are talking about devastation. Crops wilting, they are out of options. They walk, looking for any help they can get. And, there is help when they get to UNICEF. But some of them don't make it. Mothers bury their little ones on the way.",

Whether it is the Pakistan floods or across the war in Africa, what we're seeing in Nigeria, Somalia certainly now. We are seeing the impact of a changing climate.We are seeing the excesses of lifestyle from many parts of the world being paid for by the world's poorest children, children who do not really have a carbon footprint. And, if action is not taken, governments and big business do not fulfill their promises, stop as the U.N. secretary-general said, stop saying one thing and doing another. Stop lying, it is a climate crisis that is going to hit all corners of the world. Income will only protect people for a time, not forever.",

And you have a limited amount of time.Sometimes it is 60 or 90 minutes on the ground until wheels up, as they say, get out because that's how long it takes for a phone call and suddenly al-Shabaab is there. Unfortunately, over the last years, the United Nations humanitarian workers, colleagues on the front line every day, trying to reach or reaching hundreds of thousands of children for malnutrition treatment, half a million with clean water. They are at risk now. The U.N. has become a soft target. It is disgusting but you have to care for those people on the front lines. So that is the challenge, the most critical one is making sure aid doesn't go to them. And the umbrella of that is, as a colleague said to me, ensuring that humanitarian staff don't get beheaded.",

The world attention does get distracted. Many things are happening. People just want to catch their breath after COVID. But there are arguments, it is right in principle, you have to save these children's lives and they have had no responsibility for what is happening to their climate. But in practice as well, Kim, the World Bank tells us, get to a child with severe malnutrition a month earlier and you will increase that child's income going through their entire life. So practically and in terms of morally, there are so many reasons to act. The money is there. The world does have the money to act on this other crisis.",
