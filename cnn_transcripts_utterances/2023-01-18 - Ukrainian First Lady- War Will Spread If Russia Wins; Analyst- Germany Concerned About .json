He is under growing pressure to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine. And for more on that, we want to bring in CNN's Clare Sebastian, who joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So, as that pressure builds, how far might German Chancellor Scholz go in supporting Ukraine militarily? When he addresses the World Economic Forum, what are the expectations on the Leopard 2 battle tanks, particularly? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Rosemary. I think if Chancellor Scholz was under pressure before, he certainly is now following an impassioned, essentially pitch for more weapons that came from Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska at Davos on Tuesday. She essentially accused the collective, you know, powerful gathered at Davos, of not using their influence enough to counter the threat from Russia. Take a listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLENA ZELENSKA, FIRST LADY OF UKRAINE (through translator): We are facing the threat of a collapse of the world as we know it, the way that we are accustomed to it, or to what we aspire. What can be life in a world where tanks are allowed to strike at nuclear power stations?

Some have indicated, including Poland, they might be willing to commit their own tanks, but they need Germany's permission. So, the spotlight really is on Germany, all building up to that meeting in Ramstein on Friday, hosted by Germany with its new defense minister. That could potentially yield some results. Scholz has said in the past that he wants to do this in coordination with the entire Western alliance, including the United States.

We see the constant nuclear rhetoric that continue -- Russian occupation of Europe's biggest nuclear plant, which the Ukrainian first lady brought up in her speech at Davos. But I think this has also taken the debate over weaponry to a new level. The question of whether it's enough for the Western alliance to assess such the situation on the battlefield and wait for the attacks from Russia to get worse before providing new weaponry. This is something that the Lithuanian foreign minister questioned on our air earlier this week. CHURCH (voice over): All right. Clare Sebastian, many thanks. Joining us live from London.

KARADSHEH (voice over): Some Turkish officials also indicating that they might not take this to the Turkish parliament for a vote before elections that are expected here in May or June. Turkey has accused those two Nordic countries of harboring members of Kurdish separatist groups that Turkey views as a national security threat. They did sign a memorandum between these three countries between Turkey, Sweden, and Finland, in which they said they will be taking steps to address these national security concerns that Turkey brought up. Turkish officials are saying that some steps have been taken, but not enough has been done. They say they want to see more concrete steps taken before they go ahead and approve the membership that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent days also saying that they will not go ahead with this until Sweden and Finland hand over more than 100 individuals, they say, who are wanted by Turkey. But it's also very important to keep in mind that what Turkish officials say publicly doesn't necessarily reflect where things are in terms of negotiations, taking place behind closed doors that have continued now for months, especially at a time where Turkey is headed into elections. And we've heard from U.S. officials in the past, from NATO secretary general and others who believe that Turkey will eventually come around, and it will approve Finland and Sweden's membership. But some believe that what it's trying to do right now is use this situation and this leverage to try and extract concessions it has been after for a long time from these countries and others.
