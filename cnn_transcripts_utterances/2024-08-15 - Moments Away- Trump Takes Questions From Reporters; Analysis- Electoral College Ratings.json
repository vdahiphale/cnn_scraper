In just moments, Donald Trump is set to hold a news conference and take questions from reporters at his home in New Jersey. Now it's not exactly clear why the former president decided to hold the event today. It was announced a few days ago, exactly what he wants to discuss though. If you look at what's on your screen right now, there are groceries. It seems economic related. There are props. However, in recent days, allies have urged Trump to stay on message especially after his news conference last week that went like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We have somebody that in my opinion is more incompetent. Kamala, who by the way, is worse than Biden. And she's actually not as smart. Of course, there'll be a peaceful transfer and there was last time. Nobody was killed on January 6, but I think that the people of January 6 were treated very unfairly. You know, with Hillary Clinton, I could have done things to her that would have made your head spin. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech -- same number of people, if not, we had more. In history for any country, nobody's had crowds like I have. And you know that. I haven't recalibrated strategy at all. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, I'm told that Donald Trump is going to deliver remarks before that question-and-answer with reporters and his goal is to focus on the economy, to hammer Kamala Harris on inflation and specifically try to tie her to Joe Biden's policies on the economy, specifically when it comes to high grocery prices and the strain that people are feeling on their walls.And I do want you to look behind me. You can see a lot of props that Donald Trump and his campaign of laid out, different groceries, et cetera. That is to further emphasize his overall message and look, last night, we heard this as well. There's no question that this week, Donald Trump wants the focus to be on the economy and for his speech in North Carolina and for Donald Trump, I should say, he was pretty on message and focused for the former president. It was a smaller venue, a smaller crowd. And he spent a lot of time trying to hammer again, Harris on this issue, knowing that she is going to lay out a new economic policy tomorrow in North Carolina. Now, I'm interested to see what happens with this press conference. We know that Donald Trump as you mentioned, tends to riff, tend to go off script. That's specifically true when he answers questions from the press. So looking to see whether or not he actually stays on message today and is heeding the advice of many of his allies or telling him cease the personal attacks on Kamala Harris, begin talking about the things that we know you polled better on, including immigration crime, and the economy. Now, Phil, I also just want to put your attention to some other news we got today from Trump world, which is that he is bringing on a series of new Trump allies to his campaign. I think the biggest name you will recognize is Corey Lewandoski, Trump's former campaign manager, he was actually with Donald Trump from the start. Join that campaign back in June of 2015, has remained close to the campaign, but not an official part of it until today. He is back on we're told. And, look, I mean, they say that this has nothing to do with shaking up the rest of the campaign. Both Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, Donald Trump's senior or co-campaign managers our still on the team, they actually put out a statement supporting Lewandoski and the other higher. So, some news for you there. I'm sure he gets some questions about that today, too -- Phil.",

And we are hearing this from outside allies. We know Kellyanne Conway, his previous campaign manager went to Bedminster, I believe two weeks ago, sat down with Trump for a number of hours and talk to him about her concerns.It's not just her. We're hearing it publicly, too. We're hearing his own allies go on the airwaves and begged him to stay on message. They continue to reiterate this is now a different campaign. Kamala Harris is a very different candidate and there needs to be some kind of change. Now that being said, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles as of right now, are keeping their jobs. Donald Trump himself put that out on social media after this was reported, he said they'd been doing great. They're going to continue to lead the team that right there is probably the most important thing you need to hear in case anyone was deterring this layering or that Corey was going to be over the umbrella. But also Corey Lewandoski doesn't fit in the Chris LaCivita, Susie Wiles mold. He is completely separate and I will remind you, he was Donald Trump's first campaign manager, not his 2016 full time campaign manager, who was fired after a year, brought in because of negative news headlines. He is not the most popular person in the more mainstream area of Donald Trump's orbit. However, there's been a lot of top among these 2016 loyalists, bringing them back and trying something new particularly after we've seen this change at the top of the ticket the increased enthusiasm and the boost in poll numbers.",

It is the number one thing dragging down the Biden/Harris job approval and people are quite angry about the economic policies of the current administration versus what they now view at more favorably from the Trump administration.

Like they are very cognizant of trying to pull him up off message, and on some of them, you can even look at the statements, the very kind of benign everyday statements they're putting out, including one from the campaign today.It reads into the top: Today at 4:30 p.m., Donald J. Trump, loser of the 2020 election by 7 million votes, will hold another public meltdown in Bedminster, New Jersey. These remarks will not be artificial intelligence, but they certainly will lack intelligence. Is this like an effective strategy? Does it matter or is it purely to try and draw him into where he was a week ago? MAX ROSE (D), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  But it certainly effective. I don't think it's necessarily compassionate to the fact that Trump and the entire MAGA movement are going through a pretty severe stages of, you know, political grief right now. The -- look, even today, there are hosting a press conference on affordability at a country club resort that their candidate owns. I mean, talk about hypocrisy, and other detachment from where actual voters are. The truth of matters is that this is not as simple as getting the old band back together. It's not as simple as just staying on message. The truth of the matter is that Donald Trump has always been unhinged, particularly during his political life, and he has always been crazy. There's absolutely no changing that. The only time he is successful is when he has something tangible enough to distract the electorate from. And now that's clearly not the case. He's facing a new campaign with incredible political momentum and discipline. And I don't think some type of lackadaisical, weird press conference that he puts together today or any other day is going to change that.",

And that's the kind of thing I think that they need to focus on. I don't know if kind of getting down into the weeds with Donald Trump and doing the name calling is really going to get under his skin.

It's like standing outside of a house on fire with a bucket that's half full, they caused it. So the Medicare that they're pushing 8 million seniors are paying more today because of the Inflation Reduction Act. Medicare Part D plans are few and far between and it's all because they cause it. So they're going to go out there now and try to recreate and pretend like they didn't cause the problem, versus, you know, Americans know in their everyday lives are not better -- they're not better than they were four years ago. And that's the case that the Trump team needs to make. So even though we're talking about props and a press conference and is he going to stay on message, we're still talking about inflation and the fact that Americans are still paying more today than they were four years ago. And it doesn't matter what chart, that's one of the big things that Biden campaign did wrong in the beginning. They hold up a chart and said things are going better.

Your point is that -- to your point, if the Harris campaign and winds just those blue wall states, so loses all of the ones we just talked about in Nevada and Georgia and Arizona, but wins Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, they are at 269 electoral college votes, give everything else to Trump that he won back in 2020, he's at 269 electoral vote.

Her ban, for example, on price gouging in food, extremely popular and people think a former AG will just nail price gougers to the wall. So this is right in her lane, right in her personality and she just has to keep it going. You know, to that point, Kristen, when you look at what's and I don't know if you guys can see it on your screens. If you have screens, you see the kind of props, the groceries that are where the former president will be speaking. Does that when people see that the visual of that is it effective? I'm trying to see how people actually perceive the things that they're watching. You had the former president or the current president, the vice president, talking about drug prices and issue where Democrats constantly point out they pull very, very well on. What about this for the former president?",

The question is, will say saying, you know, Vice President Harris thinks she's going to take on price gougers. What does that policy actually look like? Right now, the Harris campaign has been a really choose your own adventure kind of campaign where either she's been borrowing policies from Donald Trump. I'm not going to tax tip income type policies, or saying I'm going to go after price gougers. But the question is, how? Is it the sort of policy that's actually going to leave shelves a little bit barer, where people are going to be having supply chain issues, people remember that very clearly from early on in the Biden administration, not being able to get the stuff they needed at all at the grocery store. So there is still a story Donald Trump can tell about how the economy he thinks would be better under him. Harris, but simply by kind of copying his messaging is making it closer. But we'll see if voters actually buy it.",

I mean, he could have showed up and tried to do better, I guess. And then he got himself run out of the race. The fact is they need to debate because nobody really does know her. She's never gotten a single vote for this office ever, and she's got a bunch of statements on the record from before that. Now, anonymous spokespeople are walking back and I think September the 10th maybe Donald Trump's best and only chance to really get at the heart of what she is all about. Why is she running? What is her record? And what is she planning to do as president? Not a single one of us sitting here today could answer that question because she said nothing or at least very little about how she would operate as president. For Trump, the September 10 debate looms huge. Only he can do it. She's obviously not going to submit to any media questioning or any serious questioning. So it's all on Trump shoulders.",

But when it comes down to this, what you will see from the Harris-Walz presidential campaign in the days, weeks, and months to come are a series of very robust policy rollouts speeches, interviews all the rest of it. You will not do see that from Donald Trump. The guy is hanging out on his golf course. He's going to flee down to south Florida very soon. He will do intermittent in press conferences here and there. And then who go back to a rally every other week. This needs to be yes, of course, a fair fight and thus is deserving of a fair comparison.
