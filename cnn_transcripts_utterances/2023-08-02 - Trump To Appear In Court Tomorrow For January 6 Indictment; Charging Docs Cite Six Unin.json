How the nation's Capitol is preparing for his possibility appearance just down the road from the site of the insurrection. And then who are Trump's six co-conspirators listed in the indictment, though not named? And how do they fit into Trump's world? CNN has identified five of them. Who is number six?

I'm Jake Tapper.Just about 24 hours from right now, Donald Trump is expected to appear in federal court here in Washington, D.C. where he will face unprecedented criminal charges for his unprecedented alleged attempts to overthrow the 2020 election or as the grand jury put it, quote, despite having lost, the defendant was determined to remain in power, unquote. Today, we're going to walk you through every angle of this stunning indictment of the former president, including the four charges. How did Donald Trump allegedly break the law? What kind of punishment could he face? Our legal experts are here to break it all down. We're also going to take a closer look at the judge overseeing this case, District Judge Tanya Chutkan. She's presided over a dozen of criminal cases against the alleged January 6 rioters and she has ruled against Trump's legal team once before. Plus, we're going to take a look at who are the coconspirators. CNN can identify five of the six unnamed coconspirators in the indictment, including former Trump lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman and Sidney Powell. None of them have yet been charged, although they still could be. What were their roles in this alleged scheme? Then we'll also take a look at whether members of Trump's team suggested violence could be necessary to keep him in office. The references in the indictment about potential riots in the streets and sending the U.S. military to suppress any protesters. And of course we'll take a look at the political impact of all this on the 2024 race. The White House has tried to distance itself from the Justice Department's actions. But will President Biden campaign on the charges against his top rival? And how will this arrest impact Trump, or any of his Republican opponents? CNN's Katelyn Polantz starts off our coverage today from outside of the courthouse here in D.C. Katelyn, will Trump be in court tomorrow in person, or can this arrest and arraignment take place remotely? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Jake, this court does do remote appearances sometimes for defendants that aren't in custody. But this is Donald Trump and he's going to be here in person in Washington, D.C. That is the full expectation of both the court and as well as everybody involved with this. We did get a statement from the Secret Service a bit ago saying there are some short-term traffic implications. The Secret Service is the law enforcement entity to protect Donald Trump. But there are lots of law enforcement that is going to be in downtown Washington tomorrow, making sure everything around here is secure. There is building security from the federal government, city police, Capitol police, park police, all of that is going to come together to make sure that Donald Trump could get in and out of this courthouse to face these charges against him related to January 6th for the first time.",

Now, a key component of successfully prosecuting someone under this charge is proving deceit which is why you see throughout this indictment they continue to emphasize how Trump knew that these claims of election fraud were false and how many people told him there is no evidence to support this.",

And it was an attack on democracy and to try to overturn votes.I mean, you could see it in the description of the way that people who worked there have even talked about it and the way they talked about that day. Whether or not they believe what he did was criminal or wrong, I mean, look at what Mike Pence himself has been saying about this, saying that he was asked to overturn the election on that day. And so, that's why this is such a big part of this. And this is going to be such a question for candidates on the campaign trail because when you talk to the die hard loyal supporters of the former president, they don't believe what happened on January 6 by enlarge was wrong or anything happened that day. You see how he has whitewashed it and said it is a peaceful protest and people letting their voices be heard. But when you talk to independent and middle of the road voters which helped get him to office the first time, that is not how they see it. So I think it is a question for the other candidates in stark terms as this is playing out now that these charges have been brought against him.",

Look, common sense. Donald Trump knew he had lost. He heard it from his attorney general, from his White House counsel and from his campaign officials, from Mike Pence, these are all close advisers and allies, if he had stayed in power, they have would have stayed in power. It was to their benefit to stay in power. So this was not about free speech. This was not about the fact that he didn't understand the advice he was getting, it wasn't the advice he wanted.

I fully understand why Donald Trump wants to get out of the District of Columbia as Mr. Lauro said. Donald Trump got 5.4 percent of the vote there in 2020. By the way, he got 68 percent of the vote in West Virginia.But in order to succeed on this motion, you need first of all, one option is if DOJ agrees, they're not going to agree. So then you have to go to the judge. The judge can move the case to a different venue, one, if it's more convenient, this would be wildly inconvenient to move this from D.C. to West Virginia, or, tow, if it's necessary to ensure the fairness of the trial. But judge will say, look, we have jury selection processes. Donald Trump as a defendant will have the right to strike, to get rid of many jurors, and I, the judge, will instruct jurors that they're to put aside their political beliefs. So, I think any such motion, I get why Trump will make, it's doomed to lose. TAPPER: Kaitlan, take a listen, you were talking about Vice President Mike Pence a second ago. Take a listen to what he had to say -- his latest sound on the indictment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Sadly, the president was sour rounded by a group of crackpot lawyers that kept telling him what his itching ears wanted to hear.

And the other part of the indictment is where Trump was telling people who were saying, you know, Pence doesn't have that power and Trump was saying, well, you don't need to talk to Pence. I will talk to the vice president, essentially saying people who were undercutting his argument shouldn't be talking to Pence. But the other thing that Pence said while he was in Iowa is directly refuting what John Lauro told me last night, which is he said, you know, they didn't ask for Pence to do anything wrong, they just asked for a pause on the vote count, which we know is not true.

In a meeting on January 4th, one of former President Trump senior advisers told coconspirator number two, John Eastman, his plan to undermine the Democratic election would, quote, cause riots in the streets. The indictment says that Eastman, quote, responded that there had previously been points in the nation's history where violence was necessary to protect the republic, unquote. And former Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, coconspirator number four, expressed a similar sentiment in a meeting on January 3rd when he was told by a deputy White House counsel that there would be, quote, riots and every major city if Trump didn't leave office. According to the indictment, Clark responded, quote, well, that's why there's an Insurrection Act, unquote -- a reference to the 1807 lot empowering the president to use the military to suppress any civil disorder.
