Hello, everyone. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. And you're in the CNN Newsroom. And we begin the hour with questions. I was just talking about it there with Jim Acosta. What does the federal government know about these drone sightings that we don't? The question has been hanging over New Jersey and several other states where reports of drone sightings have been pouring in. And it's not just backyard stargazers voicing concerns. Here in Ohio, drone activity forced Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to close its airspace for almost four hours. This is one of the country's most critical Air Force bases. Here's a recording of air traffic controllers obtained by the military news website, \"The War Zone,\" discussing the UAS Unmanned Aircraft System. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They include legal aircraft misidentified as drones, the U.S. government being responsible, or a foreign government that is fine, other possibilities, hobbyists or pranksters and even UFOs.Joining us now is CNN senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe. Polo Sandoval is in New York. Andy, to kick it off with you here, you know, the FBI has come out and said, look, it's gotten 5,000 tips. Less than 100 have actually led to investigative steps because they -- they were able to use technology and other methods to rule out other, the other -- the others as manned aircraft and so forth. But, you know, what is your take on all of this? Is it conceivable the federal government really doesn't have the most basic information on some of these drones?",

I think one of the reasons we're hearing very little from the federal government is that they don't really know very much about the, you know, the -- the volume of drone use across these different states. And that's not exclusively their fault.The way that the operator system is set up by the FAA, which is the government entity that's responsible for managing the skies, essentially, and an entity I should say we've heard really nothing from during the course of this issue. These drone operators really, as long as they're not straying into restricted airspace, they can pretty much run these things at night or during the day any way they'd like. There's very few rules. They don't have to file flight plans. They don't have to identify themselves. They're supposed to go online and take a proficiency test and maintain some proof of passing that test. But these are not things that are enforced day to day. So just your average drone in the sky, non- commercial use, lower than 400 feet in the air, it's -- it is overwhelmingly likely the government has no idea who' -- who is flying those devices at that time.",

Now, to bring our viewers up to speed, it's still unclear whether or not this weekend incident in Ohio may have anything to do with the drones that were first detected over New Jersey four weeks ago today, we need to remind our viewers about that as well.But nonetheless, it certainly underscores the disruptive potential of these drone sightings. Where we know about what happened at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, which is about 20 miles northwest of Dayton, Ohio. There were some small drone aircraft that were reported there. And because of that airspace had to be closed late Friday night into Saturday as a precaution as they investigated. Eventually, officials there at that base were able to deter -- determine that this -- there was no sort of threat for any of the roughly, you know, over 35,000 personnel that either live or work at the facility. But it is a critical facility for the Air Force doing some research on this do understand that there they conduct research and development for Air Force weapons. Also, it is home to a recon team as well. So it certainly would be a concern there. And it's not just military airspace, Pamela, a separate incident that took place in -- in Boston actually highlights the potential for civilian airspace where there were two individuals that were arrested for flying a drone dangerously close to Logan Airport, one of the busiest airports in the nation. So there is certainly that concern as these reports continue to come in and many people getting few to no answers.",

That's the case of Erik and Lyle Menendez and their push to get out of prison. Newly minted District Attorney Nathan Hochman sounded defeated, soundly defeated, we should say. Incumbent George Gascon last month after his predecessor recommended re sentencing and even clemency nearly 30 years after the brothers were sentenced to life in prison for the murder of their parents. Hochman's office is now preparing for a key hearing set for the end of January that could determine the brother's fate. Nathan Hochman joins us now. Thank you for your time this morning.So you've had a little bit of time, a few weeks to review new evidence in this case that the defense lawyers say point to abuse by the boys' father as well as court documents from the previous trials in the 90s you said you wanted to go through. Given what you've reviewed so far, where do you stand today on supporting the resentencing of the brothers?",

And they said basically that there's new evidence that should compel a new trial. That track is basically set for a new response from us and doesn't have a hearing date after that.The second track is clemency. Clemency is a petition that they've made directly to Governor Newsom at any time from taking office in 2019 until today, Governor Newsom could grant that clemency petition and release the Menendez brothers. The third track is resentencing. That's a somewhat unique California statute that says that not only are we going to look back at the offense that the Menendez brothers committed, but we're also going to look at rehabilitation and see if, effectively these folks are in danger of (inaudible). That's where I'm involved in reviewing thousands of pages of prison files, confidential up until now, and now I have access to them. We're reviewing the trial transcripts of the first and the second trial to see exactly what evidence was presented concerning sexual abuse and the Menendez brothers fear of immediate harm at the time they shot their parents. I'm also speaking to prosecutors. I will be speaking to defense counsel. I will be inviting any member, any victim, family member that would like to speak to me directly and the voluminous exhibits.

It's very important for resentencing to understand whether or not the brothers have been rehabilitated over the past 30 plus years, that they've been in prison.

You have to look at each aspect of what was presented at trial in the days leading up to the shooting and ultimately what happened during the shooting itself to understand what was going on in the Menendez brothers minds at that time. That's the crucial time.But as importantly, you have to look at the rehabilitation evidence for resentencing. But let me give you a quick hypothetical. Let's say that this all gets presented to the judge, and the judge were to grant a resentencing, turning a life without the possibility of parole into a life with the possibility of parole sentence. It then goes to California's parole board. A two member parole board will review the situation to see if the Menendez's are actually suitable for parole. Let's hypothetically assume that they are. Then it goes to Governor Newsom's desk. He has 120 days to review it. He can either agree with the parole board's decision, send it back for a full parole board review, or deny the parole, as he did, for instance, with Sirhan Sirhan, a parole, where for the first time in 2022, after 40 years, a parole board granted Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Robert F. Kennedy, parole. And in that case, the governor came in and reversed it and granted parole.
