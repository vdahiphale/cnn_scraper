And new CNN polling shows the former president has an edge over Harris with likely voters when it comes to the economy. CNN White House correspondent Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now. What are we expecting to hear here? Obviously, the campaign has been paying attention to the polls where Donald Trump has an edge over her in most of the polls, if not all, when it comes to the economy. What will she say today that might change that?",

According to a senior campaign official that looks like her describing her philosophy as pragmatic and also as a capitalist who \"understand the limitations of government and always sought to take good ideas from wherever they come and harness the power of innovation.\" That according to a senior campaign official. And we can expect that is going to be folded into the vice president's remarks later this afternoon. But as you mentioned with the polling, the head-to-head polling from CNN shows that the vice president holds a very slight lead over former President Donald Trump, so much so that it's just no clear leader in this race. And when you look at the issues on the economy the former president still have a lead -- 50 percent to the vice president's 39 percent. Now, advisers believe that they can start to close the gap on this issue. And in watching the vice president and attending her rallies her framing around the issue has also evolved. She talks about the opportunity economy and lowering costs for Americans while also recognizing that they're not where they are -- where Americans want them to be just yet. And that is one of the three pillars that we'll also hear about today -- lowering costs, investing in American innovation, and also what the campaign described as leading the world in the -- world in the industries of the future. So this will all be wrapped up into her remarks. Again, this may be one of the most substantial comments that she'll provide on her economic philosophy, which voters care a lot about -- Sara.",

In our CNN survey yesterday 51 percent of registered voters said that Trump had a successful presidency. Only 37 percent said the same about Biden and Harris. A lot of that has to do with the economy and it mostly has to do with inflation. And so she's yet to look into a television camera and say here are two or three things that Joe Biden did that I disagreed with, and I would do it differently, and I've learned from that. She's effectively running on a continuation of the same. People don't like the same and they remember Trump better. I don't know how you expect to win under those circumstances.",

But I've heard her also say that is not enough -- I want to do more, and here's what I'm going to do. The other thing though she has to do is the contrast. You know, economists are saying that this -- you know, you get a car, and you get a tax cut, and you get a tax cut from -- that Donald Trump's policy -- no details about how he's going to do it. No conversation about how much that's actually going to cost. And once again, raise the debt. And it will bring inflation back up. And it will pass on costs to middle-income people.

Essentially, putting speed above quality, which is huge since it was a quality control failure that led to the door plug incident. One more big finding here. Workers said they felt inadequately trained by Boeing to do their jobs, and some said that Boeing was not providing them with the proper tools. The FAA audit found that one worker was using a tool he made himself to check the gaps between certain parts of the airline. The report says this tool is mechanic- made, unauthorized, uncalibrated, and unmarked. And when asked how other door mechanics take this measurement, that workers said they all do the same thing. Now, these findings were released by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. It -- in a few hours, it will grill the FAA administrator Mike Whitaker, saying that the agency has not stayed on top of Boeing. Now, yesterday, during a different hearing on Capitol Hill, Whitaker insisted the FAA has ramped up its oversight of Boeing and that Boeing has made some strides.
