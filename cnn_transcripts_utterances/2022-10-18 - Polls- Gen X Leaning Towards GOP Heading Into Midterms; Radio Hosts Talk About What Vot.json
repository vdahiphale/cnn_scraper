So, those folks I grew up with who are Gen X, they are still -- they identify with Reagan, they are still Republicans. Young people today, they came of age, positive identification with Barack Obama and then the most amazing negative identification ever seeing with Donald Trump. This happened also with Nixon, the baby boomers, right? They hated Nixon, loved JFK. they became democrats, stayed their whole life. So, some of it is that.

I wonder if it's persuasive, politically speaking. Is that the coveted demographic and is his approach persuasive?LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, after President Obama showed that young voters actually vote, that they turn out and vote, Democrats have been trying to get young voters to continually turn out in big numbers. I mean, in 2018, we saw them break records for their age groups, millennials. And then also in 2020, again, millennials, Gen Zers with Gen Xers actually turned out in greater numbers than anyone over the age of, I think, 55 to 60. So, young voters vote. The question a lot of times for millennials and Gen Zers is whether or not they're motivated to vote for Democrats. So, that is why you've seen President Biden -- his numbers when they were so bad, I mean, they are not that great now, but when they really dipped down last year, his approval rating, a lot of that also had to do with the fact that Democrats weren't enthusiastic about President Biden. They -- and young voters where his numbers have been high with them in 2020, exiting 2020, they went down, and it is because a lot of them are not seeing what they thought he was going to do accomplish. So, with student debt, with abortion, with Roe being overturned, I think we've seen those numbers start to tick back up and young voters have also been registering in greater numbers in the cycle than they did in 2018.",

BARRON-LOPEZ:  I think it definitely plays a role because when you look at all the studies and all the polls of millennials and Gen Zers, you go down the issues and on every issue. Even though millennials and Gen Zers are more likely to say that they are not affiliated with a certain party or they're more likely to affiliate as an independent, on all the issues, they skew more towards Democrats on climate change, on LGBTQ rights, on abortion, on racial justice, you go down the list, and they tend to vote much more democratic.

That is driving people to feel less safe. And if you feel less safe, you're going to go to the polls and make a change in the election. That is what we are seeing up and down.

They are seeing either blueprints for what is happening and they want that to be the case in their own state, or they are repulsed by what they are saying and hoping it won't exist there.

They want to talk about the economy even though the economy is doing pretty well, thank you, in the middle of a war and getting out of COVID.They do not want to talk about abortion. They keep trying to change the subject. That is why you see people like Blake Masters, like Herschel Walker backing off of this issue because they know it's such an important issue. But to your question, look, I think I agree with Tip O'Neill. I think politics, most politics is local. In these midterms where there is no president on the ballot, I think most people will look at their member of Congress or their senator and see what is that person going to do for them and their state? Having said that, I still think Donald Trump in this midterm, even though he's not on the ballot, is a huge factor because of the people he has endorsed, the rallies he had given, and to a certain extent, it is still a referendum on Donald Trump.",

Jean about this. [23:30:01] She remembers it vividly. Donald Trump has denied it. And he did more than denying, the rape. He also disparaged her in the process. He also said that he had no idea who she was. She has pictures of herself with him. And so, it is interesting that a judge is forcing him to sit for this deposition because he had tried to get out of it by saying, I said these comments when I was president, so he had some sort of cover, but I guess he doesn't. BARRON-LOPEZ:  Well, right, and he also, you know, clearly been trying to delay the potential of this deposition. What is interesting here, though, and E. Jean Carroll could very well amend her statement in this defamation case, is that Trump repeated his denial recently on Truth Social. So, he just repeated it again while he is not president, saying, I did not do this, you know, attacking her again. And so, the fact that he did that publicly while he does not have this so-called protection, which she says that he had when he was president to say this, now, you know, the legal understanding, as far as I know it, is that she could very well amend her statement and now include this in it and it could potentially weaken his case.",
