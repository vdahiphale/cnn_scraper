Now just about a month away from election day and both campaigns revving up their supporters, appealing to undecided voters in key battleground states during this final critical stretch of the race. Voting already underway across several states and polls showing, there it is again, Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump locked in basically a dead heat at this point. Their campaigns now navigating several big news stories that could obviously shape the outcome of this election, from the war in the Middle East to the devastating aftermath of Helene, another storm on the way to the Florida Gulf Coast apparently, and a surprisingly strong jobs report that just came out at the end of this week. But let's start in battleground Pennsylvania, where in the next couple of hours former president Donald Trump will take the stage in the city of Butler at the site of his first assassination attempt back on July 13th. At the same location Trump narrowly survived an attempt on his life when a gunman opened fire and a bullet grazed his ear. One attendee at that rally died and two others were also injured. And CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from Butler. Alayna, I mean, this assassination attempt on the former president back in July has really become a theme for Trump on the campaign trail. He talks about it. His surrogates talk about it. And they're going to talk about it again today.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. When I talk to Donald Trump's campaign about what to expect out of this particular rally, they said it's going to be different from a traditional Trump political speech, though I imagine you're going to hear a lot of those same themes, Jim, and said they really are trying to do a lot to honor the community, which of course was upended after that July 13th assassination attempt on Donald Trump.And specifically, though, they're really trying to do a lot to honor the victims, particularly Corey Comperatore, who was killed that day. Actually I'm not sure if you can see behind me, but in the crowd where he was -- Corey Comperatore was sitting on that in the bleachers behind the podium, they've actually put up -- he was a firefighter. They put up his old firefighter jacket and his helmet and also just had a sculpture artist or a painter, I should say, get up on stage and do a painting that ended up revealing him. So a lot of focus today on the victims. Also those who were injured. We're also going to see some pretty high profile Republicans here with Donald Trump that includes Elon Musk of course. Remember here endorsed Donald Trump just moments after that shooting happened in July. We're also going to see J.D. Vance. We're going to see members of Donald Trump's family, including Eric Trump and Laura Trump. They are really trying to make this a huge event. Now, as for the people on the ground, I spoke to many rally attendees some of whom were here on July 13th and were recounting those experiences. But others who were not and all of them said that they're glad Donald Trump came back, that they knew that he said, and I promised that he would, and they do thought this is somewhat of giving them the ability to turn the page on what had happened. Take a listen to what Sherry told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERRY O'DONNELL, ATTENDING TRUMP RALLY IN BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA: I'm happy for today because Butler can now not have the reputation of having a near assassination attempt. It's redeemed I think as of today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The vice president is going there to get a briefing on relief efforts. I guess one of the questions that I have is, should the vice president respond to former president Donald Trump, who has been making a number of false claims, as you know, about the administration's response to Helene? Would you like to see her respond to that? What do you think? REP. GABE AMO (D-RI): Well, first off, thanks for having me, Jim. Look, the vice president is doing exactly what she should be doing. She is on the ground engaging with people who had been devastated. And of course, my heart goes out to all the people across the southeast. And she is focused on the response that includes moving the machinery of government, $100 million plus from FEMA flowing for response, moving to respond with thousands of personnel.

And we've seen, and we've heard reports that President Trump was known to play politics when it came to response, asking for information about the types of voters and the information related to his electoral prospects, rather than supporting people when they need government.

We are in the middle of the Sabbath. So there's no one inside the temple right now, but there will be service here tonight. And following those bomb threats that were called into several synagogues across the state, Governor Kathy Hochul said yesterday that she was going to deploy the state police to partner with local law enforcement agencies to make sure that communities were being kept safe. Now it's important to highlight, Jim, that none of those threats were deemed credible. But because we have the first anniversary of October 7th coming up on Monday, as well as the rising tensions in the Middle East, which you were just talking about, there is the potential for disruption according to law enforcement and that's what all of these protective measures are about. It's not just here in New York, law enforcement is on high alert across different cities around the country. And both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said that the upcoming anniversary on Monday as well as the fact that we are in the middle of the high Jewish holidays could be a motivation for some extremist actors to commit acts of violence. Again, no credible threats around New York City so far, but the NYPD is expected to keep their presence out here for the next several days, for the next few weeks. The anniversary of October 7th, the first-year anniversary, is on Monday, and then we go into Yom Kippur, which is a very important holiday in the Jewish calendar. So law enforcement here in New York City, as well as in other major cities around the country still on high alert -- Jim.",

So we are about two to three weeks ahead of schedule. It's Milton, 40-mile-per-hour wind sitting in the Gulf of Mexico right now expected to intensify. We already have flood watches in effect for the Florida Peninsula where some four to eight inches of rain is possible because we have a front that kind of is draped just north of Florida.That's going to give them rain before Milton hits and will steer Milton straight into the Florida Peninsula. I do want to point out that that means we're not looking at this turn to the north into the Carolinas so that should at least help get the mountain communities out of this storm for this time around. We're also looking at sea surface temperatures that are incredibly warm. Middle and upper 80s. So as we said with so many of the storm so far this season, this will act as fuel for rapid intensification. As we go into Monday, we're looking at a hurricane already, and it could grow in strength pretty rapidly. Category two hurricane, maybe even teetering on category three, as it makes landfall somewhere on that Florida Peninsula. It takes its time to get out into the open waters, but it takes its entire trek over these very warm ocean waters. Again, that's fuel and that's food. Then it heads towards the Florida Peninsula maybe sometime late Tuesday into Wednesday, but again, you could see the outer bands already lashing part of the peninsula here. And look at how far this rain stretches, right? We're looking at it from top to bottom, from Jacksonville down to Miami. We could be looking at some rain totals of four to eight inches, some isolated totals up to 10 inches. That could definitely cause some flooding. Also worried about storm surge. Where that eye goes will really depend on who gets the worst storm surge. That's something that we'll have to watch very closely. And again, it's coming on what's been such an active season already. Look at how many landfalls we've had just this season alone along the Gulf Coast from Texas through Louisiana, and to Florida. So it's been very busy and only getting busier -- Jim.",
