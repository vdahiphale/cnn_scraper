China`s space program is a huge source of national pride. We talked to China`s first astronaut. YANG LIWEI, CHINA`S FIRST ASTRONAUT IN SPACE (through translator):  Looking at this launch as a veteran, the first thing I see is how far China`s man`s space flight has come. Over the past 20 years, it has developed rapidly and made great achievements in them. I see the strength of our reserve force. And the hope for the future development of China`s aerospace industry. (On camera):  We are just minutes away from liftoff. You can see the rocket back there. This is part of this bigger mission to maintain and expand China`s space station. (Voice-over):  With each mission, China can learn more and continue to challenge what has been a long stretch of U.S. dominant in space. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thanks to a strong El Nino, the weather pattern in tropicalPacific that typically brings weather and cooler weather scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA have created maps to help people prepare. The maps show snowfall during all El Nino winters and during moderate to strong El Nino winters. And this one, that shows the number of years with below average snowfall during the 13 moderate to strong El Nino winters. These maps though give a sense of what we might expect. They`re more like historical guides, not crystal ball forecast for the upcoming snow season. This El Nino though is predicted to be the most powerful. The contiguous United States has seen in eight years when it caused the warmest winter on record, while every El Nino winter is unique, it usually brings wetter and cooler conditions to the Southern U.S., and dryer warmer weather up north. And that`s exactly what`s on the horizon for this winter. Ten second trivia. Which of these college degrees is considered the highest level of academic degree? Master`s, Associate, Doctoral, or bachelor`s? Just with the doctor order, the doctoral degree is the most advanced diploma symbolizing a person has mastered a specific area of study. This year, we`ve talked about the growing influence potential and emerging concerns of the impact of artificial intelligence across many industries. But what about education? It`s a question many college campuses are dealing with AI chatbots, programs that generate text. They`ve raised new questions for many educators who are focused on students, not only getting the right answer, but also understanding the course material. A survey of college students earlier this year showed more than 51% believe using AI tools to complete assignments and exams is cheating. While plagiarism and cheating are not a new phenomenon in academia, these new tools have created a more complex environment and administrations are struggling to set new ground rules. Should these tools be banned or is there a way that they could be used responsibly? The landscape is changing. There have been numerous cases of students being caught and punished for using AI. And there are also cases of students saying they`ve been falsely accused of using the technology inappropriately. The response by professors has been varied with some ignoring the new technology, some banning it and others are changing the way they format their exams. Some are switching back to written papers after many years of digital only. But how easy is it to spot AI content? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
