A short time ago, the president of the Palestinian Authority issued his first public condemnation of the Hamas attack. Mahmoud Abbas, speaking with Venezuela's president, called for an end to civilian casualties, the release of prisoners, and a rejection of violence.Also tonight, Gaza is running out of water and running out of life. Those are the words -- those are the exact words coming from a United Nations agency, warning that the Israeli blockade and airstrikes are pushing civilians into an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. The U.N. is seeking a safe corridor to provide essential supplies, such as fuel, water, food, and medicine. Palestinian officials say the number of people killed has surpassed 2600 so far. And along Israel's border with Gaza right now, more than 300,000 soldiers, tanks, heavy equipment await orders. A ground invasion seems all but inevitable. The question, of course, is when and what will it look like. We want to begin our coverage just north of the Gaza border. CNN's Clarissa Ward is in the town of Ashkelon, Israel. Clarissa, how significant is this condemnation of the Hamas attack you think from Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas?",

From what we are hearing, Abbas issued this condemnation really at the urging of Secretary of State Antony Blinken.He did say that, you know, he condemns the attacks, that the hostages must be released, but certainly, on the ground here, I don't think anyone expects this to significantly move the needle -- Anderson.",

And particularly they don't have any place with electricity.And this is, I think, you're seeing, many people are moving. Many others are simply too afraid. The U.N. has come out and said that this is a catastrophe. They have said that the world has lost its humanity. That they have had eight days now with no ability to get electricity, water, food. The IDF, Israeli Defense Forces, did come out and say that they have turned back on the water in southern Gaza. So far, though, that has not been confirmed by people on the ground. One of the things they're saying that makes it difficult to gauge is that they don't have electricity to power the pumps that are needed to actually get the water out of the taps, so to speak.

We've heard European leaders urging for restraint. But I just wanted to draw your attention to a tweet from Ursula von der Leyen, the E.U. general commissioner. It's from October of 2022. She's talking about Russia in the context of Ukraine and she says, quote, \"Cutting off men, women, children of water, electricity, and heat, these are pure acts of terror and we have to call it as such.\"And I think what this does, Anderson, it feeds into this strong perception of a double standard. You have so much anger right now, so much outrage, not just from Palestinians in Gaza, but across the Arab world and beyond that they don't feel that Israel's supporters and particularly the U.S. are doing enough to really push Israel to try to facilitate the opening of this humanitarian corridor. Now we did hear earlier on from Israel's ambassador to the U.S. that they are working on this construction of some type of humanitarian zone in southern Gaza that would be able to potentially meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people, but there are still so many obstacles that need to be cleared, Anderson, before that can actually happen. That Rafah border crossing with Egypt so far has not been opened. There is a strong expectation that it may open tomorrow, but not for long periods of time and not in a way that will allow for unfettered access and a huge amount of volume of aid to be allowed in, which is really what's needed at this stage -- Anderson.",

And at the same time as Israelis, we have to call upon our government and expect them to do whatever they must to bring an end to the threat posed by Hamas and ensure they can never, ever engage in the kind of atrocities, murdering 1300 men, women, children, elderly, babies, that they did just last week. It can never ever happen again. I think that that's how many Israelis are seeing this. Yes, their hearts break for what's happening in Gaza. Yes, they hope that that humanitarian corridor can be put in place. That those who are able to escape do, in fact, do so and are not prevented by Hamas threats or roadblocks or the other obstacles that we hear Hamas is doing to prevent them from leaving those areas.

So, unfortunately, it looks like that is a likelihood. That is something that Israelis are keenly aware of.And at the same time, they acknowledge that there is really no way to ensure that Hamas is sufficiently dealt a blow, is sufficiently affected in their capabilities without having some kind of ground offensive. You can't do it all from air. It's simply impossible to do. And quite frankly, if Israel were to simply carpet bomb Gaza, which of course it would never do, that would draw way more civilian casualties than if they were able to go in and do it by ground. And so this has been Israel's practice for many years to ensure that ground troops do go in, endangering their own lives while trying to spare Palestinian civilian lives and it looks like that's what Israel will be doing now as well.",

And it's just so heartbreaking and infuriating, everything that is happening and the atrocities that we're seeing. COLLINS: Congress obviously is headed back to Washington this week. There is still no House speaker. House Republicans went home last week without anyone. Obviously you are a Democrat, but as you're looking at your Republican colleagues and what we're seeing happen right now with Jim Jordan in this desperate effort to try to get him enough votes, he's not there yet, obviously this has consequences, especially when it comes to aid for Israel, which we've seen, you know, officials in the White House say they're running out of runway for that. That is going to be something that Congress needs to deal with soon. Are you confident that your Republican colleagues can get this done this week, so Congress doesn't remain paralyzed?",

We've got 212 votes for him and we have been having both public and private conversations with Republicans about our willingness and openness for a bipartisan way forward.

We need to get a speaker so that we can pass necessary legislation.

And we're not even including now Syria in all of this. And that's why you see these American carrier strike groups off the coast, just as a deterrence, just to kind of warn these groups, don't try and get involved.",

A Chicago landlord has now been charged with murder and with a hate crime, accused of stabbing a 6-year-old boy to death simply for being Muslim. Police say that his mother was also hurt in the attack. Investigators say that the landlord, Josef Zuba, did not give a statement, but they do believe that he was motivated by the war that is playing out right now between Israel and Hamas.And all of this is coming as the FBI director says in a new statement that they are tracking an increased number of threats against both Jewish and Muslim Americans following the deadly attacks. Joining me now, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Obviously, Andrew, this is an incredibly disturbing story, but when you look at this statement that is coming from the FBI director himself, that they are following this, what does tracking these threats actually look like?",

So you are always concerned when a foreign terrorist organization operates overseas, that that might cause terrorist activity here. Anything from actual operatives who have been sent here for the purpose of waiting for the right time to strike, all the way to the other end of the spectrum of just individuals who are like minded with that terror group, motivated by it, followers of it, who decide to strike out against a similar target.So that is a standard part of counterterrorism work. On top of that, counterterrorism officials at the FBI and DHS are concerned about an evaluated threat against Jewish facilities and community -- the Jewish community over the last several years, which has really spiked in the last few years. So it is a very dangerous time for -- certainly for members of the Jewish community, but also, as we see from this horrific act, folks in the Muslim community who may be targeted as a result of people who are enflamed over what's happening overseas.",

They've never done anything before, and then they all of a sudden are motivated by what they're seeing happen overseas and they strike out here.
