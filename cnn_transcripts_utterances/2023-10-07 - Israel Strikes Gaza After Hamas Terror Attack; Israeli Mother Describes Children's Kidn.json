(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): In the early hours of Saturday, Israelis woke to a sudden assault from Gaza militants. The surprise attack, claimed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, a complex and massive operation, marking a steep escalation of hostilities. The attack began with a huge barrage of missiles fired from Gaza. Thousands of rockets, some making direct hits on targets across southern Israel. Under the cover of the missiles, a large scale infiltration began as Hamas militants crossed by land, sea, and air, even using paragliders to cross into Israel. Videos from border crossing stations show Hamas fighters storming into Israeli territory. A few miles away in the border town of Sderot, Hamas was seen driving and opening fire at civilians. The gunmen tore through the streets, leaving a trail of casualties behind. The full extent of the casualties is unclear, but hundreds have been killed and more than a thousand injured on both sides. A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Force gave a frank assessment of the situation. LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL IDF SPOKESPERSON: A very severe morning here in Israel, and a combined offensive by Hamas, land, air and sea. The numbers still are not clear. We're not going to talk about the numbers as we speak. But the numbers are substantial. A very severe morning. We are very much now focused on sending forces to these locations where there's ongoing fighting as we speak. ROBERTSON (voice-over): During the raid, some fighters also took Israelis as hostages and prisoners of war, the Israeli military said. Videos geolocated by CNN show militants taking civilians captive in southern Israel and Gaza. A woman is seen forced into the custody of Hamas. Israel quickly retaliated, hitting multiple targets along the Gaza Strip. In Gaza City, two high rise buildings collapsed after an airstrike. The unrest continuing late into the night, with both sides trading rocket fire. As we touch down at Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv, air traffic was halted as sirens wailed and travelers took cover. (on-camera): We literally just got off the plane here at Ben Gurion Airport. The sirens have gone off. People are taking cover. We got off the bus. People are taking cover. And you can hear the intercept missiles banging in the air. Nothing incoming here. But everyone is taking cover. They've got down. A lot of concern about what's going to happen here this night. (voice-over): Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been unwavering in his message that Israel is at war with Hamas. Now Israel rushes to regroup with its allies despite the intelligence failure that appeared to lead to the attack. It is clear that the true force of the Israeli government's response is yet to come.

We're still trying to parse out exactly whether Israel has control of all of the communities that were infiltrated. [23:10:07 It does seem as though they have more control than they definitely had in the earlier hours of the day. But there's still a major question about whether there are further militants that had made their way deeper into Israel. And that's why you're going to see a lot of Israeli military and security officials on the ground here in communities around Israel because of the fear that militants may have made their way even further inside Israel, maybe are laying in wait, maybe waiting to do something else. Also Hamas had called on all Palestinians from across the occupied West Bank, Jerusalem and Palestinians who are also citizens of Israel to come up, raise up against all Israelis. And so that's why we are expected to see Israeli military, more military presence on the streets. Now, the Israeli military has been striking Gaza from the air. We have seen several towers that have been demolished as a result of these airstrikes. The Israeli military also telling Palestinian civilians in parts of Gaza to leave the area to safer areas, indicating that they plan to strike there as well. We have no indication yet that a ground incursion by the Israeli military has started yet. I think that the Israeli military will be focusing on clearing out the communities, the Israeli communities from militants before they start any sort of ground incursion. And of course, you have the issue of the hostages. Because right now, Hamas militants have taken what may be dozens of hostages, civilians and soldiers into the Gaza Strip. So any activity that the Israeli military undertakes in the Gaza Strip, they need to be aware of where those hostages could be at the same time. Michael?",

So right now, Benjamin Netanyahu has the political support, including from the opposition, including -- even from the protest movements, who of course, have canceled their protests that were -- that normally would have taken place on Saturday night.

But it certainly looks like right now Israel kept its eye on Gaza. And it's worth pointing out, Michael, it wasn't just a failure in intelligence to see this coming, but once this started, there was a failure to stop it, and then a failure in response. Netanyahu promising a major retaliation, but it's quite clear that the Israeli forces aren't even there to carry out anything but the airstrikes you're seeing.

Clearly, they weren't looking in all of the right places to try to predict something like this. But I also think, you know, analytically speaking, it's no surprise that the tension has been ticking up and up and up in Israel. Sorry, these are the Israel and the Palestinians writ large.

And the procedures that we saw Hamas demonstrate this morning have been developed on the battlefields of Syria over the last 8 to 10 years replicated and enhanced in Ukraine over the last 18 months, particularly the use of drones to drop armor piercing munitions, which is what we saw Hamas do this morning onto sophisticated Israeli-Merkava tanks. The use of paragliders to insert fighters into sort of hostile territory is something we've seen the PKK develop in Turkey and across from Syria into Turkey over the last four or five years. So really, this is, you know, from -- in a much bigger picture perspective, goes to show how armed groups and terrorist organizations around the world are learning from each other and proving a lesson that, you know, terrorism and insurgency academics have said for a very long time, which is if you are the asymmetric actor, not the conventional government entity.You always have that inherent advantage if you can think three or four steps ahead. And if you can use these less sophisticated, but more kind of ingenious tactics and practices, you'll always have that advantage and you'll catch your enemies by surprise.

If there is a major ground incursion into Gaza, I think that will probably force Hamas' allies elsewhere in the region to, potentially, to choose to back it up. But I think when we have the conversation of Hezbollah getting involved, we do also have to remember that Hezbollah has generally since the 2006 war been very hesitant to repeat that experience, even though it perceives itself to have won that war against Israel, which is a debatable subject.The consequence domestically within Lebanese political environment wasn't altogether positive for Hezbollah. So very, very tricky. It's much more likely, frankly, that we might see some Iranian proxies next door in Syria, perhaps choose to create a second front against Israel kind of diversionary front. And that's, of course, a challenge and a threat that Israel has been trying to deal with for many, many years amidst the Syrian crisis. So it could potentially become a multi-pronged. I think what's more likely is what your correspondent pointed to a little while ago, which is that Hamas may have used this infiltration attack not just to kidnap and take hostages, but also to infiltrate fighters much deeper into Israel as a kind of second front, as a second wave. Israel will be very aware of that potential threat. There's also not a great deal they can do if those fighters have gone to ground. But again, that restrains Israel's options here. And again, the fact that we have dozens of Israeli hostages in Gaza does put Netanyahu in an extraordinarily tricky situation whereby a major escalation could see Israeli hostages executed, which would -- it'd be an enormously destructive development for him domestically. [23:25:09] Politically, it will be humiliating, it will put great pressure on him to do other things that may also be unwise. So I think that's why we're seeing Israel respond yes, very aggressively, but very methodically and slowly at this point. I think they're measuring up those options right now.",

So it's clear the Israelis obviously now with daylight, getting assets in the air to take a look on the ground, continue to hear heavy explosions coming from the direction of Gaza. So, you know, I think what we'll see is an increasing tempo as Israel begins to posture its forces and readiness for whatever decisions the government decides to take potentially incursion.

Germany, France and the U.K. also weighing in. All three countries calling the attacks an act of terror, with Germany's Foreign Minister warning of the dangers of further violence. ANNALENA BAERBOCK, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): Hamas' terror once again move the region further away from peace. Through these terror attacks, there is now the incalculable danger of a large regional escalation. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Regional players like Egypt and Saudi Arabia are appealing for calm, calling on both sides to stop the fighting. Before the hostilities erupted, Riyadh was in talks brokered by the U.S. to potentially normalize relations with Israel, with Saudi Arabia pushing for a resolution on the treatment of Palestinians before any deal could be reached. Qatar, which historically has had both financial and political ties to Hamas, says it solely blames Israel, though some experts say, Qatar could possibly play a part in future efforts to deescalate the crisis. AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPT. MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: It improve relations with the Israelis, but they have been very supportive of the Islamists. And I think they want to maintain their their ties in context with Hamas. They may well come in to play a role. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which is backed by Israel's arch enemy, Iran, praised the attacks, saying it was in contact with Palestinian resistance groups, both at home and abroad. Adding further concerns that what began with a shocking start could spread into a wider conflict. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
