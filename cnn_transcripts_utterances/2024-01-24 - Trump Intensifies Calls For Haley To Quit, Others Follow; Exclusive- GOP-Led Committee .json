Plus, dramatic new video of the Russian jet crashing near the Ukraine border. Seventy-four people on board killed as questions grow tonight over who is behind that crash. And a passenger notices missing parts on the wing of a plane he boarded that has done the safety instruction ready for takeoff, tells the crew and the flight is canceled. Why didn't the airline notice it first? He's my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: Trump bullying Haley. Trump tonight calling her a birdbrain, who can never win. And his bullying on GOP leaders as well is working. They're all just getting on board.

And the House Speaker Mike Johnson, it's now past-time for the Republican Party to unite around President Trump. Now when he says, let's -- it's past time, I just want to pause for some important context, it seems. One-point-one-six percent of the United States population has voted, 0.16 percent. And that 0.16 percent live in only two states. Now, as for Haley, she says she's determined to stay in the race. We'll see. She's about to take the stage for the first time in her home state after losing to Trump by 11 points in New Hampshire. And while it is fair to say, to me at least, that it does not seem like the founders of this country would ever have wanted 0.16 percent of the country to make a decision like this in a moment, like the one that we are in, the reality appears to be that Trump does have this locked up, two states and two clear wins. So then why if he does have it locked and the GOP is all piling on to tell him that there back in the fold and they're good and it's wonderful and he's got it, why is the man who by all measures on track to become the Republican nominee so personally vitriolic about Haley?

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tonight broke his silence on the crash saying, quote, given that the plane crash happened on Russian territory, that is beyond our control. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The final moments of the Russian military planes flight, diving to the ground, seemingly out of control. After the impact, the jet explodes in a giant fireball. I heard only two explosions, this eyewitness says, the first one was a dull bang, then an explosion, then big flames. Russian media showing debris scattered across a large area at the crash site. Authorities say, no one onboard survived including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war set to be exchanged the same day. Moscow blaming Kyiv for the incident. The Ukrainian side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv side, Russia's foreign minister said. It targeted the airplane and was a fatal strike. The Ukrainians haven't denied shooting the plane down, but Kyiv says the Russians never told them they'd be flying the Ukrainian POWs to Belgorod, holding Moscow responsible for the loss of life and the failed exchange. Landing a transport plane in a 30 kilometer combat zone cannot be safe. And in any case, should be discussed by both sides, because otherwise, it jeopardizes the entire exchange process, a military intelligence statement says. Based on this, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions of the Russian Federation to destabilize the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our country. Ukraine says Russia often uses the IL-76 cargo jets to transport missiles used to target Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. A recent attack killing and wounding scores in Kharkiv in Ukraine's northeast. When the missile attack started, I kneel down near the washing machine, this woman says, look, something hit me here, glass, glass, but I'm alive. Some people died and my flat is gone. The Ukrainians have vowed revenge for missile attacks like these and say, they consider Russian cargo planes transporting missiles to be legitimate targets. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And one of the things that the Ukrainians are saying its really getting to them is the fact that they're not getting enough resupply. But the Russians are because the Russians are not only out-producing right now the U.S. and its allies, but the Russians also got a million shells from the Ukrainians.
