If you're just joining us, here are our top stories today.The U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister spoke on Thursday for the first time since Israeli airstrikes killed those seven aid workers in Gaza. The White House says Joe Biden demanded specific, concrete and measurable steps to protect civilians and aid workers in Gaza and to facilitate more aid getting in, or the U.S. would reconsider its policies. Authorities in Taiwan say 25 people are missing, more than two days after the island was hit by its most powerful earthquake in decades. At least 10 people are dead, with more than 1,000 others injured. And the U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is holding high-level talks in China. The U.S. wants to improve relations between the world's two largest economies, whilst also tackling what it calls unfair trade practices. A new report says Israel's military is using artificial intelligence to help identify bombing targets in Gaza. One official said humans often served as a rubber stamp for the machine's decisions. CNN's senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen has more on that story.

Information systems are merely tools for analysts in the target identification process. While Israel says it has concluded the initial investigation into the bombing of the aid convoy, the former top U.S. general in Europe told \"OUTFRONT\" he's troubled by some of what he sees from Israel's military. LT. GEN.

The former president is charged with illegally keeping classified documents at his Florida residence after leaving the White House.

Now he's making this argument under the Presidential Records Act.That is a post-Watergate law that governs which materials created during an administration belong to the government or the president. Now this argument has been rejected by the special counsel. They have insisted that this should not be able to factor into a case. It's creating actually a lot of tension between prosecutors and the judge. Prosecutors have signaled that if the judge allows this issue to come in at trial, they may seek an appeal, an appellate review. Now this is just one of many motions to dismiss that Trump has filed. The judge currently has eight motions to dismiss, sitting on her desk, outstanding, in addition to several other issues. The most significant other issue is, of course, when will this case go to trial? It is lightly penciled in for late May, but that was expected to be a placeholder. And it's been over a month since she held a hearing, arguments from both sides about when this case should go forward. And look, every motion, every hearing, every day that passes makes it less and less likely that this case will go before the November election. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Judge Scott McAfee rejected the argument that Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election were protected by the First Amendment. He says Trump's language about the outcome and execution of the election threatened to deceive and harm the government.McAfee's ruling pushes the state's racketeering case against Trump forwards, but it's still not clear when the trial will begin. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is doing damage control for his social media website, Truth Social. He's looking to hype it up after stock prices dropped this week. The plunge came after the company said it lost more than $58 million and generated very little revenue last year. On Thursday, Trump posted all of the competitors to Truth Social, especially those in the radical left Democrats Party who are failing at every level, like to use their vaunted disinformation machine to try to convince people. And it's not easy to do, that truth is not such a big deal. I think truth is amazing. Well, President Biden will meet today with families of the six construction workers who died in the Baltimore bridge collapse. The White House previously announced he'd be viewing the wreckage of the bridge, which collapsed last week after a massive cargo ship hit one of its support pillars. White House aide Tom Perez visited with some of the victims' families last week, saying their deaths are a gut punch both for the president and for the families. Previously unreported audio is adding to the picture of what happened before last week's horrific bridge collapse. The walkie talkie radio transmissions reported for the first time by the Associated Press on Thursday appear to show someone asking why traffic on the bridge had been stopped in the moments before the massive cargo ship actually hit the bridge. It's unclear who is speaking in the recording and whether they were actually on the bridge. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Flight Radar 24 tells us this plane was horizontally separated from the control tower by about 250 feet.But that only factors into position of the antenna on the center of the airplane. When you factor in the wingspan, the tip of the wing may have been only about 65 feet away from the control tower. The FAA says it's investigating, looking into whether or not this plane truly did come that close to the control tower. The National Transportation Safety Board says it is gathering information.

Severe storms are possible in parts of the southern plains and lower Mississippi Valley which threaten to obscure the view for some and pose some risks as well for post-eclipse travelers. A silver lining for those in the northeast though where high pressure and a largely cloud-free sky could make for excellent viewing conditions.

      "sentences": "Here's a bit of fun eclipse trivia to throw around on Monday's historic day.Did you know that Albert Einstein's theory of relativity was proven during an eclipse? He first floated the idea that the fabric of the universe can bend due to gravity, time and space and it took the 1919 eclipse for astronomers to prove it when they saw that stars weren't in the places they should have been, distorted our perception here on Earth. These days the biggest scientific mystery really involves the ionosphere which is the charged particles layer of the atmosphere between us and deep space and the corona which is the atmosphere around the sun. Millions of degrees hotter than the actual surface of the sun. Don't know why it stays consistent while the sun goes through active and passive phases. This year it is that solar maxim which means it's going off and so when the eclipse happens, while most people on the ground will watch it for four minutes, some very lucky pilots and scientists from NASA will fly special WB-57s 60,000 feet up into the sky and stay under the eclipse for six hours measuring the corona as it morphs around as the moon swallows the sunup there. And then there are other experiments involving rockets. It's hard to study the ionosphere with planes or satellites. Planes are too low, satellites in the wrong spot. So they're going to shoot three rockets into the eclipse which will release these sort of two liter sized instruments to measure the ionosphere. As the sun comes up wherever you are on the planet, those charged particles get really active and then they dim down as the sun sets wherever you are. This affects communication on Earth between satellites, between terrestrial communication. There are even some amateur sort of citizen scientists who are participating on Monday by using their ham radios to time transmissions and see how the ionosphere activity is changing over that four minute period. It's so easy to nerd out about this stuff. Such a rare glimpse to share the sense of wonder both as spectators but just think about how excited they are at NASA headquarters.
