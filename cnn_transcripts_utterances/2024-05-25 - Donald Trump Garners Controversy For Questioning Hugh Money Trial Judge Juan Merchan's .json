In the case of Israel, indefatigable essential ally. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I'm just very curious here. I am just curious, though, because you've been using language like supporting Israel and inviting Netanyahu. Israel and Netanyahu are not the same thing. You can support Israel and not embrace Netanyahu, which is a distinction that Biden has made. And Netanyahu presided over the worst security failure in Israel's modern history, presided over what is widely considered to be an inefficient and corrupt regime. Even his internal critics and even polls in the country say that people are fed up with his leadership during this war.

McDonald's recently introduced a temporary $5 value meal menu starting in June. Amazon Fresh, the online giant's grocery delivery service, is discounting up to 30 percent on 4,000 items.

So people have to feel really good about the economy in November for Joe Biden to improve his standing against Donald Trump. Right now, he's trailing Trump by 20 points on the economy. That is a deep hole to get out of it.

When you see how Donald Trump reacted to Nikki Haley's announcement, he actually was quite magnanimous and positive about Nikki Haley, whom he really attacked really sharply when they were in the thick of a campaign against each other. I think right now, Trump right now is on a charm offensive to win back those wavering Republican voters. Another indication of it is the fact that now Tom Cotton, Senator from Arkansas, serious, disciplined, sharp conservative, is being floated as a serious running mate possibility.
