So, there's already been a high alert with regards to security across the country. There was a high level delegation that was expected to come into Islamabad this morning. The president of the United Arab Emirates was supposed to come to Pakistan, to come to Islamabad today. Which is why there was a special holiday in order for security to be on high alert.
