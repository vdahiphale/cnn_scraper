Fed policymakers will sit down in Washington in just a few days time to decide whether or not to hike interest rates amid the banking turmoil.In the past year the Sed has hiked interest rates to quash inflation. The former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says, there's no need to panic, your money is safe. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY SUMMERS, FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: American's money is safe. American's money will be safe if they don't raise rates at all. American's money will be safe if they do raise rates by 25 basis points. Because the government has indicated that it's standing behind bank deposits. And as that message is repeated and becomes clear, as people see that those who deposited money even in the banks that failed, and even the people who were not insured are getting their money back in full. But we are still also seeing very substantial rates of inflation. And if those substantial rates of inflation continue, they will erode people's purchasing power and their ability to spend. They will be incorporated in yet higher interest rates which will mean further financial strains. So I think the Fed has to tip toe very carefully through what is certainly a mine field at this point. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
