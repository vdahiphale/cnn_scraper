This as CNN has new reporting on when U.S. officials were first warned about the threat. All of it sparking sharp criticism of defense and intelligence officials who were not immediately aware of the depth of that threat. We're going to be live on Capitol Hill with the latest. Plus, incredible stories of survival out of Turkey, including an infant pulled from the rubble after 68 hours. Small signs of hope there in the midst of so much devastation. Rescue workers, among so many things, they're facing freezing temperatures, a lack of water and power. The death toll, just hard to imagine, now surpassing 17,000. CNN is on the scene.",

He said he really didn't feel like he learned anything new from the briefing. He said there were some more nuances that he learned. And I asked him if it had really changed his thinking at all about any of this. And he said, no, his thinking really remains the same. But, again, that is just starting to break up, so we'll be hearing from lawmakers a little bit more. But they have been getting that briefing this morning.They are the first of several big things happening on The Hill surrounding this whole topic. The full Senate is going to get their briefing later this morning. So, we're expecting to hear more from them once they learn more. We're also keeping an eye on a couple of hearings that will be happening in the Senate, both in the Foreign Relations Committee and then also a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. They are looking both at the spy balloon itself and then also U.S./China relations. So, this is a big topic. And, of course, as you both know, lawmakers here on both sides of the aisle have wanted more information about all of this and have been talking a lot about it since it happened.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim, so essentially the day before this balloon actually entered U.S. airspace over Alaska, the Defense Intelligence Agency, which is essentially the intel arm of the Pentagon, they sent what's known as a tipper (ph). Basically, just a short classified report that is disseminated across government channels and flagged that a foreign object had been detected and that it appeared to be heading towards the United States.Now, this was not viewed as particularly urgent because, as we know now, the U.S. has surveyed a number -- surveilled a number of these balloons in the past. They understand that these are part of the surveillance program and they have never before posed a physical or military or national security threat to the United States as such. So, this report was not briefed to the highest levels of the U.S. government. That President Biden, for example, did not see it at the time. But then what happened was, as that balloon entered U.S. airspace over Alaska, crossed into Canada, it turned a sharp turn south and it started going towards Montana. And at that point U.S. officials said, this is a little bit strange. We haven't seen this before. And, of course, Montana is home to a number of very sensitive sites. So, that is when concern started growing. And we are told that NORAD actually did send fighter jets up to make a positive identification of this balloon to figure out whether it was indeed what they believed it was. Of course, later on, on January 31st, President Biden was finally briefed that this balloon was over Montana.",

The Weather Service will be out there later on today taking a look at what exactly happened.These were not very strong structures in the first place here with wind reports of 18 reports of damage. They did block off some things. They did have damage on the ground. And even some of the areas in the Tangiapoa (ph) city itself, not just the parish, did receive some damage. We've seen things kind of calm down here in the morning hours, but that's expected. We expect those big storms to fire up in the heat of the day, in the warmer part of the day. There may be even some weather across the Ohio Valley. Already seeing some wind reports from up there. Could be a little bit of lightning as well, but probably not much. Seeing some snow on the backside, as we talk about all the time with winter-type severe weather. On the north side there's snow and on the south side there's severe weather. But high wind warnings posted here for parts of the Great Lakes, with wind gusts over 50 to 60 miles per hour. Taking you ahead to the day. And we warm up the day. As we move into just all green, light rain, all of a sudden, by later on today we start to see some more color. And even for tomorrow we see more color.

Multiple apartment blocks have been laid down and they have, over the past hour or so, been bringing out the dead, laid in bags, some without them knowing who they belong to, and others with the words with owner written upon them and names. It is a grizzly and slow process we've been seeing happening all day.And, in fact, there was a brief moment of hope. We saw rescue workers rush towards one building, part of a street that remarkably the basement, first and second floor have all been crushed but the buildings were still standing somehow upright. And in those crushed basement areas they found, they had hoped, an eight-year-old girl alive, yet her body was brought out, her mother there as well alive, and they discovered, as they put her in the ambulance, that she had indeed perished. But, acute moments of hope and anxiety when voices are heard sometimes in the rubble here. This vast city, some of the areas of which some buildings are fine and upright. Others are tilting precariously at an angle. Others are utterly demolished. And the anger here is acute. Yes, there is anger at the initial government response, the day or so in which bad weather and perhaps a lack of preparation meant they didn't get here. But a broader anger at the political culture of Turkey I heard from one women, essentially saying people make money out of construction here. It's the big business. And it's a business where there is corruption. And where clearly some buildings were built to regulation and others were not. But it is deeply depressing in a city of this size to see the scale of this kind of ruin everywhere. Whole neighborhoods will have to be rebuilt.

If there can be some sort of chaos for them, chaos in quotes, right, or more people running for the nomination on the Republican side, that helps the Democrats.",

You also have, as you were noting, current governors, former governors who are all making their decisions right now too and could also potentially get in, in the next couple months. And so as all of that's going on, on the Republican side, as you were noting, they're also waiting a little bit to see how that field shakes out and how those people might be inspiring matches with former President Donald Trump.But I do want to make a key point on Nikki Haley and some of these other Republicans as well. They're really starting to zero in on foreign policy messages. Not just because of what happened recently with China, but she's a former U.N. ambassador. You have Kristi Noem, who's another potential candidate, coming to Washington, D.C., next week, and she will also be focused on China. So, it just shows how important foreign policy is going to be in this election and how every candidate right now is trying to figure out their positioning on it.",
