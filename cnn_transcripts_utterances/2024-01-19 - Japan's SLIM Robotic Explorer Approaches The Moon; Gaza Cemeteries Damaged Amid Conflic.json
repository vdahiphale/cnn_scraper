Welcome to the show. Right now Japan's so-called Moon Sniper mission is beginning its lunar descent. This is the rendering of the mission right here. It's expected to land in just under 20 minutes time. If all goes to plan Japan will become the fifth country ever to successfully execute a controlled landing on the moon. I want to now bring in CNN's Hanako Montgomery. She's monitoring this from Tokyo. Very exciting. To be clear what we're seeing is a CGI rendering of the data that it's collecting right now from the SLIM, so-called SLIM. Give me a sense of what we're expecting in the next 20 minutes.",

A very exciting time. And, you know, this is very significant because if it does successfully land, it will be the first time that Japan has ever landed on the moon. And so far only four countries have been able to pull this off. India, China, the former Soviet Union, and the United States. So Japan would be joining a very elite club. And it will be marking a new chapter for Japan's space history. Now were also going to be seeing unprecedented technology being put to the test here. JAXA will be trying to demonstrate something called a pinpoint landing, which is essentially a very accurate landing. It hopes to land where it wants to rather than where it can. Now conventionally speaking, most lunar landers land within several kilometers of their targets. But with SLIM, JAXA wants land within 100 meters of its targets. Now in order to do this, it'll be using something called smart eyes. It's a very fun name, but essentially their cameras on board SLIM that take photographs of the lunar service and then compares them to a map of the lunar surface so that it can ascertain where it exactly is in the atmosphere in space. So that it can avoid any rocky terrain that might, you know, sort of detriment its landing attempt. Now all of this would be very exciting for Japan. It would be a very momentous time for its history and really boost its morale. Japan has been facing a number of setbacks in recent years, most recently in March. Its flagship rocket failed to launch. And we're also seeing, you know, a renewed international race into space. India just last year landed on the moon very successfully. China, also one of Japan's rivals when it comes to space, has a very robust program. So Japan really is looking to interest and kind of achieve a better and far stronger space program -- Eleni.",

And it says most are in administrative detention allowing the government to hold them without public charge. The Israeli government has not responded to CNN's request for comments on the report. Now we're finding more attacks inside the Israeli occupied West Bank. Palestinian officials say Israeli Security Forces killed 11 Palestinians during operations there on Thursday.

So just to give you the latest update, and I love the interview that you just did and the gentleman with the Japan Space Agency that had to leave, I'm dying to know why he had to leave and who we needed to talk to because we're really at this critical point. We know that the spacecraft, a robotic spacecraft built and operated by Japan Space Agency, has landed on the surface of the moon. But we just don't know what kind of condition it's in. Did it crash land? Is it in several pieces or was it successful? And did Japan just indeed become the fifth country in the history of the world to do that, the third country this century? I mean, it has been within 50 years since the United States has landed any kind of spacecraft on the surface of the moon manned or unmanned, crude, or uncrewed. So this would be a huge deal for Japan Space Agency and the entire country to become one of the very few nations to be able to do that. But as of now, Eleni, the very latest from Japan Space Agency is they're still checking the status of that spacecraft. So the telemetry seems to be still coming in. There seems to be some kind of communication ongoing with the spacecraft, which is an excellent sign. But again, we just don't quite know the condition of the SLIM lunar lander. And just for those that haven't been following all of your coverage, this SLIM lunar lander and it stands for the Smart Lander for Investigating the Moon. It's got a great nickname. It's called the Moon Sniper because it's designed to demonstrate this really high-tech technology and landed within essentially something the size of an American football field, right. Previous lunar landings, you know, their target areas span several kilometers. So if they're able to successfully do that with the help of these smart eyes that essentially take rapid photographs of the surface of the moon and then communicate that to a computer onboard the spacecraft to help it find a safe area to land that would be a huge, huge development, Eleni.",

Arab countries and the region are constantly calling for Israel to stop its bombardment of Gaza. Many saying it's time for a ceasefire. Even Saudi Arabia who in the period leading up to October 7th was actively advancing a new security architecture in the Middle East that made normalization with Israel a key focus. But since October 7th, the kingdom has been engaged regionally and globally in efforts to address the immediate humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as well as supporting and trying to find a long-term viable path forward for Palestinians. The question of normalization, though, seemingly on pause at the World Economic Forum in Davos. CNN's Becky Anderson had a discussion with the Saudi ambassador to Washington, Princess Reema, about normalization with Israel, a focus of course of the Biden administration's Middle East policy, and Saudi Arabia's overall position on the war. Have a watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PRINCESS REEMA BINT BANDAR AL-SAUD, SAUDI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: The most important thing to realize is the kingdom has not put normalization at the heart of its policy. It's put peace and prosperity at the heart of its policy. So that looks at resolving the finite cause of the Palestinian people who deserve a state. They deserve sovereignty. They deserve a pathway that is irrevocable to their situation. Today you're talking about 30,000 people who died. Let's talk about those who are living. The children who are limbs are amputated, the people who are hiding in churches. That is not OK in any society to have sewage running around. This is not a solution to peace. This is not a solution to sovereignty. It's also not a path to safety. And while the kingdom fully recognizes the need for Israel to feel safe, it cannot be at the expense of the Palestinian people. So in our plight, in our journey over the past, and not since October 7th, it's horrible and vile and disgusting as what happened that day was, we have to go to the root cause of the instability in the region. 75 years of occupation. Those 75 years led to a plethora and an outpour and the spilling of violence across our region. To your point, it's not complicated. The solution is obvious and the solution is now. And the solution is a two-state solution. The kingdom since the time of King Fahad has put forward that policy. Since the Arab proposal of peace, we've pushed King Abdullah for that policy. And you heard the Crown Prince say in his own voice, we've never been closer than we were before. But today, cooler heads must prevail. There's trauma and pain on both sides. I can't take that back. But what we can do is ceasefire now because how many more children need to die? How many more limbs need to be lost? How many more parents need to lose their livelihood? It can't happen anymore. And the kingdom has condemned violence on both sides. We do not condemn civilian violence in any capacity. It doesn't matter in which country, which people, which faith, at the end of the day we are human beings and human beings today must say ceasefire now.",

I am profoundly concerned because today the whole Middle East has been united in its call for peace and de- escalation. But the longer that this goes on, it is inevitable that either a rogue entity or a mistake will happen that will take us back. And I hate to say it, but back to the Stone Age. It is a hot and volatile area, my part of the world. And we do not want the burden for our great grandchildren to say we could have had a solution, we could have resolved this. We didn't need to be in the state that we are in. And today leadership says I feel pain, but I will still do the right thing. My people are hurting, but I will still do the right thing because the future demands it of us. And so we recognize the shock to the Israeli people of what happened on October 7th, but we have to recognize the daily constant shock that is happening to the men and women of Gaza. And it is spilling over to the West Bank. And it is not something that we can turn a blind eye to.",

It's economic prosperity. It is a balanced, stable region where we, for once and for all, can stop being the headline because of trauma and death and violence. But we can be a headline on prosperity. Weve shown it can happen. You've seen the turnaround of the kingdom. It is impossible to say that it's not possible anywhere else. And we are here ready to take a leadership position. But it is also impossible to move in and lead, when you have a population of people who are starving, when you have aid on borders that can't come in. We want better for our world and we are taking a leadership position. But it's impossible when thousands of bombs are being dropped. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
