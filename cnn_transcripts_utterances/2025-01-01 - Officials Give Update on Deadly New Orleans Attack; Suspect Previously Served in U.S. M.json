      "sentences": "And we are following breaking news this hour. Any moment now, we expect an update from law enforcement in New Orleans after the deadly New Year's attack that is being investigated as an act of terrorism. Police say at least 10 people have died, dozens have been injured, many of them critically after a driver intentionally rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on the famous Bourbon Street.The FBI has now identified the suspect as a man from Texas. Officials say he had an ISIS floor flag at the time and that several suspected explosive devices were found inside his vehicle. We also have some new video of police exchanging gunfire with the driver. You see people fleeing the scene after they were trying to help people who had been injured. Authorities confirmed that they shot and killed the driver after they say he fired shots at officers, hitting and wounding two of them. Let's start our coverage now with CNN's Omar Jimenez. He's live on the seen there in New Orleans and Omar as we are awaiting this news conference which is slated here for a couple minutes ago. Not unusual for there to be a delay from officials. Just bring us up to speed with what we know so far.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, certainly. And we're looking to get more information from this press conference. You see folks assembling for that there in New Orleans. It's shaping up to be quite an assortment of figures there from New Orleans and Louisiana. You can see Senator John Kennedy there in the background, it appears as well.And you have law enforcement federally as well as state and local there. This appears imminent. So we're going to keep discussing also some important new information we're getting, but we're going to break away as soon as this begins and we will take that news conference live. I want to bring in Evan Perez also with us to CNN's Tom Forman. Evan, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Well, one of the things we know right now is that the Pentagon is going to have to explain a little bit about this because we're told that this person, the suspect, Brianna, is a former member of the U.S. Military. We've asked, we reached out to the -- to the military, to the Pentagon for some more details about their service. But that is also adding to the complex picture of this -- of this suspect. We know that the fact that there was an ISIS flag obviously leads the FBI to believe that there was some kind of radicalization that happened. And so that's perhaps one of the questions that will be addressed here by the law enforcement that is there.Obviously, the fact that there were multiple locations where there were additional explosives, who put them there? Was this person acting alone or did they put them there themselves? Or did they have additional help from someone who placed those explosives? What was the overall larger plan here? It's clear that the vehicle ramming of this crowd was not just one part of this plan. This was a much larger attack based on what we are now learning from the FBI. This was something that -- obviously he was armed. Was -- he came out firing at police officers. And that's one of the -- some of the scene you heard there in that video that you played there, Brianna. And obviously the idea that there are additional explosives --",

The Sugar Bowl committee has a 90 year history of being a good corporate citizen for the city of New Orleans. And that's why this tragedy hurts us as much as anybody right now. So our condolences, thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families as we all work through this.Of course, anytime we have a major event in the city of New Orleans, public safety is paramount. And we have full faith and confidence in the governor and the mayor and all the assets, the federal state and local resources that they've applied to this event so that we can ultimately bring those responsible to justice and carry on with the major events that we have in front of us. Speaking of which, we were scheduled this evening to have a CFP quarterfinal played in the Superdome at 7:45. We have been in consultation with ESPN, with the College Football Playoff, with the Southeastern Conference, with the University of Georgia, with Notre Dame. All parties and all agree that it's in the best interest of everybody in public safety that we postpone the game for 24 hours. Work is fast about to set up a safe and efficient and fun environment for tomorrow night. There'll be more details on that in the coming hours. But for now, that's the plan that we're going to move forward and play the game. And again, we reiterate our thanks to everyone up here for the work, important work they're doing. We live in the fun and games world with what we do, but we certainly recognize the importance of this and we're going to support it 100%. So thank you.",

Parents got a phone call last night, this morning, early this morning that -- that no parent ever, ever wants to receive. And as a parent, a parent of children who come to New Orleans and spend time here, I know that that is just something that, you know, we cross, we hold our breath sometimes until they're home safe. And some people do not come home safe.And we also have some people who are fighting for their lives right now in the hospital. So I'd ask everyone to pray for them. They need our support and they need our prayers. This was a heinous act, a heinous, cowardly act. And we will find them and we will bring them to justice. My office will be providing both investigative and prosecutorial support to the City of New Orleans, to the District Attorney Jason Williams at New Orleans, as I have done for months. We will continue to do that. We will provide the governor with whatever support that he needs. And the office of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security, whatever support that they need. I'll be here to help. I will be here to stand with the City of New Orleans. We will bring them to justice. Thank you.",
