Freezing Point is the latest casualty. He's the second horse to die today at the track, making it an appalling seven deaths in advance of the Kentucky Derby. They should play taps at the Derby instead of my old Kentucky home. Two of the horses that died earlier in the week were trained by Saffie Joseph Jr. He was suspended and the horse he was training for the Derby Lord Miles being pulled from the race. Saffie says he's been made out to be a scapegoat and did nothing wrong. Five horses had to drop out to Saturday's race. The latest was Forte who began the morning as the betting favorite. He injured his foot in training on Thursday. Well, that meant 18 horses started the first leg of horse racing's coveted triple crown and a thrilling race it would be. In this, the 149th edition of the Derby, a close sport contest, seeing Mage with a stunning late surge to seal, a famous victory. The three-year-old chestnut cult ridden by Venezuelan jockey Javier Castellano edging out Two Phils who finished in second place and Angel of Empire who finished in third. This in front of the over 150,000 fans in attendance. Mage will now have a chance to continue the chase for the elusive triple crown at the Preakness Stakes later on this month. The third leg is at the Belmont Stakes in June. Well, in the end, a win to save it for Mage, albeit one that now caps off. A sad and indeed really troubling week at Historic Churchill Downs.
