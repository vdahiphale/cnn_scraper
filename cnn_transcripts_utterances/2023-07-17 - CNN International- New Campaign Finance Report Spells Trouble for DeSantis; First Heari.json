The hearing will be presided over by a Trump-appointed federal Judge Aileen Cannon. And she will examine Trump's handling of classified documents. The date was set after a dispute where special counsel Jack Smith suggested that Trump and Nauta were trying to create an unnecessary delay. But as CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig puts it, there's no good time for a trial to happen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Donald Trump makes all the law school hypotheticals come to life. But if we play this through in a practical sense, when are you going to try him? If Donald Trump has to stand trial that's going to take a minimum of a month on any of these cases or pending cases. He has to physically be in the courtroom for that trial. This is not a civil case where you can skip out as he did in the E. Jean Carroll case.So there is going to be every month from now until November, either primaries, debates, conventions or actual ballots being cast. And that's why the DOJ is in a bind here. By the way, I don't think the 60- or 90-day rule really applies. Because the concern is, well, you can't do it too close to an election. I mean, if Donald Trump gets tried and let's say February 2024, people are still going to remember that come November when ballots are being cast. It's still going to absolutely impact the election.

A group of former employees spoke exclusively to CNN about their ordeal. Around a dozen team members were laid off just four days after Twitter opened an office in Accra, Ghana's capital. They say they accepted Twitter's offer to pay three months severance, with repatriation costs and some legal fees. But in the seven months since ex-employees claim that Twitter has not followed through. One saying the company literally ghosted them.Larry Madowo joins me now from Nairobi, Kenya. So Larry, it's been seven months since they were laid off, the last day, I think, was in December, and still nothing?",

Even though their official last day was December 4th, they were locked out of their email accounts back in November, that's how they knew they lost their jobs and then Twitter Ireland -- which is a legal entity that was often tried to Ghana sent them what was supposed to be an offer to their personal email which they didn't like.And it's only after CNN reported on their case that Twitter finally agreed to negotiate. So back in May, they agreed to some settlement reluctantly that they will be paid three months pay and repatriation fees for those who had moved to Ghana from other countries like Nigeria and other parts of the continents, as well as the legal fees in this case. And then silence. They haven't heard back from Twitter. And they just feel that If you were let go back in December, why was their words in July, you still haven't been paid. I want to read a quote from their lawyer Carla Olympio, representing them and has been advising them. Unfortunately, it appears that after unethically implemented their terminations in violation of their own promises and Ghana's laws, dragging the negotiation process out for over half a year, now that we have come to the point of almost settlement, there has been complete silence from them for several weeks. And now the lawyers say that they're considering some legal action against Twitter in other jurisdictions. Because if Twitter no longer has a presence in Ghana or in Africa, what kind of demands can Ghanaian authorities realistically compel them to do? Can they compel them to comply? They're not certain. And one other thing here, when we talk about the Twitter Africa team, you might think it's hundreds of people. No, it's about a dozen people, a small amount of people. And so, the severance will not really have a big dent on Elon Musk, one the world's richest people. CNN has reached out to Twitter for comment on the part of these employees and we got what is not a candid response, Bianca, a poop emoji.",

So right now, we're seeing that the pace of economic recovery in China is slowing down. And on top of that China's youth unemployment rate has hit a new record high of 21.3 percent in June. So the pressure is on Beijing to roll out more stimulus measures and to do it fast.Now, according to the official data that was released earlier today, China GDP grew about 6.3 percent in the second quarter from the year earlier. But grew only 0.8 percent from April to June. And according to economist, Carol Kong, she says this, quote, the data suggests that China's post-COVID boom is clearly over. The higher- frequency indicators are up from May's numbers, but still paint a picture of a bleak and faltering recovery and at the same time, youth unemployment is hitting record highs. Now economists say China is counting the costs of weak economic demand both at home and broad. I mean, data that was out last Thursday, it showed Chinese exports fell in their fastest pace in three years in June. And another factor at play here is what's being called the scarring effects of zero-COVID. As you recall, it was China's harsh pandemic policy. The uncertainty caused by that policy made consumers and corporates want to save more, instead of buying more. Instead of going out there and making new purchases and investments. Looking ahead investors have all eyes on an expected politburo meeting this month. We'll wait and see if there are any more stimulus measures that will be announced. Back to you -- Bianca.",

Authorities say up to 5,000 gallons spilled out of a sinking tugboat on the Tennessee River. It's unclear exactly why it sank. But officials say no one was on the boat. We've reached out to the Environmental Protection Agency for more information on that.Authorities in Mexico say that they've intercepted more than 500 migrants in their crackdown on human smugglers in the past two days alone. On Friday, 196 migrants were found packed into a tractor trailer that was parked on a roadside. About 100 more was found in another truck that was pulled over on the highway. And about 200 migrants including women and children were found abandoned in a tractor trailer on Saturday. The town's mayor said that some of them appeared to be dehydrated. Iran is cracking down on women's freedoms yet again. State media is reporting the country's so-called morality police have resumed controversial controls to impose the country's strict Islamic dress code including the hijab. Officials say those who don't comply may face legal action. And it comes ten months after the death of Mahsa Amini who died in police custody after she was detain for allegedly not wearing her hijab correctly. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins me now. Salma, other than the religious -- not the connotations but statement that it makes not to wear a hijab, it's so inextricably linked now in the eyes of the state, as a way of showing resistance and optician to them, too.",

It is, of course, build on how the clerical establishments see the rules and enforcement of Islamic dress code.And, of course, now seeing the patrols back on the street, it's seen as a victory for the hard-liners. The morality police first reseeded about 12 months ago, when the huge protest movement took hold in Iran sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini -- this young woman who was stopped by morality police Tehran while she was with her family. Put into one of their police vans. Taken to one of their reeducation centers and died in custody. Now Iranian authorities say she had a heart condition. They refute the claims from her family and that she was beaten with batons and that she had head injuries that resulted in her death. Regardless, this of course, resulted in these massive demonstrations across every single province in Iran that really threatened and rocked to the power of Iran's establishment. Now the morality police back on the streets. It's the important to remember just how powerful they are. They have access to detention centers. They have access to reeducation centers. They have access to arms. So there's a great deal of power within their hands. And what this begins to show us his that maybe Iran's government, Iran's Islamic Republic is no longer compromising, is no longer played good cop/bad cop with these protesters. Because there were points throughout this movement where we saw amnesty issued, for example, to protesters. Where we saw the morality police pulled off of the streets. But in the last months, as these protests have waned because of this very fierce and brutal crackdown -- and I can't emphasize that enough -- hundreds of people killed in the crackdown according to the rights group. Because of this fierce and brutal crackdown, those protests have waned. Morality police now back on the streets. But you have to remember the structural issues that caused those demonstrations, unemployment skyrocketing, inflation, poverty, anger at the establishment, those structural issues remain.",
