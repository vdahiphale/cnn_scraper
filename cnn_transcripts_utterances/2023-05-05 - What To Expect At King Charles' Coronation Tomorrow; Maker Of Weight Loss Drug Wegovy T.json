The fact that King Charles has been so inclusive and has different faiths represented, it speaks to the younger generation -- but there has been some criticism. Historian David Starkey, for instance, suggested that the reason that the government isn't really on board is because Rishi Sunak -- remember, we have a Hindu prime minister -- Rishi Sunak -- he's implying doesn't quite get the whole history because of the religion being different.

They are just some of the 40,000. It was really fascinating when you peeled back the layers. Both sides are adamant that what -- the women that we spoke to are adamant that the baby powder caused their cancer. And Johnson &amp; Johnson vehemently denies that, saying our product is safe. The science shows it. Even though in 2019, the FDA found in one sample asbestos. Johnson &amp; Johnson counters while we did our own independent testing -- more than 150 tests -- and there was no asbestos, and the lab was contaminated. And so, what we do is we examine the claims. We follow these women. And I sat down with Allison Brown, an attorney for Johnson &amp; Johnson who has defended this company in court. Here is what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) P. BROWN:  So -- I mean, Johnson &amp; Johnson is at the center of this and so it is essential to hear from this lawyer who has been defending Johnson &amp; Johnson in court. ALLISON BROWN, ATTORNEY FOR JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON:  The first thing that is most important for me that people know about these cases is that they are doing an enormous disservice to a very important issue of women's health. What we can say with 100 percent certainty is that we have never confirmed a finding of asbestos in any product that has been sold and that decades of scientific testing and study have shown that our talc is safe and does not cause cancer. (END VIDEO CLIP) P. BROWN:  And so, Allison Brown argues that the blame is on these plaintiffs' attorneys for why there are so many lawsuits against Johnson &amp; Johnson. She says they're money-hungry and with their advertising they've lured people in, even though she claims the product is safe. Now, of course, the plaintiffs and their attorneys argue it's not. They have their evidence that they show that we're going to put -- that you're going to see in this documentary. But right now, Johnson &amp; Johnson -- it has offered $8.9 billion to these plaintiffs. They're trying to settle.
