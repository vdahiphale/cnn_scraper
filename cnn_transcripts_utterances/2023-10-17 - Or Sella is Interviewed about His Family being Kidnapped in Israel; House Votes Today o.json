It seemed like an unimaginable reality, but that we already got used to, that -- that there are missiles coming. And family started checking in to see if everyone was all right. And we were reassured that everyone entered the shelter waiting for the security team of the kibbutz to notify when the event ends. As this is almost a daily reality for this area. And as the day continued, we were faced with the terrifying realization that terrorists were attacking inside the kibbutz, inside the families' homes, slaughtering everyone they can and kidnapping women, children, elderly. It's really hard to even think about it. My grandmother is a Holocaust survivor. And I remember hearing stories from her. And you couldn't even imagine that it's a reality. And then you see the images from the kibbutz, from - from my family's home, and - and you see that and it really looks -- it looks the same. And this is so terrible. And, you know, we haven't even had time to, up until now, to realize that the - the horrific event that has happened. So, only at 16 hours later, after the event started, tammy was rescued by the IDF. And she said, I need to go see my daughter. I need to go to her house. And the soldiers said, you can't go anywhere. We are under fire. And you have to -- you have to come with us. And she said -- she said to the soldiers, do you want to see me go to my daughter? And just started walking to see where they are. And the soldiers had - had to accept the situation and went under fire surrounding Tammy, arriving to the home, to the house - to the guesthouse, just to find that the doors were broken and they weren't there.

We're going to bring you the latest from Israel, next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTINGLY: The House of Representatives, it's in that building you're looking at right there, it is set to vote on a speaker today. Hard- right Republican Jim Jordan is, by CNN's count, still short of the 217 votes he needs to win the gavel, but he has flipped a number of key holdouts to his column. He appears to be getting closer to that magic number. And while Jordan has closed the gap, he still has a math problem. He can only afford to lose three, four votes at this point. We count at least five firm nos, including Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DON BACON (R-NE): I'm just trying to express honestly where a bunch of us are at. We've been walked on and then everybody says, OK, you've got to forget that. You've got to - you've got to be with the team. Yes, where were they at when they did this to Kevin? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, let's lay out a few factors here, Phil. First of all, we are on day 14. That means two weeks now without an acting speaker who can bring legislation to the floor of the House of Representatives. And Jim Jordan is going to take this fight to the floor today, try to grind it out, despite the fact that there are at least ten Republican leaning nos or hard no votes that CNN has kept track of. That doesn't include the dozens of members that we have not heard from at this moment. So, there could be very well a math problem for Jim Jordan when he goes out to the floor at noon today.One thing to keep an eye on is whether or not Jordan can get 200 votes to start out with, given the fact that that is the floor that Kevin McCarthy started with back in January when he was able to finally win that speakership after 15 rounds of votes. The other thing to keep an eye on, do Republicans have patience to go that many rounds for Jim Jordan? They were willing to do it for Kevin McCarthy, but are they going to be willing if Jim Jordan, time after time, cannot get the votes? As you noted, right now the margin is even slimmer for Jordan than it would typically be. There is one Republican absence this afternoon. That means Jordan can only afford to lose three Republican votes on the House floor. Is he going to be able to pull this off? Probably not in the first ballot. Is he able to get there eventually? That is the big question today, Phil. If it finishes and there is still no speaker, he can continue this fight over the course of the next few days. But how long are his Republican colleagues patient with him? Another major question this morning. Phil. Poppy.",

KEN BUCK (R-CO): Well, I think that Jim, at some point, if he's going to lead this conference during a presidential election cycle, and particularly a presidential election year with primaries and caucuses around the country, is going to have to be strong and say, Donald Trump didn't win the election and we need to move forward.

Donald Trump is supporting him for speaker. To put him in as speaker would even more closely align the Republican conference in the House with Donald Trump than it was under McCarthy. And it was pretty well aligned with Trump under McCarthy. So, I - I really do think that that's a - that a wish casting by - by Representative Buck. I've talked to a few members today, by the way, this morning. And one person says he thinks Jordan might get there. He's an enthusiastic Jordan backer. A couple of folks who are with Jordan, that were with Scalise before, say, not quite sure he's going to make it on the first ballot.

So, you can already see that he's trying to pivot away from the idea that, you know, this sort of shut it all down mentality towards, hey, a maybe we - we need to do the responsible thing here, keep the government open and try to show people that we're a responsible governing party.

I mean he really thought that they connected on - on a lot of issues. So, I know that that's what he desires here because the House Republican majority is the only leg of the stool that Republicans control. You know, we're in the minority in the Senate, in the minority - obviously don't control the White House.

And in front of me is the military -- I just finished the shiva (ph), a military service right now with the family who just now finished seven days of mourning.

How can I still wake up in the morning and go to work? What will I do with my other children? How come life is going on when I just lost my biggest love, my son? I grow with him so many years. He was her beloved one. And, you know, sometimes, I have nothing to say to her. I can hug her. I can say that I'm with her. I can say that the IDF will be here with her throughout the years.

It's so hard to think about what is going to be next while they are still here waiting for friends and more family to come and hug them. And it's like -- there's nothing to say. I can only be there for them and hug them. And it doesn't end. In the last ten days, I were in so many funerals. I met so many parents, so many siblings. People that lost their loved ones, and what can I say? It doesn't end. You know that after the -- I think it was after the number five, I think, funeral that I went to, I decided between myself that I'm stop counting how many funeral more I need to go. I said to myself, that from now on I will remember each one of the soldiers by their name and by the stories that their friends and family are telling me about them. Because there's so many funerals to go to, that if I need to remember all of them, the only way for me to remember it is if I will take from each one of them the first name and the story that the family told me about them. How they used to smile. How they used to love their family. How they used to love their friends in the army. You know that so many friends, so many soldiers cannot come to the funeral because they are in the field, they are in the battle.
