On this final weekend of campaigning, candidates and their big-name surrogates are making their case to voters in closing arguments. In Pennsylvania tonight, President Joe Biden has been sharing the stage with his former boss, Barack Obama. They are stumping for Democrat John Fetterman in what could be a pivotal seat in deciding who controls the U.S. Senate. Also tonight, and also in Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump has been campaigning for Fetterman's opponent, Dr. Mehmet oz. It's one of several stops that the former president will be making in the runup to Tuesday's election. Early voting is up compared to the 2018 midterms. More than 38 million people have already cast ballots in 47 states. Let's head out to the campaign trail.

It appears she did not employ any process to check outgoing ballots against the daily accepted report to verify that all ballots were created.\" Now, earlier this evening, I spoke with the director of Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA.

As you said, though, we have no information about specific or creditable threats to disrupt or compromise infrastructure. But we are working closely with state and local election officials to make sure they have everything that they need on Tuesday to run safe and secure elections. One of the reasons why I think the American people should have confidence in the integrity of the election is because we have put so much effort in developing mechanisms around information sharing through the election infrastructure information sharing and analysis center. We have provided all kinds of no-cost services. We can always do more, and we will do more. But I'm very confident that all of the things that happened over the past five years to include a lot more paper ballots -- I think we have over 90 percent paper ballots -- that we have been able to provide what is necessary.

It takes time to set up a special council office, get a staff in place, get office space and get up to speed.The benefits you would get from the special counsel I really don't think are there now. The benefits are you have someone who is at least arguably independent so it doesn't look so much like it is a political hit job. I don't think a special council is going to get any benefit on that front now. I think no matter who is appointed, Trump and his followers will immediately call it a witch hunt no matter what. So I don't think you get that benefit. Nor do I think there's a chance that a special council would survive a transition into a second Trump presidency or the presidency of a Trump follower. John Durham's investigation lasted into the Biden administration because the Biden administration acted in good faith to let him continue his work. I just don't see that happening if we transition to a Republican in 2024. So I think there's no benefit to appointing someone. It is not worth the cost of the delay it would take.",

We may not know which party will control the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night when we go to bed.These are the 35 Senate races this cycle. They're in light gray here because this is the live map. We're waiting for votes to come in. These will start turning red and blue on election night. But keep your focus on five states, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. These battleground states will determine which party controls the Senate. I want to talk specifically about Pennsylvania for a moment, because this is what I mean by pack your patience. It's the Fetterman/Oz Senate race. We know that in Pennsylvania, elections officials cannot even open ballots and begin processing and counting that absentee mail until polls open on Election Day. And it's going to take some time. There's going to be a substantial amount of absentee vote and it's going to take some time to count. So on election night, when this first starts filling in, I would imagine Mehmet Oz is going to have a big lead. Now whether or not he wins at the end, I don't know. But he's going to come out front with a big lead because Election Day vote, which tends to be more Republican will be counted first before the absentee vote which tends to be more democratic. So the more pro-Fetterman vote will start filling in as the night and possibly days wear on. An example as a reminder to folks is to go back to the 2020 presidential election. OK. And let me come out here and use Georgia as an example, 7:16 p.m. on November 3rd and 2020, votes just start coming in, Donald Trump way ahead, watch that timestamp. OK? 8:07, Donald Trump still way ahead. Midnight, November 4th, Donald Trump 315,000 votes ahead, eight percentage points ahead of Joe Biden. Twenty-four hours later, Donald Trump's lead is cut to 33,000 votes still quite close, but Trump on top. Twenty-four hours after that, still 4:47 a.m. November 6, Donald Trump has 665 vote lead. It was not until November 7th that Joe Biden actually came ahead of Donald Trump in Georgia. And as we know, Joe Biden won the state of Georgia. It just took some time for all of that to get voted.

National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, in a visit to Kyiv announced an additional $400 million in security assistance. Sullivan also repeated the administration's pledge to continue supporting Ukraine's war effort for as long as it takes, despite some bipartisan concerns about such an open-ended and expensive commitment.Meanwhile, a positive step for Ukraine's battered power infrastructure, the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia is now reconnected to the power grid after Russian shelling knocked it offline. That power plant is the biggest in Europe, critical to not just Ukraine but to Europe as well. It has lost power multiple times since the war began. Joining us now for more is CNN military analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel, if we look at the Ukrainian battlefields what we're most focused on right now is this area down here Kherson, and there's some speculation that the Ukrainians may soon mount an offensive there. How significant would that be?",
