He didn't do anything to hurt them tonight. He gave a very compelling speech. We can argue about the policy. That's what debates are about. He told a very compelling story. And the forgotten part, where he's from and where he will be. Look, the people of Erie, Pennsylvania and Grand Rapids, Michigan and Oshkosh, Wisconsin are going to see a lot of J.D. Vance. He's going to talk about growing up in Middletown. His family grew up in Kentucky. He grew up in Middletown, which was once an industrial town. There was a canal that ran all the way up the side of Ohio. In the old days, that's where the jobs were. They were all people who worked with their hands, manufacturing jobs.

Now, he did become an opponent of the war in 2004. But Vance's suggestion that Trump was on the opposite side of Biden on the question of starting the war, that Trump got this invasion question right while Biden was wrong, that's just not true.And that was not, Anderson, the only assertion tonight that was misleading or flat wrong, and I'll give you just some of them. A former Trump advisor, Peter Navarro, who's fresh out of prison, falsely claimed Jack Smith prosecuted him. Smith did not. A Florida congressman, Mike Waltz, mocked Biden for allegedly being focused on building electric tanks. That is pure fiction. Biden has made no push for electric tanks, though the army does want some other vehicles to be electrified. Various speakers depicted a country with rampant crime and violence without acknowledging that violent crime is now lower than it was in Donald Trump's last year in office, 2020. A former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, said Trump orchestrated an orderly end to the war in Afghanistan. Trump didn't actually orchestrate a withdrawal at all. Gingrich also claimed no U.S. soldier was killed in nearly two years there. There was not any two-year period under Trump when zero U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan. And finally, conservative commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump, Jr.'s fiancee, declared that Trump handed Joe Biden a booming economy.

Now, none of our sources said whether in this phone call Nancy Pelosi privately told President Biden that she believes he should drop out of the race, but it's important to note this is the second known conversation now between Nancy Pelosi and President Biden since his debate performance that really shook the party at the end of June. I should also note the White House wouldn't comment on our reporting in this meeting. They said President Biden is the nominee of the party. He plans to win. And a Pelosi spokesperson said Pelosi has been in California since Friday and has not spoken to Biden since. Obviously, Jake, we cannot overstate just how important Nancy Pelosi is to all of this.

So, Jake, taking together all of this, this is a different moment here as we hit the three-week period. As for the president, he's back in Delaware.

They really thought they were going to hit the ground running coming out of this. He was going to do a lot of public events. He was going to do a bunch of interviews. Well, now, he's going to self-isolate for a few days.And every interview and public appearance he has done has not done enough to materially change what you were hearing from Democrats behind closed doors, who do believe that it is up to the Pelosis and Schumers and that small group of advisers around him, the Mike Donalds, the Steve Ricchettis, to kind of have that conversation. And even they, behind the scenes, seem to be getting closer to that point.",

We are united to win. The Democrats see this here. This party has rallied around Donald Trump. For all the controversy about Trump in the past, this party has rallied around Donald Trump. So, Democrats are looking not just at the polling, but to David's point and to Jake's point. If you make a policy mistake or you did something out there, you can change that.[23:55:00] You can apologize. You can change your policy. You can have an event. This is a performance question. It's not just that they're telling the president, you're losing Michigan, you're losing Pennsylvania, you're losing Wisconsin, you're losing Nevada, you're losing Arizona. You're beginning to put New Mexico in play? What? You're beginning to put New Hampshire in play? What? You're putting Virginia in play? Hello? It's not just that. They're saying the reason is because the American people, to David's point about the poll and they're showing the data, they do not believe you are up to the job. That's not something you can change. At least if you come out of the debate, you knew they were raising that question. To Kaitlan's point and Abby's point about the interviews and the performances, if you thought you could change it, you have not succeeded because the numbers are getting worse.",

I'm just not satisfied that this is only a political campaign problem. To me, the country still has to operate and he's still supposedly the president.",
