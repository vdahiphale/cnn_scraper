That's as the United Airlines now investigates its fourth emergency incidents in five days. On Friday, a flight from San Francisco to Mexico City had to divert Los Angeles because of an issue with the hydraulic systems. CNN's Camila Bernal joins us live from the Los Angeles International Airport. Camila, this is just really the latest in a series of incidents for the airline. What's going on here?",

I mean, and passengers are terrified all of these incidents are unrelated and the airline says they're investigating them individually, but nonetheless, as it's concerning for a lot of the passengers especially the ones on these slides. You mentioned the latest one that was yesterday. It was a flight from San Francisco to Mexico City and the airline saying, you know, there are three hydraulic systems and one of them had the issues. So they diverted that flight, landed here at LAX at around 4But there was another incident also yesterday that was a plane from Memphis to Houston and then they said that part of it was because of the rain. So, this plane is landing, it's taxiing and it skids off the runway and goes into a grassy areas. So, passengers had a very three different deplaning experience here. This was a Boeing 737 with 160 passengers, six crew members. But again, it wasn't the only one this week. There was another incident that happened on Thursday and that was a flight from San Francisco to Osaka. This was a Boeing 777 with 235 passengers, 14 crew members, and a lot of us saw the video here. This was a tire that fell off the plane and it fell into a car. So that flight had to also be diverted to LAX and again, these passengers were put onto another plane and eventually went off to Japan. No one was injured, but nonetheless, enough other very scary situation. And then on Monday, another problem, this was with the Boeing 737, and this was a flight that was going from Houston to Fort Myers. And what happened here was that the engine ingested some of the bubble wrap, all of that one up in flames some of the passengers on the plight and then -- on the plane, they were able to see the fire. You know, CNN spoke to one of those passengers who said he essentially wrote a goodbye email to his wife, saying that, you know, he loved her and terrifying moments for him, even though he said he tried to stay calm. So, overall, just very scary situations for a lot of these passengers in different parts of the country. And United saying that this is something that they're going to look into with the manufacturers, with the FAA, with the NTSB. And again, they're saying that all of these incidents were separate, but they are looking and trying to figure out exactly what happened in each one of them. And it will take time to figure out what the problem was or how it can be fixed. They keep saying that safety is their top priority, Rahel.",

Well, the state of Georgia is the focus of the 2024 presidential race today as the Biden-Trump rematch take center stage in that critical battleground state. So, a short time ago, Biden landed in Atlanta. He's going to be appearing at a campaign event that a couple of hours. And around the same time, his presumptive Republican rival Donald Trump, will be holding a rally in Rome. That's north of Atlanta. Georgia is a key swing state that Biden won in 2020 by less than a percentage point, and it's the only swing state among primary contests happening on today, happening Tuesday rather. We have team coverage of these dueling campaign events. Steve Contorno is covering a Trump rally, but lets begin with Priscilla Alvarez. She is in Atlanta. Priscilla, let's start with you.

There's still another deadline fast approaching on March 22nd for another tranche of federal agencies.So the hope is that they will also be able to pass the bills so that the president can sign those before any type of shut down. For now, at least, there's no concern about a shutdown but this could all change very quickly depending on what happens in Congress. And if any of these bills gets stalled. And remember, Rahel, there's only one part of what the president is asking for. He also wants Congress to pass that national security supplemental request that includes those $60 billion for Ukraine, as well as aid for Israel, and billions of dollars for border security. So, the president also keeping up the pressure on Congress to get that request passed -- Rahel.",

Let's bring in Steve Contorno, who's covering the Trump campaign in Rome, Georgia. Steve, in 2020, Trump became the first GOP presidential candidate to lose Georgia in 24 years. How was he hoping to change that in 2024? STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Well, Rahel, yeah. As you mentioned, not only lose in 2020, but it's been a challenging state for him and for Republicans since that. Those two U.S. Senate runoff races, right after Trump's defeat here, they've lost -- but he lost some time to defeat the Republican governor here, Brian Kemp, in a primary challenge later on. And then his handpick candidate for Senate in 2022, Herschel Walker, he lost his election here. So this has been a challenging state for him. Plus, he has also been indicted here for his efforts to attempt to overturn the election in 2020. So that is recent electoral and political history here. What the recent suggests that Donald Trump remains very competitive here, that he is actually in the lead according to some polls. But you talked to Republican pollster here and strategists and they said that is, quote, polling mirage, and they said is very dangerous for us to count those polls in our favor at this point. And that, look, the Trump team acknowledged that this is going to be very close state. But I will tell you, he's not going to win it by changing hearts and minds in the room. This is a very Trump audience or even in this part of the state, this is a part of the state that is representative in Congress by Marjorie Taylor Greene. So, it's very conservative. She has been here all day, sort of amping up the crowd. She will speak later today. She's, of course, coming off as appearance at the State of the Union where she clashed with President Biden repeatedly. And I think you're going to see her and Donald Trump both lean in to the immigration debate. It is something that he has been making a focal point of his campaign ever since he became the presumptive nominee. I think you'll see more of that in just a few moments -- Rahel.",

Patrick, good to have you. You wrote an opinion piece this week for CNN.com. The headline is after Super Tuesday, the dreaded rematch is real. So what does that, what does that headline, the dreaded rematch? What does that say about the challenge ahead for both of these candidates as they try to motivate their bases and pull in undecided or unenthusiastic voters? PATRICK T. BROWN, FELLOW, ETHICS AND PUBLIC POLICY CENTER: Well, we've seen this movie before. It's the 2020 election rematch that I think so many voters, especially those in the middle, college-educated Republicans who maybe were soft on Trump and Democrats who came to vote, not necessarily for Joe Biden, but against former President Trump. We -- they're going to be -- faced with that twice again. And now, four years after President Biden's management of the administration, we have a chance to see what is going to look like again, and I think a lot of voters were who were kind of tired of Trump after four years, are now looking for another change.",

They've run the opposition ads already back in 2020. And so, I think a lot of voters are kind of dreading the slog, gritting their teeth about two old white gentlemen who have served their country in various ways, but don't really have a vision for -- a positive vision for America. I think President Trump has also to blame a little bit here, focusing so much on retribution and his adversaries, and less on positive steps like talking about a baby bonus, giving parents money after having a child.

The U.S. is continuing to conduct humanitarian airdrop into Gaza with another round coming just hours ago. The Hamas-run health ministry meantime, says that 25 people have now died in Gaza due to malnutrition and dehydration. Let's go to CNN's Clarissa Ward, who is live for us in Jerusalem. Clarissa, is -- is your sense that there is still a lot of optimism or much optimism that more aid will soon start getting through?",

That hasn't happened and it doesn't appear likely to happen. So now you see this kind of frantic attempt to improvise other potential solutions, whether that is airdrops which you mentioned. The U.S. today, dropping tens of thousands of meals and tens of thousands of bottles of water onto northern Gaza. But, Rahel, if you talk to any humanitarian aid worker on the ground or who has spent time in these types of environments, they will tell you that these air -- airdrops make a nice photograph or a nice picture? But they are not effective or efficient. And that the only way to really effectively distribute aid during a huge catastrophe like this one, is to do it on the ground. But in order to do that safely and efficiently, you need to have some kind of a ceasefire in place, at the very least, aid workers say, you need to have multiple entry points for that aid to go in. And one of the big issues right now, Rahel, as we've been discussing is that even if you can get that aid into the south of Gaza, into Rafah getting it up into the north, to hundreds of thousands of people who in the words of the U.N. are one step away from famine, that is extremely plead challenging. It's actually very dangerous at the moment as well. And so, the sort of, you know, bargaining goes on to try to get to some agreement with the Israelis towards opening another crossing from the north that would allow aid to get into the north of Gaza.",

It could take up to two months to put together.And when you're talking in the dire language that we're hearing the U.N. and other aid organizations talking and at the moment, two months seems like a very distant prospect even in a best-case scenario of getting it up and running three to four weeks that is still quite some time away. And again, when you spoke to one aid worker and what you hear is this is a glaring distraction from the obvious reality to anyone who does this kind of work which is that there needs to be more aid getting in on the ground. And that is the easiest, most sensible and efficient way to distribute it. We just need the political will of all the various different parties who would be involved, but primarily obviously of the Israelis who have control of all the borders going in and out -- obviously the Rafah crossing with Egypt.

DeSantis just announced new security measures, which includes about 140 troopers heading to Miami Beach and other cities.Now officials are hoping to avoid the violence from last year. Miami Beach also launched us a breakup campaign that includes hefty fines and parking fees and curfews and DUI, checkpoints. Governor DeSantis also dispatched 140 state troopers across Florida for assistance. Well, around the world, March 8 serves as a reminder of the long- standing movement for women's rights and a recognition of the achievements of women everywhere. But even in 2024, there are challenges facing women both here and abroad. Women are rallying for issues like wage gaps, reproductive rights, and longer maternity leave. I want to discuss all of this now with two special guests who were part of a recent panel speaking about International Women's Day this week. Kerri Murray, she is the president of the international disaster relief group, Shelter Box. And also Catherine Reitman, you might recognize producer, writer and star of the Emmy-nominated series \"Workin' Moms\" on Netflix. Good to have you both, ladies. Kerri, let me start with you. You've been on the front lines of global conflicts. You've been on the frontlines of natural disasters. Talk to us about from your perspective, the issues that women around the world are experiencing",
