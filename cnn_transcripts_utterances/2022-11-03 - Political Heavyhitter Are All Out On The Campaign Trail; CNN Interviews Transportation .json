They disagree with Congressional Republicans who voted with big pharma on social issues. The American people agree with us that Roe versus Wade was the right framework or at least the best framework that we had and disagree with the effort, the increasingly successful effort by Congressional Republicans and their appointees to take away a woman's right to choose. And you know, on issue after issue, this administration and our actions, and our policies is better aligned with the American people than anything we're seeing put forward by the other side. And I do think it is important for us to be leaning in on the issues that a lot of our critics raised, whether it's inflation, immigration or safety.

By the way, several times this summer that included me, sometimes the day after having an engagement with airline leaders on how they were dealing with this issue. The next morning we get up and find my own flight delayed or cancelled.The good news is we had seen a dramatic drop in cancellations and delays since the summer. I think a lot of that is because of steps that we had been urging airlines to take, like more realistic scheduling and continuing to push on hiring and staffing. We're better off than we were this summer. I am concerned as we head into Thanksgiving travel that we're not completely out of the woods and really need to keep pushing to ensure that we have an aviation system that can handle all of this demand. I would add our department has created a dashboard because we found that transparency is one of the things that seems to have a very powerful effect on the airline's behavior and their choices. So, you can go and see side by side, comparisons of how the different airlines will respond, how they will treat you. If you do have an issue, will they get you a voucher for a hotel or meal, will they offer to put you on another airline in order to get you on your way. You can go to our website to see what they will do. And if they don't follow the rules, especially on things like refunds, you can also go to our website to file a complaint and we will have your back.",

It wasn't as if it was centered, focused or solely on Democrats or Republicans but you say even in spite of that, Republicans might have a decisive advantage in enveloping more Latino voters under their big tent. Why?RUY TEIXEIRA, CO-EDITOR, THE LIBERAL PATRIOT SUBSTACK: Well, I think -- I think really what's happening is something that I think some of the people you interviewed got at and sit, I think Hispanic voters are tired of, you know, the Democrats in a sense taking them for granted, thinking of them as people of color or thinking of them as immigration voters or thinking of them as sort of automatic Democrats. And, you know, their attitude definitely is at this point what have you done for me lately? You know, from the polling data led by 2 to 1, they don't think Biden had the right priorities for the country. They disapproved of his economic management by about 30 points and on and on. It just seems like the Biden administration may have passed a bunch of legislation. But in terms of the actual day to day lives that Hispanic voters lead, they don't feel he's produced much and they also feel he's at the helm of a party that's moved to the left culturally in a way that isn't really consistent with the way these voters are coming from, who are moderate to conservative on social issues.

We come from different countries in Latin America. We have different interests. We are different people. And for some reason politicians have a really hard time understanding that.

Justice Department officials are discussing whether a Donald Trump run in 2024 would require a special council to oversee the two big federal investigations involving Trump. We've also learned that the Justice Department is staffing up so they can be prepared for whatever decisions come after the midterms including whether or not to indict a former president.But why would a special council be necessary? If only we had someone we could ask, Laura. Oh, it turns out that the Laura Coates worked in the Justice Department as a federal prosecutor. So, Laura, help us understand why -- what would a special prosecutor do?",

And so, this idea of a special council being someone who could be removed from the politics of it that's the theory and be judged as a truly neutral being. But of course, we all lived through the claims against a special counsel, Muller, for example. And the idea is that they believe some but it was a political witch hunt.

And also, to say, look, fine, I want this to be a truly transparent process, having that decision be made. It's not set in stone yet, Alisyn, but can you imagine if you've got the same arguments rehashed, we've had for, oh, about four years about witch hunts, and this is a way to weaponize the DOJ. They're hoping to avoid that. I don't know that it can be done and un-ring the bell, but that would be one step forward.",
