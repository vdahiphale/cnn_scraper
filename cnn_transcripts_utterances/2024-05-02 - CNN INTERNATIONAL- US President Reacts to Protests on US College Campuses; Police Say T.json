Defense attorneys really trying to highlight the fact that based on that testimony from Davidson, Donald Trump never actually signed the deal with Stormy Daniels, and really looked to distance the former president from any interaction between Davidson in the end, Trump's then attorney/fixer, Michael Cohen. The judge earlier today held a separate hearing on whether Donald Trump had violated again the gag order in this case and should be held in contempt. We don't know when that issue, when that ruling rather will be issued, but of course, we will stay on top of that and bring it to you as soon as we know more. It took about a week the last time around. CNN justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider is with us now.

So what the jury heard a little while ago was a small snippet from a recording of a phone call. And in it, you actually hear Michael Cohen talking about Donald Trump saying this. He said, he said to me, I hate the fact that we did it, meaning Donald Trump said to him he hated the fact that they paid Stormy Daniels off. And then Michael Cohen, you hear him responding saying every person we've spoken to will tell you it was the right move. So this does seem to be referencing the Stormy Daniels' payoff in a conversation that Cohen had directly with Donald Trump. And then just a little while ago, we actually heard a snippet of Michael Cohen's voice as well, seeming to talk to Donald Trump again. So this is again, all part of the preview of what is likely to come from prosecutors linking Donald Trump to the hush money payment and this alleged scheme to cover up this payment, those false business records. So you know, Erica, we are hearing from this data expert who may seem to be working in mundane terms, in terms of getting this metadata and the data from the cellphones, but this is really important because this is how prosecutors are going to introduce this audio evidence to the jury, and later, at some point later in this trial, we will actually hear directly from Michael Cohen.

He is on a phone call when the recording starts. When he hangs up,Michael Cohen says, \"That was a great call by the way.\" This is the call to Michael Cohen, calling, saying he needs to open a company. He has already spoken with Allen Weisselberg, of course, who held the purse strings there at the Trump Organization about how to set the whole thing up.

Well, CNN has been investigating an Israeli airstrike on another refugee camp in Gaza last month. A group of children were killed in that attack. We must warn you that there are disturbing images in this report from our Jeremy Diamond.   JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT:   Isa, two weeks ago, we brought you the story of a deadly strike on the Al-Maghazi Refugee Camp. The harrowing images of the bodies of children splayed around a foosball table in the middle of that street, and we've since spent the last two weeks investigating that strike. Our stringer in Gaza, Mohammad Al-Sawalhi went back to the scene of the strike documenting visual evidence from the strike, marks from shrapnel, a crater in the middle of the road, and pieces of shrapnel recovered at the scene. Three munitions experts who reviewed this visual evidence say that it was caused by a precision-guided munitions deployed by the Israeli military.

So Biden cannot be seen as accepting the validity of the criticisms that the students are in while at the same time, if he's seen as repudiating, a candidate who already is seen as a kind of machine candidate of the institutional party, loses whatever connection he has to the energy and idealism of young couple.

But the thing that I think needs to be emphasized, it's very easy toforget is that Biden's danger, like Humphrey's danger, by the way, in '68 is not to the left nearly as much as it is to the right. That is to say he has been losing votes among more conservative Democrats. Those people are, if you ask them, are you pro-Israel or pro-Hamas, it's an easy answer. They're pro-Israel. And they're certainly going to be hostile to what they consider to be chaotic demonstrations. So there is a greater danger to his right, as there was in Humphrey's case.

Lyndon Johnson in many respects was a very, very good president domestically, brought forth some major pieces of legislation. He chose not to run in '68 because of opposition to his views on Vietnam, and I worry very much that President Biden is putting himself in a position where he has alienated not just young people, but a lot of the Democratic base.

The final witness today, a digital evidence analyst who was questioned about messages and recordings on Michael Cohen's iPhones. Much of the day, however, was reserved for testimony from the attorney who negotiated Stormy Daniels' $130,000 hush money payment ahead of the 2016 election.Davidson denied that Daniels was trying to use leverage against Trump, although he did admit on the stand to using the word leverage with Cohen. Earlier in the day a prosecutor asked Davidson to explain the process of negotiating that $130,000 payment from Michael Cohen, who of course at the time was Donald Trump's personal attorney. The day started with Judge Juan Merchan holding a hearing to consider some new claims, four, from the prosecution, alleging that Donald Trump has once again violated the judge's gag order in this case. They're asking he be fined $1,000 for each of those four alleged violations. No ruling today but of course we'll stay on top of that and let you know when there is one. Katelyn Polantz joining us now with more as court has now wrapped for the day essentially. Most of the time, of course, devoted to Keith Davidson, but we did get some interesting information from that final witness, this data analyst -- Katelyn.",

However, they say that they will maintain consular assistance to Colombian citizens, both in Israel and Palestine.Late last night the Israeli foreign minister reacted to this decision from the Petro government calling Petro an antisemitic precedent full of hate, and remember that Israel and Colombia have enjoyed warm relationships for decades. In fact, Israel is one of the main supplier of light firearms and weapons to the Colombian Army and the Colombia Special Forces in particular. But I think that we need to look at this, Isa, from a broader context. Petro has been threatening with an action like this one for many times in the last seven months. Colombia has supported South African action at the International Court of Justice against Israel in the Hague. And Petro himself clashed repeatedly with the Israeli ambassador here in Bogota ever since the attack by Hamas against Israel on October 7th. And yesterday, when he made that announcement, Petro, he spoke about his desire to be a voice for millions of protesters, pro-Palestine protesters all around the world. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUSTAVO PETRO, COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Here in front of you, the government of change, the president of the republic, informs that tomorrow diplomatic relations will be broken with the state of Israel for having a government, for having a president that's genocidal.

So a lot of stake there. But I think it's clear that there is a direct line between those university protesters from Valencia in Spain, Paris, Sydney, or all across the U.S., and this action by the Colombian president who tries to be a world leader, to talk more and more on a global stage and not just to his own constituency here in Bogota -- Isa.",
