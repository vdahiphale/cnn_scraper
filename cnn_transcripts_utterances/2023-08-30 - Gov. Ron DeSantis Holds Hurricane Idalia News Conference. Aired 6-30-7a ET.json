He is giving updates on what is now a category four storm from Tallahassee.We will take you bake to him as soon as we know -- we're going to take you back to him right now. We have the feed back. DESANTIS: Do not run that generator inside your home. Do not run it inside your garage. It must be run outside your house. It needs to be at least 20 feet away from doors and windows. And you have to point the exhaust away from your home. We do not want to see any fatalities as a result of misuse of generators. So, there's a lot of people that are - that are on deck right now. There's going to be a lot of efforts as this storm passes. But this thing is hitting really within the next hour and a half most likely. It's going to make landfall. It is a major hurricane, as we have been saying. It was likely to be for the last couple days. And we just hope everybody stays safe. Don't put your life at risk by doing anything dumb at this point. This thing's powerful. If you're inside, just hunker down until it gets past you. You don't want to be messing around with these winds. There's going to be things flying all over the place. Obviously, if you're in a place that's close to the coast and you see that surge, that's going to be legitimate surge. It's going to be a big, big deal, and it's going to be very, very dangerous. And there we go with our - with our power here. We're back. So I'm going to have Kevin Guthrie come up. We'll also hear from Major General Haas, Admiral Schofield, and then one of our Leon County commissioners, Christian Caban, will be here. So, Kevin.",

Don't do anything that's going to put yourself in jeopardy. And there will be a lot of help coming on the back end of this storm.

I think that they've been very clear about the storm surge threat and all these zone a's across the gulf coast and probably more so than any storm that I can remember in recent years. So, people understand. You know, we've said from the beginning it was going to probably be a major hurricane. And that's what it is. And so we're here, and we're ready, and we're going to work hard on the back end to make sure everyone gets back up on their feet.",

It's saying, if you're in the path of where the eye wall is going, you know, at this point you've got to hunker down. And so those big bend counties, as we get into north central Florida, you know, you're in - you're in jeopardy at that point. And so it's really those places where it's going to hit the eye wall, where the eye wall is coming in to be able to not mess with it. It's going to be a significant, significant impact.",

You would need to be maybe even like on a three-story building because it is going to rise very, very highly. So -- but I -- there were some people -- now, most people did heed the warning, but there were some that just -- that's just -- that's what they wanted to do. And so once this passes, there will be rescue efforts done, and done if need be, and hopefully it's not necessarily, hopefully they knew what they were doing and they have a spot. But it's - you know, it's potentially very, very hazardous when you're talking about really anything even approaching ten feet.

You know, if you just look at the way Florida is cut, to have something go in this big bend, and it's going to be to Georgia relatively soon, whereas we've had some hurricanes, I mean like Ian, it rams in the southwest Florida and then it cut across the entire state and really impacted many, many millions of people.So, you don't want to get hit at all. You want it to be as modest an impact as is humanly possible. And I think that there's different paths that some of these storms have taken. Ian was one that was a really bad path just because it impacted so many people. Like, you know, people saw the images of Fort Myers Beach, and, obviously, that was a catastrophic -- those were catastrophic images. But, you know, you would go hundreds of miles away and you had major, major flooding, you had erosion on the east coast of Florida in places like Volusia County, the beaches and things like that. You had structures falling down because of that. So, it had massive, massive impacts. And so any time you do this, you know, you would want it to impact as small amount of places as possible.",

But it is very clear that in this moment, just an hour before landfall, at what his emergency management division director said would be about Keyton Beach, Florida, in that big bend region, it is time to be safe, hunker down and get to a safe place. We are going to have much more on this coming up, including President Biden, who his federal resources have been deployed in the area as well. My colleague Betsy Klein at the White House says he will be speaking about this publicly this afternoon when he convenes his cabinet. Obviously FEMA playing an enormous role on the federal level as well. So you've got federal, state, local, and, obviously, residents as well. We'll be talking to all of them over the course of the next several hours. Again, this has been a rapid intensification of a major storm with no precedent in hitting this region where it is headed, the big bend region of Florida. We are going to keep you updated throughout the course of the next several hours. You just heard from Governor Ron DeSantis, as he said, significant, significant impact. That impact coming within the next hour or so. We'll be back with more. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
