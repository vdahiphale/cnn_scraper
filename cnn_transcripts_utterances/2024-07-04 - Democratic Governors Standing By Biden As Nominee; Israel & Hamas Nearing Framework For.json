An Israelisource tells CNN that both sides are nearing a framework agreement for a ceasefire and a hostage release deal. A Hamas official telling CNN, quote, we have put forward some demands that achieving securing access to a complete ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Right now, Palestinians are evacuating southern Gaza under orders from the Israeli military. Let's bring in CNN's Max Foster. He is live for us in London. Max, we have been in this position before where such a deal seemed imminent. How close are they and what's different this time. MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  We don't know, but that's partly why there seem to be some positivity here because normally, the Israelis would respond very quickly saying this is not the deal for us and we're not getting that this time. Sources saying they are considering a deal and Hamas has reacted to some of the elements around this framework positively. So, everyone's looking at it and the process would work, like this, you know, Netanyahu would look at whether he liked it or whether he good work with it, and what we are talking about here as a framework to deal, not the deal itself, that would come much further down the line. And then he would consider it, you know, take consultations on that. And then you'd have to take it to the war cabinet as well. So, we're looking to see if those movements are happening behind the scenes. But certainly, something that both sides appear to have which they can begin work on with a view to getting a deal which is obviously much more progress than we've had before.",

It would be how many and which Israelis would be released in exchange for which Palestinians would be released from prison as well, and how many of them. So that's going to be a big part of the debate. And obviously, a little the domestic pressure on Netanyahu is coming from the families of Israeli hostages, he has to respond to that because it's -- you know, this sympathy, of course, within Israel for those families and the hostages themselves.And maybe there has been some movement on that in terms of what he can offer in return to Hamas, we just don't know the details of that yet, but certainly, that's been a big sticking point going through.",

So they're always in the room, they always part of the debates.But certainly, President Biden is set up and giving speeches and said we close to submitting and it hasn't transpired. The Israelis are then come back, saying, you know, it's not entirely right. Blinken has worked extremely hard with all of the negotiators here in Egypt and the. Qatar as well as the Israelis to try to get some sort of deal, but they haven't got a deal quickly, as quickly as they had wanted. So if they can reach a deal, of course, it would bolster Biden's foreign credentials. But well wait to see whether or not actually something happens and whether or not actually people will say Netanyahu that push this through without any pressure from the Americans. He didn't respond to it. I don't know.",

They've got some tropical storm-force conditions, but those hurricane winds are expected in the next couple of hours. We're still dealing with a major category three hurricane when 120 mile per hour wind sitting 55 miles south and east, their Grand Cayman. Wind gusts, there have already been over 44 miles per hour.You can see where some of those wins getting into to the islands and departing parts of Jamaica. Jamaica's conditions are getting better as Cayman Islands conditions deteriorate. We'll continue to find it at the Cayman Islands today. Then as we go into tomorrow, we're looking at another landfall somewhere in Mexico in Yucatan Peninsula, where we could find some storm surge, heavy rain, again, hurricane conditions from Cozumel to Cancun, and then we'll find it getting back into the Gulf of Mexico, and then we'll have to see where it can go after that. Does it restraint in a little bit in the warm, open waters? Does it turn towards Mexico, or Texas, something that we'll have to watch. But heavy rain across the Yucatan peninsula, looking at up to eight inches of rain possible that could lead to some flash flooding and mudslides. So, it will continue on this weakening trend as it gets towards Mexico, but it's still expected to make landfall as a hurricane. Hurricane warnings are in effect there as we go into tomorrow and then again, we could be looking at another landfall somewhere between Mexico and Texas, something to watch as we head into the week. It really all depends on how strong this area of high pressure as is if it nudges itself a deeper into Mexico, or if it makes it to Texas -- Kasie.",
