He's fairly inexperienced, fairly unknown. He's never -- he's not going to be speaker of the House no matter what happens in this, I mean, maybe in the future someday, but like in 2023, he's not going to be speaker of the House.

If this number rises above the 20 that we saw yesterday when Byron Donalds actually, you know, flipped his vote, I think will be probably more telling when it's a candidate like this who is, as you say, somebody they've thrown out there.It's also potentially, you know, a risk for them to put Scalise's name forward at this stage.

So far, that has not been said. And I think that they're revealing what underlies all of this, which is just personally, McCarthy is unpalatable to them. They want to humiliate him.

Yesterday, he lost 20 votes, we'll see if more occurred. Yesterday, he seemed to think that perhaps he had peeled away some of those opponents. So I asked him, what happens if you lose more votes here on the fourth ballot. And he said, it doesn't matter, I still have the most votes.Now, Hakeem Jeffries actually has more votes than him, but among Republicans, he has the most votes. And he added, we can go through every name in the conference. At the end of the day, we'll be able to get there. So he still believes, despite the firm opposition among that block of members who are denying the votes for the speakership, that eventually he'll be able to get there. Now, the problem has been that the negotiations have not produced the result that he has wanted. The emissaries of his have reached out to some of those key detractors. They have yet to get a full sense of what everything they want in exchange for supporting McCarthy. Some of them just simply will not get there. And Jim Jordan, who is a McCarthy ally, who had been pushed by those dissidents, told me that he went to them and urged them not to nominate him here. He had been nominated twice yesterday, despite his opposition for challenging McCarthy. They listened to him. They decided not to nominate Jordan but by nominating Byron Donalds. Once again, they are showing that they are not moving anywhere near the McCarthy camp. So the question now is, what happens after this vote? The vote automatically would happen in the fifth ballot unless they seek to move to adjourn. I was told by an Aegis now it's unclear exactly what will happen after this. So a lot of questions for McCarthy, his future and he indicated to me he's still pushing ahead. He believes he can get there, even though he hasn't been able to now have a full balance here.",

There have been some discussions about delaying it until tomorrow, having an adjourn -- allowing that those discussions to continue to play out, give more time for those opponents to explicitly say what they want. But the Democrats would have to agree to that because they need 218 votes to adjourn the chamber.And there are several Republicans who won't vote to adjourn. That means they need support from Democrats. Democrats have no incentive to do that. They want McCarthy on the floor losing ballot after ballot after ballot. Now, there may be a point later today where they do decide to adjourn. At the moment, that has not been their posture. They want McCarthy to go through what has been a pretty painful exercise for him and his allies. But this is a very fluid situation, Anderson, that this could change pretty rapidly. But what is not changing are the votes. McCarthy looks like he's on the way to losing. It looks like the same group of members here. Twelve votes in counting. He can only afford to lose four on his way to probably losing 20. We'll see if that opposition grows, something they fear may happen.",

And that is because you've got these 20 plus, let's see how many votes Byron Donalds gets today if that number increases. Really want to continue embarrassing on the House floor, Kevin McCarthy.

But McCarthy's strategy right now is to split this group and try to pick them off one at a time. Now, that's a tall order because they would need to pick off 16 of them because there are 20 defectors. We'll see what the number is today. But 20 defectors, though they needed not take that many back. So they want to isolate them, try to get each one to flip on their own.Frankly, you have to use pretty heavy handed tactics, I think, to do that at this point. I'm not sure this is one of those -- I don't think you can use carrots right now. I think it's now they're bringing out the sticks and, but we'll see if it's --",

I mean, that very much backfired. And we saw people dig in more and coalesce. They've got probably received they get the 20 today. If they get more than the 20, frankly, they just need to kind of do what they're doing over and over again. They whipped him three times, four times now. And they are just going to keep doing it. It's telling that he didn't reach out to Donalds. He may have been able to peel off Donalds. He didn't reach out to Boebert either. So this idea that they're trying to split people and isolate people, they don't seem to be trying very hard if they didn't go for Donalds or Boebert. The other thing that I think is unhelpful is Bacon has been out saying, well, maybe there's going to be some coalition speaker. We'll get some Democrats. I think if you're that 20, you're going to say, listen, this is just proof that Kevin McCarthy is part of a UNA party, right? This is why they don't want him in the first place. So, I mean, I think just strategically there isn't much of a strategy. There isn't much of a plan on the McCarthy side, and there is a very, very effective plan among the rebels.",

They just want to show that all of those options are better than Kevin McCarthy for those 20 votes.What they should do if they want to move on to governing, but I don't expect that's the case is put up someone like a Steve Scalise, somebody who could credibly get potentially more votes than Kevin McCarthy. I'm not sure there's a sitting Republican who could get 218 votes in this moment, but I think that there may be some who could get closer to it than McCarthy.
