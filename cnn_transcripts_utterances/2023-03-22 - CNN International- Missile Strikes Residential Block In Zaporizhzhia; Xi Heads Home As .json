We're live in Ukraine with the latest.A high stakes balancing act for the Fed as it weighs a decision on interest rates in the midst of banking worries and rising inflation. More on what to expect. And sandstorms blanket Beijing as the air pollution there soars off the charts. A swarm of Russian missiles has bombarded parts of Ukraine overnight, apparently targeting residential areas, including Zaporizhzhia. This is social media video of a building there, and you can see the moment very clearly that a missile hits it. Meanwhile, in Kyiv, a drone hit a residential building, killing four people. Let's bring in Ivan Watson following the story from Kyiv, Ukraine. Ivan, what more are you learning about these latest attacks?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, it's a deceptively kind of warm day in late winter, early spring here. And that's when the Ukrainian authorities say at least two Russian missiles slammed into the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, hitting two nine story apartment buildings.We've just gotten casualty figures from the acting mayor of the city, who says that 18 people have been wounded, including two children aged seven and nine, that 11 adults have been hospitalized. The fire department was on the scene, search and rescue as well. You can see from the amateur footage from the scene some of the damage that these powerful weapons caused, again against these residential buildings. This isn't the first time that apartment buildings in Zaporizhzhia have been hit by Russian missiles. The city is about 25 minutes drive from active front lines and other apartment buildings have been absolutely decimated in past months by similar types of attacks. I think the timing of this is also interesting because just last night, the leaders of China and Russia were kind of embracing theirselves each other, bidding fond farewell to each other after two days of meetings in Moscow and declaring how they wanted to create a more just, more peaceful, more democratic international order before the Chinese leader left. And then that night, the Ukrainian authorities say that Ukrainian cities and towns came under multiple missile and drone attacks from the Russian military. In the southern port city of Odesa, several missiles fired, the Ukrainians say, by Russian warplanes. Some of them were intercepted. At least one got through the defenses and hit the city. Still trying to hear more about the extent of the damage there. And meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force says at least 21 of these Iranian made Shahed drones that Iran provides to Russia were fired from the north of Ukraine at Ukrainian cities and towns. That some of them hit a town about 50 miles outside of the capital city, Kyiv, killing at least four people. That air defenses succeeded in knocking down 16 of the 21 drones. But everyone that gets through can still hurt innocent people, civilian people. On the flip side of this terrible conflict, Bianca, the Russians have been saying that some kind of drones were targeting probably from Ukraine, the city of Sevastopol in the Russian occupied Crimea peninsula. The Russian Defense Ministry saying that they succeeded in knocking down some of these drones. So it's giving you a picture of the deadly long distance war that's being waged against cities, at towns on both sides of the conflict, even as the Russian and Ukrainian militaries continue killing each other on the front lines day after day.

Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced solidarity along with vows to advance their country's economic interests. Putin also touted China's self- proclaimed peace plan for Ukraine, dismissed by the U.S. as diplomatic cover for Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): Of course we did not ignore the situation around Ukraine. We believe that many of the points on the peace plan put forward by China are consistent with Russian approaches and can be taken as the basis of a peaceful settlement when the west and Kyiv are ready for it. But this readiness is not observed on their side. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, in terms of the peace plan, well, Russia says it's open to it, although as you heard Vladimir Putin say there, he doesn't feel that either Kyiv or the larger west is open to it at the moment.And so, it's not clear what the status of it is going to be. There were discussions a couple of days ago in Kyiv about having a first phone call with Xi Jinping and President Zelenskyy, although at the moment that has not taken place, and I'm not sure -- excuse me -- what plans there are for that. In terms of what else Russia got out of this, well, it was a massive diplomatic coup for a world leader like Xi Jinping to stand side by side by Vladimir Putin at a time when he's isolated in the rest of the world. Just days ago, he was indicted by the International Criminal Court, for instance, for war crimes. More than a dozen deals were signed on joint projects to bring the two countries closer together. But you're right to say that there weren't any tangible results in terms of -- from the Russian point of view in terms of the Chinese giving a full throated support for the invasion of Ukraine, or on the provision of military aid. And, you know, who knows what was discussed behind closed doors. And most of those discussions were in private, but in public at least, there were just general expressions of goodwill between these two countries as they move closer and closer together.",

In a few hours, it will announce whether it's going to raise interest rates again and how high that hike will be. It's a delicate balancing act for the Fed as it tries to tame inflation and avoid spooking the markets already on edge about the banking system. Who better to discuss this with then, CNN's Anna Stewart, who joins me now. Anna, it is a dilemma and a difficult balancing act. Where are they going to land on this?",

      "sentences": "And I feel like with these decisions, there often is a balancing act, particularly when you're raising rates to try and tackle inflation. If you go too far too fast, then you can push an economy into recession. But it's got even more complicated as a result of the last few weeks of this turmoil, really, in the banking sector, particularly in the U.S.Because part of the problem has been interest rates. So what do investors want to see from this meeting? I feel like there are three options on the table for the Federal Reserve. Number one, a big hike, half a percentage point. Now, this would look at the economic data. A tight labor market, high inflation, it is coming down, but it remains high. And it would just tackle that. The second option is to read the room and think, well, that first option may really spook the market, so let's react with a smaller hike. But also try not to spook markets as much, particularly as they've come back in the last 24 hours. It feels like perhaps a banking contagion could be contained. The third option is to do nothing and to make the banking issue the focus of today's meeting and leave the rate rise for later. But that could actually speak markets as well, because perhaps that would mean the Federal Reserve wasn't taking inflation seriously enough. So those are the three major options. There's also, of course, the messaging around these decisions, which is just as important, if not more important, than the rate decision itself. And you'll be pleased to know the dot plot, the quarterly dot plot will be out today, we believe, and that will look at what the forecasts are for the rate rises going ahead. And I think that will be critical in terms of what investors see.",

Eleven banks coming together to throw a lifeline to First Republic recently.Yesterday, comments from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen certainly seemed to calm market nerves. We saw a big rebound, for instance, in First Republic, but we do probably have to wait a few more days to see whether it really has settled. But today is critical. So what happens today will be critical, I think, to know whether or not we can move on from this crisis of confidence as much as anything.",

      "sentences": "Bianca, this law makes it extremely difficult to be gay in Uganda, period, because it criminalizes even identifying as LGBTQIA Plus. What it says is that there are only two binary genders, male and female, and anything else apart from that is illegal. Just identifying as LGBT will attract a prison sentence of up to 20 years.Homosexual acts, same sex acts will get life imprisonment and aggravated homosexuality, which is this new thing they invented that will get the death penalty in Uganda. Again, this was passed by a large number of members of parliament in Uganda, but it still has to go to President Museveni for assent. He's likely going to sign it into law because the Latania (ph) general and his prime minister were in parliament and they said that they supported, they're fully behind it. President Yoweri Museveni himself has called homosexuals deviants and said he's not sure if it's nature or nurture and accused western nations of imposing their practices on Africans, even though there's some scholarship that homosexuality predates colonization in Africa. Homosexuality is illegal in about 30 of -- in more than 30, actually, of Africa's 55 nations. But this law in Uganda goes much further than any of them. And there's some concern that a lot of the rhetoric, a lot of defunding and sponsorship of some of these anti-LGBT and anti- abortion laws in Africa are actually funded or sponsored by Christian conservative groups from America, and which is why you see language that similarly mirrors what you've heard in the U.S. such as protection of traditional family values, which is something that translates very well in conservative Christian societies like in Uganda. Because this law, Bianca, has a lot of support among the ordinary Ugandans who see homosexuality as something that's abhorrent because of the Christian values.",
