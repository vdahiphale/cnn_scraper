In Russia Wagner Head Yevgeny Prigozhin on the move again, back in Russia specifically St. Petersburg, where a Summit for leaders of African nations is being held, no photo opportunity with President Putin expected of course although today's events to further complicate Prigozhin's perplexing let's call it that status in Russia, we'll be discussing. In the meantime nothing perplexing about today's central bank action, the European Central Bank, just announcing an expected quarter point rate hike that's the ninth rise in a row and it takes borrowing costs of three and three quarters of a percent little guidance though from Christine Lagarde and Company on what next? It says all options are open and that's pretty reminiscent of the Fed think too after they raised rates to 22 year highs, Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying a September hike remains on the table although many believe the Fed is now finished. Jay Powell also noting the resilience of the U.S. economy and those staffers no longer expects a recession and I have to say the latest growth data from the United States absolutely screams that. Fresh data this Thursday morning showing the U.S. economy growing at a much better than expected annual rate of 2.4 percent in the second quarter and we've had a whole slew of strong data today to support that as well. The stock market reaction, as you might expect very positive U.S. futures rallying after the DOW's 13th Street winning session. The NASDAQ today's outperform a bullish tone, too, as you can see in Europe and across Asia as well strong earnings also contributing to the market mood with a whole array of firms raising their forward guidance. That includes Meta the parent company of Facebook, enjoying a rebound in digital ad sales just like Alphabet's Google, in fact, as you can see there Meta shares set to rally almost 10 percent in early trade and make that a more than 140 percent rally so far this year. All right, much more on the Fed and markets later on in the show, but first to Prigozhin in St. Petersburg, according to a telegram channel linked to the Wagner Mercenary Group Yevgeny Prigozhin is back in Russia. This is the first time the Wagner boss has been seen inside Russia since leading last month's armed rebellion. The last time he was seen in public, in fact, was on July 19th, when he appeared in a video filmed in Belarus. Nic Robertson joins us now. Nic, I think many thought it was remarkable that he remained at large after that mutiny attempt. But now back in Russia, it seems no less. What do you make of this?",

And while there have been many people pointing out that only about 17, heads of state went to the Africa Summit in the Russia Africa Summit in St. Petersburg, substantially down from 2019. The fact that anyone showed up is significant for the President since he has been isolated from much of the rest of the world. He did say that Russia's investment across the African Continent, the trade has gone up to 18 billion, Julia. Well, if you compare that to U.S. trade, it's a small amount. If you compare that, again to Chinese trade it's a very small amount. So Russia has a long way to go in terms of building up trade relations in the African Continent. But given his isolation from Europe and the U.S. it is a potentially very important set of countries for Putin to try and win.

It's surrounded by Mali,and Burkina Faso where the Islamist insurgency is at its peak, where groups affiliated to ISIS and Al Qaeda have been active and have led to thousands of deaths, and a lot of suffering for so many citizens of the Sahel. So but what happens next? It's unclear because for one, when will President Bazoum show up in public? Will they allow him to go to another country on exile? Or will they put him on trial for any perceived crimes? It's hard to tell. But the bigger problem here is that this risks contagion in the region, the reason why the U.S. and France a lot of the other international community put a lot of weight in Niger is because in 2021, for instance, it became -- it got for the first time a peaceful handover of power. The first time it had had that since 1960, when he got independence from France. Four coups since then, if this is successful, it will be the fifth coup, but think about the neighborhood, Mali and Burkina Faso have each had at least four coups just in the last four years. So it's a really worrying situation there. That is why you see the U.S. the European Union, the UN and the African Union, all calling for the release of President Bazoum and also a return to that democratic path, because there's risks backsliding and wiping out all the gains that the country has made, Julia.",

And the heaviness comes from the salt in the Atlantic world, that's also why you don't see the same kind of circulation in the Pacific. And that salt water here can be fresh. And if there's too much melt off from the ice sheet, too much one off from rivers and precipitation into the ocean and export of sea ice and fresh water from the Arctic Ocean there. If it shuts off, that's a point of no return that we've known for a long time, are the climate models that basis for the IPCC assessment that it's very unlikely to happen within the 21st century. A little bit too conservative, it turned out. But we know that the most conservative so if we instead had data that would support what we see in the past 20 years where A mark has actually been measured directly. But only for 20 years, we've seen a weakening, but that weakening could be natural variability we do not know. So the only way we can see the difference between this and natural variability is if we can extend the data going further back. And this is something that was an aquifers at the Germany at the Potsdam Institute and other places have been very thoroughly about using a sign of the A mark from ship measurements of surface temperatures that goes all the way back to the 19th century.",

No later than 2095, though you expect it to be, you know, somewhere in that, Suzanne, to your earlier point about me getting the consequences potentially wrong? What would be the consequences if this did collapse? S. DITLEVSEN: Yes, first, I want to make something more precise. So we have based our analysis on these historic data. And of course, these historic data are approximate data of what we want to analyze. And when we give a confidence interval, so we say from 2025 to 2095, it is given that this data is actually a good relevancy of -- .",

And Suzanne, youcan weigh in on this first, if you don't mind. What's missing for me is why? Why does it occur? What's the catalyst that makes this happen? I mean, some of those other studies have cited perhaps melting ice from the Arctic. What is the catalyst? And does that necessarily matter? Is the point just we have to do more about human climate change? P. DITLEVSEN: Well, we believe it is the melting that is caused by global warming. So it's kind of a difficult story saying that Europe will be colder, but the world will be warmer. But that is actually what is in the pipeline, and the cost will probably be this increase in freshwater is just not monitored very precisely. So what we did was to actually say as little as possible of the course just saying that, well, we know that things are changing. And if it changes as a business as usual, in the future, this is the consequence. So in some sense, this is the worst case scenario from the IPCC's projections, where we say this is going to happen very fast. And it came to us as a surprise to me that was this early.",

And I was also we were both very surprised for having this very early result. And we do hope we are wrong. We should also say that our estimate is built on what we call business as usual. And that means that we continue with the greenhouse gas emissions as we have done until now. And of course, that is, I hope, unrealistic, I hope that we will be decreasing the emissions. And then these estimates, of course, will change, of course, they will change. So, since we have not put any assumptions on our analysis, it is built upon that we continue the way we did.

The city office there is on record and the highest ever ocean temperatures for this time of year. The consequences are clear, and they are tragic. Children swept away by monsoon rains, families running from the flames, workers collapsing in scorching heat. For vast parts of North America, Asia, Africa and Europe, it's a Cruel Summer, for the entire planet, it is a disaster. And for scientists, it is unequivocal, humans are to blame. All this is entirely consistent with predictions and repeated warnings. The only surprise is the speed of the change. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
