I'm afraid to say I was up and about at that time and the rain was biblical, just washed this road away. You can see the gas line still there, there was until about 30 seconds ago where - for Lauren-looking palm tree hanging over my shoulder. The earthmover just pulled that down. Kind of emblematic of what's going on in this part of California right now.Now, the reason that they are trying to make at least one lane here possible is this is the only road that connects (inaudible) that are further up the hillside from me. All these people are right now blocked in, no way to get out, no way to evacuate even if they had to. So this right now trying to fix some infrastructures so much of this state has been hit by the storm. So much water, slippage is onto roads. Ironically, some people here were also without water service for a while that has now been restored. We're hearing in Watsonville, just a little bit, about a half hour away from here, there is flooding in residential neighborhoods. There are flood watches across much of the state about 17 million Californians under flood watch right now. At the moment, we do not have any rain actually falling from the sky. But we do have all this water rushing down the rivers. We have the snow melt from this warm storm that's melting that snow that's fallen over the past couple of months. And we are in line for another so called atmospheric river to hit this part of California. The forecast for Soquel over the next few days is rain through Tuesday.

His lawyers have said this is selective prosecution. They've been looking at him every which way and this is what they're going at.

Social Security is something that people pay into their entire work lives, whether you're wealthy or whether you're not wealthy.And so to take away benefits from people who have paid in would be very difficult. I think it's more treacherous when you talk about raising the retirement age. And Congress has thought about this and has thought about doing it for a long time. In a way, you have to give Nikki Haley some credit for raising the issue because you want you want social security to be solvent, and a lot of young people believe it's not going to be there for them.

And these are systems that are not as large as perhaps other systems that the U.S. is sending, they're shoulder fired, they're things like javelin, anti- tank systems and Stinger anti0aircraft systems. But there's - it's still significant, we are told, that they're sending them to Iran, because the main reason why they're doing that is likely because Iran is then going to reverse engineer the systems to make their own tools and potentially proliferate those systems throughout the region. And the Iranians have actually proven to be quite adept at doing this. They have reversed engineered a number of us made systems in the past, including anti-tank guided missiles and drones. So this is something that is sparking a lot of concern, of course, among Middle East watchers, because it could cause some unease in the region. But it also - it's also important to note that this is not necessarily a widespread or systematic issue in Ukraine. The Ukrainians are not losing a ton of us provided equipment to Russian forces. And every time they do lose a system that has been provided by the U.S. or the West, they actually do inform the Pentagon when those systems fall into Russian hands, either because the Ukrainians have had to withdraw suddenly or because they are overrun, so this happens in war, right. And that is essentially the message that we're getting from the Pentagon. We were told by a defense official that Colin Cole, when - a senior Pentagon official - his comments on this stand regarding the diversion of the weapons that the U.S. is providing to Ukraine. It is not happening in large number as Cole said but they are seeing Russia capturing some of that equipment. However, right now, it's not a huge concern. But this partnership between Iran and Russia, it is growing, it is intensifying and it is concerning leaders, of course, globally, guys.",
