(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Moments after impact, elite Ghulani Brigade trainees struggle to save lives. The worst of the wounded whisked away to nearby hospitals by helicopter. Others taken by ambulance, medics swarming to the IDF base 40 miles from the front line in Lebanon. Within hours, the toll becoming clear, four dead, eight others seriously injured, making it the deadliest for troops outside of combat zones since October 7th last year. HAGARI (through translator): We need an improvement to our defects. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Israel's prime minister on site inspecting the damage inside the canteen, which appears to have been the target, timed close to 7 p.m. when troops would have been having dinner, uncompromising in his response. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I want to clarify, we will continue to strike Hezbollah without mercy everywhere in Lebanon, including Beirut. ROBERTSON (voice-over): After the strike, Hezbollah claiming it was a complex attack involving rockets, the decoy, Israel's air defenses and a swarm of drones. Regardless of this claim, in recent days they've been threatening strikes on gatherings of troops away from the war at Lebanon's border. And in recent months have released what they claim is drone surveillance video of sensitive sites deep inside Israel. But Hezbollah may have had unwitting help from the IDF in their intelligence gathering. An IDF promotional video of the base 30 miles north of Tel Aviv reveals its layout in detail, including the location of the canteen. As the IDF expands its cross-border raids, it says a targeting Hezbollah in an increasingly protracting campaign there, a new reality is emerging. After heavy blows, Hezbollah is finding its feet and its wings, becoming a lethal threat far from the front lines. The four trainee troops who died, all 19 years old. Nic Robertson, CNN, Jerusalem.

It's striking in the south, it's striking in the Bekaa Valley, it's striking in the southern suburbs of Dahiya, it's striking in central Beirut, it's striking in the mountains, it's striking in the north Tripoli, the second largest city in Lebanon; it's striking even in Christian areas in Mount Lebanon and the north as we've seen yesterday.This is really all out war. I think what we have seen in the past few days or so is that Israel's and American celebration of victory over Hezbollah was very premature. Many Americans, as you know, officials and Israeli officials have already written the obituary of Hezbollah. Hezbollah seems to be on its feet. It has regained the initiative. It's escalating its attacks. It has fired hundreds of missiles at the heart of Israeli cities, including Haifa and Tel Aviv. And just yesterday, or the day before yesterday, it targeted one of the most important military bases, training special operation forces and killing and injuring schools of Israeli soldiers. This is all out war. This is a protected conflict. Hezbollah is planning for the long game. I think sadly and tragically, this will turn out to be as badly as Gaza, if not more so, in the next few weeks and next few months, unless a ceasefire is achieved sooner rather than later.",

Here we are now. The fact that the United States has deployed the most sophisticated air defense system to, or will deploy it in the next few days to Israel along with 100 American soldiers to man the air defense system, tells me that the Biden administration is expecting the worst.He's expecting Israel to retaliate big times against Iran, and he's also the Biden administration expecting Iran to retaliate against Israel's response. So we could wake up tomorrow and see really all out regional conflict directly between Israel and Iran. So the war in Gaza, Israel's war in Gaza, which the Biden administration has been saying, he does not really want the war to escalate beyond Gaza. Not only the Biden administration has failed to bring about an end to the bloodletting in Gaza, the Biden administration has failed to prevent the war in Gaza from escalating into Lebanon and now escalating into a direct war between Israel and Iran.

Arsonists really pouring gasoline on a raging fire, and the tragedy is that civilians are paying a heavy price for that.

My take on it, if you really ask me, I mean, what I really would like to see. I really believe deep in my heart, Rosemary, the Palestinians are Israel's only salvation, not the United States. The Palestinians could become Israel's moral conscious in the same way that the African- American community is the moral conscious of the United States.

It shoots them down in their final dive towards their target, so about a hundred or slightly more miles out, but it can detect them more than ten times as far based on its radar. Crucially, it can work with not only the Navy destroyers that are operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and intercepted ballistic missiles of their own on October 1st and April 13th, but it can also work with Israel's own complex and layered air defense system. There is the shorter Iron Dome, the medium-range David's Sling, and then the longer-range Arrow. So the THAAD system, when it's deployed, when it's set up in Israel with a hundred U.S. troops, about a hundred or so operating it, it will add not only a quality system, but crucially it will add quantity, simply more interceptor missiles that are capable of intercepting an Iranian barrage. And that of course is what the U.S. is watching for here. Israel has vowed that it would respond to that Iranian barrage of more than 180 ballistic missiles on October 1st. Iran has in turn said that it too would retaliate for any attack. So it's into this situation that the U.S. has deployed this advanced anti-ballistic missile system to Israel, preparing for the possibility of an Iranian attack. It also adds more defenses in Israel, should Hezbollah continue to launch rockets, missiles, perhaps even drones. So again, it adds a quality system to Israel's layered defense, and it also shows the U.S. commitment to Israel's defense. And that message of support for Israel and a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies, that's just as important as the military capability itself. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.
