But he is still referred to by his former title, \"President Trump,\" when he's at his Bedminster Golf Club, in New Jersey, as he is tonight, or at Mar-a-Lago. I'm here tonight with CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid, and CNN Senior Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez, both of whom have been covering this all day.

That suggests she really wants to move this along quickly. Now, it's impossible to say, at this point, if this will go to trial, before the election. We need to know a lot more.

I have pictures from that. And I walked over this way, frankly, to get away from the mob. And so, for the judges, in this courthouse, they've been dealing, with hundreds of pro-Trump defendants, who they're having to sentence. One of them was being sentenced today, a Proud Boy. And so, I think there's a reason why they showed up, because, of the importance. And I think one of the big things that has happened, in this courthouse, is the judges have repeatedly said that they believe that it's important, for these cases, to be adjudicated, before the next election, in part, to send a message, right, to try to prevent this from happening again.

But you have no doubt that had the January 6 committee not done the work that it did, and got the information that it did, and captivated the public, in the way that it did, that the Justice Department would perhaps not have gone forward with these? ADAM KINZINGER, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE - ILLINOIS, (R) FORMER MEMBER, JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, I mean, I have no doubt that that actually ignited them to start something. Maybe they would have eventually started something. But I think, my sense was when they saw the information we had, when they realized that? And this is a big thing, because as we talk about the January 6th, and the day of January 6th, sometimes we can get lost in the violence of that day. And it's important. But January 6, to me, and it's one of the things I learned, through this committee, through our research on that, it was a symptom. The real rot was everything that led up to it.

So, they don't put everything, prosecutors don't put every single thing, every witness, every piece of information, inside the indictment. The trial is going to be much fuller, many more witnesses. And I think, the way Jack Smith, in his press conference, I think he framed it exactly the way Congressman Kinzinger just said, which is, this wasn't about, you know, when he talked about the Capitol Police officers, he says, they weren't just protecting the building. They weren't just protecting the people in the building. They were protecting our democracy. And that's what this is about, this indictment. It's about -- and I looked here, starting on page 39. It does talk about the violence, and it does talk about how the President exploited it, for several pages. But really, the story, the arc of this indictment, and of the trial, is going to be the attempt, to steal our democracy, our way. It's just a free and fair election. And to just literally steal an election from the American people? ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: One thing, I think, we can discern from this indictment is who some of the witnesses are likely to be. And it's really remarkably powerful, when you think about it. I mean, Mike Pence is going to be a witness, based on this indictment. There are paragraphs in here that have to be solely based on Mike Pence's account, of one-on-one conversations, he had, with Donald Trump, bolstered by Mike Pence's contemporaneous notes. Imagine that? That's going to happen. This is going to go to trial. Donald Trump's former Vice President is, in all likelihood, going to take the stand against him. Maybe even while they're running against each other. Who knows when the timing is going to be? And looking at him, as a prosecutor, I think he's a great witness. I don't have any particular views, on Mike Pence, politically. I'll leave that to you all. But he did the right thing, that day. He's backed up, by his notes, from the day in question. He is, I mean, he's literally a God-fearing man. When a lot of people take that oath, I don't know how seriously they take it. I feel like he will take it quite seriously. We're going to have other witnesses, Republican elected officials, state officials, Brad Raffensperger, we know the names, Adams committee did, I think, an remarkable job, of showing us, what they had to say, Cassidy Hutchinson. We still don't know where Mark Meadows is. But that's what's going to really happen. It's hard to envision, but that's what this trial is going to be. That's how big the stakes are going to be. DAVID URBAN, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, and I think Elie's point is well-taken.

But if you don't concede, there are all these extra innings, there are all these other things that can happen, the States got to certify this, and the Electoral.
