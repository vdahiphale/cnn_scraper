Remember, Donald Trump in his campaign have spent this entire election thus far workshopping a playbook designed to go after an unpopular 81- year-old man. Now, they have to change gears.

We were hoping that would maybe help the firefighters.We went from zero percent containment to 10 percent containment. So, it did help at least a little bit but that doesn't mean the fire can't spread. It also went from 300,000 to 350,000 acres burned. So, you're still seeing those problems. Wind is going to be a concern as we go through the rest of the day but also those temperatures. So, let's take a look because it's also not just the park fire. You have over 90 active fires, about nearly a dozen states in the western half of the country. And all of these could be impacted from changes that are expected to come over the next few days. Now, the park's fire -- park fire specifically we talked about is now up to over 350,000 acres burned, but it only started late Wednesday. So, if you talk about how quickly this fire has been able to spread, we talked about this yesterday, that means it has been burning an average of 50 football fields every single minute since it started. So, that's how fast this is spreading. One of the concerns today is more spread, not just from that fire, but even some other fires. We have the red flag warnings in place, those winds about 30 to 35 miles per hour that can easily take some of those embers and quickly spread them pretty far and wide. The other thing that can spread is the smoke. So, you've got a lot of air quality alerts out there in effect for several states because the air -- the smoke is going to be very thick in some spots. If you have breathing problems, respiratory illnesses, that's going to be a big impact for today. Some areas of dry thunderstorms off to the north and also above average temperatures and very strong winds a little bit farther south. Both of those are going to factor in. But those cooler temperatures that we talked about, they are not going to last very long. A lot of these areas getting back into those mid to upper 90s this week.",

And all of them shared the same thing with me, that they felt that these realistic drills were doing more to harm and traumatize their children than actually prepare them for any emergency inside a school classroom. Now it is important to highlight, Victor and Amara, that despite our country's ongoing epidemic of gun violence, school shootings actually remain somewhat rare. In fact, they account for less than 1 percent of school shootings. Of the more than 44,000 annual U.S. gun deaths. That's according to data compiled by Everytown, the group that advocates for gun control. And so, their argument is that it is actually unlikely that the majority of children will have to be exposed to gun violence or a shooting inside their school. And that this over preparation, this constant drilling, and the depiction of violence, and the use of props in many of these drills is having an effect in their mental health. It is traumatizing, it is creating anxiety and it is exposing them to a level of violence at a very early age. I was shocked to learn that many of -- of the students are exposed to this from when they are still three, four, five years old. I also spoke to a student activist. She's an incredible young person who has had to go through these experiences of shootings in her school, but who has taken that experience and turned it into activism by pushing for these changes. She spoke to me about what it's been like to go through the school system and having to be exposed to these constant drills. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's -- it's become a little bit of just like a chore almost. I last year we did, I looked around and I saw everyone scrolling on their phones and I was just thinking to myself, like, this is not a solution. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm talking about Simone Biles. U.S. Women's gymnastics team that taking part in the qualifying round today. Just minutes ago, she was helped off the mat by coaches after a routine.Joining us now from Paris, CNN sports analyst and columnist for USA Today, Christine Brennan. Christine, I just saw a couple of minutes ago she had to hop down the stairs on one foot. What's going on?",

This is the qualifying for the team competition and also for the other events as they move on through the rest of the Olympics.So, it's a very big deal. Simone's first time. I mean, you've got a cast of thousands. Ariana Grande and -- and Tom Cruise are there in the arena watching. And on her floor exercise, apparently, Simone had or even before that there was something going on with her ankle and her calf and that is wrapped now. So that's been taped up. She has continued to compete. She just did the vault. Had a hop on her landing, but she did compete. So, I think it's important to say she is still competing. But there has been -- there's certainly some concern, especially when you see Simone Biles literally crawling off and having to then get up and then have her ankle or calf or both be taped. So that's what we know. There's a lot we don't know. What will happen next is at some point Simone will be interviewed certainly by NBC and then by the reporters, many reporters who are there from print and online, and we'll start to get answers from her on exactly what happened. The key point is no matter what the injury is or not, or just it's caution or concern, which happens, as you know, with a lot of athletes at this elite level. Whatever it is, Simone Biles continued to go on and compete. And I think that is the important point as we look at this developing situation.",

And, you know, I think because of the scattering of NBA stars throughout -- throughout the, you know, throughout the international play that you're going to see most of these countries have an opportunity, potentially to give the U.S. a scare. South Sudan gave the U.S. a scare last week in a preliminary game. So, the internationalization of basketball, men's and women's. But certainly, the NBA stars that we've come to know who are from other countries, they go back and play for those countries. So even Serbia, of course you know, has an NBA star or two.So, I think -- I think every game potentially could be close. I do think the U.S. men will win the gold medal. That's another dream team for the U.S. But clearly, again the world, you know, everyone's catching up. And there's no doubt about that and what we love about that in the international play in the NBA or the WNBA. Obviously, then it carries over into the Olympics as well.",
