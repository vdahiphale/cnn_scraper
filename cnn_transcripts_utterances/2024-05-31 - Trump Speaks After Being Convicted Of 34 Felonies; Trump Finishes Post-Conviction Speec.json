And something nobody's ever seen anything like this before. He may look like an angel, but he's a devil. This is a rigged trial. Totally unfair.This is Judge Merchan, who's going to have to decide on July 11 the sentence that Trump is going to get. Does Trump not realize that in going after Judge Merchan like that, he potentially is only hurting himself, he may get a more severe sentence as a result of this?",

And he's going to make sure that it's not personal to him. That's the kind of guy Judge Merchan is.And he has thick skin. He's going to hear these things. And he's going to make it a point to not allow those types of comments to factor into any personal feelings that are animus to factor into his sentence. But what he will take into consideration is Trump's lack of remorse, and lack of acceptance of responsibility for what he has done, and that is what he continues to do here. He's also going to take into consideration the fact that he violated the gag order 10 times during the course of the trial. A gag order, it's a court order. And being held in contempt means he defied the court. He didn't listen to the judge. And I think finally too, he's going to look at the fact that Donald Trump is continuing even -- if it's technically not a violation of the gag order, he's going after witnesses in the case. He hasn't crossed the bright red line yet of the jury. That would be I think, where the third rail would be for Judge Merchan right now, even after the verdict because these are just 12 ordinary people who did their civic duty and served on jury duty.

Donald Trump wanted to be up there arguing his own case. But this is where Trump's instincts are -- he's very attuned again to the base. All of that stream of consciousness, you need a glass of glossary if you are not clued into the right-wing media ecosystem. But for the right-wing media ecosystem, they know what he's talking about because he's been seeding these lines of attack for weeks and weeks and weeks since even before this trial started. So, you always have to see Trump through this lens of the different audiences that he's speaking to. We have yet to see Trump pivot to a message for the broader electorate from just from a political perspective. And I suspect you may not see him do that because you heard him here today. He said, I'm leading. I'm winning. And from his perspective, what he is doing is working. He doesn't need to change. But I just want to caution everybody. We are in the end of May. There's a long way to go in this election. Most Americans are not plugged in yet.

When you hear what he's saying completely unscripted, and you realize this isn't a process of somebody who is -- could potentially be facing a jail sentence.

And the judge has been great about it.The judge has not been holding it against him in the rulings or in the demeanor in court. The judge is not going to hold it against him at sentencing. I think the judge will hold against him the lack of remorse, but not the personal attacks. So, they can pretty much let him go until and unless he basically cuts off some of their means of appeal by saying something that undercuts an appeal argument, which he hasn't done quite yet.

What happened was a venting session for the defendant in this case who's now a convicted felon 34 times over to just air all the ramblings through his mind about his grievances from this case.

He wants to make this argument about age against Biden, but here he was looking, you know, kind of like an old man who was just ranting and raving in a self-involved way, to your point, David Chalian, into the campaign's going as well.And so, again, I -- this wasn't a great outing for him. I think it was probably smart of him not to answer questions, given where he has been so far in this speech. And if you look at the times he has answered questions, he gets himself in trouble on any number of issues. You think about the Time Magazine of that cover story, he sounded terrible there, and in terms of issues around the Department of Justice, around abortion, as well. And so, listen. We're probably going to hear more of campaign Trump. And if this is a preview of it, I think the Biden team probably feels pretty good.",

That's actually like one of Trump's real superpowers as a political persona on the stage for now, a decade in American politics nearly.And he uses that back-and-forth with reporters when he wants to strategically shape a narrative.

So, one would say it would not have been a fool's errand to get his narrative out there knowing how much it would have been covered, etcetera.He chose not to, for whatever his own personal reasons. And the defense counsel last night speaking to Kaitlan Collins. Todd Blanche said that he has never told a client not to testify, but they had made decisions together about why he likely should not in this instance. And yet again, even without the framing of a prosecution team going after him for how many hours it would have been, he still chose not to do so.

But the judge also said there are other things the DA wanted to ask him about. The judge said, no, those are no good. Those are out of bounds. It's the same determination that a judge makes in every -- in any case. He said some things are in play. Other things are out of play. And just real quick. Every word Donald Trump says from here on out, if I was Donald Trump's lawyer, would make me cringe. But for specific reasons, you still have sentencing ahead. It's all relevant for sentencing. You still have a gag order in place. It all could go to that. And you have an appeal. And there are certain things that you can say that could actually compromise your ability to make certain arguments on appeal.

And at the maximum actually is 20 years. Even if the judge were to do that and run them all consecutive, the law would actually limit it to 20 years.But I don't think he's going to get anything close to that. It would -- I don't know that prison time for him is even in the cards. It might be, but there's a wide range of sentencing options that he could get. He could get community service, for example, where he has to pick up trash on the subways. He could get probation. He could get a fine. He could get weekends in jail. He could get no jail at all.
