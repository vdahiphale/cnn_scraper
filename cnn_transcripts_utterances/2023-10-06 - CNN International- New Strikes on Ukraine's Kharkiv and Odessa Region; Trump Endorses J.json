This as the death toll from the attack on the village of Hroza keeps rising.CNN's Fred Pleitgen is now on the ground here. Jailed Iranian activists Narges Mohammadi wins this year's Nobel Prize for Peace we'll bring you an exclusive interview. Plus, France's bedbug infestation is making headlines around the world with the frenzy justified. We'll have a look. A day after one of the deadliest strikes on civilians since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moscow is launching new attacks across the country. In the Northeastern city Kharkiv the regional official says a grandmother and her 10 year old grandson were killed in a missile strike. In the south drones hit the port City of Odessa damaging infrastructure and a grain storage facility. This follows Thursday's attack on a small village in the East. And missiles slammed into a cafe and the grocery store as people gathered to mourn a fallen Ukrainian soldier. At least 52 people were killed. The U.N. Human Rights Chief says a field team has been deployed to investigate. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us from Hroza, which is still reeling from this attack, Fred.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it certainly is, Max. And I can show you behind me right here. What's, actually left of that grocery store and that cafe that you were just talking about, which is pretty much nothing. As you can see, it very early on became clear to the crews that were working here.That this was going to turn quickly from a search and rescue operation to a recovery operation and now obviously a clearing operation. In fact, if we pan over there, you can see just how much debris has already been cleared away. We can see on top of that pile of debris that there seems to be some sort of a box that would have had ice cream in it. Just to show that this was indeed a supermarket and a cafe that was hit. Obviously this place you're absolutely reeling from what happened. We got here late last night when people were still clearing bodies. It was a scene of utter carnage. And we've been speaking to some of the folks who live here. And they tell us pretty much everybody who lives in this place has lost somebody. Pretty much everybody who lives in this village has had somebody killed if you look at just the sheer numbers there are about they say about 160 people who were still left to in this village before the strike, and 52 people having now been killed. A large proportion of this village has been wiped out because of this attack. The Ukrainians of course continue to be extremely angry about all this they are saying that this wasn't Iskander missile strike the same types of missile that they say struck hearken earlier today. It's a medium range missile with a huge warhead that obviously does a lot of damage. One of the things that we saw earlier was there were forensic teams going around that seemed to have found some parts of that missile, it seemed to be shrapnel impossible engine parts again, unclear what exactly though. But those forensic teams were sort of bagging them up and taking them away. The Ukrainians have also had a war crimes prosecutor on the ground here as well. We spoke yesterday to the Chief Investigator and they say that they have launched a probe into possible war crimes here as well. Obviously they say with so many people who were killed. This is obviously a massive, traumatizing event for this entire region, Max.",

And in fact, President Xi has not actually confirmed that he will come to the United States come to San Francisco for this APEC summit in November.But all that being said, White House officials are confident that they are on the path to setting this meeting up. And it would be an important opportunity for the leaders of the two largest economies to sit down, talk about some of the issues they have and continue trying to stabilize this relationship, which is really, you know, spiraled over the last several months or so. And you mentioned that last meeting about a year ago in Bali for the G 20. At that meeting, the two leaders agreed to what they called establish a floor for this relationship. Essentially ensure that it doesn't deteriorate any further. But in the months afterward, there was that situation you'll remember, with the Chinese spy balloon, there continued to be military and economic tensions. What President Biden wants to do is really sort of stabilize this relationship. And you have seen him send a number of top administration officials to China over the last several months to meet with their counterparts to try and establish these points of communication with the Chinese government. And now President Biden has said several times over the last weeks and months that he is looking forward to meeting with President Xi. So whether this meeting actually happens or not remains to be seen, but it is certainly something that officials here at the White House are eyeing as the summit comes together in November, Max.",

I have no inside knowledge about what the Republicans will do, who they will end up voting for? But when do they put the country first, they do not represent a majority of even the Republican Party. When you look at the extremists in the House, they certainly don't represent a majority of the country. And you know somebody has to stand up and say enough. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Mohammadi calls out what she says are the hypocrisy of the religious authorities. Female protesters and prisoners sexually assaulted as Iranians rose up on the streets last year she lent her powerful voice to the uprising and for that she was recently sentenced to another year in prison. KARADSHEH: But that hasn't deterred Mohammadi who with the help of intermediaries responded to CNN questions in writing, detailing incidents of sexual assaults dating back to 1999. She also mentions her own experience, but since the protests she says they have increased significantly describing them now as systematic. KARADSHEH (voice-over): She writes in prison, I have heard the narratives of three protesting women who were sexually assaulted. One of them was a well-known activist of the student movement, who upon entering the prison filed a complaint with the authorities and announced that after being arrested on the street, her one hand and one leg were cuffed and tied. And in that position, she was sexually assaulted. I went with one of my cellmates under the pretext of taking food for a prisoner. We saw bruises on her stomach, thighs, arms and legs. The Iranian regime has denied allegations including a CNN investigation of using sexual violence and rape to suppress the protests, calling them baseless and false. For years Mohammadi has been the voice of the voiceless, fighting for political prisoners against the death penalty and solitary confinement. Something she and her husband Taghi Rahmani have both endured. Rahmani a Former Political Prisoner who was jailed for 14 years now lives in exile with the children in Paris. He's have to be both father and mother to Kiana and Ali",
