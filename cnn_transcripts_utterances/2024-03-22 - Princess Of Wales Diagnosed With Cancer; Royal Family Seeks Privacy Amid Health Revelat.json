It has been an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family. But I've had a fantastic medical team who have taken great care of me, for which I'm so grateful. In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London.And at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy. And I'm now in the early stages of that treatment. This, of course, came as a huge shock. And William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis, in a way that's appropriate for them and to reassure them that I'm going to be okay. As I've said to them, I am well. I'm getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal in my mind, body and spirits. Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too, as is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to us both. We hope that you'll understand that as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I'm able. But for now, I must focus on making a full recovery. At this time, I'm also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer. For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone.

I mean, that was a very touching statement, obviously, but we still don't know what kind of cancer this is. As Max mentioned, we don't know what stage this is. But January 16th is when we were told she was going in for surgery. The next day we were told that she's probably going to have a somewhat prolonged hospitalization, and it was almost two weeks, 13 days later, that she was discharged. So that was end of January. Then it was end of February where we now understand she started this chemotherapy.And obviously we're hearing about this three weeks later for all the reasons she mentioned. One thing, they use this term preventive chemotherapy in the statement, which I think is a very non-medical term. I mean, you don't give chemotherapy preventatively. She has cancer. We don't know what kind of cancer it is, and this is typically something that's referred to as adjuvant chemotherapy, meaning something alongside the surgery now that's being given. But, you know, what stands out to me is that, you know, it's very touching. But we don't know the cancer. We don't know the staging. We did not hear anything from the medical team saying, hey, look, we expect a full recovery. She obviously has said that. But there's a lot of questions, I think, that still remain and need to be answered, I think, in some way.",

If it's given in the bloodstream, then people do typically go to the hospital. Of course, we're talking about the royal family, so I think anything probably is possible for the royal family in terms of doing it more privately. But as Max said, it can be several weeks of these therapies.And they're designed like the basic notion is we did the operation. Now we find cancer. There's likely to be some cancer that is remaining in the body. Let's give chemotherapy to try and target those remaining cells. That's the basic sort of idea behind chemo. But I almost can't say anything more than that because we don't know what kind of cancer. We don't know what stage. We don't know what the chemotherapy is. And we don't know even, you know, what type, meaning what you need to be, even in an outpatient setting in the hospital.",

And I want to be just really careful because, again, we don't, there's so many things we don't know. But one of the things that you think about with cancer cells is that they divide very rapidly. Okay. So you're targeting cells that are dividing very rapidly. That's what chemotherapy does. What other cells divide very rapidly in your body? The cells that create your hair, for example, which is why people may lose hair.The cells inside your intestines divide very rapidly, which is why people often get sick. They feel nauseated when they take chemotherapy. But that's not all. Chemotherapies, we don't know which ones. We don't know. Again, I'm repeating myself, don't know which cancer, what stage. So it's very hard to speculate what this chemotherapy would do to her, how often she'll need it, how long she'll need it. Maybe we'll get more of those details forthcoming.",

When people undergo extensive surgery, they just don't go in for, typically, anymore for, quote, exploratory surgery. All of these operations are preceded by extensive imaging, like CAT scans and MRIs. So, the surgical team would have a very good understanding of what was likely to be the problem, and that would be confirmed by pathology.So, a piece of the tissue removed, whatever the organ is, or the organ removed, or intestine, for instance, that goes directly to the pathology lab, often during the surgery. And sometimes, whether something is cancer or not will dictate the extent of the actual operation. So, it's very likely that the surgical team knew or had a good sense of what this was going to be prior to surgery. And that was confirmed at the time of pathologic testing during the operation. [14:15:09] So this is something that would have at least been suspected before and confirmed during the operation.",

So it's impossible to know how long or how intense she will be treated without knowing the specifics of the disease. Cancer is being found in younger people more frequently now.

Some people think that diets heavy in sugary beverages in children and adolescents change the risk profile for colon cancer. But it's about 10%, as I think I said, of the colon cancers diagnosed are being found in young people. Which is why a few years ago, the American Cancer Society, and then more recently, the United States Preventive Task Force lowered the minimum age, the suggested youngest age for screening for colon cancer from 50 down to 45, and even younger, down to 40, if there's a family history of colon cancer in a first-degree relative. And they did that because they estimated that the yield in terms of preventing death would be magnified by starting to screen a younger population because we were seeing colon cancer in younger and younger people.",

Anna, one of the particularly disturbing things that we have witnessed over the last week or so, I think it was several days ago, we learned word that there had been a reported attempt of a breach of the Princess's medical file at, I believe, at the hospital she had been treated. What do we know, first of all, about the status of that breach? And I guess the question is, was that sort of also part of the reason that this announcement was made now, the idea that there may have been people out there who had gained access to or still were trying to gain access to her medical records?",

And what we don't know, actually, is whether that breach of Princess Kate's private medical records was actually successful. So we don't know that at this stage. But that just goes to show, really, the intrigue and the speculation and the huge amount of pressure on the royal family to give the public more information than they, frankly, perhaps should have ever have had or deserved. And just hearing what we heard today from the Princess of Wales, how it's been a huge shock, it has been a tough couple of months. She has been off work for nine weeks. She's had major abdominal surgery. DR. And perhaps the most heartbreaking part of it all in that video message, just what this will mean for her children and having to explain that to them.So, really, after weeks of speculation and pressure from the media, from social media, the message here is incredibly clear. At the end, they say, we hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. They have given us a lot more medical information than we often get when it comes to the royal family. Much like King Charles, we know, of course, that she has cancer. We don't know the exact details, but this is all the information I would expect we will get for some time to try and draw a line under that huge pressure that we have seen in recent weeks.",

It wasn't spoken about initially. You know, after their father came and told them she had been killed, you know, there was a lot of silence surrounding it. And the family sort of feeling was just, you know, let's keep things being normal, so to speak, and try to help them just get over it. Her approach certainly seems to be, I mean, I think her generation and certainly with Prince William involved, they have probably learned from that in terms of how to deal with their kids. GODDARDSo you've got three royal family members talking about cancer. It's  a scary conversation for all the children involved. And you are so, so right. You have to be open with children about what mummy's scared, why mummy's going to the hospital. Why grandpa's going to the hospital all the time. You do have to be very open because as you so rightfully say, if people just try to sweep it under the carpet, it becomes terrifying and unmanageable for children and leaves them with lifelong trauma.",

So that's why they waited until this point.And in terms of, you know, as much detail as we're going to get, frankly, on the medical conditions, you know, reiterated to me, we're not going to be told what type of cancer it is. They don't want people to speculate because that's going to create more confusion they said. In terms of the stage of cancer, they're not going to give any more medical information.

And she's in the recovery pathway, as I'm told, having commenced a course of preventative chemotherapy. That started in late February and they are, it's continuing, but they're not telling us until when. So, I mean, Sanjay can speak to that. I'm not sure what that means. And we're not being told where she's being treated, but we are being asked not to try to track her. She's going to be going for treatment regularly. She's on chemo.
