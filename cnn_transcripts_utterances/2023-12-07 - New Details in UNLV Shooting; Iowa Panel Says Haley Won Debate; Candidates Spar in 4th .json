He said, \"there's nothing contextual about calls for all Jews to be killed. Jewish students around the country are afraid. If colleges refuse to protect Jewish students from generalized bullying and harassment, the universities need -- either need a new code of conduct or new presidents.\" We also heard from the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, speaking forcefully outside of a falafel shop that had been targeted by these pro-Palestinian protests. He said, \"this was an unacceptable statement - that was an unacceptable statement from the president of Penn. Frankly, I thought her comments were absolutely shameful. It should not be hard to condemn genocide, genocide against Jews, genocide against anyone else.\" And then finally we have a tweet from hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who went to Harvard, but who has been very critical of these universities handling of instances of anti-Semitism. He said, \"they must all resign in disgrace. Throughout the hearing the three behaved like hostile witnesses, exhibiting a profound disdain for the Congress with their smiles and smirks, and their outright refusal to answer basic questions with a yes or no answer.\" So, these college presidents were trying to approach this as kind of the next step in a long running debate over free speech. That did not go over well with this audience. They said, you had to be much more forceful in calling that calling for genocide against Jews is harassment, it is bullying, it should go against the university's code of conduct.",

I think you would see more of that in a - in a second term. Ideas like, you know, banning federal aid to schools that don't follow what Republican states have done on limiting the teaching of race or transgender youth policies or his threat to prosecute locally elected DAs who he calls Marxists and lunatics. So there's a lot of policy imposition on blue jurisdictions. But what happened, as you know, toward the end of his presidency was he went way beyond that. And in terms of deploying and projecting federal force into blue cities over the objections of mayors and governors in most cases. And I - and he is being very clear that he intends to ramp that up in a second term. Door to door deportation, the largest ever, which would, obviously, unfold mostly inside of - of the large cities, sending in the National Guard in an unspecified kind of mandate to restore law and order, sweeping the streets of homeless, building internment camps. You start - you put all of that together and it begins to look like the possibility of an occupying federal force in the nation's largest cities that in all likelihood will vote against him in large numbers if he's the Republican nominee.

We've had polls where half of Republicans or more described the January 6th insurrection in positive terms. I mean Trump is essentially promising to use national power to advance factional ends, to impose the priorities of red America on blue states and blue cities that are resisting it.
