Kevin mccarthy, to a certain extent, owns the shape of this conference, because two years ago, he knew that 147 of his members did not vote to certify the election. He had an opportunity in those two years to go out and do what he did. He took a victory lap around the loss of Madison Cawthorn, North Carolina 11. If you guys remember, North Carolina 11, Madison Cawthorn was primaried by an absolutely reasonable, respectable conservative Chuck Edwards, who knocked Madison Cawthorn off in the primary. And now, you got Chuck Edwards, a reliable vote for McCarthy, not an election denier, not a conspiracy theorist. If Kevin McCarthy had actually really focused on republican primaries and had tried to prevent the Boeberts and in the Gaetz and the Biggs from getting those nominations, I know that is an orthodox, but that is what a real leader should have done. He should have work to shape the party so it was responsible, full of responsible Republicans, not conspiracy theorists.

But for 14, maybe they have figured something out now. I think the flip side of this is when we get to the hard stuff, the policy, not just the leadership, the policy, what we have also seen, we've seen the republican dysfunction and chaos and mistrust and distrust and animosity. We've also seen the new democratic leadership on the floor and the new democratic team on the floor. As of these early days, they have their act together. I was about to use another word. They have their act together. You have seen -- Jeffries has not spoken because he is the one being nominated, but mostly Pete Aguilar, his deputy. You just saw Congressman Phillips. We did hear Congressman Clyburn earlier today who is moving on from the leadership. But mostly what we've heard is the new, younger generation of democratic leadership. They remember January 6 very well. They are well organized against this republican majority which is an interesting contrast because these Republicans are getting off on the wrong foot. Let us see if they can fix it. Sometimes, you put things behind you. (CROSSTALK)",
