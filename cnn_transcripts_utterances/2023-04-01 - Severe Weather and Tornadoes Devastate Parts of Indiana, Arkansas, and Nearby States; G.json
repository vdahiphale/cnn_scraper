Inside more than 200 people. First responders say some of those folks were trapped underneath the debris. At least 28 people were injured. We're told one person was killed. Some others have what have been called life threatening injuries. Meanwhile, within the last 90 minutes or so, this crew with the heavy equipment has been behind us working to clear this area. When we arrived on scene, obviously, the fence was here, which says keep out. The area is barricaded, but there's a debris scattered throughout the street. This is a historic building. There's a marquee on the building that says 1921. If you're looking, you can see that the foundation or the structure of the building is brick, and those bricks have been scattered throughout the area. If you drive around the neighborhood, you will also see a similar scene where trees have fallen in this parking lot, which is adjacent to where we are right now. There's also shattered glass.

What inspired you to bring this bill before Congress and get Damar Hamlin on board as well?CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK:  Well, as a mom watching the game when I saw Damar collapsed, my heart sunk. And I immediately thought about the times when my daughter was playing soccer and one of the kids got hit with the ball, and you didn't know if they had a concussion, and the fear that you have as a parent watching. And then I learned very quickly that this situation actually happened to many of our kids who play sports, but they have a heartbreaking outcome that wasn't as great as Damar's. Like when we think about the Mangine family in Kentucky, their son passed out on the floor, had cardiac arrest while he was playing soccer. And there was the AED device that was 250 square feet away from him. However, no one knew how to use it. Or the Manning (ph) family in California, whose daughter was a cheerleader, and we also have the Macaroons (ph) in Florida, whose family member also, their son, died there playing soccer. So it became very apparent that we have to protect our kids and make sure that all of our children, especially our student athletes, are actually having an opportunity to have lifesaving technology, especially since a lot of times we think of cardiac arrest and we don't think of our children. We especially don't think of our athletes. So it's important we think what we see happening with cardiac arrest and make sure that all of our kids have a chance at surviving.",

And as you said, especially when you're talking about student athletes, you don't think that this becomes something so common. So this bill is cosponsored by a Florida Republican, lawmaker Bill Posey. What does it mean to have this kind of bipartisan support to get this measure going?CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK:  Well, it really proves the point that there are some people who are still willing to work bipartisanly and despite people in politics and to make sure our kids are protected. And I think the support we've been getting from all the major league athletics, especially the NFL, NBA, and even the National Hockey League, it's really weaving the story that we're united on saving our kids. When we think about the legacy that's actually going to be left after we pass this bill will save -- even if it saves one life, we did our mission and we accomplished what we need to do. WHITFIELD:  So help us understand the objective of the bill and what it will afford schools to do. It's not just having the devices, but there's training involved so you don't have circumstances like the ones that you described, where people didn't know how to use it, or even how to access something that they had on campus. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK:  Well, what we found out is that there's only a handful of states that require schools to have AED, so we wanted to normalize their availability to all schools. In addition to that, as I mentioned, there were two students who actually died because there was a defibrillator there, but no one knew how to use it. And really, when we see these cardiac arrest situations happen with our kids, the response is usually one of fear and not knowing. And we want to normalize people knowing about heart health and also how to use defibrillators, and that's why this bill also provides grant funding for yearly trainings. So now it will be as easy as a fire drill. Once you hear that bell, you know what to do and you know how to get out. We want the same response for our parents, our students, and anyone who's working on these facilities, on the schools, to make sure that everyone has the same response. And that's really our goal is to normalize heart health, normalize saving our children, and normalize everyone having access to lifesaving treatments.",

Baldwin maintains that he was not aware the gun contained a live round. The actor and the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, are both facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter related to the incident. In Tennessee, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the state from enforcing a ban on public drag shows. It was supposed to begin today, but just hours before it was to take effect the judge delayed the measure for at least 14 days. He says he is considering whether the ban is unconstitutional. Opponents say the law would essentially restrict freedom of expression among LGBTQ people. But the state has argued the measure is not a full ban and is only intended to stop overtly sexual performances in front of minors. And Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has been released from Walter Reed Medical Center after undergoing weeks of treatment for clinical depression. In a statement, Fetterman said he wants everyone to know that depression is treatable and treatment works. He also posted this picture to twitter.
