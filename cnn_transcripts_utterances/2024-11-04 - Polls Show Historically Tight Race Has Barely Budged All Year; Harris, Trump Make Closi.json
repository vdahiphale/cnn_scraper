DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What a terrible job. What they have done to our country. And you're going to say that to her, you're going to say, you've done a terrible job. You're grossly incompetent. We're not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of.

Over the next nine plus months, we saw criminal convictions, turmoil overseas, two assassination attempts and a change at the top of the Democratic ticket. Here's how it's going. The CNN Poll of Polls has barely budged. There is still no clear leader hours before election day. Now, if somebody tells you they know how it's going to end, they're blowing smoke. But we do know there is a very good chance it will all come down to Pennsylvania. And that is why Kamala Harris is spending her entire day there. She's hitting at least five cities in the crucial commonwealth, including two stops focused on courting the Hispanic vote. Donald Trump is also heading to reading in Pittsburgh, also in Pennsylvania. Before heading out to Michigan, Grand Rapids there, and that is going to be his final rally, just like he did both in 2016 and in 2020. The former president started his day in North Carolina, where he's campaigned for three straight days. He's still up there on stage. You see him there, that's live. He has been speaking for more than an hour. He talked a lot about crime and the border, but there was also a lot of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That does not mean like in 2016 and 2020, the winner will actually have a pretty big edge in the Electoral College, right?So, my take for people at home would be, prepare for anything. Prepare that one candidate sweeps most of the battleground states. Could be either one of them or prepare that we do have a heavy weight state by state. We don't know because it is so close. There's a smidgen, I think if you look deep into the data. The Democrats are making the case. They see a smidgen of light momentum. OK, we'll see if that's enough. For me, it comes down to -- what is the Harris coalition. Trump is the constant. This is his third time. Never in anybody's lifetime here have you had the same candidate three elections in a row for a major party. So, he's the constant. You know, he's going to get 48 or 49 across the battleground states. The question is, can she get above that? That's the math.",

Does that hold true? if so, then it's pretty easy to get you a Trump path to victory if he over performs his final number. Or have the pollsters finally figured out his number and that's what it is. We don't know the answer to that question, which is why I actually like that. We're almost at the point now. We just actually can let people vote. Don't worry about the data. Let's count votes.",

But last night, I was at Vice President Harris's final rally in East Lansing, Michigan on the state of Michigan State University, not surprisingly, the final day of early voting.But it was an optimistic message. It was hopeful. Did not mention Donald Trump's name once, did not mention the word fascist or anything else, she has been really doing in the recent days. I was out with her last week in Wisconsin as well, where she was doing that. So, look, she's trying to close in a hopeful way. He is not. But that is also his brand, and this is what she's trying to say. To John's point about the coalition, it is so interesting. This is not the Obama coalition. This is not the Biden coalition. This is the Harris coalition. Is it going to be enough? One of my questions I kind of have in my head, and we'll find out later. Which one is viewed as the candidate of change and what kind of change do voters want? And there are a lot of Republicans or moderate independents who don't identify as Democrats, who do support her because they have had enough of Donald Trump. There is an exhaustion factor for Donald Trump. However, depending on where you get your news. There is also -- some people who think that Vice President Harris is responsible for the border, entirely responsible for all the economy. It's almost like President Biden is not there, and they just cannot see her in the Oval Office. So, this is a America where we are not operating on the same set of facts. So that is why this election is so close. I am with John. There is absolutely no way that I would even suggest who's going to win. We have no idea. It is that close. It feels that close, talking to voters who are sort of our North Stars out there. They are divided about this.",

But the one thing we can actually talk about is just the vibes that we are getting from the campaigns and the voters that we're talking to.I was on the phone with a senior campaign, Harris person who is so anxious that they don't want to be holed up at HQ. They would rather be just out there. So, they're in one of the battleground states for the final days. And they were saying, they are really looking at two main questions as they are going around to these organizing events and seeing what kinds of people are showing up. One is, are the people that are showing up, the people you would expect to show up, or are you also seeing people who are showing up for the first time? And they said, it's definitely the latter. The second question that they are zeroed in on is, are people showing up with fear about the other guy or are you also seeing people showing up because they have and this is going to sound trite, but joy about the candidate that they're supporting. And he said they're seeing a mix of both. There are definitely people who are clear eyed about the stakes, and they're definitely paying attention to the things that Donald Trump is saying. But they're also seeing the, you know, homemade t-shirts. The people who are really excited to be volunteering for the first time, and again, all of this is just vibes.

She was going to write in Pat Toomey, the former conservative senator from Pennsylvania. She watched the debate, and she watched Donald Trump say, I'll negotiate an end to the Ukraine war with Vladimir Putin, and she said, Don, I'm voting for Kamala Harris.No Republican conservative would do that. No Reagan conservative would appease a communist dictator who stole another country. She said that was it. And so, she's going to vote for Harris, even though she disagrees with her, just about everything. She said she'll write a lot of letters to the White House if Harris wins, complaining about policy, but she wants to get her old Republican Party back. The question is, are there enough Joan London's in Pennsylvania. There are 155,000 people who voted for Nikki Haley, a couple of months after she was gone from the race. That's a protest vote. That's say, I want to vote against Donald Trump. Not only do I not support him, I want to vote against him. Can she get enough of them? Joan lives in Berks County, close in suburbs, vote Democratic. As you move farther out, think about Loudoun County, you know, in Virginia. If states are going to turn from purple to blue, that's what happens. The Democrats make gains in the exurb. So, you're going back to the big box stores. Are there enough of her to do that in Pennsylvania? To the other point about those headlines. I was in Arizona and Nevada on Monday and Tuesday of this week, right after the Madison Square Garden event. That blew up on Latino Spanish speaking social media. It blew up. And if Donald -- if Kamala Harris can win one of those two states or both, and the Latino vote swings a little bit her way in the end, that will be the reason.
