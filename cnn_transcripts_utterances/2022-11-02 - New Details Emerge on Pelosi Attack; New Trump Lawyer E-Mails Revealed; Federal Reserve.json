Thank you for being with us as we await a critical decision minutes away that could have major fallout from your bank account to the ballot box.One hour from now, the Federal Reserve is poised to once again raise interest rates to try to tame inflation. This would be the fourth straight big rate hike. And the impacts will certainly be felt at the White House less than a mile away, where we will hear shortly from President Biden, set to discuss his latest efforts to bolster the economy. And then, tonight, he will make a prime-time address focused on threats to democracy. But it is those pocketbook issues that most voters say are most important as they fill in their ballot. You can see there economy tops the list, with elections now just five days away. Let's go to CNN's Matt Egan. He's live outside the Federal Reserve in Washington. Matt, set the scene. Just how much pressure is the Fed facing right now to make the right call here?",

They're feeling it at the supermarket, at restaurants, their home heating bills, the gas station.And at the same time, we also have politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who are worried the Fed is actually going too far in this fight against inflation. They are worried about a recession that wipes out millions of jobs. Now, the Fed does not have a magic wand to make inflation go away. What they do have are interest rate hikes. Essentially, they're raising the cost of borrowing. They're trying to cool off demand to give supply a chance to catch up. So, in less than an hour, we are expecting the Fed to raise interest rates by 75 basis points. This would be the fourth massive interest rate hike in a row. We haven't seen anything like that since at least the 1980s. And this is, of course, raising concerns about a recession, because history shows that the Fed tends to underreact to inflation and then overreact, because we have seen that recessions often, but not always, follow these interest rate-hiking campaigns. We saw that in the early 1990s. We saw it again in the early 2000s and, of course, around 2008. And, Ana, the Fed really faces an almost impossible situation here, because, they don't do enough, inflation stays high and maybe goes even higher. If they do too much, they end up causing a recession.",

But take a look at the average credit card rate, which right now is sitting at about 18.7 percent. I just got off the phone with Ted Rossman of Bankrate, who says that, in their 30 years of experience crunching the numbers, on average, the highest was about 19 percent for credit cards. That was in 1991, I believe it was. He thinks we're actually going to blow past that next week.",

So if you can't, think about perhaps a zero rate balance transfer. If not that, if you have good credit, perhaps you can consider a personal loan. You can get maybe a 6 percent interest rate, but then you spread it out over several years, certainly better than paying 18 percent or 19 percent, right? And then maybe also some nonprofit credit counseling. But big-ticket purchases, housing and cars, I asked about. He said, look, car prices are very high. Housing prices are also very high. He said, if you were waiting it out in terms of the housing market to see prices crash 20 percent, one, we hope that doesn't happen, but we're not expecting that to happen either. So that's a much more specific scenario. So you have to do what's best for you. But maybe you want to sit it out until rates cool off at least.",

But you're right that absolutely hurts if you are certainly on the lower end. And you're not only dealing with higher costs, but now you're also dealing with higher borrowing costs.

The president will be holding an event on what White House officials have worked on intensively behind the scenes, on a public-private agreement to try and expand the work force in critical sectors like construction and broadband, the idea being that there have obviously been significant labor shortages over the course of the last several months. Those have contributed, in large part, to the inflation that we're seeing right now. And this isn't a near-term fix. Again, it kind of underscores the fact there's very little the executive branch can do to try and address inflation that remains at nearly four-decade highs, but they can put into place longer-term solutions they believe will have an effect. The vice president, she will be in Boston announcing $4.5 billion to help address soaring energy costs, particularly heating costs, as well as some long-term proposals on that front as well, again, not directly getting at the price increases that we have seen that have been so pervasive and persistent, but trying to address the overall cost of living. The speech tonight, though, is very much something that's been driven by the president. We have heard him talking about it before. Obviously, he had he had a major prime-time speech in Philadelphia a couple of weeks ago. But officials tell me he's been talking about this pretty constantly behind the scenes as he's kind of watched things play out over the course of the last several months. One thing that really kind of set the tone for what you're going to see tonight was the attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, the president obviously close with the speaker, knows her husband. That has really resonated inside the White House and helped drive the idea that this is a speech that needs to be made, two very different topics, but two topics that the president and his top advisers believe he can address just six days out from the election.",

And you see here, 51 percent, a slim majority, of likely voters say they're going to vote for the Republican,an advantage with -- over the Democrats, 47 percent. And take a look here over time. What you see is, since the beginning of last month, Republicans have grown plus four, and Democrats went from 50 percent to 47 percent, minus three. So you see that, as we're getting closer to the election, likely voters are getting -- giving more advantage to the Republicans. I also want to show you a critical sort of dividing line in American politics that we have been tracking for the better part of a decade now, Ana, and that is the sort of education divide. Take a look here among likely voters, white college educated likely voters. You see a slight edge for Republicans; 52 percent of likely white college educated voters in our poll are going to vote for the Republican candidate, 47 percent Democrat. Why is that critical? Because Joe Biden in 2020 edged out Donald Trump among these voters. In 2018, when the Democrats won 40 seats, they had a big advantage among these voters. Hillary Clinton just lost them to Donald Trump. This has been a group of voters that's been moving to the Democrats in the Trump era.

This is exactly what was said that convinced a federal judge in recent months that they may have been engaged in planning a crime, specifically obstructing Congress or defrauding the United States after that election. So I want to read some of these e-mails, because we knew about them before. That federal Judge David O. Carter had described them in court, but now we're actually seeing them because they were provided in a link in a court filing last night very early in the morning. So one of them is from attorney Ken Chesebro. He was working for Donald Trump to challenge the election. He wrote to other attorneys on December 31, 2020: \"If we can just get this case pending before the Supreme Court by January 5, ideally with something positive written by a judge or justice, hopefully Thomas, I think it's our best shot at holding up the count of a state in Congress.\" So there's Chesebro specifically saying they want to get this before a favorable judge. They want to challenge the election in court, not because they wanted to litigate it, but because they wanted a reason for Congress not to assert Joe Biden as the president and instead keep the possibility alive that Donald Trump could continue challenging the election. Chesebro also wrote in another e-mail on December 31, New Year's Eve, 2020: \"Possibly, Thomas would end up being the key here. Circuit justice, right? We want to frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue some sort of stay or other circuit justice opinion, saying Georgia is in legitimate challenge -- legitimate doubt.\" So this was a legal challenge that they were bringing in Georgia in federal court, that Donald Trump was attesting to the truth of facts in a case, and Justice Thomas would have been the person to receive that challenge. Of course, he also has been under a political furor because of some of his wife's comments about wanting to challenge the election as well -- back to you.",
