      "sentences": "Well look, Christine, this has been months in the making.Finland initially applying to join the alliance alongside Sweden and Turkey, for the most part focusing on Sweden has over the last few months expressed concern over both nations but focusing squarely on the situation inside Sweden where it accuses the government of taking a lax approach to groups that the Turkish government considers to be terrorist organizations -- namely, Kurdish groups in the country. That has been the key criticism from the Turkish government. But now it appears that President Erdogan is prepared to take steps to ratify the accession of Finland, although it's unclear how this will impact the ratification process for Sweden. Now, we've heard hints earlier in the week from President Erdogan that this would be the case. We've seen negotiations over the last few weeks and months. We've seen even policy changes in both Helsinki and Stockholm. And on Wednesday, President Erdogan told reporters in Ankara that Turkey would do its part to fulfill its promise. And we heard similar illusions from the Finnish president who said that in the instance that Turkey would make the decision to ratify Finland's accession to the NATO alliance, Turkey would request a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders and that Finland had, in turn, accepted that invitation. Now, we are expecting the two leaders to meet in the next two hours or so and there is expected to be a joint press conference. We've already heard earlier in the week from the Swedish government saying that they also understand that Finland may be taking steps to gain accession without Sweden, but that Sweden would be safer with Finland in the alliance than outside of the alliance.",

It's now at the lowest level since September 2021. That is good news -- inflation cooling. But you don't see prices easing very much at the grocery store, right? Let's bring in CNN Business reporter Nathaniel Meyersohn. This has been something that has been just sort of troubling in these inflation numbers -- that the grocery store prices have been so sticky. Grocery store prices up 10.2 percent annually according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Why are shoppers still paying more for these important items?",

Dollar Tree sells just about everything for $1.25 at its 8,000 stores. It used to sell everything for a dollar but it recently raised prices. So it has less flexibility to increase prices when its costs go up, so they're saying instead of taking a loss on eggs they're just going to stop selling it until prices come down.

That's how much the Federal Reserve loaned banks this month in this new emergency lending program that gives banks the original value of the Treasury bonds -- bonds that have crumbled in value during historic rate hikes.

European markets up after the central bank -- the European central bank raised rates 50 basis points but did not signal more. On Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour also leaning higher, although barely. A blockbuster bank bailout by the banks. Stocks closed higher after several big banks swooped in providing $30 billion in deposits to First Republic. The Nasdaq finishing up more than two percent -- 2 1/2 percent almost.

John -- all right, Credit Suisse accepted a loan from the Swiss central bank. You've got these big banks in the U.S. who swooped in to help First Republic. Crisis averted here in banking? JOHN LEER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MORNING CONSULT (via Webex by Cisco):  The near-term crisis is averted but there are some longer-term risks that really, really scare me. And the biggest issue here is basically we've had a prolonged period of very low interest rates that drives financial institutions to go search and seek for higher yield. That drives them to make riskier decisions. And I think unfortunately, what we've seen, particularly in the U.S., is that we just haven't had the sort of regulatory environment and the sort of regulatory priorities that have kept some of those risk-taking behaviors in check.",
