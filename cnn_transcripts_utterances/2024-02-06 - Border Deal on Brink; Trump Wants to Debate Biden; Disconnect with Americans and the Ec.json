In a closed-door meeting last night, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell told senators they should feel free to vote against moving the bill forward. It is a huge reversal from the minority leader, who just hours earlier gave a speech from the Senate floor calling on senators to take action on immigration and foreign aid. McConnell's messaging coupled with stiff opposition from Donald Trump and House Republicans, painting a grim picture for the bill that took months to put together.CNN's Lauren Fox is joining us now from Capitol Hill. Lauren, I don't know that we've seen this in a very long time, and especially since the Republicans are starting - saying the quiet part out loud. Donald Trump is in the mix, even though he's not an elected official at this point in time. Where do things stand this morning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, it's really hard to deny Trump's influence on the Republican conference, not only in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate this morning. That is because after less than 48 hours since the bill was released, it's very clear that this bill is on its way to collapse. The expected procedural vote was supposed to happen tomorrow in the United States Senate. It's clear that Republicans are coming out largely opposed to it, or at least largely opposed to this procedural step.Just moments ago we heard from a member of Republican leadership, John Barrasso, who said that he is opposed to this legislation. Last night, behind closed doors, McConnell telling his conference that they should vote their conscience and that he was comfortable with many of them voting no if that is what they wanted to do. So, clearly, despite the fact that one of their own, Senator Lankford, was creating this bill for the last several months in hard-fought negotiations with Democratic colleagues, it is clear right now that this bill is going nowhere fast in the United States Senate, including the reality that it was already dead on arrival in the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, tonight, the House will vote to move forward with its impeachment of Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. One thing is very clear, that we -- Republican leadership expects that this is going to pass tonight. What is less clear is what happens in the United States Senate once it does so. If it goes over to the United States Senate, you can expect that leaders there are going to look carefully about how they want to consider this. One of their options is they could quickly dismiss it. They could also refer it to committee. They could hold a brief Senate trial. As one senator put it to me last night, they view this as blatantly political. But Chris Murphy said there are probably some constitutional and procedural implications here that they cannot ignore. Sara.",

January saw stunning jobs growth, consumers are spending and inflation is finally starting to ease. But there does seem to be a disconnect between how the economy is doing and how Americans say they feel about it. And President Biden wants to know why.

And that is something President Biden himself has been asking his advisers, why, as there are these bright spots in the economy, why is it that consumer sentiment hasn't completely changed or grown in its trajectory.But there have been some upticks recently in consumer sentiment. A recent poll that was -- survey that was released by the University of Michigan showed that consumer outlook was up 13 percent in January. That tracks with some of the numbers that we've seen steadily progress over the coming months. But one thing that the White House is really facing at this moment is an American electorate that has very negative views about the state of their personal financial conditions. And many of them are attributing that to President Biden. If you take a look at a recent CNN survey, it found that 55 percent of voters believe that Biden's policies have worsened economic conditions in this country with only 26 percent believing his policies have improved conditions. The president's approval rating, when it comes to his handling of the economy, stands at about 37 percent, really highlighting some of the challenges President Biden has going forward. But we have seen over the course of this past few weeks this steady change - the steady uptick in the way that the White House is messaging some of these economic bright spots. President Biden on the trail has been pointing to the fact that inflation is down, gas prices are down, and also that consumer sentiment is rising. We've also seen him start to take this approach to try to tackle issues that are kitchen table issues for voters, really trying to take a hammer to junk fees that Americans are facing. And in one of his recent campaign events, trying to start to call out some of the corporations for these inflated prices, talking about greed-flation that is going on in this country. But it all really paints a very challenging picture for President Biden going forward, as they're seeing these economic bright spots, how is it that they can sell this to the American public while also acknowledging that there is still more work to be done heading into November's election.",

Trump didn't care much about policy or principles or conservativism. It was all about politics. And Republicans were happy to go along with him. Politics is impeaching Secretary Mayorkas. Policy is passing a border deal. Politics solves no problems. Policy does. But the policy is the hard part. And despite the fact that Republicans asked for these very policies from this bill, and for something to be done at the border because it was a matter of life or death, and they're right it is, suddenly the policies they asked for are not so important.

I think, again, the hard truth is that this is not a Republican problem. This is a bipartisan problem. The Democratic Party effectively told the voters of Florida that their vote was not necessary, that they had already chosen their standard bearer in Joe Biden. The Democratic Party made it impossible for anyone to try to challenge Joe Biden. So much so that Robert Kennedy, whose family name is basically ingrained in the DNA of the Democratic Party, was forced to leave the Democratic Party in order to actually form a somewhat viable campaign for president.So, yes, I think to his own credit or against President Trump, he has decided he wants to move the battleground to the general election to go against Joe Biden. Anyone who is taking issue with that and the fact that he didn't debate should also be equally upset with what's happening on the left. Democracy demands debates, but that means that we have to have a two-party system that actually invites that debate as well.",

He won't.I know why he wants to debate Joe Biden, because he thinks he'll look good debating Joe Biden. And I don't think he's wrong. Trump has some severe mental capacity issues. Those are in evidence. But he comes off tougher and stronger than Joe Biden does. And so I think this is, of course, all for Donald Trump. It has nothing to do with the good of the country. If it were about that, he would debate. And Democrats should debate too. That's part of the democratic process. We should demand debates as voters.

Well, I learned as a very young doctor taking care of the - the sitting vice president hat the truth is just going to come out and you might as well get it out at the beginning and tell the - tell the entire story because speculation is sometimes worse - worse than the truth. The palace yesterday basically said that his majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation. But by actually not sharing his specific cancer diagnosis, they've only fueled speculation. So, you know, look, if the news is not so bad, then that will extinguish the speculation.
