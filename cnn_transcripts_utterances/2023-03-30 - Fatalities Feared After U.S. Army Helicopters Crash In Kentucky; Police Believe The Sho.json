There was probably a thousand people who attended the vigil. But those who were on the inside, Dr. Biden went and shook each person's hand, thank them for being there and extended her condolences.

It is like a holding tank where they remove all the items from migrants.And so, it was hard to really believe that the migrants were the ones who had started it. That's the first thing. The second thing is that the video that shows that there was a fire that was started somehow in the in the cell, the way it was started. It just it's there's still a lot of conflict.
