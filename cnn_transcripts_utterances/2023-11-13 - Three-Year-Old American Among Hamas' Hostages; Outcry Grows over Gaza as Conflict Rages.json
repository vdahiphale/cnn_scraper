The IDF says it has arrested 20 alleged Hamas members, including some accused of taking part in the October 7 attacks in Israel. Meanwhile, multiple hospitals in Gaza are closing, due to airstrikes and lack of fuel and supplies. Health officials and aid agencies say patients, staff, and thousands of displaced civilians, are trapped inside Gaza's biggest hospital, al-Shifa, due to fighting nearby. The Israeli military says it put 300 liters of fuel at the entrance to the al-Shifa Hospital complex on Sunday, providing this video of the fuel being carried by soldiers. CNN cannot independently verify the contents of that video, though. The IDF says Hamas blocked the hospital from receiving the fuel, but the director of the Shifa hospital says staff have been too scared to go out and get it. He also said the fuel would have provided power to run the generators for only 15 to 30 minutes. Nada Bashir has more on the dire situation in Gaza hospitals. The usual warning: some of the videos you're about to see are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (CRYING) NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These are the sounds of the final gasps from Gaza's collapsing health care system. Medical staff in Gaza City, working under near relentless Israeli bombardment, for over a month. But now, this chorus of frantic voices, seen here working under torchlight, tells its own gut-wrenching story. The al-Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza, has now collapsed. The hospital is no longer operational, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. But these scenes are all too familiar across the besieged Gaza Strip. The vast majority of hospitals here are already completely out of service, the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah says, and those remaining now on a cliff edge. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There was a direct injury in the head. Internal bleeding. And we can't do surgeries. No surgeries, no oxygen, no electricity. We work manually. We are using a manual resuscitator. It is a clear injury. It needs an urgent surgery, a lifesaving one. He's less than a year old. BASHIR (voice-over): Remarkably, this baby survived, but his father, who was in the very same building when an Israeli airstrike hit, did not. At Gaza's largest hospital, al-Shifa, officials say newborn babies had to be moved, and that at least three babies in the neonatal unit died after a generator powering incubators was damaged in an Israeli strike. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The IDF regularly says it is targeting Hamas. But doctors here say the hospital is now completely surrounded.",

Doctors are overwhelmed. Morgues now long beyond capacity. [00:05:02] And with communications frequently cut off, contact between medical teams on the ground and with the outside world, is growing increasingly difficult. Hospital officials say thousands of displaced civilians are still thought to be in the compound, taking shelter in what once was thought to be a sanctuary, in the midst of this seemingly unending nightmare. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We thought the hospital was a safe place, but it wasn't. If we had stayed another five minutes, we would have been killed. They started to bomb us, and we ran away from al-Shifa. BASHIR (voice-over): The Israeli military says it is now enabling passage from three hospitals in Northern Gaza, with an additional route said to have been opened to allow civilians to evacuate Southwards. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): This is another form of torture. We have about six kilometers to go, no less. She got a stroke that caused her brain damage. She can't speak and is paralyzed. BASHIR (voice-over): But the United Nations itself has raised doubts over the so-called safe zones outlined by Israel, warning that nowhere inside Gaza is safe for civilians anymore. And for those too injured, too sick, evacuation is impossible. Many doctors on the ground, vowing to stay beside their patients, no matter what. Nada Bashir, CNN, in Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We're obviously treading carefully when it comes to hospitals, but we're not giving immunity to the terrorists. And so far, even though Hamas has tried to prevent the civilians from leaving, hundreds of thousands have left, sometimes having to go through Hamas gun points, and gunfire, that wants to keep them in harm's way.

It's a three-year-old toddler whose parents were killed by Hamas during the attack on October 7th.And we're learning about this American in a read-out of a phone call that President Biden held with the emir of Qatar. You remember that Qatar is playing broker in these talks, to try and release some of these hostages. Certainly, the information that one of those hostages is a three-year- old American will only increase pressure on the parties to try and come up with some kind of agreement, to secure the release of that three-year-old. But also, the 200-plus other hostages that are being held. And certainly, President Biden and other American officials have been in active discussions about some sort of agreement that would include a pause in the fighting to allow those hostages to come out. President Biden has been pressuring the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on a longer pause that would allow for the release of more hostages. But certainly, the fighting has not decreased at all. It certainly has been ramping up around the largest hospital in Gaza. We did hear from the American national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who did say that it is in Hamas's playbook to use hospitals as staging grounds for weapons and for fighters. But, he did also issue a message of caution to Israel. Listen to what he said. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: The bottom line for the United States is that we do not want to see fire fights in a hospital. We do not want to see innocent patients, who are sick or wounded, be injured or killed in the crossfire. So, that is how we look at this issue.

GIDEON LEVY, COLUMNIST, \"HAARETZ\" NEWSPAPER: I did not mean just this strategic surprise, or the fact that the army wasn't ready for such an attack. And it took hours until the army woke up. I think Israel needs to rethink about its old way of existing, of living. Are we going to live on our sword forever? Are we going to live from one war to the other? I mean, the whole way of thinking must change, because we are reaching such dangerous stages that we have to realize something went wrong. And we have to get to the depths of it and find out.
