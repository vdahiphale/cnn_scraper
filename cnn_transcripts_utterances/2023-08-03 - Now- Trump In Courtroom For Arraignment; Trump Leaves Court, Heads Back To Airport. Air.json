Nobody wants to have the weight of the United States versus and their name on other side of it. It's very significant.Here's the weight of resources are no longer in your favor, I don't care how much money you necessarily have. What they're doing now is likely expected a not guilty plea where he will formally tell the court he has notice of all the charges against him, and they will set some date in the future in terms of when he will have to either have discovery provided to him, there likely is not going to be a motion schedule for the things that you would argue about what would come into evidence, that's going to be longer down the road. But the notion of a rap sheet is so significant with these different indictments, particularly because of this reason -- normally if somebody has charges against them, trials in the same vicinity, you're talking about maybe if they are convicted they're going to run concurrent sentences, meaning this one will run on top of the other and the other. It's not going to be you'll serve five years for this one, then ten years for another, five for the next. It will run together. But these cases so far are of different natures. So, they're not going to have the same factual basis to provide. So, the court may likely say, if there are convictions, that they would run consecutive. You're talking about a significant amount of time. And, again, this is the magistrate judge. This is not the judge who will ultimately hear the case. You've heard about that particular judge. But it's significant nonetheless because he is -- right now, being treated, as he should be, as every other defendant in America who has to come before a court, not appear through Zoom, although he could have here, and actually show up. Now, I will just applaud for a moment -- you know, we joked around about how Jack Smith was at subway getting the subway sandwich shop. He was not hiding. He's in the courtroom today. He's in the courtroom before the person who's called him deranged, before the people that question whether he has a political axe to grind or otherwise. He is showing up to present and recall what he said when the indictment was unsealed. It is up to the jury to have the evidence tested, and the presumption of innocence is there. Right now, you have the presumption of the credibility of a prosecutor standing behind the decision that he has made.",

Now apparently the two men have exchanged several looks as they await this hearing to get under way.We're told it's very quiet in the courtroom right now. The former president is seated with his lawyers. He's been signing some paperwork, talking to them for a little while. Most of the courtroom could hear what they were discussing because they were on a microphone that was on. When they realized that, they pushed that away. Of course, they don't the assembled media to hear the legal advice that they are giving their client. The prosecutors are seated at a different table, several prosecutors from the special counsel's team. Again, Jack Smith is not expected to participate in this hearing, but his presence is notable. Again, this is one of the only times that he will come face to face with the former president before this case goes to trial. He also attended the initial appearance down in Florida.

But typically the defendant surrenders at the courthouse, is taken into custody by law enforcement, be they FBI agents if it's an FBI case or U.S. Marshals, and they go through a period that we refer to as processing.That's where the photographs are taken, fingerprints are taken. And biographical information is taken from the defendant, their name, how they spell it, date of birth, sorts of basic facts. And while it seems mundane, that is actually the information that's put into a system we refer to as NCIC, the National Criminal Index Information Centers. And that's what forms your rap sheet or your -- your arrest history essentially. So, it's -- you have to have that information, accompanying with the photograph and the fingerprints in order to make that entry. And that's -- that essentially establishes the first official record of the arrest which follows you for the rest of your life. Eventually there will be a new entry that resolves -- that indicates how those charges were resolved. But if you walk into a gun shop to purchase a firearm and go through the background, the federal background check, it will come up that you were arrested on this date in this courthouse for the following charges and how those were resolved, which could ultimately deny you the privilege of purchasing a firearm. So it's a mundane process but one that follows you the rest of your life. Whether or not that's happening for the president, we'll have to find out.",

They interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses. There were bombshells like Cassidy Hutchinson who spoke out. [16:10:05] What I'm obviously waiting for here is the trial. I mean, last night, we heard attorney general for Donald Trump, Bill Barr, say he believed looking at the indictment that the evidence laid out there was the tip of the iceberg. What don't we know? Is Mark Meadows cooperating? He was noticeably absent from the indictment. Will Mike Pence be called to the stand? And just to go back to your point, Carrie, about it being a streamlined indictment, my understanding from justice sources is they are going to try to move this as quickly as possible and go to trial before the election.

He didn't get convicted by the Senate, but the house did impeach him.I think that's probably why going back to right after this happened there was some trepidation inside the DOJ about making this a criminal matter, but now it is. Now what we're seeing is many people are numb to the fact that he's getting indicted three times in four months. But this is the only one that has to do with an alleged crime that he committed while in office about his office, and about not just his office but the fundamentals of the democracy that allows presidency to even exist.",

He used lies and trickery and used the false electoral certificates to try to corrupt the process and to try to stop the process.That also -- you know, basically it's a glove that fits in different ways, you put it on in different ways. You've got the other charges of obstructing a congressional proceeding, conspiring to obstruct a congressional proceeding, and the last one, 241, the charge that was interference with the voting rights of all Americans. All of those fit in different ways, but they fit nicely. And the Section 371 charge, I think -- it's important to know it doesn't really matter whether Donald Trump thinks that in some broad sense the election was stolen from him. The fact -- what matters is the fact that he used lies to fix what he perceived to be a problem, if he perceived to be a problem. I agree with Bolton, I agree with Barr that Trump clearly understood that he lost the election, he was told that by multiple people. The fact of the matter is if -- just because you think you were wrong, it's the two wrongs don't make a right thing that Bolton referred to, doesn't mean that you can use lies to overcome the problem. And the analogy I like to use is the O.J. case. Not the murder case, but the case in which he was sent to jail for in Nevada where he thought these items, these memorabilia items that he was trying to get back, belonged to him rightfully. But he used a gun. He used a gun and held people at gunpoint to take the items back. Here, Trump -- maybe he thought -- thought so, I don't think he did, but he won the election in some abstract sense, but he used lies and used pressure on the vice president, on Secretary Raffensperger, to compel them to violate the law.

And it's amazing that what they're describing is similar to any other defendant. Just waiting for a judge -- we know judges are typically late. But picture the scene, you have an empty bench where the judge would sit, and then you have two tables -- one for the prosecution team, and one for the defense. And our colleague, Holmes Lybrand, describes how Trump is sitting there with his hands folded. He's looking down. He is discussing things with his lawyers. He has a lot of questions, it appears, about the papers on his table. He's discussing it with his lawyers. But his lawyers are taking great pains so all the reporters in the room can't hear what they're discussing. One of his lawyers is putting his hand over his mouth as he discusses something with the former president. We're told it's so quiet in the room right now that you can hear someone in there somewhere clicking a pen. Now the only big difference inside this courtroom right now is the significant security presence. They say there are seven, seven marshals guarding the door to the courtroom, while usually have a security presence in a federal courtroom. That is really one of the only details that sticks out right now that reminds us how extraordinary it is that a former president is once again sitting inside a federal courtroom. All right. It looks like right now they have said \"all rise, the judge is in\". It appears the judge is on the bench, and the hearing is under way. So, right now, the hearing appears to be under way.

And that's notable because obviously Evan Corcoran, he's a former assistant U.S. attorney, has worked inside here, but he also reported Steve Bannon. Most notably is a witness against Trump in the documents case. He is the attorney, of course, that Trump, according to the indictment, tried to mislead when it came to whether or not where the documents were placed, he had notes that he took on his phone about interactions he had with Trump about plucking documents out that Trump thought were bad ones. And he had to go and attorney/client privilege was pierced and speak to jack smith's investigators in that case. That's separate obviously than the reason why Trump is in the courtroom today. It's notable that he is in there today. He has not yet entered his name on this case from what we have seen in the court filings, but he is in the back of the room. That means he's not at the counsel's table with Trump and John Lauro and Todd Blanche. But it is notable that he is in the room. And just also the fact that Donald Trump and Jack Smith are sitting 15 feet apart from each other right now, occasionally glancing at one another, but the fact that that is happening and that this is a very normal process, as Paula described, even though it's very not normal given Trump has attacked Jack Smith as deranged. He has called him a crack head. He has implied he had something to do with the cocaine found at the White House which obviously we know, Anderson, is not true. But now, those two men are seated 15 feet apart from one another inside this courtroom right now, just really speaks to the moment that we're in.

That is something that is of high interest obviously to Trump and his team because of just how she is -- her kind of situation here, the way she has handled other January 6th rioters. And the courtroom -- the courthouse behind us I think is also notable in and of itself. We know that Donald Trump is on the second floor now. That is where he is being read his rights. He has been sworn in. This arraignment is now under way on his second set of federal charges. And this is a courthouse, though, where thousands of people who were prosecuted and charged in the January 6th riot came in through these very hallways.

Not used in the pejorative sense, and there is because what we're doing in this process, first of all, we're starting the criminal justice process.But second of all, we are formally recognizing and in a sense honoring the constitutional rights that any defendant has. And look, it's 2023. We could probably do this by clicking a couple of boxes on the internet. But, no, the person needs to make an appearance in front of a judge. Before COVID, you had to do it in person, now there's optionality here. That's because these are sacred rights. And let's be clear about what's at stake for Donald Trump. This is not going to be a finding. This is not going to be a monetary penalty. This is not going to be a report. If he is convicted he will lose his liberty. He will go behind bars. So, this is a very serious process. The other thing I want to point out is there's a humbling effect naturally to sitting at that defendant's table. And for all the bombast that we see in every other arena, now he's got his hands folded, his head down. There's something about the court system that humbles everyone, brings everyone down to an equal plain.",

I'm told he didn't even use the microphone. He just looked straight at the judge and projected his voice and entered a plea of not guilty.Now again, the hearing down in Florida, when he went through this in a federal courtroom there, he had his lawyer enter that plea. So, to hear him say that in his own voice is significant. Now the judge is reading the conditions of his release. You may remember that down in Florida, in is actually what delayed the hearing. Here she's saying you must not violate state or federal law, and also that he cannot communicate with anyone known to be a witness about the case unless through a lawyer. Now that could get tricky because as we know he's listed six co- conspirators, many who are still close associates. So, much like the Mar-a-Lago documents case, the fact that so many people in this inner circle are caught up in this, that will likely be a difficult issue to navigate. Just looking quickly to see if there are any other significance -- significant things from the judge. She's reminding him that it is a crime to influence a juror or threaten a witness or retaliate against anyone else who provided information or otherwise obstruct justice. Of course, he has been charged not only with obstruction of justice but obstructing his own alleged obstruction. So she's going through all of these standard things that you would go through with any defendant, but again, taking on a different significance with a former leader of the free world. We are told, again by our colleague Henera Benowitz (ph) who's inside, he's agreed to all of these conditions. He has now sat down, and they are bringing the actual paperwork to his attorney.",

He appeared displeased about something.There was something that the pretrial services official who was in the courtroom handed papers to his attorneys, to the Justice Department attorneys there, Tom Windom and John Lauro, on Mr. Trump's side. And then they began discussing whatever it is in perhaps the bail package, that's typically the paperwork that he is handed. And then he is signing it. There was something in that paperwork that appears -- appeared to displease the former president because he had a couple of -- seemed to be heated conversation with Todd Blanch, who is seated to his right. The former president mostly looked straight ahead. He looked around the room. There were a few times where he and Tom Windom -- sorry, he and Jack Smith looked at each other. It was absolutely more Jack Smith looking in his direction, but the former president because of the vantage point absolutely saw Jack Smith. There was also -- a lot different from the one in Miami, from the hearing in Miami, where they didn't see each other during the entire hearing. One of the things that I think was interesting was the former president -- you heard him just a few times he said, yes, yes, I do when the judged him if he understood the charges, if he understood his right to remain silent. And, of course, when he said, he pleaded not guilty, he didn't speak directly into the microphone. He spoke directly ahead. You know, the demeanor of the former president reminded me a lot of during the presidential debates with Hillary Clinton where candidate Clinton said something to get under his skin. That's the look he had on his face quite a few times as he sat there with his attorneys, having some discussions as he waited about 20 minutes for the judge to take her seat in the courtroom. So, now, we expect obviously, as you have just been talking, that this is a case that's going to start moving a lot more quickly. Absolutely more quickly than the one you saw in Miami. Again, a sharp difference. There was a lot of sharp differences between the two proceedings, having been in the one in Miami.

How much time will it take you to go through discovery, to share it with the defense, but we know the special counsel, Jack Smith, has said he wants a, quote, speedy trial. Now the defense attorneys, they are going to want to delay this as long as possible. This is a pretty tight turnaround in terms of wanting to get this answered.

Trump, John, he said -- that was how he phrased it.And then he had to say his age. He had to say that he had not had any alcohol or medication before this hearing, knew exactly what was going on, that he was aware of what was going on around him. He also was the person who formally entered his pleading when he was told his charges and said do you understand these, what do you plead to these four counts? He said very clearly, very articulated with a pause, \"not guilty\". And that was the bulk of this hearing, it was Trump being addressed directly. He also was told directly by the judge that he should be able to acknowledge -- or could he acknowledge that he has a right to remain silent, that he understands that things that he says, especially to law enforcement could be held against him in a court of law. He said yes, he understood that. And he also was asked to confirm that he understood it would be a crime to retaliate against any witnesses in this case or even to intimidate some potential jurors. He said he understood that as well. Just hearing Trump's voice in that court, it is unmistakably his voice. You could hear it. You could even hear him a little bit even before the proceeding as he was whispering. He was quite animated as we were waiting for the proceeding to start. There were several minutes of wait time before the judge took the bench. Trump was in the room. Jack Smith, the special prosecutor, he was also in the room. They had a clear view of one another. And so, Trump spent a lot of time looking directly at Jack Smith, then speaking to his attorneys. Jack Smith was also quite animated in conversation, appeared to be extremely relaxed, even had his arm up on the bench. He was smiling afterwards as he sat in the counsel table in the well. But Donald Trump was in court. He didn't seem to be in as foul of a mood as he was whenever we witnessed him in court in Florida for his previous arraignment. But this really was a somber proceeding where he was asked to be directly engaged with what was going on there, with the charges he faces. Actually, one more thing that I noticed is as he's waiting for the judge, there was a large stack of papers sitting in front. He started sort of fiddling with it. He was fidgeting around and then he looked down and was clearly reading what was on the paper and then lifted it up in front of him and I could see it was the indictment itself.",

We're in the back of the motorcade.We saw Trump's vehicles pull out from the courthouse. He was underground. We were staging out behind him. And we are heading to DCA, the airport here, to hear him give remarks. I talked to an adviser who (AUDIO GAP) giving remarks but they did say we don't know which Trump is going to show up. And that is because at times Trump has been defiant when it comes to these arraignments, these indictments. At times, he's been angry and frustrated. At times, he's ignored it altogether and just focused on the 2024 campaign. Now, they said he was ramped up, which we saw on the plane ride here. He was watching the media coverage, talking to his lawyers. And we saw that because of his tweets on truth social, or his posts on truth social. Kind of snarky, almost making light of the fact that these were indictments. But they say that obviously that could change. And as we heard our colleague Evan Perez say, he seemed to be almost upset at times during his court appearance. He had his hands together. I think I heard another guest say that he seemed like he might have been humbled. Now, I don't think we're going to see a humbled Donald Trump deliver remarks. I've been covering him for a long time and that's not one of the personalities that we see. But it will be interesting, will we get a good read on how this went for him and what he feels from seeing these remarks.",

And I think all indications are that they wanted to move this thing more quickly.She's going to hear from Donald Trump's lawyers on the 28th, or I think there's going to be a brief filed even before that, for why there should be some delay. But there's no argument for much delay here, certainly not, you know, something past decide say of this year. Trump's lawyers have been signaling that, well, it's been 2 1/2 years that the prosecution's gotten to investigate, so we should get 2 1/2 years also. And the criminal law does not work that way for obvious reasons. Investigations sometimes take time but there's no parallel requirement that the defense gets the same time. So I do think all indications are this thing is going to be tried just as, you know, any other criminal case would be tried in the next year.",
