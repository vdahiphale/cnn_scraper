No major Israeli police action or anything like that to signal that something could be happening. That's why this is such a surprise. Bibi Netanyahu said himself it was a surprise. So there will be a the lot of questions not only just how was Israel not better prepared but also how did all of these militants get in? Were they already in Israel because thousands of Palestinians enter on a daily basis with permits to work? Did they come from the West Bank? How did this all happen? Another major question is whether other fronts will get involved as well, especially the north and especially Hezbollah. If Hezbollah get involved in the north, that puts this is on a whole different level.",

What's really striking for the everyday Israeli, as they are watching the news, is getting live calls from people in the south, who are hiding in their safe rooms, who are hearing this happening on the streets in front of them, who are reporting terrible things. We want to confirm those before we bring them on air. But this is incredibly shocking for them. And that's why you hear the parallels to the Yom Kippur War because that's what happened, the holiest day for Jews during the year. And they were surprised in the same way. There was a bit of disbelief back then this was happening. Not as much this time but there was a the lot of shock and fear from Israelis about what will happen now, how far into Israel have these militants got, because Hamas is calling on all Palestinians across Gaza, across the West Bank, across Jerusalem, to rise up. They're saying grab your guns, your axes, your cars and any way you want and join our war. Join our war against Israel. I think that will be a major issue if we begin to see what we're seeing with those infiltrations in those Israeli villages. If we see it across other parts of Israel, that's a major issue in addition to the rocket attacks.",

At this point, even though we're in a preliminary stage, it's clear that Israel's major strategy in the context of defending this volatile area surrounding Gaza, that strategy basically failed.What we see right now is a manifestation of Israel's worst scenario, where militants are actually taking over parts of communities and civilians in the Gaza Strip. So in that sense, definitely. And as I said, there are many other aspects that have to be asked in that regard. But with your permission, I would like to go back and provide additional insights and observations. I was talking about the military perspective and the Iranian master plan of the Ring of Fire. There's another interesting perspective. That goes to the question, why did Hamas launch that war? One different aspect is the fact that Hamas has been struggling for an ongoing period of time and it's been accumulative of criticism of people in Gaza Strip over Hamas. In the last couple months, there's been some relief because Israel enabled more and more people to go and to work in Israel. So this is one interesting aspect. The other interesting aspect has to be viewed in the context of the power struggle between Hamas on the one hand and Palestinian Authority on the other end. Hamas goes to be the leader of the Palestinian. And as part of its ideology, Hamas goes to military action. It basically says the only way to bring Israel down is through military use of power. In that sense, Hamas basically is -- basically say or do what he always say, hopefully Hamas basically hope that will gain him a credit within the Palestinian public opinion and so on. There's another interesting aspect regarding the question, why did Hamas wage that war? That has to be looked in the context of the normalization and particularly the recent talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia and the reports about it brewing sort of like peace agreement or agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Now I'm taking it to the Palestinian perspective. In the Palestinian arena, there is a growing discontent. The Palestinians are feeling that the Arab world, the brothers are abandoning them. And basically, the Palestinian says Saudi Arabia is the last one to defend us. If the Saudis are going to join the process with Israel, it means that we have totally been thrown under the bus. What Hamas likely did here is actually sending a message to the regime, saying the Palestinians are not going to be excluded. The Palestinians have a say and they have the ability to impact the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and no one could ignore that war. So I think these are a couple things to look at when we ask ourselves, why did Hamas wage that war, because it is a war. And particularly, when you look at the most significant question at this point regarding that, what is going to be Israel's response? (CROSSTALK)",

He basically was able to screen a picture where he was taking control over Israeli communities, apparently taking control of holding some Israelis as hostages.Now that goes back to the Israeli government. And one of the things that we have to ask ourselves, is Israel going to launch a massive military operation actually, basically taking that specific situation as a point where Israel is now actively changing the reality that was formed in the Gaza Strip, since 2007, when Hamas took over the strip? I would not exclude that scenario. It's very possible that we will witness a massive Israeli ground operation in Gaza Strip, that basically will aim to try and to change totally from the ground the conditions that have been prevailed for the last almost two decades. This is a pivotal moment. We have to look and see what will be the scale and the volume of Israeli retaliation and response. We have to look whether it's going to evolve in expanding of this war to other arenas. We are looking at critical hours, critical days, definitely.

I want to start with your reaction to the unprecedented events we're seeing right now. DANIEL LEVY, PRESIDENT, U.S. / MIDDLE EAST PROJECT: I think the first thing to note is this element of surprise and the really staggering success in that respect by the Palestinian movements who launched this military effort. I think that will over time play very badly in Israel. I think there was a sense of hubris, that you could keep the Palestinians in these conditions and not have these kinds of resistance actions. I think the immediate thing is the Israeli Jewish community, the political parties, the representatives come around unified. But I think ultimately this will play into an already deep polarization inside Israel. I think this, whatever happens next, will be considered a significant success for those Palestinian movements. It's not clear what happens next. It would be surprising if the Israeli response in Gaza did not also include a ground operation. I think this comes at a time where we would have the most extreme government in Israel, endless provocations. You also have what feels like a quite fragile, weak internal Israeli environment and I think the Palestinian side have looked at that, those Palestinian movements who've launched this. They have looked at the situation in Jerusalem. That resonates not only with Palestinians but far beyond. They've looked at issues like how Palestinian prisoners have been treated. They have looked at the normalization talks. And this has been the response. And I think it's also an important reminder, as your viewers are realizing this morning, that really the issue in the Middle East isn't whether Israel and Saudi Arabia, who are not at war with each other, normalize or not. The issue is what happens on Palestinian front. So many decades of occupation, there will not be security quiet instability. As long as the Palestinians don't have their rights and their freedoms. We've been reminded of this. It also comes on the 50th anniversary of the last time Israeli intelligence had a huge failure, which was the 1973 war with Egypt, the Yom Kippur War. And so I think that will play into the Israeli psyche and into the analysis coming out of Israel this morning and in the coming days.",

And what we have seen on so many occasions is devastation, massive civilian loss.Of course, massive loss to housing, to infrastructure, to schools on the Palestinian side. And unfortunately, we can expect that again. But daily life for Palestinians in Gaza and throughout the areas controlled by Israel, is one that is not normal. So Israelis are waking up to a very abnormal situation. But it's an abnormality that Palestinians live with all the time. It's just a question of what is the extremity of that. And in May of 2021, when there was the last major escalation, you saw what the Palestinians called the unity intifada. And you saw popular expressions of opposition to Israel, inside Israel, on the streets of Israel, in mixed town. You saw it inside the West Bank.

I think what it will be is predictable, which will be standing in solidarity with Israel, recognizing what they will call Israel's right to defend itself, never recognizing the Palestinian right to resist an illegal occupation and a permanent siege and blockade. So I think that's one thing we'll see.The other thing that will be missing is an appreciation that you cannot keep people under permanent conditions of inhumane, immoral but also illegal occupation and not expect something like this, not expect there to be insecurity for the party that is doing that to the Palestinians. And I think the rest of the world may look at this. I mean, look at the inadequate American response, to say, wait a minute. In one place, you celebrate resistance. You celebrate people taking up arms against an invasion, which is correctly considered to be illegal. That's in Ukraine. And in this other place, you run cover for the people who are doing the illegal occupation. And I think in the parts of the world that have woken up already and some that are also yet to wake up, they will see this as another example of the very selective American application of the standards it is claiming to uphold in one place and totally negates and undermines in another place.",

The IDF are saying some 2,000 rockets or more are being fired all the time to launch this complex attack from the sea, from the air, infiltrating with paragliders and then on foot. We have seen images of breaks in the Gaza fence and Hamas operatives and other militants entering Israel on motorbikes. Now they are able -- by being able to infiltrate and effectively now conduct hostage-taking operations, potentially, there's some reports, including from my own sources within the IDF, that they fear there are hostages and dead bodies that have been taken into Gaza territory. We have seen the destruction of a Markova tank. That is about one of the most sophisticated tanks on the planet, very sophisticated Israeli piece of heavy armor, falling to militants on or close to the border fence there in Gaza. And a Humvee being driven through the streets, all of that combining as an attempt by Muhammad Al-Deif, the leader of the Hamas military wing, inside the strip to make a call to arms right across the Middle East but in particular, trying now to cause a forest fire effectively in militant activity on the West Bank and then perhaps ultimately among ethnic Palestinians who are citizens inside Israel itself. Where the Knesset has reported three years ago that some 400,000 weapons are in the hands of ethnic Palestinians inside Israel. If that combines to set off this chain reaction, then Israel will be very much on the back foot at a time when there will be extreme pressure, particularly from Israel's Right. And it is the right wing that dominate the government in Israel, on the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to launch a very severe counterattack inside Gaza, possibly aimed to try to rid the Gaza Strip of Hamas altogether. But as we have been hearing from Daniel Levy a few moments ago and other critics on the Right within Israel, this is seen particularly by the Israeli Left as an inevitable consequence of bottling up Palestinian hopes inside enclaves like Gaza. But the real aim of the Palestinians here is to try to cause this chain reaction, an uprising on the West Bank, inside Israel itself, with the ultimate aim perhaps that this would be the doomsday scenario of involving Hezbollah out of Lebanon. That I think at the moment is a distant prospect. The next 48 hours and how Israel responds will define this. But it is absolutely unprecedented to see infiltration on this scale, effectively infantry infiltration of towns reportedly, like Sderot, where we have seen a number of civilians that have been killed at a bus stop. There's images of Hamas operatives driving around in pickup trucks, firing supposedly at random, opening fire on a police vehicle and even being involved in combat near the Sderot police station. This is the biggest town near Gaza. It's some distance from the Gaza Strip itself. There's been infiltration in the kibbutzes close to the Gaza Strip, too.",

We have seen Starlink have great success in Ukraine as a source of capacity to help the forces there doing the war. So there's a lot of opportunity here but it's going to come down to whether there's a big enough consumer market. That's really going to contain the bulk of their customer base and their revenues as well.",
