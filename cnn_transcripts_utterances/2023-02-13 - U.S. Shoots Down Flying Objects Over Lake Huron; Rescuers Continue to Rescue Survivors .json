We begin with the U.S. fighter jet shooting down another airborne object on Sunday, this one over Lake Huron.According to the Pentagon, the object was not a military threat, but it was determined to be a flight hazard. The operation marks the third day in a row that an unidentified object was shot down over North American airspace. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GLEN VANHERCK, COMMANDER, UNITED STATES NORTHERN COMMAND &amp; NORTH AMERICAN AEROSPACE DEFENSE COMMAND:  These are objects, I am not able to categorize how they stay aloft. It could be a guess. It's a type of balloon inside a structure or it could be some type of a propulsion system. But clearly, they're able to stay aloft. I would be hesitant and urge you not to attribute it to any specific country. We don't know, that's why it's so critical to get our hands on these, so that we can further asses and analyze what they are. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

And the Pentagon is saying that there's reason to believe that this object is what actually triggered that flight restriction to go into place based on the direction that it was headed in. And this object was shot down because of the potential threat to flight aviation and also because of its potential surveillance capabilities. With the Pentagon saying that they're now working to recover this object, after it was being shot down, still many questions.

You know, one team takes the lead, and then the Chiefs coming back, it was just an incredible atmosphere. And if you liked seeing points, this game was certainly for you.The first Super Bowl ever where both teams scored more than 35, it was certainly a battle. And you can see just how much this game meant to Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni from the start, he had tears pouring out of his eyes during the national anthem. But he certainly cheered up early on and was happy to see how good his quarterback Jalen Hurts was playing. He had a historic half. Hurts, the first player ever to run for two TDs and throw for one in a Super Bowl even out of a third-rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter, which is a Super Bowl record for a quarterback as well. But when the Chiefs needed Patrick Mahomes the most, he came through big time. Mahomes, even with a bad ankle that he reinjured in the first half, he led the Chiefs on a scoring drive every time they got the ball in the second half, and with the game tied at 35 in the closing moments, Mahomes, this big 26-yard run up the middle to get the Chiefs into field goal range. Now a defensive holding call helped the Chiefs run out the clock, and some fans were mad about this call, but James Bradberry admitted after the game, he was holding on to play. Chiefs, just the second team ever to erase a double-digit half-time deficit. They went 38-35 to claim Super Bowl LVII, and Mahomes was named the game's MVP. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK MAHOMES, QUARTERBACK FOR KANSAS CHIEFS &amp; SUPER BOWL LVII MVP: It's hard, man. It hasn't even sunk in. I don't think even yet. I mean, I appreciate -- I appreciate just the failures. I mean, the failure of losing a Super Bowl and losing an AFC championship game, and it may give you a greater appreciation to be standing here as a champion.

A satellite can pick up a chunk of data, but it has to keep moving and pick up more data when it comes back around. But if you can hover over a particular area and you can get streams of data, it makes it much easier for the people collecting that data to be able to try to decrypt that encrypted data. So, it's all about cellphone information, it's about military communication, it could be about government-to-government communication, but the possibilities are endless by putting these different types of devices up, they increase their chances of actually collecting good data.",
