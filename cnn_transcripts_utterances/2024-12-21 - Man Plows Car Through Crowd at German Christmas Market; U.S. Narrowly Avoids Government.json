In fact, we're gonna get right out of your way and you can see that there's still a lot of fire trucks, a lot of ambulances that are here on the scene with the emergency medical personnel working here. This is a gigantic event.And one of the things that the authorities here tell us is that the hospitals in the Magdeburg area, it's actually a very big city. They're completely overwhelmed with all this and had to fly some of the casualties to other places for increased treatment. The latest that we're hearing Is that this incident started the authorities say at around 7 p.m. local time when the driver plowed into the Christmas market. And if you look from here, the Christmas market is actually a little bit over that way. That fencing over there is the Christmas market and he plowed through there. Now there are some barriers that I've seen to that Christmas market, so it's unclear how the car made it in there. But you just showed that video, that devastating video of the car plowing through the Christmas market with people trying to jump out of the way. And that it would have been very difficult for them to do that, it's a very compact area. And, of course, 7 p.m. on a Friday night is exactly the time when most people would go to that Christmas market. Families, people coming off work, the last Friday before Christmas. So the authorities are saying the place was packed. It was almost impossible for people to get out of the way, and that's one of the reasons why so many people have been so badly injured. The governor of the state that Magdeburg is in has said that he fears that the death toll could continue to rise.",

And it appears that there's a bit of a pivot in the investigation in the last few hours in Germany, where they're looking at sort of a mixed or convoluted motive that was probably fairly personal in nature. This person apparently felt somewhat persecuted by German authorities. And investigators are now pouring over at least three to four different social media channels.

It's not always that there's an elaborate statement or a clear pathway of breadcrumbs so to speak to follow for analysts.The other problem we're getting is not just that they're not always leaving these statements. But sometimes, other than not going on media, they're using different platforms. So people will leave a statement on one and go to a Telegram channel and be in a different chat group and maybe give an indication there. So, it's also becoming harder for analysts not just to find where the breadcrumbs are, but also then to harken them together. And that's still a tremendous challenge, and particularly here where there's no firearms involved.

The U.S. federal government is avoiding a shutdown after the Senate just passed a stopgap funding bill by a vote to 85 to 11.The House of Representatives passed it earlier and the bill still needs President Biden's signature. Now, the so called Plan C extends government funding into March. It includes disaster relief and farming provisions, but it doesn't include a debt limit suspension, which was a key Donald Trump demand. That piece was stripped after a bipartisan revolt on Thursday. Apparently frustrated yet resigned, Trump lamented to one lawmaker that he was disappointed the deal couldn't include a debt ceiling hike, but some believe the president elect did, in fact, get what he wanted. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DUSTY JOHNSON, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: The reality is that President Trump did get what he wanted. He got a commitment that we're going to address the debt ceiling early next year, and that's no big surprise. Everybody knows the debt ceiling is going to be addressed next year. Of course, we are not going to default on our debts. That would be catastrophic. The debt ceiling is a leverage point for whatever the minority party is. President Trump wants to make sure that that's not a leverage point for him, for Chuck Schumer and the Democrats into the middle of next year. We, of course, are going to take care of that for him. And so, I do think he was able to get the deal that he needed this week. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, there were 38 Republicans in the House that voted against it. And so, what we're seeing here is that Trump's hold on the Republican Party, while it is incredibly strong, it is not iron clad, but he definitely along with Elon Musk, we're trying to maneuver things behind the scenes, mostly through social media. And Musk has become an incredibly powerful figure in American politics. Putting out information in this case, some of it was not truthful information about what was going on with the bipartisan deal.

If you take a look at majorities at every scale over the course of the last five decades, like right here, you'll see after decades of democratic dominance post Watergate, you got 149 seat majority at one point back in 1977. You can track that down hundreds, hundreds, 80s, 70s back to 182 that flipped when the chamber flipped. Of course, when House Republicans took over in 1994, they didn't have a huge majority, but 26 seats. Not bad. 1912 narrow at nine, but then starting to pop back up. And we saw that toggle back and forth as both sides took majorities over a period of years until the most recent period where a new trend started right about there. 10 Democratic seat majority, then nine Republican seat majority, then five Republican seat majority. So, let's take this away and go back to where we are right now. Because again, was 220, 215. At some point during this process, it's going to be 217 to 215. And that makes it really, really hard on one person in particular. This guy, Speaker Mike Johnson.",

The announcement was made by Barbara Leaf, who is the top State Department official for the Middle East. She visited Damascus on Friday.Part of the first high-level U.S. visit to the Syrian capital in years. Leaf and others sat down with the head of HTS, Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group is still designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization. Leaf said the meeting was good and productive. She called Sharaa pragmatic and noted his moderate statements. But she said the U.S. will, quote, \"judge by deeds, not just by words.\" Sharaa and others are calling for the U.S. to lift its sanctions on Syria to help jumpstart the economy. Meanwhile, these U.S. officials also raised the case of Austin Tice, the journalist who has been missing in Syria since 2012. The head of hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, says that he has been amazed by the number of secret prisons in Syria being uncovered, and he said that in their search for clues, they're focusing on around six facilities where Tice may have been held. Carson's acknowledged limited resources and suggested that American investigators, including from the FBI, could join the search on the ground soon, but for now, sadly, there is no news about Tice's whereabouts.

Demonstrators are holding a rally in South Korea as they prepare for President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment trial to begin. Now these are live pictures from Seoul where people are marching to the constitutional court. Yoon was suspended from office last week after attempting to impose martial law on the country. That shocking decision triggered weeks of unrest and protests. Now, Yoon's fate is now in the hands of the constitutional court, which has up to six months to decide whether Yoon will be formally removed from the presidency or reinstated to office. The court plans to hold its first pretrial hearing on Friday. Ukraine says Russia has, quote, \"unleashed a real hell on the southern city of Kherson.\" More than 1, 000 artillery shells hit the city over a period of 40 minutes on Friday, leaving two people dead and 10 others injured. Kherson is just across the river from Russian positions, and officials say Russian troops regularly try to cross over with hopes of reoccupying the city at some point. Similar scenes played out in Kyiv, where at least one person was killed and 12 others injured. Ukraine called it a barbaric attack that also damaged several foreign embassies. Officials say all Russian drones and missiles were shot down or failed to reach their targets, but their falling debris caused damage and casualties. Now, those strikes came a day after Russia's president bragged about his new Oreshnik hypersonic missile. It was fired at the city of Dnipro last month in what could be the first time it's ever been used in combat. The missile has multiple warheads, which can be either conventional or nuclear. And as Nathan Hodge reports, it Russia's leader dared Ukraine to pit its air defenses against it.",
