How long Griner stays at that medical facility will be up to her -- up to her, and her wife, according to the State Department. That is the same airport, the same facility that Trevor Reed went to, when he was exchanged, back in April, by the Russians. Anderson, Viktor Bout, he's already home. He landed back at the Moscow's Vnukovo airport, just a couple hours ago. He was greeted off of the plane by his mother and his wife.

But he has been doing these things now for four years. And it's hard to imagine that he's going to have to continue to do it.

WHELAN: Yes, it's brutal, and it's simple, in that they do labor every day. He's in unheated sort of sewing factory, all day long, six days a week. There's very little food. There's almost no fresh fruits and vegetables. So, I mean, it's about the worst existence, you can think of. As I've said before, it's surviving, but it's not living.

And this legislation, today, that we passed, and the President will sign, will ensure that for federal purposes, if you are married, lawfully, any state in the country, every other state must recognize that. For federal purposes, marriage between individuals of the same- sex will be determined, to be valid, if it was valid in the state it was performed.

The country is finally easing some of its strictest zero-COVID policies, after mass protests swept the nation, lifting certain testing and lockdown rules, have crippled society for years.There's one man, who can take credit, for helping bring those protests, and information, to light, risking his own life, by doing so. He spoke exclusively, to our Selina Wang. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (PEOPLE PROTESTING) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Video after video, of historic anti-zero-COVID protests, in China, broadcast on the world's television screens, everywhere, but inside China, where authorities censored all evidence, of the protests. So, how did these images manage to get beyond China's controlled internet? Newsrooms, around the world, including CNN, have been relying, on information, from this Twitter account. And there's only one man behind it, Li, a Chinese painter, in Italy, whose identity we're hiding, for security reasons. MR. LI, OWNER OF TWITTER ACCOUNT @WHYYOUTOUZHELE (through translator): This account may become a symbol that Chinese people are still pursuing freedom of speech. When you post something, within China, it will quickly disappear. This account can document all these historical events that cannot be saved inside the country. WANG (voice-over): His account quickly turned into one of the world's key sources, for protest information. Li says he received thousands of submissions per day, as the demonstrations unfolded. Apps, like Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram, are banned, in China. But people used Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, which are prohibited in China, to access Twitter, and send their videos to Li. WANG (on camera): What's the motivation behind all the work you do? LI (through translator): It's to let people inside of China, climb out of the Great Firewall, to see what's happening, at this very moment. WANG (voice-over): But that's exactly what authorities want to prevent. Here's what happens, if you search for information, about any of the protests, on Chinese social media. You get a notice that says, \"Sorry. No relevant results are found.\" Meanwhile, on Li's Twitter account, he was rapidly uploading videos of demonstrations, across China, from Marunouchi (ph), Neijiang (ph), Chengdu (ph). (PEOPLE PROTESTING) WANG (voice-over): To Shanghai, where protesters chanted, for Xi Jinping, to step down, calling for freedom, and an end to zero-COVID. And researchers say the Chinese government is even trying to bury information, about the protests, from social media users, abroad. Search on Twitter, and Chinese characters, for cities that had protests? And you get this, a flood of spam and porn advertisements. The spam campaign researchers say, appears to be the work of Chinese authorities. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment. WANG (on camera): Are you worried about your own safety? LI (through translator): Of course, I'm very worried. I get a lot of anonymous harassment, saying \"I know who you are, where you live, and I will kill you.\" WANG (voice-over): His parents frequently call him, in fear, he says, and the Chinese authorities have been harassing them too, making midnight visits, to their home, in China. WANG (on camera): What price do you think you have to pay for the work that you do? LI (through translator): This account is more important than my life. I will not shut it down. I've arranged for someone else to take over, if something bad happens to me. I'm mentally prepared, even if authorities won't let me see my parents again. WANG (voice-over): Authorities in China try to keep the country in a parallel universe. But Li is playing a pivotal role, in breaking that bubble. Li spends hours a day, on the account, only taking breaks to feed his cat, and barely slept, during the peak of protests, as he sorted and verified the endless stream of video submissions, each one urgent and historic. He's doing the work that he hopes one day Chinese journalists, and Chinese citizens, from within China, will be able to do without fear. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He's getting messages from people about all sorts of challenges, across the country, including the continued COVID chaos, and restrictions, despite the recent easing of rules.
