All of those detained are Egyptian nationals are being held on suspicion of people smuggling.In the hours before the bootleg down the Greek Coast Guard took this aerial photograph. What is clear to anyone is the vessel looks better than dangerously overloaded with no one on the upper or lower outer decks appearing to be wearing a life jacket. It's hard to see any women and children in this photo. Most are believed to have been traveling in the cargo hold. The UN says at least 40 children were on board, either before or after the photograph was taken the captain abandoned ship. Then hours later the entrance I believe to have stalled in high seas, the boat capsized and sank. Before that the Greek Coast Guard shadowed this fishing vessel for hours and Greek authorities say attempts to render assistance were rebuffed by those on board. And because they're in international waters, they say, there was little they could actually do. But that just doesn't ring true to many maritime legal experts who point out that such search and rescues do not require consent, knowing the boat was unsafe. The Greek Coast Guard was legally required under maritime law to attempt a rescue regardless of what the passengers did or did not want. As many as 750 people on that boat, 104 survive. Right now they're being kept in a dockside warehouse will eventually be transferred to a facility in Athens. Many are in shock. They're traumatized. They're asking about their children. The leader of the Greek opposition blamed Europe's immigration policies causing so much needless hearty and death. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXIS TSIPRAS, GREEK OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): I want to say that unfortunately, in this Europe where great ideas and great values of enlightenment were born, human life does not have the same worth for everyone. I want to say there are huge political responsibilities with the migration policy that Europe has been following for years, a migration policy that turns Mediterranean our seas into watery grave.

The breach is blamed on Russian hackers known for extorting ransom from their victims. CNN's Natasha Bertrand has details reporting in from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER (on camera): Several U.S. federal government agencies have been hit in a global cyberattack in which hackers have managed to exploit a flaw in a widely used software. The U.S. cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency told CNN on Thursday that it is quote providing support to several federal agencies that have experienced intrusions affecting the MOVEit applications and is quote working urgently to understand impacts and ensure timely remediation. Now MOVEit is a widely used file transfer software that hackers appeared to have found a vulnerability in earlier this year and began exploiting in late May. Progress the U.S. firm that owns the MOVEit software has now urged victims to update their software packages and has issued security advice. Now so far the U.S. Department of Energy is the only federal agency to confirm publicly that it was hit, saying in a statement that records from two of its entities were compromised and that the department is investigating the incident. But look, the hackers have used the vulnerability to target not only federal agencies but also state governments and academic institutions, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and Georgia statewide university system. In terms of who is behind the hack a Russian speaking ransomware group, known as Clop. Last week claimed credit for some of the cyberattacks which have also affected employees of the BBC, British Airways, oil giant Shell and state governments in Minnesota and Illinois, among others. But while the Russian hackers were the first to exploit the vulnerability, experts say that other groups may now have access to software code that is needed to conduct attacks and are simply taking advantage of it. So broadly, the new hacking campaign really shows the widespread impact that a single software flaw can have if it's exploited by these skilled criminals, and it's putting new pressure on federal officials who have pledged to combat the ransomware attacks that have hobbled schools, hospitals and local governments across the US.

The storm uprooted trees brought down power lines, literally leaving nearly 1,000 villages in the dark and left many homes without roofs. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOLOGIST (on camera): What once was a very powerful storm for a time down here in the warm water now is down to 100 kilometer per hour storm making its way on shore so the storm surge is not so great. The wind speeds are not so great. The real threat from Biparjoy is when this moves onshore and into the very dry land that's there with very heavy rainfall. Some spots will pick up 250 to 500 millimeters of rainfall, that's anywhere between eight and maybe even up to 16 inches of rain. [01:20:00] There's the storm where it was a meandering little storm didn't want to come on shore finally did. The good news is because it took its sweet old time, that this thing grabbed so much dry air from the deserts to the north, that lost a lot of intensity, a hurricane, cyclone, typhoon, they all want to be in warm water and they want to have humid air around them. Well, it didn't have the humid air. It was dry air that truly weakened the storm significantly. It is going to continue to move and continue to weaken as it moves through kind of the hilly areas here. And that's part of the problem. It's the hilly areas that will collect the rainfall in one or two spots and then all run downhill. So if you see this 250 to 500 millimeter rainfall totals here, here's some back over here that's almost 12 inches of rainfall expected here in that white zone. That's where the fresh water, the flash flood water will be collecting and also of course running off that's the greatest risk right now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Boris Johnson's birthday party, one of them had 200 odd people invited to it and they were told to bring their own booze.Ultimately, the report concludes that Boris Johnson did mislead the House when he gave in the words of the report unsustainable interpretations of the rules that he helped to write. For example, he insisted and in some cases continues to insist that some of these gatherings were essential for work purposes. So in its conclusion, the report found in part, quote, we came to the view that some of Mr. Johnson's denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the Committee and the House while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth. Now, Johnson released his own scathing statement in response, which read in part for the committee now to say that all such events thank yous and birthdays were intrinsically illegal is ludicrous contrary to the intentions of those who made the rules, including me and contrary to the findings of the Met, and above all, I did not for one moment think they were elicit at the time or when I spoke to the comments.

Now, that soldier who was there that night told his story exclusively to CNN, with the activist's group breaking the silence. He said dozens of forces there were aware of the threats that were (INAUDIBLE) but did nothing to intervene. He said the army generally quote, \"doesn't know how to deal with settler terrorism. He said soldiers did nothing at the first sight of groups of settlers, some of them even masked, coming towards the town. And it's not that no one knew these attacks were going to happen, that little West Bank group or even some right wing members of the Israeli Parliament are members, have called for settlers to march towards Huwara and quote, heap revenge for the deaths of the Israeli brothers. But the Israeli soldiers said that the biggest failure of the Israeli forces is actually their inability to protect and let in fire trucks to prevent the extensive damage to property. Videos and testimony from witnesses show that emergency vehicles were blocked either by settler attacks or by Israeli soldiers telling them it was not safe to enter. Eventually some of them did go in after being told they were doing so at their own risk. Now, since that night in February, there have been several more violent and sometimes deadly incidents between Palestinians and Israelis in and around Huwara. Israeli soldiers remain in the town to reinforce the area, the IDF has said, and Palestinians say that in practice, that sometimes means the soldiers force them to close their shops. The IDF chief of staff told CNN they have learned from the rampage in February and now they say rapidly reinforced security forces in a given area when suspicion arises of the development of a similarly severe incident. But Palestinian residents in Huwara remain unconvinced. And with settler leaders now in positions of power in this government, they say they are fearful of what is to come.

That is according to the E.U.'s Copernicus Climate Change Service.It's also the first time in June that global surface air temperatures surpassed pre-industrial levels by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Other new research from the group Climate Central shows the near record heat forecast in much of Texas and Mexico has been made at least five times more likely by human caused climate change. Triple digit Fahrenheit temperatures are forecast from now until next week and that's over 40 degrees Celsius. It's not even summer yet here in the northern hemisphere. There's something truly unique, truly awful in the shared misery for anyone who travels in the U.S. during the summer months. Even before the long lines at airport check-ins, epic waits at security checks, before the screaming child on every flight, before the disappearing in-flight service -- that is, if your flight is not delayed or canceled, there is the price of travel, which has soared and not just in dollar terms. Airlines are demanding more frequent flyer miles, especially for international travel, than ever before. And then there is the downgrade apocalypse. About 20 million members of U.S. loyalty programs reportedly had their status downgraded during the first quarter of the year.

And Delta is ten times that for the same exact flight.So what I urge people is, if you've got credit card points, just because you fly a certain airline like Delta, it doesn't mean you need to put all your miles in one basket. Use credit card points and then transfer to foreign frequent flyer programs, which have not had the same level of inflation in terms of miles.",

And a lot of credit cards will actually give you Global Entry for free. So, it takes a little bit of time to apply, and it can take a while to get an interview for Global Entry. But here is the trick. Whenever you travel abroad, you can, once you go through Customs on the way home, and Immigration, you can interview on the spot. They call it enrollment on arrival.
