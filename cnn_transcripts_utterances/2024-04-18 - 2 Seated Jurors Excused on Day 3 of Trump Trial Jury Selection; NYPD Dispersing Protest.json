      "sentences": "Right now, 18 potential jurors in the Trump hush money trial are facing additional questions from Donald Trump's defense team and the prosecution. They're in the running for 13 open slots on the jury. That's more than we started with today because two impaneled jurors were unexpectedly dismissed. One of them cited concerns that her identifying information had been made public and that concern is apparently weighing on the jury pool, at least according to one person who was dismissed earlier in the process.That person says that when prospective jurors saw reports that identifying information was published by certain outlets on Tuesday, some felt \"scared.\" Let's go back out to CNN Chief Legal Analyst and Anchor, Laura Coates, who's posted up outside of court. Laura, this is a painstaking process. Yesterday we were welcoming the fact that it was moving so swiftly. We thought open arguments would begin on Monday. Now we've hit a speed bump. LAURA COATES, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: I mean, we were one step forward, now it's two at least jurors back. And the process continues right now, Boris, to find an impartial panel of 18 jurors. Remember, that's 12 jurors, as we know needs to happen, plus six alternates. Now, it might now become at least six alternates because of the pace at which we seem to be losing people on this jury pool. Now, remember, these two jurors that were dismissed, they were not just prospective jurors. They had actually been seated, which means, of course, that the defense and the prosecution chose not to use either of their peremptory strikes. A fancy way of saying I'm going to exercise my prerogative to dismiss you for any reason that is lawful outside of race or gender or ethnicity. These were essentially compromised people who you could say, listen, we agree that you could be impartial. Now they've lost two of those people and the reasons for doing so, the first one phoning in with the judge saying, listen, I know I was chosen, but I believe that my anonymity has been compromised and now I feel that I cannot be impartial. A second one having answered a question, question 19 on that jury questionnaire form, which alludes to whether you've ever been arrested or committed a crime or prosecuted for such or one of your family members has been. Apparently, one of the jurors did not answer that question truthfully through the investigation we learned later from the DA's office, and so these two different areas. At the end of the day, you're right. It's not a perfect system. It's not quite an honor system, but it is about self-reflection and self- disclosure. And then you've got, of course, the duty of the prosecution and the defense team to then maybe go beyond that and see, are there other reasons to doubt what this person is saying. Now, for a fair trial to take place, it doesn't mean it's only fair if a certain result, either acquittal or conviction ends up. It's whether or not there is a jury of peers who can be impartial, listen to the evidence as presented, does not have an ax to grind or a personal stake in the matter, is willing to have an open mind to actually receive the evidence. That's the goal of any trial. It's the right of any defendant, but it's proving more and more challenging as the hours - not just the days - go by.",

The person has pleaded guilty to serious crimes. They've done bad things.In the case of Stormy Daniels, we're not talking about crimes, but a life that some jurors may not actually agree with. And so what they want to do is just put it out there, out in front, let everybody know about what it is, say this is who this person is. And in this case, with jury selection, it's particularly important to get out in front of that because they now have an opportunity to keep that person off the jury if someone says, listen, I just don't trust that someone like that could tell the truth. I don't like people like that. That's the sort of thing that would be very helpful for prosecutors and the defense, of course, to know as they're selecting their jury.

I don't think that anyone will be wanting to go in that direction now.If, as we go along, there are threats coming in that the authorities deem serious or there's some reason to reconsider, I'm sure that the judge will, protecting the integrity of this. Proceedings and, of course, the safety of the jurors is paramount here. But I don't think anyone's willing to go there yet. That's a huge burden on the jurors and on the system.

Others may not be so concerned about that. It just kind of depends on the person.Of course, if they got individual threats or, you know, saw someone following them or had some other specific reason to think that there was a safety problem, then that would change it altogether. But as of now, I think they're just thinking about: Am I going to be identified? What's that going to do to my life?

But it's just past this gate here, Boris, where there's about 500 students that have gathered in the center of the university we're told that's pro-Palestine and pro-Israel groups that have gathered. There are speeches being made.But around 1 o'clock, that is where everything started to happen. There was a pretty sizable police response, an escalation here by the university president. She had given warnings, the school had given warnings that students were going to be forced off the campus because they had set up tents. There were other things going on there. And then finally, the NYPD moved in. They also gave warnings, telling students that if they don't leave, that they're going to be arrested. And then they started making arrests. We're told that at least 30 people were taken into custody by the NYPD. They're being processed. They have been removed. [15:10:00] But it's certainly an escalation for the university president to ask the NYPD to come on campus in their riot gear and to start making arrests as they did, certainly has troubled many of the students here to see that kind of activity by police officers on their campus. But out here, certainly things have gotten a lot calmer, quieter out here. There's a small group gathered here. They're pretty peaceful and they're just chanting. But the other thing, Boris, that I want to show you is just the security around the campus has definitely been stepped up. I've been on this campus before. You can easily just walk through. But today you see their security set up. They're checking students' IDs before they even let them in past the gates here, so definitely a difference here.

But this idea of now changing the motion to vacate has sparked some blowback on the far-right and really left Republicans divided about how to proceed. Just listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): A lot of our members would like to see the threshold change because of that, so that we can get back to the work that we need to do and not have that as a constant threat over our Republican majority in the House. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Our goal is to avoid a motion to vacate, but we are not going to surrender that accountability tool, particularly in a time when we're seeing America's interests subjugated to foreign interests abroad.
