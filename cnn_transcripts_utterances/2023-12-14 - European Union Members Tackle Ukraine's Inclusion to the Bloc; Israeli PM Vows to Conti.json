There are growing calls to ramp up funding for Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion and to advance Ukraine's bid to become part of the European Union. But Hungary's Prime Minister is threatening to veto both of these initiatives. Viktor Orban is the closest E.U. ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and all decisions about future accession to the E.U. must be unanimous. So European leaders are about to engage in a lot of wrangling.Now this comes shortly after the U.S. failed to replenish tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did get a pledge of nearly $800 million in financial and humanitarian assistance from Norway on Wednesday. And CNN's Bianca Nobilo is following all of this. She joins us live from Brussels. Good Morning to you, Bianca. So, what is expected to come out of this European Council summit, particularly when it comes to the possibility of E.U. membership for Ukraine?",

      "sentences": "Well good to talk to you Rosemary. This is a historic summit and the stakes are exceptionally high. You laid the groundwork therefore for why that is and that's because Ukraine has been struggling in its counteroffensive. Putin seems to be positioning himself from a greater stance of strength at the moment. He's even doing his annual Q&amp;A this year which many are interpreting as a sign of renewed confidence in terms of his invasion of Ukraine.So what happens here really matters and currently there is all to play for. We don't know how it's going to turn out and that's because the member states will be discussing renewed funding to Ukraine first and foremost and then this key question of whether or not Ukraine can begin formal accession talks to become the 28th member of the European Union. Right now the leaders of the 27 member states are arriving in the building behind me. It is literally happening at this moment because we were having trouble with our live positions just before I went live with you because of snipers and security. So everybody's arriving now. There have been discussions last night and this morning between key players such as the German Chancellor, the Prime Minister of Hungary, the French President and key figures within the European Union to try and break this deadlock because as you say, all agreements have to be unanimous. Orban is Putin's closest European Union ally. We know last night that a large amount of E.U. funding for Hungary around 10 billion euros was unfrozen. Now that had been frozen because of concerns to do with Hungary's rule of law. So there are some within the European Union, the Parliament especially, that are criticizing this saying it looks like bribery because the European Union need Hungary to be on side when it comes to getting more funding for Ukraine, possibly agreeing on Ukraine formally starting accession talks. So it's a bit of horse trading going on there, unfreezing these funds. So the other question is, Rosemary, whether or not President Zelenskyy will come to this summit, whether he'll make an appearance. We know that he hasn't been shy in doing that. He's just been to the United States. He's been in Norway. He's come to the United Kingdom when he really needs funding or the next step of support. But there's chatter this morning in Brussels that won't be happening because it might be seen as antagonistic to Orban and actually make these discussions even more difficult. So huge amounts at stake here, Rosemary, and we'll keep you posted on developments as we get them.",

CNN's MJ Lee has details from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: For the first time, President Biden meeting in person here at the White House with some of the family members of those American hostages that are still being held captive in Gaza. About a dozen of those family members, we are told, were here at the White House. Several others tuned in virtually. When these family members came out to speak to reporters afterwards, they said that they were grateful for the White House's continued close engagement with these families and they said that the Biden White House understands that each of their loved ones isn't just a name or a face, but that they are somebody's son, somebody's mother, somebody's grandmother. Here's what one of those family members said. JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF HOSTAGE SAGUL DEKEL-CHEN: It was a terrific, terrific meeting and conversation. I think we all came away feeling that as families of hostages, of American-Israeli hostages, which are eight out of a total of 138 hostages, we felt that and we felt before and we were only reinforced in seeing and believing that we could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Biden himself and his administration.",

The war has resumed and no hostages have gotten out since then. And so these family members are all pressing both the Israeli government as well as the Biden administration to basically get creative, to do really anything, take any action to try to get additional hostages out. But the tough reality right now, according to CNN's reporting, is that there is no movement at the moment. There isn't even a formal negotiation to try to get Hamas back to the negotiating table as it relates to these hostages. Our reporting is that in recent days, Hamas has actually been entirely unresponsive to various overtures that have been made to once again discuss some kind of deal, some kind of negotiation to get more of these hostages out. So that certainly is not good news for these families. But they did say after this meeting at the White House and seeing the president in person, that those meetings, that meeting, helped to refuel their hope that the White House is, in fact, trying to do everything that they can to get more of these hostages out of Gaza.

      "sentences": "That's right, Rosemary. None of those two issues bode well or over well for a resumption of this week-long truce that ended on December the 1st and saw some 80 Israeli hostages being released in addition to 25 foreign hostages and then about 240 Palestinian prisoners who were being held in Israeli jails being freed as well.So from a senior U.S. official we are being told as MJ was just saying that Hamas is pretty much deaf to new overtures to return to the negotiating table to try to resurrect that truce or get a different deal, maybe even an improved deal, which would see not just the remaining women and children that are still being held captive by Hamas, who were kidnapped by the militant group on October the 7th, but also perhaps to include the men that it holds hostage as well. But no movement there. And of course, we also have to remember that it was difficult enough to get that first truce in place. Israel and many in the U.S. administration believe that the intensification, the ratcheting up of that military pressure on Hamas is what will get them back to the negotiating table. But at the same time that makes the prospect of negotiations trickier, because don't forget the U.S. and Israel are going via the Qataris. The Qataris speak to the Hamas political leadership in Doha. They then have to speak with the military leadership of Hamas inside the Gaza Strip, who of course are trying to remain undetected by the Israelis, who are at the same time trying to kill them. And as for the Mossad chief, this is the head of Israel's Foreign Intelligence Service. This was a report that came out on Channel 13. We subsequently had confirmed at CNN by someone familiar with the hostage negotiations, telling us that David Barnea, the head of the Mossad, was due to go to Doha to try to give renewed impetus to get those truce negotiations back on track, but that trip was canceled by the Israeli government. That has caused outrage among the families of those who have loved ones still being held captive inside the Gaza Strip. So while they feel that President Biden could not be, there could not be a better person in the White House to back their cause. they don't feel the same about the Israeli government. Rosemary?",

Many thanks.A U.S. official says Israeli forces are testing a new strategy to try to degrade the Hamas tunnel network in Gaza by flooding them with seawater. It's being done on a limited basis for now to see if the operation could be scaled up. But it also comes with risks, as CNN's Nic Robertson reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): The tunnels themselves are big, big enough for fighters and their weapons, seen here in this Hamas propaganda video, which was also posted by the Israel Defense Force. They are reinforced with concrete too. Two years ago, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers, more than 300 miles of them. The tunnels are spread all over Gaza. This map over two years old. The IDF says they've discovered 800 tunnel shafts so far and have destroyed 500 of them. The entrances are often well hidden. As I was shown by the IDF near a Gaza hospital, really well hidden, which means the tunnels can be really hard to find.",

Now, it's not without its risks.There could be hostages in those tunnels. There are very few details about how precisely the water is getting into the tunnels, how much water, how fast it's going in, or what you do if you suddenly discover you're flooding hostages, other than the IDF say they have begun carefully testing it and that this method is being trialed on a limited, limited basis. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Some of the tunnels are thought to be five floors deep. Some of the hostages who were freed have described them. This elderly hostage helped by her daughter.

New video shows what overwhelmed hospitals are now facing and we want to warn you viewers may find the images disturbing.The video was shot at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza on Wednesday and shows those injured being treated on the floor amid chaotic scenes. Many casualties were brought in on Wednesday after a reported strike. The Hamas-controlled health ministry said Wednesday the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 18,600, and it's not just the expanding war but also the weather that's bringing more misery to Gaza's displaced population. Heavy rain has flooded makeshift tents and some have had to dig trenches to try to keep the water out. Well up to 45 percent of air-to-ground munitions Israel has used in Gaza are the so-called dumb bombs. That is according to the latest U.S. intelligence assessment described exclusively to CNN by three sources who saw it. The unguided or dumb bombs are less accurate and more likely to cause civilian casualties. The assessment comes amid rare U.S. public criticism of Israel.

But I think the key thing that Biden needs to do is get out of this zero-sum politics of just a ceasefire on its own. There needs to be a package that includes some sort of transition that reassures Israel on security, but also reassures the region and the Palestinians that there is a plan for the day after. Because right now, my sense is -- is that a ceasefire on its own is a non-starter for Netanyahu and that's really what's putting a lot of pressure on Biden, why he's sending people to the region, including Jake Sullivan this week, to talk about what some of that package might look like.",

And then you have to go through the options that Biden and Netanyahu and the Palestinians have.And option one that the Netanyahu has said, which is staying on in Gaza indefinitely, is certainly a non-starter for the E.U. and for the U.S. The U.S. has floated the idea of the Palestinian Authority taking over. I expect that will be a key line from Jake Sullivan's trip to Jerusalem today. But Netanyahu has said that he will not allow the Palestinian Authority back into Gaza.

Last year, Ukraine had just managed three successful counter offensives, the most recent one being the retake of Kherson, which was the biggest city Russia had managed to seize.In the war, Russia had launched a mobilization which had led to an exodus of thousands of people abroad. So Putin's grip on power, his standing in the country was a little more shaky. This year, Ukraine's allies are hesitating. Its counteroffensive stalled and then fizzled out. And so Putin does have the wind in his sails to some extent. He's also just announced he's going to run for a fifth term in office, which, you know, I think calling it an election might be optimistic given that there's no real opposition, but certainly his power seems pretty secure. And I think we might be able to see some of that in this event today. It is a combination of both his end-of-year speech and this televised phone-in. So we may get some sense of it being sort of a proper kickoff for his election campaign. It's going to be quite long. Usually they last some hours.

And it is unfortunate that he has found himself in this circumstance.You know, he was literally kidnapped. He has been held for a ransom, as you mentioned, which we paid. And now we're just really wanting him home. We're doing everything that we can. We've been pleading with the State Department, you know, really wanting to make sure that we get him home as soon as possible, you know, and we're just bumping into so many bureaucratic roadblocks, really, you know, and trying to do that. You know, they're requesting that we have him sign a privacy release form, which I understand, but we can't even, we can't gain access to him, his attorney can't gain access to him. You know, so it's like it's just it's one thing after another where we're doing everything in our power, trying to urge, you know, our government to designate him wrongfully detained, which is so blatantly obvious.

And because he is American, we're assuming, they have now made him a political prisoner, along with the other American hostages. We know that where he is, it is a place that is notorious for very inhumane treatment. We know that Savoi did pass out from the abuse and the neglect and was taken to a medical facility. We do know that horrible things go on there. Savoi was placed in forced disappearance for four weeks with them not even acknowledging that they had them and with no communication to the family. And He was placed in solitary confinement. His human rights are being violated on a daily basis. His attorney has been denied access to him. And so it is a horrible situation and we are urgent not only for Savoi but for all of the Americans that are there, that are, you know, that we want them home.

We appreciate you too.The Turkish football referee who was punched by a club president after a game earlier this week has been released from hospital. The chief doctor of the hospital says the referee has some swelling in his eye but overall he's fine and in good spirits. Turkey's Football League is set to resume matches on Tuesday. CNN's Scott McLean has more on the incident and its fallout on Turkish football. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A moment of rage from a top-tier club boss becomes a moment of shame for Turkish football. After his Ankara Gujju club concedes a goal late in the match on Monday, Faruk Koca storms onto the pitch and punches the referee in the face. Two others kick him while he's down. Shortly after, the referee emerges from the scrum with a very noticeable black eye. The ref is escorted off the field under police protection. The club president, though, needs none as he waves to the crowd. On Tuesday, Koca was arrested in Ankara charged with injuring a public official. He told Turkish state news agency Anadolu his violent outburst was because of the ref's decisions during the match. A day later, he stepped down. The incident has attracted nationwide condemnation. Even the Turkish president called the ref in his hospital bed. His doctor explained the prognosis. There was a small crack, he said. But what makes us happy is that there was no brain damage. The Turkish Football Federation has suspended all professional matches until next week. But in Istanbul, some fans are more shocked by that decision than the violence itself. Several pointed us to this incident in 2015, when shots were fired at the Fenerbahce team bus after a match, injuring the driver.",

Green apologized and says it was an accident, but he was thrown out of the game, his third ejection this season and his second suspension.

And as OPEC congratulated the Sultan and called for oil field expansion, climate envoy John Kerry tried a more hopeful tone. JOHN KERRY, U.S. SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE: The message coming out of this COP is we are moving away from fossil fuels, we're not turning back that is the future. And the United States is going to continue to lead the charge on this on the home front through investments in the Inflation Reduction Act and bipartisan infrastructure law. WEIR (voice-over): Those laws have uncorked billions in clean energy investment and the price of renewables has dropped so dramatically Texas leads the nation in wind power.

MANN, AUTHOR, \"OUR FRAGILE MOMENT\": Unfortunately, the reality is that it was a disappointing agreement because there was no agreement reached to phase out fossil fuels.
