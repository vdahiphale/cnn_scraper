Senator John Fetterman, one of the staunchest Biden supporters, at this hour is my guest. Plus, all eyes on Kamala Harris as Trump turns his focus to attack her personally. Is he now just betting that she's going to be on the top of the Democratic ticket? And also tonight, summer camp in North Korea. We've got one student's story about what Kim Jong-un's loyal followers did as they tried to brainwash him. It's an incredible story. He speaks to CNN. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the breaking news, a ninth House Democrat just calling on President Biden draw from the presidential race that Democrat, Congressman Earl Blumenauer of Oregon. In a statement, he writes: This is not just about extending his presidency, but protecting democracy. While this is a decision for the president and the first lady, I hope they will come to the conclusion that I and others have: President Biden should not be the Democratic presidential nominee. And just moments ago, the president just facing an onslaught of questions about his health and the future of his campaign and Biden, this all happened while he was meeting with the new British prime minister, chose not to answer any of them. Let me play the moment for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One widely shared view had really been that everything was going to come to a head after the conclusion of the NATO summit, which the U.S. is hosting just blocks away from here from the White House.Instead, we have seen this quick succession of really ominous and painful headlines for President Biden as he has been trying to juggle these various engagements with world leaders. You take through some of them, Nancy Pelosi saying that it's up to the president to decide if he's going to continue running. That really went off like a political earthquake. Senator Tim Kaine saying, he is going to ultimately make the right decision. And then, of course, the George Clooney news that you just referenced, that comes at a moment when plenty of donors have told CNN that the money is just a pause right now, and there is the real danger of the money completed elite drawing up for Democrats as people tried to figure out what exactly is going to happen for the future of the president and whether he really is going to stay in this race. And all of this is happening while the Biden White House and the Biden campaign has very much been digging in. Their message has really been, not only is the debate over, but we are done debating the debate. The voters have spoken and there is no scenario where President Biden is going to drop out. But, of course, this huge moment that everyone is looking towards tomorrow, the press conference that the president will be holding with reporters, a lot of Democrats have been looking forward to that moment see whether he can use that to really prove himself in a big way. But I think it is clear after the events of the last 24 hours, there are many Democrats that are simply wondering, are there going to be more shoes to drop before that press conference tomorrow?",

We aren't threatened with balance. We aren't ostracized but what I would ask everyone when we do this in a way that it's happening now, what happens in November when Joe Biden is still our nominee? Do we throw up our hands and say, oh, my bad, we still want you to go and vote for the president and help us save democracy? What's the end game here? And so, what I would say that until Joe Biden tells us differently, he is still our nominee. If we want to defeat Donald Trump in November, we have to rally around our nominee and do everything that we can do to make sure that he and Kamala Harris win in November and this infighting then get us any closer to victory.",

My song would be Nancy take the wheel, okay? She has been the best speaker in American history. And I think what she was saying this morning when she said the president has important decision to make, we back him completely, is she's telling us not only by the way, is the best legislative leader of American history, but as a mother of five, I've raised four kids. I know, there's a time at which permission becomes more powerful than pressure, right? So instead of piling on, getting, you know, getting nasty with the president, with president nasty with Democrats who are concerned, I think the thing to do here is to listen to Speaker emerita Pelosi and pull back a little bit. I think Senator Kaine and the comments you reported earlier its doing that. Stepping back the president is the leader of the free world. And right now, Vladimir Putin is bombing a children's hospital in Kyiv. And Donald Trump is attacking Liz Cheney. Not criticizing Vladimir Putin, a war criminal, he's attacking his fellow Republicans, Mitch McConnell and Mike Pence and Liz Cheney. So there's an opportunity cost here. So I think what Speaker emerita Pelosi might be saying is, let's just pull back here and give President Biden time to finish this summit and then do the right thing because I think a lot of Democrats think that he can't win.",

CNN exclusively learning tonight the names of fake electors and election deniers from seven states who will be acting as delegates, and national committee members at the 2024 Republican convention next week. Some of the fake electors now facing criminal prosecution over their roles in 2020 -- I mean, to think of that criminal prosecution, you can see some of them there, many of them do come from battleground states.So I want to go straight to Zach Cohen, his reporting breaking this story tonight. I mean, Zach, just to -- the bottom line here, you've got people from seven states who were involved in trying to overturn the last election. Now have active roles in the official process to nominate Trump this time. Wow, I mean, what more can you tell us? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, Erin, that's exactly right. We're talking about key swing states that are going to be pivotal again here in 2024, places like Arizona, places like Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, the delegations from these seven states that the Republican Party in those states are going to send the convention in Milwaukee. They're made up of a lot of election deniers, several fake electors and others who tried to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results. They're now going to go to the convention and officially helping anoint Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president in 2024. And I want to take a look at some of these specific individuals because it really is a who's who in some cases of fake electors. They include people like Jake Hoffman a state senator from Arizona. He was fake elector there and it was indicted for his alleged role in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results, has pleaded not guilty in that case. You have people like Amy Kramer who will represent Georgia as part of that delegation. She's not been criminally charged for her role in efforts overturn the election, but she did help organize that rally at the White House ellipse that immediately preceded the January 6 riot. And Michigan, that's going to be represented by people like Meshawn Maddock. Meshawn Maddock served as a fake elector. She's been indicted on state charges and pled not guilty in Michigan there. And also Matthew DePerno from Michigan, he was separately indicted for in a conspiracy alleged to try to seize voting machines in that state. So really several people currently facing criminal charges that are going to appear on the convention floor and submit their states vote for Donald Trump for president.",

Now, Giuliani was actually on a Zoom line and on Zoom, he starts shouting so loudly that the judge asks Giuliani's microphone to be muted. So I want to go straight to Katelyn Polantz.

It's just extraordinary.In Wisconsin, what you mentioned, there was a major civil law settlement in which the false electors, all ten of them, agreed that they would never be involved in being official electors for Donald Trump or for anybody actually in 2024. And the agreement also says the electoral defendants agree to refrain from participating in any way in the execution or transmission of electoral votes in 2024.
