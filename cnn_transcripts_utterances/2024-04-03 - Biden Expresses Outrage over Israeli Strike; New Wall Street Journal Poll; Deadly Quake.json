Biden holding a tight lead there.It's also where thousands of progressive voters used last night's presidential primary to protest Biden's handling of Israel's war against Hamas. More than 45,000 voters picked uninstructed on the ballot. And that is more than twice the margin that Biden had when he won the state back in 2020. Last night, President Biden came out also with some of his harshest words yet toward Israel, criticizing Israel over the deaths of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers. They were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. He shared those frustrations also with a small group of Muslim community leaders during a meeting at the White House last night. It wasn't enough to keep one Palestinian American doctor from walking out in the middle of the meeting in protest. Arlette Saenz is at the White House, back with us with much more on this. What more can you tell us about this meeting that happened last night, Arlette?",

Now, one of the attendees from that meeting told CNN that the president did raise and discuss the deaths of those seven aid workers who are working for World Central Kitchen to distribute aid in Gaza.And the president, yesterday, also issued some of his most forceful language yet when it comes to criticizing Israel for the conflict in Gaza. A senior administration official told CNN that the deaths of these World Central Kitchen workers has really raised the frustration among President Biden and his top advisers to a whole new level. That was evidenced in the statement President Biden released last night. The very first word saying, quote, \"I am outraged.\" A word that he has rarely used in this conflict. The president also, in his statement, criticized Israel for not doing more to protect civilians and humanitarian aid workers. He said, \"this conflict has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed. This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult, because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians. Incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen.\" The president also spoke by phone with Chef Jose Andres, the founder of World Central Kitchen, to express his condolences for the lives lost, including one dual U.S.-Canadian citizen. But really this incident highlights some of the tension points between the U.S. and Israel. The president has increasingly warned Israel that they need to take greater care to protect civilians and also to get more humanitarian aid into Palestinian civilians in Gaza. But the president, as you noted, is also facing domestic pressures here at home. In that small meeting last night with Muslim leaders, some of the people in attendance were doctors who have been on the ground in Gaza and seen the suffering firsthand. And one of those doctors, Ahmad (ph), told CNN that he walked out of that meeting in protest. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. THAER AHMAD, WALKED OUT OF WHITE HOUSE MEETING: We are not satisfied with what has taken place. There has been no concrete steps. But keep in mind, we're very concerned about the people that are over in the Gaza Strip, that are in Palestine right now, who are not just starving, but are facing the threat of a looming Rafah invasion. And so I was able to share that with the president and let him know that out of respect for my community, out of respect for all of the people who have suffered and who have been killed in the process, I need to walk out of the meeting.

Obviously, this \"Wall Street Journal\" poll today not great for the Biden campaign. But we have seen the polling average come up in these battleground states. We've seen the trend lines moving in the right direction. Obviously, the election is not tomorrow. It is still seven months away. There's still a very long time to sharpen the case, to draw this contrast, and to bring forward the issues you kind of heard Harry referencing this. You know, for the Biden campaign, they have to - they have to think about how they can bring to the forefront the issues where Biden has the advantage. Abortion is obviously one. You know, how can they really ensure that this campaign is about what's at stake, what a Donald Trump second term would really mean on these issues, and how can they draw that clear contrast?

And the way they - the way they put it together is that upwards of 100,000, if you add it all together when you're looking at the Republican primary in Wisconsin, is they voted last night, upward of 100,000 Wisconsin state Republicans went to the polls Tuesday and checked the box for someone or thing other than Donald Trump.

I think it was 8 percent of the people who turned out, did this uninstructed on the ballot. Is - what do you do with that as a campaign? Do you think that those people who were voting for Nikki Haley on the ballot are getable for the Biden campaign?

People feel tired of politics. It's, you know, you could - I think you could argue since Donald Trump really came on the scene in 2016, politics has taken a turn for the even more negative. People are tired of it. And they've got frustrations with both candidates. No question. So, I think strategically for the Biden campaign, I think what they've got to do is they have to cast as wide a net as possible.Donald Trump is not putting forward an inclusive message. He's not putting forward a message of optimism or hope, or really even a message that's focused on the future. I mean really, you know, his messages is a lot about his own personal grievances and in the past. So, for the Biden campaign strategically, I think in order to energize some of these people who feels sort of turned off by politics, they have to put forward an optimistic message. They also have to be very clear about the stakes. I think they cannot beat around the bush in terms of what a second Trump term will look like in terms of threats to our democracy, in terms of just the overall sense of chaos. I mean that was something that people really disliked about the first Trump term. And the Biden campaign has to remind people what that felt like and what that kind of uncertainty felt like having Donald Trump in the White House. So, you know, I think the Trump - so far what we've seen from Donald Trump is giving Joe Biden a huge opening to do that. I think they have a pathway.

It's also a rural area and also where most of Taiwan's earthquakes actually take place. So, of those 137 people still trapped, Taiwanese authorities have told us that a majority of them are actually in a mining area. And they're trying to get to those people, trying to communicate with those who are still trapped. [09:20:02] And they're trying to get those people out and to safer grounds by deploying military troops and working with local governments to get them there. But, of course, some of these rescue efforts were affected by just really collapsed roads that have been destroyed due to that really powerful earthquake and those aftershocks. Now, the Taiwanese government has also warned residents in Taiwan that we could still see aftershocks continuing for the next several days. They've said that the earthquakes - the aftershocks could have a magnitude of 6.5 to 7.0, which is very, very significant. And as someone who lives in a very seismically active country, who has experienced a lot of aftershocks from vary powerful earthquakes, I can tell you, John, that these are not to be taken lightly. They can still be very traumatizing for people in Taiwan.
