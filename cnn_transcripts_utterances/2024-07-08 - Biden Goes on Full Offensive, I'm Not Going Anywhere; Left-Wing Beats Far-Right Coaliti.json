It's a recognition that certain political tactics that worked for Donald Trump might also work for other politicians.But yes, Biden did sound a bit Trumpian in this most recent call. He did, by the way, also on ABC. There is an element of resentment and grievance that you and I very well recognize from the former president. And we do know that motivates some voters. It certainly is a way to fire up base voters. What it probably doesn't do, though, is change these anxious, nervous, panicked Democrat lawmakers. Whether it's going to sway them. I think that's an entirely different question, but it was so telling, Jim, to hear Biden say, it's driving me crazy listening to all this. He's saying all the columnists and writers calling for his departure that he doesn't care about what they're saying, but he clearly does. And he should pay attention to what they're saying. They're making cogent arguments.",

And Tom, you know, one of the things I want to ask you about is basically, just to get your reaction to the president is -- he is defiant. It sounds like he is just dead set against getting out of this race. It looks as though the White House and the Biden campaign have basically launched a media blitz this week. He went on one of the morning talk shows this morning, fired off a letter to the Democrats up on Capitol Hill. Do you think this can work? Can this settle things down for Joe Biden?",

And if he wants to run, that's, you know, no one's saying that it's not his right to do it.But the problem is, you know, as Brian was pointing out a moment ago, so much of what he's saying now is about him. And that's not really what this is about. This isn't, you know, some sort of personal vendetta that, you know, it's -- it almost seems like he's coming across -- like he's trying to talk to those newspapers and to some of the people on the Hill. And, you know, I think everybody has the same goal in that coalition, which is to beat Donald Trump. And when it gets down to a lot of, you know, I did this and I did that, and only I can, that's -- I think that's uncomfortable because that's not who Biden was when he ran the last time and how he's governed. And now, he's kind of really, you know, gotten -- and you saw it Friday night as well, that it was just -- you know, it's a -- if I do OK, I'll be happy.

And I talked to one House Democrat this morning who said when they come back to town things might change it. That makes me wonder whether or not the president is going to be successful in trying to put the pieces back together again.And, Tom, I mean, one of the things that I have been wondering all weekend long is if you do try to go to a brokered convention, if you do have a fractured convention, how does that help the Democrats at the end of all of that? And the president sounds as though -- I mean, he just said a short while ago in one of the other networks, hey, OK. Challenge me at the convention. What are your thoughts on that? Could that possibly blow up in their faces? I suppose there's another line of thought that says, you know what, maybe it will invigorate the Democratic Party and produce a candidate that can be Donald Trump? What do you think?",

He lied throughout that entire debate performance the other night. He's been laying low ever since. And there's been this entire I guess, you know, conversation about Project 2025.And one of the things I heard over and over again while I was off talking to folks is, why don't you guys talk more about that? This initiative by the Heritage Foundation, it's a consortium of other conservative groups working with the Heritage Foundation on this, laying out what Trump would do at a new administration. And take a look at some of the folks who would be involved. I mean, this is some of the ideas that they're talking about as part of Project 2025. And much of it involves stocking the new administration with, you know, Trump loyalists and trying to get rid of as many civil servants as possible. And then you have folks like Ben Carson, Ken Cuccinelli, Rick Dearborn, Johnny McEntee, Stephen Miller, Peter Navarro. The list goes on and on. People who were involved with the Trump administration who were involved in Project 2025. And you know, there are a lot of critics out there who say, why don't you guys cover that?

      "sentences": "I think the answer is all of the above. And there has actually been quite a bit of news coverage of Project 2025. There will be more, I'm sure, in the weeks to come, even though Trump is trying to distance himself from it.Ironically, Project 2025 is a forward-looking plan that many conservatives are very much on board with. It's actually a plan for the future. The critique of Biden right now is that he's stuck in the past, talking about his past accomplishments. So, ironically, Project 2025, even though it scares a lot of liberals, it's actually a forward-looking plan. Biden would benefit from talking more about what Trump is proposing, what the Heritage Foundation wants to do, and to contrast that with his own plans for the future, rather than talking about the past. I think in terms of the media critique, right now, it's an unprecedented crisis to the Democratic Party. This has never happened before in our lifetime. The idea of this elderly man, whether he should step aside, whether he should step down. We're in uncharted territory, so it's a major, major media story. But there's, of course, many, many months to come -- not months, the many weeks to go in this campaign. Trump will continue to be scrutinized. And here's, I think, the bigger story, Jim. This is not just about Biden, it's not just about Trump, it's about the American gerontocracy. It's about elderly people running the government and most younger voters being sick and tired of it. The average 30, 30, 40, 50, 60-year-old does not want 80-year-olds running the government. That's the story here. Biden's a part of the story. Right now, it's Biden's turn to be scrutinized by his own party. But Trump would also be one of the oldest presidents in -- you know, in memory. So, I think the bigger story here is about the gerontocracy and that should be coming through in the news coverage.",

You told us to watch what would happen Friday night, and twice that's gone really badly.They're acting as if the president, you know, seeming to be having problems, health problems or concentration problems isn't a real story. And of course, it's going to get covered. As Brian said, it's an unprecedented crisis.

We have behind us a French National Assembly that is very divided, much more fractured than it was before these elections.Of course, the headline last night was that the far-right had been kept from power in the second round of voting. But that left-wing alliance that kept them out of power, that became the biggest group in the assembly here is itself extremely fractured. There are going to be all kinds of negotiations going on behind the closed doors about how and whether the left can agree, even on what candidate it would like to put forward as a potential next prime minister. For the time being, Emmanuel Macron has asked Gabriel Attal, the current prime minister, just to stay on. He tried to give his resignation this morning. He's asked him to stay on as a sort of caretaker prime minister in the hope that that'll bring some stability to the government until the parliament can figure out exactly what it's doing. But just a reminder, out there, you can see on the National Assembly the signs, we're 18 days away, Jim, from the start of the Paris Olympics. And these are Olympics that are likely to happen at this stage in scenes of extreme political chaos with questions about who the prime minister will be by the time they begin, Jim.",

The company not really saying all that much this morning, only that it has reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice.Here are the terms of that deal according to the government. Boeing's being signed $487 million, the maximum fine allowed by law, according to the Department of Justice. The government will also be appointing an independent compliance monitor to see -- oversee Boeing over the next three years. That monitor will give reports to the court each year. But the biggest part of this is Boeing agreeing to plead guilty to criminal charges. Remember, this is for the 737 MAX 8 crashes, the Lion Air crash in 2018, the Ethiopian Air crash in '19, 346 people killed in those two crashes. Boeing is agreeing to plead guilty to defrauding the FAA about the MAX 8 that Boeing hid major design changes that led to the two crashes. Now, originally, Boeing was able to reach a settlement with the government to avoid criminal charges. But that deal also came with three years' probation. The January 5th door plug blowout on the Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 happened just days before that probation was set to expire. So, that made the Department of Justice look at that original deal again, ultimately triggering this new deal. Now, victims' families are calling this a sweetheart deal because they wanted Boeing to face a nearly $25 billion dollar fine for the crime. Paul Castle is the leading attorney in the civil case, and in a statement, he says, the sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing's conspiracy, 346 people died. This deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest. Of note here is that Boeing executives avoided criminal charges themselves. The Department of Justice says, this deal gives them no immunity, though, and that applies to the MAX 8 crashes as well as the door plug incident. So, that is something that we could see continue unfolding here, Jim.",

Biden is resisting calls to take a cognitive test. And some lawmakers say it is time for both him and the former president, Donald Trump, to do so.Joining me now CNN medical analysts and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University Dr. Jonathan Reiner. Dr. Reiner, great to see you over the weekend. You tweeted at this point, what is the rationale for not supporting a formal cognitive evaluation of the president and the former president? What do you think? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST AND PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY:  I think we really should see that. This is the oldest pair of candidates for president that have ever run. And while, you know, you can make an argument that in older people without any symptoms, cognitive testing is not necessarily required, and that is really the conclusion of the United States Preventive Task Force, you can also now make an argument that both candidates have shown symptoms potentially of cognitive decline. And for the president that was manifest most dramatically at the debate 10 days ago. Look, when I see a person walk up a flight of stairs, stop midway, clutch their chest and have to sit down, you know, I don't know what's going on there, but I would suggest that perhaps they get a stress test and see a cardiologist. And when I see an older person, you know, struggle with language or to complete a thought, it makes me wonder whether they do have some evidence of mild, you know, cognitive impairment or early dementia. Maybe, maybe not, but that's worth a look. And as the commander-in-chief of the United States military and the CEO of this government, it seems like we should probably rule that out if there are symptoms.",
