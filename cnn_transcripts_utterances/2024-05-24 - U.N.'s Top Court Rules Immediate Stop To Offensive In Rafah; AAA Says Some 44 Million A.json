The court says Israel has one month to submit a report on its progress in the matter. But is the ruling even enforceable? We'll discuss. Also ahead, here in the United States, it's the unofficial start to summer -- forty-four million Americans are taking to the skies and roads for Memorial Day. We'll take you to one of the world's busiest airports live. And later, chance encounter. She left the house for a hike. Moments later, she met the love of her life. That story, just ahead. And a warm welcome. We are live in New York. I'm Paula Newton, and you are watching ONE WORLD. And we begin with what could be a pivotal moment, not only in the Israel-Hamas war, but in the eyes of the international community. The United Nations top court is ordering Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah, and to report back to the court within one month of its progress. Now, the ruling is part of the wider case that South Africa brought to the International Court of Justice against Israel under the Genocide Convention, the ICJ citing, quote, exceptionally grave developments. They said that the humanitarian situation in Rafah has seriously deteriorated since its last hearing in March, and can now be classified as disastrous. And the court says it's not convinced that Israel has taken sufficient measures to alleviate the, quote, immense risk to which the Palestinian population has been exposed. Now, meantime, the Israeli military says it has recovered the bodies of three people killed by Hamas on October 7th. The victims were identified as Hanan Yablonka, Michel Neissenbaum, and Orian Hernandez. Two of them were, in fact, attacked at the Nova music festival, and one was killed as he was picking up his granddaughter. According to the IDF, the bodies were recovered in a joint overnight operation with Israel's domestic security agency. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Jerusalem as he's been following all of the latest developments. To that court ruling first, give us an indication of how Israel is reacting, and not just the politicians. I mean, I'm quite curious, given the moves of the ICJ and earlier in the week the International Criminal Court, has this served to actually bolster the war cabinet of Benjamin Netanyahu?",

That is certainly a sense that existed before October 7th. It is one that has only been amplified in recent months as international criticism of Israel's war effort in Gaza has heightened. But that being said, it is also an indication of just how much Israel is being increasingly isolated on the world stage between the ICC decision to seek arrest warrants for the Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister at the beginning of the week, and the ICJ, the International Court of Justice, today ordering Israel to halt this military offensive in Rafah. Now, Israeli officials are already discarding this ruling by the ICJ, showing no indication that Israel will comply with what is indeed a legally binding ruling. But it is one where the International Court of Justice has no enforcement mechanism to actually ensure that Israel is complying with its order. What could happen though is that multiple other countries, European countries for example, could seek to impose sanctions on Israel if it disregards this ruling by the ICJ. So this isn't just a symbolic measure, but one that could actually have an impact on Israel.",

Many across the country are starting a three-day weekend. That often means outdoor fun, of course, the cookout, swimming, and, of course, travel. AAA says some 44 million Americans will travel this weekend. Many will be flying, like those folks you see there at the Atlanta airport, but most, in fact, will be hitting the roads. In fact, the Auto Club says it expects to see the highest number of travelers since it started keeping track back in 2000. Now, in the central and eastern United States, meantime, those celebrations may have to be held indoors. A line of severe storms could bring hail, damaging wind, and possibly tornadoes. However, across the Gulf Coast, it is the heat that could be making things outside unbearable. We are looking at all those angles, and we've got Derek Van Dam tracking severe weather. But we begin with Ryan Young at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airport. What are you seeing right now there with those travelers? Things still running smoothly, as far as you can tell. RYAN YOUNG, CNN SR. U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Things are running smoothly, but they're already breaking records. And I'm talking about record numbers of people coming through this airport. Over 111,000 people went through this airport TSA checkpoint alone yesterday. And already this morning, they've broken the morning numbers when it comes to travelers going through here. More than about 40,000 people going through so far. You can see the lines. And look, they are prepared for this. All lines are open. But you're not even seeing the international travelers where we are right now. When you talk about the 3.5 million Americans who are going to be traveling all across this country, this is pre-pandemic numbers. 2019, some people calling this revenge travel because they want to get out. They want to experience getting ready for the summer. I talked to one family that says it was tough budgeting for this because obviously things are more expensive these days. But at the same time, they wanted to be out. But take a listen to these travelers who said they are excited to get on the road and get in the skies to go on their trip. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This was part of his outreach toward black voters, minority voters, Hispanic voters, and Trump in this rally really spoke to what he felt was the issues that concern these communities. And yes, this is a Democratic part of the country in a very Democratic state, but Trump is trying to reach these communities in swing states, as well. He has made similar outreaches to African American communities in Detroit, in Atlanta, to Hispanic voters in Nevada and Arizona. So, this is part of his effort to drive a wedge between Democrats and one of their traditional bedrocks of their voting base. And there is -- suggestions in the polling that it is working so far.",

What we've been seeing is that there's really two frame of thoughts when people arethinking about this mission and what international intervention looks like in Haiti. On one side, you have folks who, yes, they may be living in Haiti, but they have foreign passports, they're able to travel to other countries if need be. And then also, you have folks that fall under that same umbrella that are part of the diaspora, that have an outsized influence on how policy is shaped and how the interactions in Haiti happen. So, those are the folks that you really see that are protesting any type of intervention, whether it's U.S.-led, led by one of the core group nations, such as Canada, France, or Brazil. And then on the other side, you have the folks who are in Haiti who live their day-in-day-lives there. They do not have the luxury to be able to get on a flight to head to the D.R. or head to Miami or head to New York. And they are the ones that we have spoken to. We have our own team that's in Haiti that is very clear in saying that they need help. Now, I understand that intervention, whether it's, you know, a Kenyan-led intervention, U.S.-led, whoever it is, that there are complications to that due to the historical experiences that folks have had with Haiti and foreign intervention. However, the common thread for all of these people that, despite that, before any progress can happen in the country is that we need to have stability. There needs to be safety. There cannot be this overwhelming rush of violence where folks are not even able to go about their day-to-day lives. So, while the concerns about what the implications for any type of foreign intervention may look like in Haiti is very valid and I understand where that's coming from, in the immediacy, this is not something that should be politicized, because there are people who are losing their lives and people who are really, in a way, they described it as an open-air prison.",

Israeli War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantzhas responded to the International Court of Justice ruling that the country must immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah. Gantz issued a statement saying they will continue with their operation in accordance with international law. Gantz also held a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken after the verdict. The ICJ ruling follows an emergency request by South Africa two weeks ago, which is part of a wider case by the country. While the court's rulings are binding and cannot be appealed, the ICJ in fact has no way of enforcing them, and they have been ignored by countries in the past. Today's decision is among a series of setbacks for Israel this week. On Monday, the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, said it was seeking arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister and defense minister, as well as top Hamas leaders. And on Wednesday, the prime ministers of Ireland, Spain and Norway said they would formally recognize the Palestinian state next week, calling it the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. Time now for the exchange, where we want to take a closer look at the implications of this ICJ ruling. Henry Lovat joins me now from Glasgow, Scotland. He's a senior lecturer in international law and politics at the University of Glasgow, and has published widely on international law issues. Good to have you here as we continue to parse what has been a very busy week on the front. You know, what material impact could this latest ruling from the ICJ have? I mean, we've already learned that it's binding, okay, but likely not enforceable. HENRY LOVAT, SR. LECTURER IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW:  Yeah, thanks for inviting me on, Paula, that is correct. We're looking at roughly four different provisional measures, as they're called. The Israel has said that contrary to what we think, it will continue as a military offensive. There is some debate, I think, as to the extent to which the wording of the first provisional measure actually allows Israel that, if you like, discretion, that wiggle room to defensively claim that their military offensive is not prohibited by the courts. There's a whole discussion there, it's not unarguable. There's a second measure about maintaining open the Rafah crossing, and there the key question, of course, is what's going to happen with Egypt, as I understand the cross is currently closed. And that's not just done to Israel. The third measure is really interesting. It's about ensuring unimpeded access to competent U.N. or competent investigative bodies that come from or authorized by the U.N. And that runs counter to Israel's traditional approach here. So that, if it materializes, will be a stage to watch. And the last is another measure to report back in one month, which I think would be expected. You know, I'm wondering what Israel's level of engagement, though, would be with any of this. And again, what material difference it would make?",

And what's also interesting so far is, I think, if you look at the team, the way Israel engaged with the initialapplication going back to January, they took it incredibly seriously, very much bringing their A-team through the Hague, and they continue to engage throughout. So, at that level, and the legal process, there's no question Israel is taking this seriously and is engaging. When it comes to the question of how will all this play out domestically in Israel, will it affect the conflict, the, you know, the military behavior, military action, that's a different question. And there, I think, it probably helps to look at this in the broader context with, as you said, the ICC application that's gone in this week and other cases around that. There's also an advisory proceeding continuing. So, all that together seems to be causing an almost rally-around-the-flag effect within Israel, certainly that's the way it's being played by Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government and so on. So, you do wonder, in that case, if despite these measures, they may not actually be making, if you like, a peaceful resolution to this conflict further off.",

We're going to be hanged regardless and let's just do what we think we need to do, kind of thing, within our understanding of the particular legal rules. And the other aspect of this is that I worry about the institutions themselves. International courts are not necessarily robust institutions. You know, you see in other contexts, these courts can cease functioning. We saw previously with the Trump administration's sanctions on the ICC itself. We're kind of into unknown waters here.

Legally, most institutions now have been impotent against a terror organization. And I go to the case of ISIS. That was a terror organization that was met with brutal military actions, actions that the international community said were necessary. Actions that, again, killed, injured, and yes, kept humanitarian aid from thousands of civilians. You know, people are asking, where's the equivalence there? What are the measures being taken against Hamas?",

For a start, politically, you don't have, if you like, thatcoalition to lend support and, if you like, lean into Israel and support there, helping things perhaps better. At the same time, you know, who has leverage over Hamas here? You've got to be fair -- the ICC. What you've seen Karim Khan do is what you would expect and want, right? These are the tools that are available to these institutions, but they're extremely limited. You could perhaps ask questions. Could the Israeli government have gone about things a little bit differently, perhaps a bit smarter? Are there things now that the U.S., Western Europeans, others, Egypt, Qatar might be able to do, but we're just not there. So it's, you know, there's legal tools available at the moment to address Hamas. I'm afraid we're struggling a bit.",

Now, the NCAA and thefive power conferences, which represent the teams, agreed to that each school can share up to $20 million of revenue a year with its athletes. They also reached a settlement to pay more than $2.7 billion in damages to past and current student athletes. For more on all this, Polo Sandoval joins me. Look, Polo, nothing is final in this decision yet, but how transformative could it actually be for these student athletes?",

This is still a tentative deal, albeit asignificant and groundbreaking one that has the potential to reshape the world of college sports. That is because those students are now positioned in a way that they can potentially expect, finally, to be paid for their performance by some of their universities. It's certainly a landmark deal, and we could see those payments potentially in fall of 2026. The NCAA, which is the governing body of collegiate sports, together with five major conferences, are announcing that they've reached this agreement. They described it in a statement as a, quote, \"roadmap for college sports\" and it stands to financially benefit students. As you mentioned there, the $2.7 billion that would be owed to current and former students, you're talking about those student athletes that were unable to profit from any sort of sponsorship -- any sort of deals in the past because of previous NCAA rules. But then also the other big headline grabber here, which is setting up that profit sharing, allowing some schools to share close to $20 million a year with their athletes, specifically those that are participating in Division I athletics. Now, there's still a lot of questions here, Paula How will that piece of the pie be divided, right? Like, how much will the star quarterback get compared to those who participate in some of those sports that perhaps aren't as popular? So, there's still a lot of questions to be ironed out here. But the other one that you really hit on here, which is the judge still needs to approve this. ESPN, that's been widely reporting a lot of these details, also saying that they've spoke to an anti-trust attorney that says this very well could unravel if one of these student athletes decides to join a separate deal. But again, this is all tentative. And finally, in exchange for participating in this settlement, student athletes would also agree to not present any sort of antitrust litigation against the NAACP in the future.",

You do have these students who havepreviously worked, previously performed and played sports for these universities. There will certainly be pressure and an expectation on these universities to adhere to those really important Title Nine laws that you just mentioned here. So, ultimately, these universities will have to work with the NCAA to try to form some sort of framework to make sure that students are compensated appropriately. So, I think to answer your question, there really isn't an answer quite yet. However, there will certainly be an expectation, and not only would people require that, but most importantly, the law would require for that compensation to be dealt out accordingly.",
