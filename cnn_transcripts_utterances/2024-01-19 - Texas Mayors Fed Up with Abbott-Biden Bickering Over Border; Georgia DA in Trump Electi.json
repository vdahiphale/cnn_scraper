It's about 2.5 miles of the Rio Grande and if you look right here to my left, you'll see this first fencing just went up. That's new.Then there are several layers of razor wire and it keeps on going and going. That's why we wanted to do this driving to really give you a perspective of what is going on here in this area. Now, every now and then you'll see that there are either pieces of clothing or shoes or things in between this razor wire. That's what migrants use to squeeze in between the wire to get across to the United States. All of this wire is not stopping the illegal immigration. As a matter of fact, we just learned that there's about 19 people crossing just behind us and we have video of what's happening once they arrive here to the United States. And it's actually state authorities who are arresting the individuals because I want you to take a look around. There is no border patrol in this area again because the state of Texas took over the area last week and that is the issue here that the state of Texas took over and Border Patrol doesn't have access and that's the tussle between the federal government and the state right now. And with the state government digging in their heels saying that they are not going to surrender. As you can see, this goes on for miles and miles. Now, the number of migrant apprehensions has plummeted. It was about 10,000 per day in mid-December. Now, it's about 4,000 per day. It's still high that there's still illegal immigration but it's not at that level. And I want to stop here because this will give you a sense of what migrants do to get in. Those are some blankets and some other items that are used to cross into the United States. But Boris and Brianna, there are no signs here that the state of Texas is going to give this up or in the words of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Texas does not plan to surrender to the Biden administration.",

And even when the state government intervenes, like in this case, right, the state of Texas has taken over.But that doesn't solve the problem. I'm going to continue driving because you'll just get a sense what smugglers are doing, Boris and Brianna, is they are simply going beyond this razor wire. It eventually ends. I mean, I could go on for miles and miles and you'll continue to see this fencing and multiple layers of razor wire, but it eventually ends. And that's where we have learned from law enforcement sources that smugglers are taking migrants to those areas. It ends up in residential areas. And I've talked to individuals who live in those residential areas, and that's exactly what they tell me that they're seeing. They're starting to see that that migrants are ending up there in large groups and that buses are driving into these neighborhoods to transport those migrants to processing facilities. And so, again, it is the municipalities and the individuals, the citizens, residents of these communities that end up paying the price. Back to you, guys.",

And this has really become a messy legal battle that's threatening, you know, to derail the case that's moving forward against Trump and the more than dozen co-defendants he has in Georgia.So first of all, she's trying to avoid being deposed in this divorce case between her lead prosecutor and his wife. It's But what's interesting in just filed papers in court, the wife is now producing credit card receipts that she says prove that Fani Willis and her husband, that lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, she says that these credit card statements show that Nathan Wade actually bought tickets for Willis to accompany him on at least two out of state trips. They do show that he purchased airline tickets for the two of them to Miami in October 2022, San Francisco in April 2023. Wade's wife is now saying this is proof of a romantic relationship. All of this has been swirling and a judge has scheduled a February 15th hearing to consider whether Willis should actually be disqualified for this case because of these allegations of this relationship. And, you know, all of this, guys, began earlier this month when one of the defendants in this election subversion case in Georgia, Mike Roman, he's a former Trump campaign official. He moved to disqualify Willis because of these allegations that she had an improper relationship with Wade. And on top of that, you know, this co-defendant of Trump's is alleging that this special prosecutor, Wade, actually used the money he billed to work in this case, which adds up so far to $650,000 to actually take Willis on those romantic and lavish vacations. Now, we haven't really seen any exact public proof of these accusations, but this latest filing from Wade's wife today shows these credit card statements that seem to show that Willis and Wade did travel together on at least two occasions per these credit card statements. So it has really gotten very messy, guys, on two different legal fronts. You have the divorce proceedings where Willis is being -- where she's trying to avoid being deposed. And then this could potentially all, you know, mess with the Trump legal case and his co- defendants because that judge has scheduled that February 15th hearing to see if Willis should be disqualified. So very messy right now with a lot of these accusations flying in court.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think -- thank you for having me, Boris. I think it's important that people understand that it's actually not new news that China had genetic sequence of the virus as early as December 26. So that part of the story isn't as shocking as people are making it out to be.However, what is interesting is it shows you that people in China were trying to do the right thing. They were trying to share this data on the genetic sequence of the virus, which, if we had been able to successfully process that on the U.S. side at NCBI Gen Bank, the database that the scientists uploaded it to, if we had gotten that out faster, it would have been two weeks faster at coming up with PCR tests, antigen tests, diagnostics, therapeutics, and of course, vaccines. So it's really important that we acknowledge that we could do better at perhaps automating how we prioritize what sequences get out, because this was treated like a routine research sequence. And of course, hindsight 2020, it's clear now that that was a really important sequence. At the time, it was treated just like any other entry in the database, which could have been a fly genome or anything else. So the database was built for research.",

But if you're a scientist in a country like China, even in the country like the U.S., there is some prestige associated with being first. So if a small lab had the sequence and was to ask, mother, may I, can I can I share this publicly? They might have encountered a, well, wait a minute, let the prestigious top lab in our system do it. You wait.But instead, this lab went and they probably recognized that this might be a concern. It was a new coronavirus. They didn't know if it was causing the pneumonia, but they thought it was important to get the data out and they tried their best to do so. So they weren't trying to cover it up or hide it. It was just maybe a time of chaos. And individual scientists were trying to do their best to make this data available to as many eyeballs around the world as possible.

It looks a lot like almost identical to coronaviruses that have been found since in bats.So we already know this is almost certainly a virus from nature that was brought into the market by wildlife trade. It's a multibillion dollar industry in China where they bring animals from all over that region to markets to be sold as food and they bring them as live animals. So it really looks like a bat virus that got into some intermediate host and made it to the market that way. And this sequence doesn't give you any anything new in terms of seeing that it might have been engineered or not. It's almost identical to sequences that were released later on January 12th.
