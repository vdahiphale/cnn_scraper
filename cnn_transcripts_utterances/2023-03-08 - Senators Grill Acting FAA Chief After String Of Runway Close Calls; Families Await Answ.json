So in addition to Dr. Redfield, Republicans had invited Dr. Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, to testify as well. And here's what he said. He said researchers that \"researchers, who sought to publish papers like himself in examining a lab origin, were, quote, \"facing ferociously strong headwinds' and a manufactured consensus in the scientific community on the lab leak theory.\" He described himself as a lifelong Democrat and said that he had been painted as a conspiracy theorist when he started to investigate even the possibility that Covid originated in a lab. Was potentially valuable information and time lost during that period in your view? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN &amp; DEPUTY DEAN OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BROWN UNIVERSITY: I think a lot of potentially valuable information was lost. But not so much because of the suppression of papers, which I can't comment on. As an editor of a journal, I never saw a paper come across my desk that talked about a lab or land origin of Covid. Instead where I think information was lost what was lost in those early months, in China, itself as well as in the early months in the United States. We did not know about the spread of Covid within China until long it had already started to decimate the Wuhan region. And then, as Covid migrated across the globe, we lost valuable time here in America with lack of testing, lack of data, lack of effective policies to identify who was potentially sick and to try to keep the virus out of large spread. That's where our time was deeply lost.",

But what we deserve even more is better preparedness so that we never get caught in that same situation again. We should be strengthening international cooperation to monitor for new infectious disease outbreaks. We should be strengthening international cooperation around how to handle labs, not just labs that do research but also labs that get specimens. We need to have good security protocols around that. And we should be strengthening international cooperation so that we, as a society, are ready to react if and when there is another pandemic in a way that protects our most vulnerable, that scales up testing and treatment more quickly. Watching what's going on with the H1N1 bird flu, which has not made large-scale jumps to humans, I'm deeply worried because we're setup to make all those same mistakes again. (CROSSTALK)",
