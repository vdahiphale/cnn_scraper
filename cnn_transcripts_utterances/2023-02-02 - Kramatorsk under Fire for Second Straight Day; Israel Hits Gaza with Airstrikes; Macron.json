We are live from Dubai.People desperately ran for cover for a second day in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk as Russian missiles rained down. Today's attack came after three people were killed in a strike on apartment buildings on Wednesday. Searchers are digging for anyone who may be trapped. Kramatorsk is in the eastern Donetsk region, which has been at the center of the fighting. The new strikes come on the eve of a summit between European Union and Ukrainian leaders in Kyiv. CNN's Fred Pleitgen and his crew were nearby when one of those strikes happened. And he gives us this compelling report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We had just arrived at the scene, left our vehicles, when the house in front of which our vehicle was parked, was hit by a missile strike. It was a really heavy explosion, very close by, I would say maybe 40 or 50 yards from our location. So we then went, trying to go into shelter. And as we were doing that, I turned around and you could see the second missile hitting the exact same area. We already know that there were people who were severely wounded on the ground there. It is unclear if and how many people were killed. Of, course right now there is a big rescue operation going on there. But I think it is important for our viewers to understand that this area this was in was an active search and rescue operation in a residential area. And today, the Russians targeted exactly the same area with two very heavy missiles. And this was as there was a lot of civilians on the street. We didn't see anybody in the way of military on the streets or any sort of military installations. It was right in the heart of the town of Kramatorsk. And of course, we then decided to leave that area as fast as possible after we realized the coast was clear. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That last word from officials, we have been told, that there were three people killed, eight wounded, two of them were critically, we have also got new footage from inside a nearby hospital, where some patients have been taken. And one woman who spoke to a Reuters group, briefly, from her hospital bed said that she just remembers sort of grooming her cat before she heard this extremely loud explosion. And then all of a sudden, she felt pain, she says. And in terms of the rescue operation for those who may be trapped, the local governor there says that there could be two people still trapped under the rubble. But time here is really of the essence, because we are talking about something that took place now about 20 hours ago. And if you consider that someone who may still be alive under there is very likely to be hurt, very likely to be dealing with the dust and smoke and gas from the actual missile strike, not to mention the fact that, overnight, temperatures were below freezing. And today they remain right around there as well, Eleni. So it is very difficult for anyone to survive in those kind of conditions.",

It was a little overthree weeks ago that there was not a single Western country that was willing to send tanks to Ukraine. Now there are 12 of them sending an initial round of more than 120 tanks to Ukraine in the coming months. These are complicated machines; they are expensive machines and they take a heck of a lot of training as well. And yet, countries that had previously said the answer was no, had slowly come around, all because of the leadership of Poland being the first to actually commit them. And now you have a situation where the Polish prime minister has told the German newspaper that, look, he is going to go along with whatever NATO decides on this. But he went further than the French president, he went further than the Dutch prime minister in saying that if he were making the decision on behalf of NATO unilaterally, he would want to send fighter jets to Ukraine. He thinks that they are something that they need and that would be useful on the front lines in, really, allowing Ukraine to make some inroads and actually pushing the Russians back in a really substantial way, especially ahead of this so-called spring invasion or this spring escalation that the Ukrainians have been talking about. And so, as you said, the Americans are no, the Germans are, no but now that the Poles are yes, we will have to see whether or not anyone's tune on this actually changes.",

Therewas a rocket fired from Gaza toward Israel, as far as we understand there were no injuries. There was some shrapnel that damaged a road. And then Israel, as it has been doing recently in its policy now for quite some time, any rocket that gets launched from Gaza, even if it doesn't cause any major damage or cause any injuries, they respond some way. And so they respond at this time with airstrikes. They say that they struck, what they called, a storage facility and weapons manufacturing site. We don't have any reported injuries from Israel or Gaza. In Gaza we do have some reports of a fire and some homes damaged and the Palestinian servicing some agricultural sites were targeted as well. This is actually the second exchange of fire between Gaza militants and the Israeli military just in the past week. The last round happened on Thursday evening after the Israeli military raid in Jenin in a similar situation outcome, rockets fired and airstrikes, no reported injuries on either side. But an interesting development in the last few hours on the diplomatic side of things is that we have heard from Hamas, that their senior leaders are actually headed to Cairo right now to meet with the Egyptians. We know that Secretary Blinken had specifically gone to Egypt before coming to Israel on the West Bank and he had requested the Egyptians to get involved, which they historically have been very much involved in trying to calm the situation between Israelis and Palestinians. And so it is definitely a sign that the Hamas chief is headed to Cairo. On the other part of the diplomatic activity that is affecting this region, the Jordanian king is supposed to be having a lunch with President Joe Biden in Washington, D.C. Jordan, historically, is also very much involved in negotiations here. They're also the traditional custodians of the holy site in Jerusalem, the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as the Temple Mount. So I'm sure the Israeli-Palestinian situation is coming up. And as you noted, Benjamin Netanyahu is currently in the air on his way to Paris to have a working dinner with Emmanuel Macron. From what we've heard from the Israelis, Benjamin Netanyahu, his top priority is going to be discussing Iran. He didn't even mention the Palestinians. Macron did mention that in what they plan to focus on. But for Benjamin Netanyahu, even in this latest round of violence, he is trying to keep the focus on Iran, keep the focus not necessarily on what is happening internally here. Eleni.",

And keeping that in mind, yes, the IMF delegation isn't done. It was supposed to have reviewed the current program back in November. But the finance minister has made certain changes, certain strong austerity measures to ensure that this IMF loan does come in.
