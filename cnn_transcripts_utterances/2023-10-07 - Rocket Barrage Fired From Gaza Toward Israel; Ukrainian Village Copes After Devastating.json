Potentially other fronts as well, they are getting themselves prepared. We should expect a very intense air response to what is happening in Gaza, airstrikes in the Gaza Strip.

Two killed, dozens wounded when the city of Kharkiv was hit early Friday. The Ukrainians say this was the work of the same type of missile that killed more than 50 in a village close by just a day earlier. Anatoliy Androsovych tells me pretty much every family in Hroza lost someone. His brother and his brother's wife also among the dead. I just heard the explosion, looked at the dust and realized my brother, Nikola (ph), was there he says. They identified the bodies. Their son went to pick them up. We will bury them tomorrow. The plot for their burial already marked at the local cemetery, close to the fresh grave of the soldier whose wake the victims were attending at a local cafe when the missile struck. At the attack site, crews already clearing the debris. The authorities here quickly realized that they weren't going to find any more survivors underneath debris. And you can see here this has now gone from being a search and rescue to being a recovery operations with the teams here searching for human remains. Amidst the belongings of those killed littering an adjacent playground, police officers catalog what they believe are parts of the powerful Iskander missile that annihilate the building. Nearly a third of Hroza's residents lost their lives here. Those who are left shocked and grieving. 73-year-old Valentina Kozienko lives right next to the site. \"I knew all of them,\" she says. \"They are all from here, all from our village\" -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Hroza, Ukraine.

We ourselves, sitting in the studios in Jerusalem, have heard what might be interceptions or impacts from rockets in and around Jerusalem. That is unusual because Jerusalem is usually kept out of these rocket conflicts. What is really unprecedented that is happening this morning is these infiltrations. That is I think where the real danger is. The Israeli military has confirmed that there have been infiltrations from Palestinian militants, likely from Gaza, into communities in southern Israel. We have seen videos of militants on the backs of pickup trucks, on the streets, shooting at the streets, shooting in civilian neighborhoods. We do not have confirmed reports of how many infiltrations there have been and how they arrived, whether they were already in Israel laying in wait. This was clearly coordinated, this happened, the rockets happening at the same time as these infiltrations. There have been at least 100 reported injuries, at least according to two hospitals in Israel. We know of at least one fatality. But there are likely to be more. The Israeli military have declared a state of war alert. They have called up reservists. We have just heard from the defense minister saying that the Hamas terrorist organization has made a grave mistake this morning, launching a war against the state of Israel, saying the state of Israel will win this war. The Hamas militant group has named this operation the Al-Aqsa Storm. They claim they fired thousands of rockets. They're calling up all Palestinians, saying that if you have a gun, get it; get out with trucks, cars, axes, telling everyone to come out. They are connecting this operation directly to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as Temple Mount, one of the holiest places here in Jerusalem for both Muslims and Jews. What is unusual is that there hasn't been a clear trigger point. There has not been an Israeli police raid on the compound this past week. There has been no capturing of a senior militant person that we have seen, that would typically trigger this sort of massive action. But now we should expect a massive Israeli military response, toward the militants in Gaza.
