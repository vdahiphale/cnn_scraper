But logic tells you they're going to discuss the case. The defense will start receiving all of the discovery in this case. Now, sort of hanging out there is an application for bail. And I've been told by the court that they do not believe that today, the defense will be asking for bail. They probably haven't even gotten all the information that they need. But you never know what is going to come up at a hearing. You never know. That's why it's so important to be in the courtroom to be right here. Now, we do know that the estranged wife of Rex Heuermann, Asa Ellerup, she's been dealing with so much at her home because of the execution of the search warrant. And things were in such disarray because they are trying to find potential forensic evidence. Anything that can link the defendant in this case with the victims being in that home. We also know through her attorney who spoke with CNN, that there has been communication between Asa Ellerup and her husband, jailhouse phone calls. Now, the attorney also says that is very well-known they are recorded. There is no privacy in a jail at all. So it's just generalities that she never brought up anything about the accusations or about the charges at all. One other thing to note that the civil attorney for Ms. Ellerup said to CNN was that in regard to her filing for divorce, that this was not a symbol of guilt or innocence, that she is trying to protect herself right now. And he said that there may be financial civil cases that are filed and this is her moment to protect herself and her children. And by the way, no siding at all of his estranged wife and their children today at this courthouse.",

And so, the fact that they haven't had contact with his wife to this point, Brianna, does not preclude, of course, the fact that they may look to interview her at some subsequent point. But it establishes to me that they don't need her per se to establish anything in connection. They believe based upon everything else they have from cell towers, to DNA evidence to, you know, just witness information and other things that at the end of the day, they could establish this in her absence.

I know a lot of people look at that and say, how could a spouse not have any idea that their husband was a serial killer? But is it normal for that to be the case? SCOTT BONN, CRIMINOLOGIST, PH.D.: Well, thanks for having me on, Brianna. And it -- this actually is not surprising at all. A serial killer like this, who I believe is highly organized, a psychopath, and probably what's known as a malignant narcissist is able to compartmentalize. He's a chameleon. He's invisible in plain sight so he is able to very convincingly function, not only in public, but even at home.

Certainly, Gilgo Number Four, I suspect, there'll be a charge there soon.But to your question of whether there are potentially other burial grounds and other bodies, I think it's a distinct likelihood. More likely than not, in fact. And the reason why is the original Gilgo Four were discovered in December 2010. And two of those four actually went missing just a few months before they were discovered. So, it's very unlikely that he made a rational choice to just stop killing because individuals like this have a compulsion. It's an inner drive, a visceral hunger to kill that they can't control. So, what is sadly and unfortunately, more likely, is that he's simply moved his base of operations, and there are probably bodies yet to be discovered elsewhere.",

He'll call them election interference. And they'll also be going after Special Counsel Jack Smith directly arguing that they're focusing a lot of their attention on Donald Trump, but the Justice Department is not spending enough time looking into President Biden.

The fact that it took so long to collect the evidence and bring charges. And remember, there were a lot of people, including the state authorities in Georgia, who were critical of the DOJ for not moving quicker on the January six indictment. And the fact that it has taken them this long and that we're now in a place in July, the year before an election year with the elections are right around the corner, on August -- with the elections right around the corner next year, it's going to make it very difficult, I think for the justice department. Number one, to conduct a trial before the election. As I said, I think it's virtually impossible that that happens. And that of course, in turn, will raise all sorts of other complications about if Trump wins the election, he likely well, just wreck -- direct that the charges be dismissed. If he were convicted, somehow he could pardon himself possibly or try to do so. So, it raises a host of complications that they could have avoided if they had moved just a little bit quicker on this case.",
