This is, in fact, his furthest trip from the capital, Kyiv, since the war began. He's extending the reach of his diplomacy; we saw it yesterday, speaking to Arab league leaders, telling them not to believe Russia is propaganda, not to turn a blind eye to it that Russia is the aggressor, not as Russia would have.Its Arab friends believe that Russia is the victim. So, an important meeting for Zelenskyy. Today, when he sits down with the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, because Modi has yet to come out and say what all the other G7 leaders have said, that Russia is undertaking a war of aggression, that it's invaded a peaceful neighbor, that also run, India rather, is importing Russian oil -- none of the other G7 members, of course, are doing that. So, you know, the landscape will have a chance here face to face with Modi to say, Look, you need not to support Russia in this way. By buying their oil, you were helping keep the war going. So, I think this is Zelenskyy's opportunity to broaden through some of the other invitees at the G7. His message of Support Ukraine, if not support us directly, don't enable Russia. That's going to be a message. And I think when he speaks to Narendra Modi, as well, who's going to be hosting in Delhi in September, the G20 meeting, obviously, is the Lansky is looking into these big forums, international forums where he can be invited to speak to put his views across, frankly, but it's the G7 where he's going to get the real support and no surprise, it was meeting with a British Prime Minister today who's been at the forefront of efforts to get Ukrainian fighter pilots trained on F-16. That goes back to February this year. Just a couple of days ago, the U.K. Prime Minister along with his Dutch counterpart as well, initiating an effort to get a an international training program and purchase program for F-16 is going. So, Zelenskyy lining up friends and allies and partners to aid his voice around the table at the G7 for these critical military things, F-16s that he needs.",

First, they see the political dysfunction in the U.S. And usually, the U.S. is the force of stability, now they fear it could be a potential force of instability. The President's been trying, including today to say, don't worry, we've got this, we're going to work it out, we're not going to default.At the end of the day, if it just turns into a hard negotiation, but it all works out, then I think it'll be pretty well forgotten around here. What won't be forgotten is that he was the president was supposed to go down and be the first American President to visit the Pacific Islands, and to try to gather those countries together in a coalition that would help the U.S. keep access to the South China Sea, an area where the Chinese have been extremely competitive and have been putting their military forces in as well. So, that's a big lost opportunity, it's going to be hard to sort of convince them that he's serious about this if he needs to go back and, and deal with the debt crisis.

I'm also proud that -- of the work we've done with our partners of the -- of the ASEAN and Pacific Islands.

Remember, President Biden has sent Vice President Harris, along with other of his representatives to Africa. Other countries are really trying to compete with China as they try to expand their world power. So, one of the stated goals of this trip is basically to figure out ways that these groups, including the Quad, which President Biden have spent a lot of time with both in-person and virtually way so they can continue to counter China, a big, big goal of the president. So, we expect to see him talk more about that but, of course we heard those apologies as he won't be able to go to Australia and he won't be able to go to Papa New Guinea, because he has to come back here and deal with the debt ceiling.
