The state Supreme Court just issued a historic decision on abortion, which could enforce some of the most extreme restrictions in the country, and it could have far-reaching consequences for reproductive rights. Today, the justices ruled that the state must adhere to a 123-year-old law that bans nearly all abortions, though there is an exception in the case of saving the life of the mother.It does not have any exceptions for rape or incest, but it does have exceptions for abortion. It is a punishment for abortion providers between two and five years in prison. We have CNN's Paula Reid. We have Natasha Chen as well standing by with the latest developments. Let's start with you, Natasha. Walk us through what is in this ruling.",

This is far from the end of the debate on reproductive freedom. And I look forward to the people of Arizona having their say in the matter.It goes on to say, and let me be completely clear, as long as I am attorney general, no woman or doctor will be prosecuted under this draconian law in this state. So you can imagine, there is still going to be quite a bit of confusion going forward, even though this ruling was supposed to clarify the confusion in the state, the attorney general there saying that she won't prosecute and she's referring to a citizen ballot initiative where they're still gathering signatures in hopes to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution.",

Obviously, the White House in their efforts to retake the White House in November has made reproductive rights one of the pillars of their campaign. The president describing this decision as cruel, extreme and dangerous. He's pledging that he and Vice President Kamala Harris will continue the fight for abortion rights.He's blaming the extreme agenda of Republican lawmakers for this. Let's bring in Paula Reid, because Paula, obviously this is a drawn out process and it's not exactly clear how things are going to change. We're going to go, given that the attorney general has pledged that she's not going to enforce this law. So ultimately, what happens next? PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: So in terms of the process, there's certainly a role, as the governor just said, for the state legislature to rewrite a new law. We've seen in other states where similar things have happened. For example, in Wisconsin, it was a judge that stepped in and actually said, no, this doesn't make all abortions illegal. We know that this case is also getting kicked back down to the lower courts for additional proceedings. We also saw, for example, in Michigan, a judge, excuse me, the governor repealed a 1931 ban last spring. So there's a lot of possibilities here. But usually I'm at the table with you guys talking about Trump's legal problems. And I can tell you that this case and those like it will have a far greater impact on Trump's chances for reelection than any of his criminal cases. This is an issue that we've seen motivates voters. We're seeing this in a swing state. Just yesterday, the former President Trump said when it comes to abortion, he wants to leave it up to the states. Well, this is that inaction. And the former President, back when he was a candidate in 2016, he surprised a lot of people with just how adept he was at attracting a lot of pro-life voters, evangelical Christians, because he understood and he could articulate his vision for overturning Roe v. Wade. He had a list of candidates for the Supreme Court, any vacancies that he would have. And of course, we knew he had several. He was successful in overturning Roe v. Wade. But now he's on the other side of that. And again, this is going to be an enormous challenge, far more so, I would argue, than the criminal cases he's facing.",

And we should remind people that women had the right to vote in 1920. That's when the 19th Amendment was ratified, right? So this, especially in Arizona, the optics are problematic because of just how far back in time it goes to pre-date that. I wonder, something that Natasha had reported earlier, and I wonder if you can explain to us how this will work. She said that the Attorney General has basically issued an advisory that they are not going to prosecute. And yet, when it comes to abortion providers in the state, does that really mean anything? Because you have obviously counties that can make their own call, but also depending on who may be, the AG in the future, couldn't they retroactively prosecute if they wanted to?",

This afternoon, a judge ruling that there's no reason to push back Monday's start date while Trump's appeal of the gag order in that case plays out. So that means in six days, jury selection is set to begin in Manhattan. That will kick off the first criminal trial of a former president in U.S. history. Let's talk about this now with CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Andy, do you think first the gag order is going to stand here?

The gag order is particularly narrowly tailored. I think the goal is to protect the process, to protect the witnesses and the people who work in and around the prosecution are all things that are far outside of the president's First Amendment political speech rights.The question is, how much time do prosecutors have to spend focusing on this? You know, I made this comment about a week ago when the alteration to the gag order was being discussed. I think it's highly questionable whether or not the utility that the prosecution and the court get out of the gag order are worth the delays that it imposes on the prosecution in having to face down all of these appeals and requests for accommodation and clarification and things like that. I think there's a massive distraction value here on the prosecution, and that's something we can't completely discount.",

It would be an absurd strategy for any other criminal defendant to go into a trial attacking the judge, attacking the judge's family members, using his own social media platform to constantly lob attacks at the prosecutors. This is a judge who will, likely- who will clearly sit in judgment over this case. And if the case results in a conviction, this is the person who will decide what sort of sentence Donald Trump serves.So you do not help yourself by going into a trial, angering the judge, conveying to the judge that you are someone who doesn't fight fair, someone who doesn't really embrace the sanctity of the legal process and the respect that it deserves. So it's a crazy strategy. But we know that Donald Trump is looking at this trial. Not just as a matter of freedom or incarceration, but as a matter of politics. And it is his political brand to stand up and throw punches and say crazy things. And so he's going to do that as long as he considers it to be politically viable. We might see, though, this political strategy running headlong into his legal strategy, and that could really result in a tough situation for him.",

      "sentences": "You know, the filing is, as we've seen from all the special counsel's filings on this matter, it is eloquent, it is direct, and it pulls no punches. I think the legal theories are very similar to those that we've seen them put in front of the trial court, where they won, and then, of course, in front of the appellate court in the D.C. Circuit, where they also won a resounding victory across the entire panel, a unanimous panel who voted on their behalf. So it's not surprising we're seeing the same legal arguments. We're seeing a very strong reliance on the history around this issue, the fact that nowhere in our Constitution or in the comments of the framers did anyone ever even consider that the president should be above the law and not subject to legal scrutiny and to the checks and balances that we embrace in our form of government.I thought it was also particularly adept how they point out that the sort of immunity he is arguing for, and his reason for doing so, which is Donald Trump says that if without immunity presidents would be essentially, it would be impossible for them to make tough decisions because they'd always be worried about being held accountable. I think the special counsel does a great job of showing the opposite side of that argument, which is it's a good thing in this country that our leaders, even at the highest level, are also accountable to the same criminal laws as everyone else. And the fact is, we've had many, many, many presidencies in which all kinds of hard and troubling decisions have been made under immense pressure, and none of those presidents so far have suffered any of the impediments to decision-making that Donald Trump has complained about at his filing. So it's a fascinating read if you have time, and an incredibly important issue. We'll see how the court decides it.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Brianna, Boris, it has to. You know, I think that we've evolved as a society and we've seen that evolution in this very prosecution where everyone needs to be held accountable. Parents can make a difference. Parents in this case could have made a huge difference with respect to  looking at any warning signs. How is your child doing? What, if anything, can I do to prevent something like this?Should I get someone a gun who clearly has some issues that have not been overcome? And so we're in a different world. And I think part of this whole thing, Brianna, is when you look at sentencing, it's punishment, it's deterrent, and then less to a lesser degree, it's rehabilitation. Parents, and in this case, the Crumblys were punished for conduct that was what they could have done and misdoing. And if they had not, right, engaged in such negligence, perhaps we wouldn't be having this conversation. That's the message. Deterrent, to your very point. Deterring others, right, from engaging in anything like this, to seeing and looking at the warning signs. And so, yes, I think there's a space everywhere, not only in this jurisdiction, but throughout the country to do better. And I think as a result of this prosecution, you're going to see parents doing much better as it relates to, look, you don't know exactly everything your kids are doing, of course not. But if there are obvious signs that you miss and you don't take and it comes to this, then yes, there needs to be accountability. That's what happened here. And I think there will be preventative deaths moving forward as a result of what we saw today and as a result of the convictions we saw of the mom in February and the father in March.",

It didn't really appear that he had obvious contrition. He spoke about a deeper truth that the courtroom didn't get into, that the proceedings didn't allow his defense to get into.

And I think my answer is, you know, the ones who are really hurting and harmed and who had a lot to say were those who made the victim impact statements. And those who lost so much at the hands of the Crumblys. Trials are about truth, and it's the jury that makes the determination as to what that truth is. How? By assessing the facts, by assessing what the conduct, what the misconduct, what the lack of conduct, what have you.And so the father could say what the father wants. The reality is, is he had his due process, and that due process consisted of numerous witnesses. It consisted of his attorney having the ability to cross- examine, and the jury spoke volumes. And so I think ultimately the judge here, Boris, was fair and didn't penalize him to the extent that she could have as a result of his disconnect, as a result of his not fessing up. What is an apology if it doesn't have teeth and meaning? And when you're trying to wiggle and shake out of accountability, that's exactly what it is. It's a toothless apology. And so the judge, I think, was very fair and proportional in sentencing and could have really maxed him out, right, 15 in a determinative sentence, instead giving  him 10 to 15, you know, which I thought was appropriate, and really overlooking what you note to be the posture, and certainly something that he just is not getting to this day.",
