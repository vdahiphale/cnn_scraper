I reported several times on Oceangate while working in Seattle, including a piece in 2018 about this vessel, about the \"Titan\" before its first expedition to the \"Titanic.\"I was struck by not just how cramped the vessel actually was but also some of the simple, almost rudimentary technology on board. It was pirated, this vessel, with a gaming controller, effectively a PlayStation controller. Yet the company told me they were extremely confident that they could safely use this vessel to go on such an expedition, 13,000 feet down into the ocean. And that the \"Titan\" could handle 150 million pounds of pressure at the ocean floor, largely because of its carbon fiber structure. Oceangate, the folks there, said they worked with NASA and Boeing to design this vessel. They didn't cut any corners when it came to cost and safety. That said, we have learned the \"Titan\" has had communication issues in the past last year. The crew on board during an expedition lost communication with their support crew on the surface of the ocean because they were relying on messages -- they didn't have GPS under water. So a lot of questions remain as to what went wrong here.",

There's a lot of mystery surrounding it. And of course, embellishment by Hollywood and various movies. And having gone to a trade show and met somebody that was actually on one of these dives, she described it in a way that -- you know, you can hear all you want, you can see the movies. But when you get down and the bow of the shift appears with rust icicles coming off it, you now have a tangible feeling that goes right to the core of the human spirit.

For instance, I was reading, its communication is basically a one-text message system. One system. Doesn't appear to be a failsafe. I don't know if transponders are possible at this depth. It would give you some sort of passive communication if you go missing. But you run sea dives. Does this have the safety measures that you would have in place?",

Wouldn't be the same. The risk is much greater at these depths.We look at the structure of this vessel, being carbon fiber, titanium. And we have to know the people inside it, there have to be certain safety measures. Reading on the \"Titan\" vessel, there are several systems in place, should something fail, the vessel would automatically begin an ascent to the surface. It can't race to the surface. We cannot forget the physics involved here. That would be a risk. We're not designed, created to put our face in the water and breathe, and yet we're going to these great depths. I could argue that the risk of it is acceptable. The human spirit, the quest for improving and learning, the very endeavor, I think that drives us to do that. So part of me says, yes, we have to go, but there have to be safeguards. So, what are the safeguards on this particular vessel? What has proven, what has been the tests performed? Its rated depth is just over 13,000 feet. That is well within the \"Titanic's\" depth range at 12,500. Not a big margin when you think about it.",

Those are misdemeanor charges.And as part of this agreement, one source tells us the prosecutors, that Trump appointee, has agreed to recommend to the judge that there be probation. So no jail time for Hunter Biden. Now, another part of this deal is that he is charged with a gun possession charge, that is possessing a gun while addicted to controlled substances. He's been very public about his addiction. And that will be diverted. Meaning, if he meets certain criteria and conditions and abides by them for the next 24 months, that that charge will disappear and go away. Hunter Biden's attorney has said -- issued a statement saying, \"I know Hunter believes it's important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\" And the next steps here will be that this case will be assigned to a judge and the judge will set the date for Hunter Biden's arraignment. That's when he'll come and appear in the courthouse behind me and say exactly what he did in committing these crimes. At some point further down the road is when the judge will sentence him. And while this U.S. attorney's office here is making this recommendation, according to our sources, for probation, it will ultimately be up to the judge to decide what the sentence will be -- Boris?",

What do you make of this? BARRON-LOPEZ: So to Manu's point, they're saying this is a two-tiered justice system, when these are very different case, whether it's the charges are being brought against the former president and those being brought against Hunter Biden. This is something that, also when McCarthy was being pressed by reporters today in the capitol about what exactly -- what type of charges would he have been happy with or would he think would create an equal justice system. And the speaker dodged. He wouldn't answer that and repeated the line of a two-tiered justice system. I was just texting with a Republican pollster who did a recent focus group, who said that, among swing voters -- and they said that those swing voters had started to mention Hunter Biden a bit more in the focus group. And ultimately, they were kind of using it as permission to maybe return to voting for former President Trump over President Biden. But that pollster noted that it's not widespread at all among these swing voters. And I was also talking to a Democratic pollster today who was saying that they really don't think this is going to have that big of an impact on moderate voters, on those voters at the margins going to ultimately decide the election.",
