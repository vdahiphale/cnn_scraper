The former president has steadfastly denied it. His lawyer, Joe Tacopina, has just wrapped up a two-day cross-examination of Carroll. His line of questioning focused in part on Carroll's shopping trips, media interviewers, her book, and a 2012 episode of \"Law and Order SVU\".

And she responded saying, look, yes, I like the show, and, yes, I made jokes about having sex with Donald Trump. Then he went on to press an issue that he has pressed repeatedly here which is, look, you have an advice column where you advise women who have been assaulted to report their assault, but that's not what you did. And they presented different columns that she had written. And she said, quote, I would never call the police for something I was ashamed of. And they also tried to draw discrepancies between how she describes her life in interviews as being, quote, fabulous, but then talked about how much she was suffering here in court. And she said, I don't want anybody to know that I suffer. Now, arguably, the whole trial is riding on her testimony and Joe Tacopina's ability to undermine the credibility of her story.",
