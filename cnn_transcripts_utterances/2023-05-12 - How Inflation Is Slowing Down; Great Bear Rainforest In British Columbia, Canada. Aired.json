      "sentences": "The inflation fire hasn`t been put out, but it does increasingly look contained. Consumer prices jumping by 4.9%year over year in April. That is the smallest increase in exactly two years. There have now been 10 consecutive months of cooling price gains. Unfortunately, though, the pace of the improvement has slowed. It`s basically leveled out even though it`s currently at a level that is more than twice what the Fed is targeting. Now, on a month over month basis, inflation actually heated up between March and April, though, a lot of that was driven by a spike in used car prices and that spike is not expected to last. I`m digging to the report, there were definitely some positives here, a record price drop on an annual basis for major appliances. And for health insurance on an annual basis, used car prices are actually down. Grocery prices, they`re still going up rapidly, but even that has cooled off. On the other hand, car insurance is up more than 15% over the last year. So if you put it all together, inflation is clearly moving in the right direction. But the pace of the progress has slowed. And it`s still too early to declare victory on inflation. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The westernmost province of Canada is British Columbia, defined by its mountain ranges and Pacific coastline. Let`s head to British Columbia now to the Great Bear Rainforest, where the indigenous First Nation community has taken steps to protect their land, marine and wildlife, which includes an extraordinary sighting of a white bear or spirit bear. These protections have impacted the ecosystem and the community`s livelihoods in just a few short years. Our Bill Weir gives us a tour from that stunning region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
