The former president has been trying to get all of the court cases against him either delayed or dismissed. Separately, Trump is facing additional scrutiny today after a major new report on his handling of nuclear secrets. ABC News saying, quote: \"Months after leaving the White House, Trump allegedly discussed potentially sensitive information about U.S. nuclear submarines with a member of his Mar-a-Lago club, an Australian billionaire, who then allegedly shared that information with scores of others.\" That sensitive information allegedly included the exact number of nuclear warheads that U.S. submarines typically carry and exactly how close U.S. subs can get to Russian subs without being detected. Trump allegedly made that disclosure to Anthony Pratt, the head of U.S.-based Pratt Industries, one of the world's largest packaging companies. Here is how Trump described him back in 2019.

He definitely did things his own way.And so I think, to some folks, they hear this and they are not necessarily surprised by it. But I think that we should be concerned about it because him leaking this to an Australian billionaire is one thing, but what if that got into the hands of someone that did not have our nation's best interests? And we've heard the reports, too, that Mar-a-Lago is crawling with folks from nations like China and other things, undercover spies, who are trying to get this exact type of information from the president or folks who are there. So that is what's really concerning. And I think that the evidence in this case is rock solid. But I think that voters might not necessarily understand the gravity of it, just because they're used to Trump operating in a way such as this.",

Dozens more were left injured.The strike follows an overnight drone attack in Odessa, damaging port infrastructure, trucks and a grain silo. Meanwhile, the damage is still being assessed in the small village of Hroza. More than 50 people were killed there yesterday when Russia aimed a ballistic missile as people gathered to mourn a local soldier. That building was destroyed. Hroza has no military assets. Its small population is entirely composed of civilians. CNN's senior international correspondent, Fred Pleitgen, joins us from Hroza. You have the Kremlin saying, Fred, that is not targeting civilians. But clearly, the evidence shows otherwise.",

We haven't seen troop concentrations or anything like that. It is a very small village. I can show you, once again, the extent of the damage here in Hroza. One of the things that you mentioned that's extremely important, Pamela, is that there was this second attack today in Kharkiv, which is a big city very close to here. And that used the same type of missile as the one that was apparently used on this building here, which completely destroyed the building. It's called an Iskander missile, which is a medium-range missile with a massive warhead. We can see here now that the debris has been cleared. But there is basically nothing of this building standing. There's a few walls here. You can sort of see where the impact site appears to have been where the floor has kind of given way. But other than that, this place has absolutely been reduced to rubble. And something that's a big concern to the Ukrainians where they say missiles like this obviously cause a lot of carnage among the civilian population in small places like this. But of course, also in larger places like Kharkiv, as you were talking about, which was struck today. The Ukrainians are saying the only thing that can help against this is further air defense systems for them. It's something they've been pleading for. They say that this is something that is a direct help to keep their citizens alive. We've had some pretty tragic encounters here today, Pamela. We talked to one gentleman who lost his brother and his brother's wife in the attack. But they had a list of the people who were killed here. And pretty much everybody here in this village has lost someone who was close to them. I spoke to one lady who was in tears as she spoke to me, also talking about the loved ones that she has lost. Just to put the whole thing into perspective, there were more than 50 killed here in this village. And the population of this village at the time of this attack was about 150. Ao a third of this village has been wiped out by this attack -- Pamela?",

He never admitted to pulling the trigger.

That detective said that he believed, potentially, financial gain. Finally, the district attorney told CNN that they also are well aware of those statements but they wanted to gather corroborating information before bringing a charge.
