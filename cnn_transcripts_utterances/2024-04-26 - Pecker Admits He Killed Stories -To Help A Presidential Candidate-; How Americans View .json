And Boris Sanchez is outside the courthouse in Manhattan. On this day eight of the trial, the first witness is nearing the end of his testimony. David Pecker is facing redirect by the prosecution after several hours of cross examination by Trump's defense attorney. Much of that cross detailed the former tabloid executive's history of purchasing stories so that he could bury them. Boris?",

Day eight, the first witness testimony, as you said, Wolf, nearing the end, the defense trying to highlight apparent discrepancies in David Pecker's testimony. They included what was said during a 2017 White House meeting between Donald Trump and the former publisher of the National Enquirer. You saw that image there of Pecker at the White House.We have CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid with us.

The question of whether he used that personal relationship to suppress stories to help Trump get elected, the reason prosecutors chose David Pecker as their first witness, it doesn't really speak to the accusations at the heart of the criminal charges here, but it sets the stage for the idea that there was a concerted effort that Michael Cohen and then candidate Trump were involved in to suppress negative stories.And so David Pecker was questioned about that by prosecutors. Then Trump's lawyers got a crack at him a little bit yesterday and then mostly today. And they had a few goals. The primary one, though, was to establish that this wasn't something special that they did just to help Trump get the White House in 2016, that this was business as usual, that they suppressed stories for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mark Wahlberg, so that was a big focus of their cross examination. The prosecutors are up now. They're trying to do a little bit of repair there, pointing out that, OK, you did this for other people, but did you pay $150,000 for an Arnold Schwarzenegger story the same way you paid Karen McDougal to suppress her story about an alleged affair? Well, no, we didn't. So they're trying to repair some of the damage to the case that may or may not have been done when the defense was asking David Pecker questions.",

Zooming out, Paula, the next witness will be who? REIDOne, you could call Karen McDougal if you wanted to. It seems unlikely for a lot of reasons that they will even need to do that. She doesn't really -- she's not relevant to the heart of the charges, which are about money paid to Stormy Daniels. You could also call Kellyanne Conway. She was, of course, the head of the Trump campaign at that time. And the reason her testimony would be significant is to talk about the Access Hollywood tape when it came out, very close to the election, the impact it had on the campaign, the pressure they were under, particularly when it came to stories about Trump's sex life, the incentive to maybe suppress those, that would be relevant to setting up the Stormy Daniels payment. So she's a possible witness they could call next. Hope Hicks, also a possibility, again, intimately involved with the campaign and involved in conversations with Michael Cohen and David Pecker about these hush money payments. So we haven't gotten to the real heart of the case yet. But as they walk through and set it up, these are two possibilities. They could also call someone that none of us have ever heard of to talk about paperwork, because at the end of the day, we got sex, we got politics. But really, Boris, this is a paperwork case.",

We asked voters in our brand new poll by SSRS, how is Trump being treated in the New York hush money trial? About a third, 34 percent say he's being treated more leniently than others would be. About roughly the same here, 34 percent say he's being treated more harshly than others. It -- doesn't that an American politics right now.And this is interesting, Wolf, only 13 percent say that he is being treated like any other criminal defendant. Not many Americans believe he is being treated that way. You asked about his behavior. You know, this is the subject of the whole issue of the gag order and whether or not Donald Trump's been violating it. And obviously, Judge Merchan is yet to rule on that, 42 percent of Americans in our poll, Wolf, say Donald Trump's behavior during this hush money trial thus far, inappropriate, that's the plurality, 25 percent say appropriate, 32 percent no opinion on that.

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris. So Trump's attorney started their recross or their cross examination today, continuing theme that they had yesterday, trying to say that a lot of what David Pecker and the National Enquirer was doing was, as he put it, standard operating procedure. He went through a number of the news articles that the Enquirer had published of Trump's political opponents, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, and Pecker agreed that they would have run these stories even if he didn't have that deal with the former president that was struck in August 2015 at Trump Tower to catch and kill any negative stories, as well as to publish negative stories about his political opponents.He also tried to catch David Pecker in some inconsistencies in his testimony. David Pecker has been cooperating with prosecutors, both federal prosecutors and the district attorney's office for several years now. And so they were focusing on, remember the testimony about a January 2017 meeting at Trump Tower that David Pecker walked into while Donald Trump was finishing up a meeting with some -- with then FBI director, James Comey and others. And during this meeting is when David Pecker testified that there was -- that he had a conversation with Donald Trump and Donald Trump thanked him for taking care of the doorman story and the Karen McDougal story. So Donald Trump's attorneys pressed him on notes from a previous interview had given with investigators. And in that interview notes, he said, according to the FBI's notes, that David Pecker told them that Donald Trump did not express any gratitude. Well, David Pecker dug in on that today, saying that the FBI notes were wrong and that his testimony over the past few days is the correct accurate testimony. So a lot of back and forth over different inconsistencies in certain agreements and trying to get David Pecker off his feet. Now, we did see during the testimony of cross examination. David Pecker, some of his answers were very quiet. One answer was so quiet, it was barely audible in the courtroom. When the prosecutors began their redirect of him to try to address some of the issues that the cross examination raised, David Pecker began to grow more confident again. He was again turning to look toward the jury as he was answering those questions. And prosecutors focus on the redirect was that David Pecker would not have done some of these things, but for the deal, he would not have entered into the agreement to pay $150,000 to Karen McDougal without the understanding that Donald Trump would have reimbursed him for it. He would not have ever allowed anybody on behalf of the candidate to get involved with amending some of these catch and kill deals. So he's trying to reset the table with David Pecker there. That is expected to continue after the lunch break. Prosecutor said they have about less than a half an hour more questions. Trump's attorney said he will have a few more on cross examination and then we'll move on to the next witness in this case, which they've not publicly said who that is yet. Boris?",

Your cross exam has to be within and usually narrower than the direct exam. Then your redirect has to be narrower than and within the cross exam and so on down the line.I think the main points that prosecutors are trying to reinforce here as we head into redirect are, first of all, this was an intentional, organized operation. It was AMI, National Enquirer, David Pecker working hand in hand with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump and the campaign in order to buy these stories, in order to protect Donald Trump's campaign prospects.

What if they never did this for anybody until Donald Trump came along and then they said, OK, we're going to do this thing. We're going to pay people for their stories. We're going to put out harmful stories? That would be a lot more sinister and a lot easier for the jury to understand why does this cross the line? But, Gloria, you're exactly right.
