Hunter Biden surrounded by family in Delaware as Republicans peddled conspiracy theories already about his guilty verdict. Drama in the desert. A MAGA Republican in Nevada snubbed by Donald Trump. Now he's trying to fight back. Police in Atlanta chasing a hijacked bus through rush hour traffic before making a deadly discovery on board. This is pretty wild. And Senate Democrats asking Republicans to join them as they prepare for a vote on protecting IVF. (MUSIC)",

For the first time in American history, the child of a sitting president has been convicted of a crime. A jury in Delaware finding Hunter Biden guilty on all three felony charges as members of the Biden family, including First Lady Jill Biden sat in court to hear it read. His father, President Biden was not in court, but afterward, he headed straight to Delaware to be with Hunter. The president released this statement, quote, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. That message does stand in contrast with how Republicans greeted the verdict that was recently handed down against former President Donald Trump. How did they take in the Hunter verdict? Let's watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Every case is different and clearly the evidence was overwhelming here. I don't think that's the case in the Trump trial. SEN. ERIC SCHMITT (R-MO):  So I think the American people are smart enough to know that these are two separate cases. There are two tiers of justice. SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL):  But first in this case, this is existing law in the case of Trump, they've made up something brand new that nobody's been prosecuted before. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We have former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield with us, and Matt Gorman, former senior adviser to Tim Scott's presidential campaign. Welcome to all of you. Thank you for being here. Kate Bedingfield, I actually would like to start with you in terms of -- I mean, look, this is obviously extraordinarily difficult for the Biden family. Politically, when you look at them, whether Republicans are saying there, I mean, had he been acquitted? I think you would have had a quite different storm from them. So I mean, maybe its political break as hard as it is?",

      "sentences": "Break maybe tough just because I think it is so hard on the president's family, but I absolutely agree this is not going to be a huge political winner for the Republicans for a couple of reasons. First of all, we've actually seen them try to make a Hunter Biden line of attack that sticks to Joe Biden for five years now, Donald Trump trying to make it central to the 2020 campaign. It didn't work and I'll tell you, we saw on the Biden campaign in 2020, not only did it not work, it actually wound up highlighting some of the things that people most love and connect to about Joe Biden, his love for his family, his humanity.So this just hasn't been a winning line of attack for them. And then also if you look at the reaction Republicans had yesterday, it was all over the board to say the least. I mean, I think they recognize that the center of this conversation is really one about addiction. And that's a hard thing to seem like you're on the attack over. There's also the gun politics here. I mean, this is sort of a weird, unnatural for Republicans to be, arguing, you know, for less strict gun laws essentially. So, no, I do not think there's going to be a political winner for the Republican by any stretch. HUNT:  I mean, I think, Matt, I'm reading from \"The Wall Street Journal\". They write about the guilty verdict and they say the guilty verdict is likely to minimize any political impact and acquittal by a Biden hometown jury would have fed Donald Trump's narrative of unequal justice, especially since the Justice Department tried to let Hunter off with a slap on the wrist plea deal.",

As well as an inconsistent overall message on how to react to this. You add some once again going to unfounded sort of conspiracy theories, almost not mentioning the trial yesterday, not mentioning this result, but trying to indicate that there are other charges -- again, without, without evidence. You had other Republicans that seem to be saying that once again, trying to frame the justice system still as launching a witch hunt against, against Trump, which again, just this would seem to muddy to undermine that argument when you have a Justice Department that did just deliver a guilty verdict to the presidents son here. So, at this point, you're not seeing really a consistent response from the GOP on how to react to something that is really complicated. I mean, just a couple of days ago, you also saw the former president talk about the issue that was clouding this trial, which is that of addiction, one that I think many Republicans and Democrats know, many Americans throughout the country are dealing with or know somebody who is -- who is struggling with that issue.

I think jury systems work and I think to have our jury is talk about like, look, everybody knows is Joe Biden son, but at the end of the day, we're just looking at whether or not he lied on a form and whether or not he's guilty.

I mean, we were just came upon the ten-year anniversary of Eric Cantor losing a primary back in 2014, and from that data, this day, who would have kind of thought. I will say, look, I respect what Paul Ryan is saying. He has obviously first-hand experience working with him as speaker of the house. I also don't think its going to change very many mines and this is kind of what the other thing I talk a lot about and the kinds of Democrats, but ill just say in the context of the setting, people price in the fact that, you know, Trump's has all this bad stuff. Trump does this, Trump says that, that's fine. Now, were going to talk a lot about abortion later in the show. And I think that might be the more salient issue if you're a Democrat to push rather than look at what Trump said now, but I respect what he's saying. And I think you're right.

I think if you asked almost anybody in the conference, they would not agree with that. But he knows what he has to do to get on TV. But I think you're right. In some respects, look, it's easier when Paul Ryan is out of office -- in office, I know Trump is coming down to D.C. today to have kind of a meeting and looking is the leader of the party. I will say this -- we had a primary, right? Like we had and he had a one-on-one race with Nikki Haley. He did, and he won, and I think that is -- it makes it a lot easier for Republicans, it's not like 2016 where there's this clown car at the end where people were siphoning off votes. So I think it's easier for Trump to take the mantle if he goes down there today and say, look, you had a primary, I won fair and square, like we come together. KANNO-YOUNGS:  Well, this is the other key. I mean, Paul Ryan also says that he's not saying he's going to vote for Joe Biden. He's criticizing Trump, but he's not saying he's going to vote for Joe Biden. And when I hear his comments, basically expressing disappointment with both candidates, I also wonder you were talking about the primary. What that means for other voters that may share similar views as Paul Ryan's, such as maybe some of the Haley voters, other members of the Republican Party are voters that are disappointed with both of these candidates.
