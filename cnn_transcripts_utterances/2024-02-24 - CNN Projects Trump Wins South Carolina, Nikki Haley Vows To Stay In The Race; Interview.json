Donald Trump 57.6 percent of the vote, Nikki Haley with 41.9 percent. That's with just 25 percent, though, of precincts reporting. So more numbers still to come in.It is 8:00 p.m. Eastern here on the East Coast. Donald Trump is the projected winner of the Republican presidential primary in South Carolina. It will bring a huge blow to the state's former governor, Nikki Haley, in her own backyard. Even bringing him closer to clinching the GOP nomination. We are, as I said, standing by to hear from Nikki Haley any moment. We'll obviously bring you her remarks live. That is the crowd that has been waiting.

      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson, I'm talking to a lot of sources here who are close to Donald Trump saying that now is the time to pivot to the general election. They believe these four definitive wins in a row make Donald Trump the presumptive nominee, even though the delegate math is not there, even though Nikki Haley has not dropped out of the race.Now to be clear, he is not the presumptive nominee at this time, but this is four significant wins for the former president. And you kind of heard that in his speech tonight. He didn't mention Nikki Haley once, so that wasn't just because of this pivot to the general election. This is because it was the same speech he was supposed to give in New Hampshire when he won, but did not. As we remember this -- in New Hampshire, Nikki Haley took the stage first, giving a very enthusiastic speech, despite the fact that she lost. And Donald Trump, instead of celebrating his win in the state, launched into a series of attacks for quite some time against Nikki Haley. His team not happy with that. He completely changed the narrative away from his win. Tonight a different person. He was celebrating his win. He was not mentioning Nikki Haley, and turning his attention to Joe Biden. Now the big question is when we start to see Donald Trump's campaign actually move to a general. And I mean, not in terms of messaging but in terms of money, and Donald Trump did just get a big significant win in terms of funds. A new super PAC has been established by a long-term friend and donor, Ike Perlmutter, who used to be the executive of Marvel. It is going to be run by a family friend Sergio Gor, and they say they've already got donors from across the country. Now this, of course, it's going to be at a time where Donald Trump not only needs money for a campaign, but also needs a significant number of funds for all those legal fees that he is facing. Now that's not where his super PAC money is going to go, but it is another avenue for Donald Trump to raise cash as he looks again towards a general election.",

We see his dominance here, but I'm going to take you inside these exit poll results among Haley voters. Obviously, the smaller share of voters tonight since we've projected this race. But I do think it is telling for the work Donald Trump and his team will have to do to bring the party totally unified, heading into a general.So among Haley voters in the South Carolina primary tonight, what are your feelings if Trump wins the nomination? 78 percent of them will be dissatisfied if Trump is the nominee. Among Haley voters we asked, is Trump fit for the presidency if he is convicted of a crime? 82 percent of Haley voters in this Republican primary saying no, he's unfit for the presidency if he's convicted of a crime. Who is physically, mentally fit to serve as president? Again, these are Haley voters we're looking at tonight. 74 percent of them not surprisingly say Haley is fit both physically and mentally to serve effectively. Only 4 percent of her voters think Trump fits that bill that he is physically and mentally fit. 18 percent say both of them are. And here's one that's really interesting. Haley voters actually think Donald Trump can beat Joe Biden despite the fact that Nikki Haley every day says Donald Trump cannot beat Joe Biden. That's one of her main arguments day in and day out, why she's still in the race. 56 percent of her voters actually say that it's very or somewhat likely that Trump would indeed defeat Biden -- Anderson.",

Not only that, but per Jake and others, that she's competitive in two congressional districts right now.Not only District One, which is Charleston and a low country, but also Jim Clyburn's district, which is District Six. And so when you think about these things, I mean, this is more competitive than people thought. Now, she's still getting beat by 17 points in our home state but she's performing at over 40 percent. And I think that is something that, I mean, Nikki can celebrate that per say, but the Republican Party has to be keeping their eye on that because 41 percent of the electorate in South Carolina is rejecting Donald Trump.",

You could see some of the things in that that you're seeing now, her grit, her political skills, her kind of willingness and she -- you know, call Sara Palin, gets that endorsement.She was a fighter then, but she was a very different candidate ideologically, right? She was a Tea Party candidates. She was, if anything, modeling what became the Trump movement at that time. Then she goes and she works for Trump. She repudiates him after January 6th.

You know, that's how she gets herself in trouble.But what we're seeing is that she's a fighter. She always has been a fighter. I mean, she's been a fighter for a very long period of time. In 2010 when she ran for governor of South Carolina, Gresham Barrett was supposed to win that race. She ran against Gresham Barrett, who was a sitting United States congressman. I mean, she ran against Henry McMaster. She ran against Andrei Bauer. All of these names who were bigger than the lowly state representative from Lexington County, when she got elected to the statehouse, she beat the oldest member of the general assembly the election before I beat the oldest member of the general assembly.
