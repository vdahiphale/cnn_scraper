      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", great to have you with us this Friday a historic day in the world of techwith Elon Musk completing his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. Musk becoming the owner of the troubled social media giant after a tumultuous takeover drama that began way back in April. How can we forget it ended this morning with Musk sharing this tweet, the bird is freed? And telling what feathers are well and truly flying. Musk making his marks immediately his first move firing the CEO, the CFO and the Execs responsible for banning Trump on Twitter. And of course, as we saw yesterday, crowning him, \"Chief Twit\" the question is what now will Trump be back? And how will Twitter change it for users if at all? We'll discuss all the ins and outs later on in the show with Venture Capitalist Bradley Tusk, the Founder of Tusk Ventures. Now Musk's deal closing at an inauspicious time for financial markets to a Halloween season where the scariest word on Wall Street literally has been tech almost $1 trillion worth of market cap wiped off the biggest firms in just a few days Amazon, in fact, at the latest horror show falling 13 percent pre market after posting weak results and guidance. And like Microsoft earlier this week, it's seeing a slowdown in a key growth area, cloud computing. Amazon also seeing a soft holiday shopping season ahead, as does Apple by the way. All the details on what they had to say coming right up. In the meantime, Amazon's plunge, pressuring the NASDAQ the tech heavy sector once again, as you can see there the index losing close to over 4 percent in the past two days. And it's now down more than 30 percent this year. Tech stocks in the meantime also getting crushed over in China the HANG SENG falling more than 3.5 percent in the session overnight to a fresh 13-year low. Truly the tech nightmare before Halloween Tech's ongoing pain and Musk begins his Twitter reign. And that is where we begin the show. Marc Stewart and Clare Guffey joins us now. And I know Clare; you in particular have been covering this all night. So thank you for making it with us today. Marc, I want to begin with you the deal is done. One cloud of uncertainty hanging over this stock clears. But the drama continues, including the exodus of the Chief Executive, the CFO and others walk us through the last 12 hours.",

But yes, there has been a big exodus from the C suite. And that certainly is one of the big headlines so going now from Twitter's CEO Parag Agarwal, as well as Chief Financial Officer Ned Segel. None of this too much of a big surprise because especially between Agarwal, and Musk as we have reported over the last few months. It's been bit of a frosty relationship. Of course, the other question remains what happens to the thousands of other Twitter employees? Perhaps we will get some more direction on that later today. I also can't but help bring up the tweet that you mentioned earlier about the tweet from Musk saying that the bird is freed. Well, evidence that this is a global company. And when you make a tweet like that, it generates response around the world, including from Thierry Breton, who is the EU commissioner for internal markets. He basically snapped back at that tweet saying the bird in Europe that is in Europe, the bird will fly by our EU rules. Making a nod to the switch to the strict tech regulation that can be found across the EU because not only does the change in the C suite mean just different faces. But Julia, as you well know, it also could signal a big change in philosophy and direction of the company.",

But what about other options for monetization because, as Clare quite rightly pointed out there there's this juxtaposition between perhaps wanting to be more free and easy with content and allowing this to be a free platform. But at the same time, if you want advertisers you need those, add those eyeballs watching. But there are also questions about where you place those ads versus difficult, controversial content too.",

And that is what perhaps we will see in the future. I mean, Musk has made no secret; he wants to perhaps develop Twitter into the Super App. Something similar to what we see in Asia, with encrypted messaging in direct messages. So that is something that he could explore that perhaps hasn't been done before and could be seen as a way to keep as well as court new advertisers. I think it's also important to mention the relationship that he has formed with Former Founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey; the two have talked about this deal. He has, in many ways served as an advisor. This does not mean that Jack Dorsey is coming back to Twitter. But it means that Musk has someone to lean on and when you take on a platform as large as this. And you have Musk's wealth, you want to get lots of different opinions, lots of different direction and perhaps we could see that relationship with Dorsey strengthen even further.",

OK, let's move on the $44 billion takeover of course comes as tech giants continue to see their stock values pummeled shares of Amazon falling now 14 percent pre market after warning about weaker sales growth this quarter.

Rahel we have watching all of these let's hone in on what Amazon said.

And you mentioned that shares were off about 14 percent pre market consider this Julia. After the Bell yesterday after the company reported shares were off almost 20 percent. So what did they say that spooked Investors because it was actually a pretty decent quarter, the current quarter, right? I mean, sales, revenues and profits were roughly in line. Sales grew 14 percent versus last year. Although in its cloud business, those sales were actually soft, that revenue was actually soft. And in fact, it's what's just ahead in this current quarter this holiday quarter that really spooked Investors, Julia. The company lowering its guidance quite significantly, essentially acknowledging that it expects things to get tougher. Now, one perhaps silver lining, as one analyst pointed out in a note is that if Amazon is facing these headwinds, in terms of retail that. You know, the other retailers are also absolutely dealing with these headwinds. And Amazon has a better financial cushion. Because it has those really profitable sectors like AWS and advertising. But in an environment Julia, of course, as you know, where there is so much pessimism, there is so much uncertainty.

Services were weak and some analysts are wondering, is that the sign of consumer starting to pull back? Are they starting to pull back on their subscription still buying and really across geographies? Julia, when you look at sort of where the iPhone sales were, sort of concentrated really all across the world still seeing strong growth. But consumers are pulling back on services.

In this case, two missiles short range missiles believed to be fired around a 20-minute period around noon local time that flew east some 230 kilometers before splashing into the sea. The U.S. Military says that they pose no immediate threat to U.S. personnel or to U.S. allies in the region, but they are concerned about it. The South Korean Military has called this a provocation. North Korea has said that it's firing these missiles in response to Military exercises that its South Korean rival has been conducting. In the past alongside the U.S. and Japan just this week, South Korea was conducting its own amphibious assault landing exercises that CNN witnessed. And there have been other rounds of exercises that North Korea is angry at as well. Other signs of tensions have been that North and South Korea have been firing artillery warning shots into the buffer zone, the maritime buffer zone in recent weeks. That's another sign of trouble in the region. And then there's the concern about a potential seventh North Korean nuclear test. And the question that we're hearing from the U.S. government from the South Koreans is not if but when this could take place.

As well as in India and China, saying that there's going to be an attack, a dirty bomb attack by the Ukrainians. Now, no one thinks this is remotely plausible. But there's an immense amount of effort that's gone into this from the Kremlin. And this is what has the White House and NATO Leaders spooked the idea that if it looks like Kherson is going to fall that the Russians might be planning a false flag attack. This is why Biden has focused so much in his commentary recently on threatening the Russians if they were to use a tactical nuclear weapon on the ground in Ukraine. So I think the level of concern about that on the part of NATO leaders is about as high as it has been in the last two weeks. I don't think it's changed at all from Putin's speech.",

And stop the Ukrainians from taking more ground, which, of course gets harder for the Ukrainians as we move into the winter months. This is that's the Russians don't have many options, right? So I mean we're seeing that the Russians hadn't been attacking critical infrastructure of Ukraine in the first seven months of the war. Now they are and in the last three weeks, 40 percent of Ukraine's electricity grid has been damaged or destroyed. So much so that the Ukrainian government this week is telling refugees in Europe don't come back because the power grid can't handle the additional strain this winter. They weren't saying that even a week ago. So the Russians, I think, understand they're under pressure. They don't have good options in the near term. And they're using everything they can, some of that is escalatory. Some of that is we're ready to talk, to try to avoid more embarrassing losses over the coming few weeks. The coming few weeks are clearly in some ways, the most dangerous of the conflict so far because the Ukrainians are being quite successful in their counter offensive. And the Russians are admitting that on state media, if you watch Russian media. They're not saying they're not pretending that they're holding all that ground.

You've got Elon Musk's sort of inadvertently taking sides in the Russia-Ukraine war, providing the Starlink satellites to Ukraine. He's got interest in China, with electric cars and the operations that he has there. I mean, he sorts of has a finger in many pies in terms of businesses. But he also has a finger in many pies geopolitically, as well, which I'm sure in certain cases, he'd rather not have them, quite frankly.

The fact that increasingly, a handful of technology companies, most ofwhich are based in the United States, effectively exert sovereignty in the digital space, they act as governments. And so when we talk about something like the war in Ukraine, you have NATO countries that are providing weapons. But you have technology companies that in many cases are doing a lot more for the Ukrainians than most NATO countries are. And obviously, that makes them aligned. From a NATO perspective, it makes them belligerence from a Russian perspective. But the decisions are not treaty bound, the decisions are being made by individual executives and the C suites in these companies. And in the case of Elon, they're being made individually by Elon. Now, what's so interesting here is that SpaceX is really a national champion for the United States, right? I mean, the contracts are mostly the Pentagon, they're mostly NATO. And so I mean, not a surprise that they'd go in and support the Ukrainians. On the other hand, Tesla's a global corporation also owned a large piece of which by Elon. And that the Chinese are critical market for and now twitter, taken private by Elon. And very different perspectives, and all three of those companies in terms of what they mean what they have to do geopolitically.

I mean, it's, it's interesting, I mean, the business model, and I think most of us agree thatthe advertising model of social media is part of what fuels the toxicity of the social discourse. You need eyeballs, eyeballs are attracted by extreme content, controversial content. And that sort of fuels the beast, in a sense, and this echo chamber of like-minded opinions and beliefs. So if you want to break that, then you ultimately undermine the financial reason for owning or investing in some of these social media brands. For me, I don't see the monetization, the bigger monetization potential, if you take him at face value, when he says that actually part of the reason for owning this was trying to cut through some of the crazy and the noise and the extremism and the ability of a social media platform to silence the president, which you can, you know, and you know, and have been involved in politics for many years. And there are questionable - questions to be asked about that whether any social media platform should have that power? I'm sort of asking 40 different questions in one branch, you can answer how you--",

Keep in mind,there are new headwinds that hasn't even run into yet that are likely to happen. So there's a law in the U.S. government called Section 230 the Telecommunications Decency Act. I know that sounds pretty, pretty granular there. But what it does, why it's so important is it protects platforms from any liability from the content posted by their users. So no matter what I post about you on Twitter, or Facebook, or TikTok, or whatever it is, you can sue me, but in most cases, I don't have any assets to recover, but you can't sue Facebook. You can't sue Twitter says result, entire business model developed to say, we need to maximize clicks to maximize advertising revenue, toxic content gets more clicks than positive content. We can't get in trouble for it anyway, because we're protected by Section 230. So therefore, we can do whatever we want. That may not remain. The only thing that I'm aware of in the 2020, Trump and Biden platforms that were the same was calling for the repeal of Section 230. It has bipartisan support, if that were to happen, the business model for every social media platform in this country will get far harder and far worse. So I think not only is there not a sort of path to profitability, it might actually get a lot worse.",

So I don't think that they meant to unleash what they did. At the same time, there's been a complete blockage of any sort of regulation that would make the platforms less dangerous, less toxic, and less harmful. So what your point is really, really sounding Julia, because we're right now call it five to seven years away from some sort of pretty developed version of the Metaverse. The Metaverse will be so much bigger and so more immersive than web 2.0, that everything good about the internet will be magnified. But everything bad about the internet will also be magnified. And if we can't deal with some of these basic issues like privacy, like free speech, like the ability to protect your data, protect no not have teenagers, you know, being shown how to cut themselves or engaging eating disorders and all that. Imagine what's going to be on the Metaverse when everything is feels 10 times more real. And so yes, I think it's really important that the government now start thinking about this thing is coming, Meta alone spending about $25 billion this year on R&amp;D for it. And we've already failed to regulate the regular internet properly. It'll get a lot worse unless we start taking action. So yes, I think that the risks are there. And I also think the fact that while Facebook stock is way down, Mark Zuckerberg is not someone I would ever bet against. And I think just like he had a vision in the early to mid-2000s the terms most valuable companies in history, I think that were very well made go through that.",
