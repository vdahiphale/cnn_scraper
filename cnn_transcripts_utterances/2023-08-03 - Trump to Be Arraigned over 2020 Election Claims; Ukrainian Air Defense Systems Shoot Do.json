Trump is expected to plead not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in court. They are related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, accusing him of trying to subvert the very democracy he was sworn to protect. CNN's Zachary Cohen, Shimon Prokupecz are in Washington. Alayna Treene is in New Jersey, where Trump is beginning what is a historic day. And, Zachary, let's start with you. Trump returning to the scene of the alleged crime; Washington, of course, on high alert. Remind us what charges he faces at this point.",

Now when Trump arrives in D.C., he will travel to the courthouse here and will be placed under arrest, processed and then likely arraigned. And we expect that the process today will be streamlined because he's already been through the federal court processing system before, for the Mar-a-Lago documents indictment. Look, as you mentioned, this courthouse is in direct view of where the violence on January 6th, 2021, took place. And also, more than 1,000 Trump supporters who breached the Capitol that day have gone through the motions of the same initial appearance that Trump will make today. Really sort of a full circle moment as the former president travels to the courthouse here in, D.C. to answer for those charges that were laid down by Jack Smith and the special counsel.",

And they also want it to be known that, despite his aggressive campaign schedule -- he will be in Alabama tomorrow on Friday and South Carolina on Saturday-- he is being forced to take time out of that schedule to come to this. It plays a bit into his defense team's strategy to talk about election interference. That is one of the key lines of defense that they will be using in this case. To give you a sense of how today will go, as Zachary said and just talking about Trump's plans, he will be leaving here shortly after noon Eastern time. He'll head to Newark airport and then will take his private plane to, D.C. and go to his court appearance at 4. As Zach said, it will be a pretty swift process. And immediately after he will go back to the airport for his plane and come back to New Jersey.

Law enforcement officials are outside and everybody is just waiting as we approach the hour that the former president arrives here.

Here is what Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr, told CNN about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I really don't think that's a valid argument, because, as the indictment says, they're not attacking his First Amendment right. He can say whatever he wants. He can even lie. He can even tell people that the election was stolen, when he knew better. But that does not protect you from entering into a conspiracy. All conspiracies involve speech. And all fraud involves speech. So, free speech doesn't give you the right, to engage in a fraudulent conspiracy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This,  what you heard there, is one of the former vice president's harshest rebukes of Trump to date. We previously saw him reticent to engage this way, especially on the campaign trail. But this indictment is markedly more personal for Pence, who says it is important for Americans to know he resisted pressure to overturn the 2020 election. He is really a central character in this latest never-ending saga of the Trump post-presidency. But take South Carolina senator Tim Scott for instance, another GOP hopeful. He and many others in the field are casting suspicion on this latest indictment, arguing he remains concerned about the weaponization of the Department of Justice, even going so far as to suggest our institutions here in America hunt Republicans and protect Democrats. But former New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, another rival, has made going after Trump a cornerstone of his campaign. And he says the former president violated his oath of office. Now all of these candidates, Becky, they are really forced to confront the daily revelations regarding Trump.
