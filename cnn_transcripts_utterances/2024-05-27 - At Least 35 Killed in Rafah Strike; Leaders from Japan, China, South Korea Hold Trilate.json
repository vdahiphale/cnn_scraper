We begin this out in Gaza, where the health ministry says at least 35 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in an Israeli strike in the Southern city of Rafah.Many more have horrific burn injuries from the fire that followed the strike. Gaza officials say it hit a camp filled with tents for those displaced from the war. Many of the video coming from the scene simply too graphic to show. The Israeli military claims it was targeting what it called a Hamas compound and says two senior Hamas officials were killed. The IDF, though, acknowledges reports of the strike along with the fire that it caused, did harm civilians. CNN's Paula Hancocks is tracking all the developments for us. She has more from Abu Dhabi.

It was in a displaced persons' camp, where there were tents. There were makeshift shelters. And according to Gaza's Ministry of Health, they say that most of those who were killed and injured were women and children, saying that no hospital had the capacity in the area to be able to cope with the scale and the number of those killed and injured. Now we know also from the Gaza government's media office that this was designated as a safe zone. And this is an area where some had moved to after being evacuated by the Israeli military and other parts of Rafah, notably in the East. Now we've had a response, a statement from the Israeli military. They say that they did carry out an airstrike. They struck a Hamas compound in Rafah. And they say that they killed two senior Hamas officials, one of them a commander of Hamas's leadership in the West Bank. Now, they do acknowledge that there was a fire, reports of a fire. They say they see reports of civilians being harmed, as well, and they are conducting a review of the incident. Now, we know a large fire did break out in that area. There are horrific images on social media. There are images obtained by CNN, where we see the bodies and the injured being pulled from those burning tents. Now we saw firefighters, paramedics, also the displaced desperately trying to put those fires out. Now, also, earlier this Sunday, we saw Hamas fire eight missiles at Israeli territory. And for the first time since the end of January, they targeted Tel Aviv. There were no reports of casualties, but we heard from the Israeli military that Hamas is operating in Rafah. They have hostages in Rafah. And this is why they need to operate there. But the fact, of course, that more than seven months, well over seven months into this war, Hamas is still able to fire rockets into Israeli territory. It does raise questions, and it does also put more pressure on the Israeli government to come up with not just a military strategy, but also a political plan for the day after the war.

Of course, we have these two centers of gravity, Michael. We have China now pulling Russia closer to it, and we have the United States pulling the Republic of South -- or the Republic of Korea and Japan closer to it and its own alliance, as well. So this is the context we find ourselves in the senior leaders of all of these countries. Again, President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and Premier Li Qiang of China, saying that they need to be able to talk to each other at a senior level, again, to avoid any kind of escalation or misunderstanding. So you know, Michael, the framework for having this sort of meeting has existed for years. It's notable that it's happening, because it's been on ice for the past four-and-a-half years because of tensions between the three countries and COVID, as well.

It dates back to the Cold War era.However, we are seeing an increasing concern about recent developments of such technologies. And that's playing out against the backdrop of increasing focus on space and U.S.-China competition in space. Today, militaries are increasingly integrating their capabilities here on earth with satellites in space. For example, using satellites for things like positioning troops, or launching and detecting weapons and running secure communications. And that's led to a growing number of countries vying for technologies that could disrupt or, in some cases, even destroy their potential adversary's satellites. And this is of particular concern to the United States, because it's a country that has extensive military capabilities linked to assets in space. And its geopolitical frictions are mounting here on Earth. That's something that experts who watch this space closely are saying that China and Russia are interested to deny the U.S. access to those assets through the development of these counterspace technologies.",

So it may not necessarily appear at this time to have a military application, but it could down the line. That said, space powers are widely believed to have researched or developed technologies that include things like jamming and spoofing of satellite signals. So that means interrupting a signal that's going from a satellite down to a ground station or vice versa. There's also high-powered lasers that could dazzle imaging satellites and preventing them from taking that imagery. Then there's more destructive kinds of technologies, and those include things like missiles, which are launched from space that can then take out a satellite or satellites and other spacecraft that are launched into orbit that could potentially interfere with or target satellites there.
