We do talk, usually complain, about work to - to our friends and family.But there is another layer here because Justice Thomas is a Supreme Court justice who could decide on cases that involve things that have to do with Crow. What was your take? GRAEME WOOD, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Yes, that's right, I mean these two are certainly old friends. And they've been friends since after Thomas got on the court, about 30 years. And the way Crow talks about it, you know, they're people of the same generation. They have some alignment in political views, I think, but most of the time when they talk, they talk about things like their shared love of Motown, he said. They talk about things that - that, you know, like the weather, sports. What I think Crow has a hard time understanding is that this -- yes, this is a Supreme Court justice. And so, forget house transactions, you can't buy a drink for a Supreme Court justice without someone wondering exactly what the nature of this relationship is. To Crow, clearly he thinks of it as just a friendship. To everybody else, there's a lot more suspicion that that relationship deserves.",

      "sentences": "So, Crow thinks that he did nothing wrong with this purchase. Now, the details of this purchase are as follows. It's a small house in this area of Georgia that Clarence Thomas grew up in. And Crow has, over the years, paid for public library donations, donations to preserve the culture of the Golecgechi (ph) people, who are descendants of African slaves in that area. And he found that this house that Clarence Thomas had this association with, was still inhabited by Clarence Thomas' mother, who's 94 years old. And he bought it for what he says, Crow says, was fair market value, about $130,000. And the mother is 94 years old, so Crow, who, of course, you know, he's one of the largest real estate developers in the country, this is nothing to him. And he said, you know, I'll let a 94-year-old woman live there for the rest of her days and that will be -- have a negligible effect on the value of the transaction.So, from his perspective, he was buying a house to preserve for -- as a historic site or museum for the life of his friend and in some ways one of his heroes, Clarence Thomas. And from the perspective of everyone else, he's writing a check to Clarence Thomas, who owned the house, and letting Clarence Thomas' mother live there for as long as she lives. So, again, it's an example of where, from Crow's perspective, he's doing a nice thing. He's helping a friend. He's helping an American hero. And from everybody else's perspective, he's doing something that deserves the deepest scrutiny because it involves the integrity of the Supreme Court of the United States.",

A lot of 38-year-olds get winded just taking their groceries to the car. But he was very cryptic when talking about his future after putting up an incredible performance. Here's some of it. He was on a mission. He dropped 31 of his game high 40 points in the first half. Seemed like everything was going in. Even passes. Aaron Gordon couldn't believe it. Most playoff points in a half in his career. Year 20 in the league. Unfathomable. But, check this out. Gordon couldn't believe this either. He didn't steam do anything wrong and LeBron was just full of attitude. His Lakers take a 15-point lead into halftime. But the Nuggets two-time league MVP Nikola Jokic dropped in 30 points in this game, 14 rebounds, 13 assists. His eighth triple double of the playoffs. Breaks the great Wilt Chamberlin's record for the most in a post-season. In the final seconds, LeBron had the chance to send it to overtime but Gordon gets the last laugh, blocking the shot.
