He's the co- author of \"Unequal: A Story of America.\" Also here, Jeffrey Toobin, a lawyer who extensively covered the O.J. Simpson trial. He's also the author of \"The Run of His Life: The People V. O.J. Simpson.\" I thank you all for being here today. Jeffrey, let me begin with you here. Talking to Kato Kaelin seems a bit surreal for so many who remembered his testimony, like myself. What's your reaction to things he said? JEFFREY TOOBIN, LAWYER WHO EXTENSIVELY COVERD O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL, AUTHOR:  Well, you know, he certainly said nice things about, you know, how he wants to live his life and sympathy for the victims. But it is worth remembering that his testimony was equivocating and awful for the prosecution, and seemed to me and to many others very much shaded in favor of O.J. Simpson. So, you know, it's all well and good that he thinks O.J. was guilty now, but if he had given more straightforward testimony in the trial all those years ago, who knows, the result might have been different.

But talk to me about the role that race played in the perception of this trial.MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN &amp; DIASPORA STUDIES, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY:  Well, there's no question, Laura, that there was a split screen of racial perception. The O.J. Simpson case was a race quake. It trembled the ground beneath our feet because it exposed to us, it didn't create it, it exposed to us the fault lines that trace beneath the terrain of American society. There had already been two Americas, one white, one black, unequal, separate, as the Kerner Commission had predicted back in the late 60s. And then we saw Rodney King being -- you know, his assaulters, the police people who beat him mercilessly, acquitted. So, O.J. was the culmination of a long trail of travesties, of tragedies, of hurt and pain that African-American people had endured. And O.J. Simpson was the perfect avatar for such beliefs. And the reason he was a perfect ideal is because he was the white man's Black person. He was beloved in white America. He was celebrated. The Jews Hertz commercials being celebrated for his racelessness. But Time magazine darkened his face. America saw him through a different prism. And now, he became the very embodiment of all that was stereotypical about black masculinity and, of course, the hateful denunciation of, you know, what that blackness meant in America. So, O.J., whether he wanted to or not, became a symbol and a prism through which we viewed the landscape of American race.",

It tells you a lot about the LAPD that he lost his case and was told to go back to work as -- as a police officer. I mean, the LAPD had an appalling history when it came to race. And, of course, the Rodney King case was the most vivid demonstration of that.However, the tragedy of the O.J. Simpson case, in my view, was that even though that was a legitimate complaint about the Los Angeles Police Department in general, O.J. Simpson got away with murder because he was the unjust beneficiary of that long and unfortunate history. O.J.

Obviously, you know the law a hell of a lot better than me, but I just thought that, for me personally, I've often joked if I were a lawyer, there's no way that Johnny Cochran would have beaten me with that level of evidence.And over the years, I've become friends with Carl Douglas, who was on the legal team, a member of the legal team for O.J. Simpson. I still speak to him this day. I'm very, very fond of him. He's a very successful lawyer in Los Angeles. And one of the things that he said, you know, do you have any idea how great Johnny Cochran was? I said, of course we do, we all do, it's just that the preponderance of evidence that was against O.J. Simpson, considering the circumstances, I thought he was guilty as hell. Having said all of that, I wasn't as angry as white America was at his not guilty verdict because in light of what had happened with Rodney King and the history of the LAPD with African Americans, it was a foregone conclusion in my mind that the preponderance of evidence was going to have to be ironclad. And not only that, the defense was going to have to, the prosecution rather, was going to have to have an ironclad case. They were going to have to execute it exceptionally well in order for him to be found guilty in light of the climate in Los Angeles at that particular moment in time. So, I wasn't surprised by the verdict. But just me speaking as an individual, when I saw the evidence, when I saw the court case, watching it on TV all of those months, you're damn right I thought he was guilty, and I still think he's guilty to this very day.",

I think if Rodney King had not happened, that's just my personal opinion, Laura, I don't know for sure, but I'm just of the mindset that had Rodney King not happened, then O.J., a not guilty verdict for O.J., probably would not have happened.And listen, when I think about Nicole Brown Simpson and I think about Ronald Goldman, especially Ronald Goldman, of course, both lives being lost, so heart wrenching and what have you, you don't wish that on any human being with any kind of soul, you don't wish that on anybody. Let's be clear about that. But to see Ronald Goldman's father, to know that he had no relationship with O.J., and the perception is that he just came by and he was in a wrong place in the wrong time, and to have that happen to him and for Nicole Brown Simpson to reportedly having had to endure what she endured from O.J. for years and then for that to happen, your heart just goes out to them. But unfortunately, at that particular moment in time, Black folks were saying there's a lot of lives that have been lost from our community at the hands of transgressors who happen to be law enforcement officials. That was a more pertinent and profound issue in the African-American community than O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson or Ronald Goldman. I mean, Jay-Z said it best when, you know, listen, we didn't have Black folks. And I think, you know, I don't want to speak for you, but it's hard to imagine that a Black person in America didn't remember O.J. saying, I'm not black, I'm O.J. You know, he wasn't somebody that ingratiated himself with our community. You know, I'm not happy that the man is dead. I'm not happy that he passed away from cancer. I lost my mother to cancer in 2017. I'm very, very sensitive to that issue. I don't wish death upon anybody. But in the same breath, this was a man that had detached himself from his community. He was the first Black athlete ever given a national ad campaign by Hertz in 1975. He prided himself on being different and separate and apart from his own race of people. These are facts. And so, when you look at it from that perspective, and the only time it appeared he found his blackness was when he was indicted on double murder charges and he needed the support of the Black community, you did have a lot of white folks in America looking at the Black community like we were absolute fools for being supportive of him in any way because they knew that about him as much as we did.",
