Knowing my relationship with David Pecker, the tabloid king, the two of you should work together. And anything negative that comes out, you let Michael know and we'll handle it. That's Michael Cohen quoting Donald Trump.Now, a lot of this has been corroborated by David Pecker's testimony. What does it tell you that the jury requested this? Because if I recall correctly, the prosecutor -- the other prosecutor, Steinglass said in his summary, that that Trump Tower meeting was a really important meeting to view this entire case through an important lens.",

It never is. My view is the testimony of Pecker and Cohen overlaps substantially enough that it's mutually reinforcing. It's mutually corroborating. And Kasie's right, what you said before, trying to understand what the jury's thinking is the pseudoscience of all pseudosciences. However, we can still draw inferences. And one inference that I think we can draw about the jury is they're approaching this in a perfectly logical, chronological manner. The D.A. tried to tell the story in closing. This meeting is chapter one. This meeting is page one. It makes perfect sense that the jury's starting there and it's a solid starting point for the prosecution.",

David Pecker, according to his testimony, ate the cost of that. He thought he was going to be repaid by Donald Trump. He was not repaid.Do we think, since he had an immunity deal, David Pecker, to testify, that they could have -- the prosecutors could have charged him with an illegal campaign contribution, because he's saying he did this? Is -- it would have been embarrassing to campaign. He's saying explicitly he did this to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump's campaign. Do we think that that was part of the deal?

Now, that's a deal prosecutors make all the time. I made many of those deals.

It's my understanding that Karen McDougal does not want her story published for that part, and they read that as well.Now, they're on the second part of the request from the jury for an excerpt. This, again, has to do with David Pecker. And it is from testimony from April 25th. And it is, again, the prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, talking to David Pecker, the tabloid magnate. Steinglass, now, even though this agreement was signed, was it ever actually executed? This is about -- still about Karen McDougal. No, it wasn't, Pecker said. Question, now, again, I'm going to ask you to be very careful here without revealing any privileged conversations with your legal counsel or your general counsel. Did you come to the decision -- did you have a conversation with your general counsel? Pecker, I did. Question, and based on that conversation, did you co- angry me? Is that a word? What is -- maybe this is a miss -- and based on the coverage, did you come to the decision that you no longer wanted to be reimbursed for the money that AMI had laid out to acquire Ms. McDougal's lifetime rights. Yes, that's correct, Pecker said. Sorry, there's a typo in my transcript here. Question, did you communicate that decision to Michael Cohen? Pecker, yes. And then, a few lines later, Pecker goes on to say, I called Michael Cohen and I said to him that the agreement, the assignment deal is off. This is -- again, this is the deal with Karen McDougal. The assignment deal is off. Quote, \"I'm not going to forward, it is a bad idea, and I want you to rip up the agreement.\" Now, Michael Cohen, Pecker says, was very, very angry, very upset, screaming basically at me, and I said, I'm not going to forward -- I'm not going forward with this agreement. Rip it up. And he said, excuse me, Michael Cohen said, the boss, meaning Donald Trump is going to be very angry. I said, I am sorry. I'm not going forward. The deal is off. And he said, I can't believe it. I am a lawyer. I am your friend. I don't understand why you are so concerned. I said, I'm very concerned and I'm not going forward, period. And I said, are you going to rip it up or not? And he said, I will take care of it. The prosecutor says, to be clear, Mr. Pecker, did AMI ever get reimbursed for the money? And the answer was no.",

And then they would assign the rights that they had to control the story. They would essentially sell it over to Trump and Cohen. What Pecker is saying here is we ended up not getting reimbursed from them, not selling the rights back over to Cohen and Trump because I talked to my lawyer. Now, he wasn't allowed to say what the lawyer told him, but it's quite clear the lawyer said to Pecker, hang on, this is getting into the shady area. You don't want to continue with this deal, and that's why Pecker ended up buying the story on his own.

And this was a conspiracy to help Trump win the White House in 2016 by suppressing negative stories and amplifying ones that can help him.So, it's interesting that they've not only asked for David Pecker's testimony about this, they also asked for Michael Cohen's testimony about this, because one of the questions they're going to have to ask is, what was Trump's role in this meeting? What was his role in what prosecutors allege was the first step in this conspiracy? So, when you come to the overarching, right, narrative of this case, this is a critical moment. And it's probably important for them to rehear this testimony because David Pecker, they haven't heard from him in weeks, he is the first witness they heard from. So, they're going to hear this back.

I believe when he misremembered the exact date, Trump was at a debate, a Republican primary debate, actually, during that time period. But after that, in -- when the prosecution had the chance to question David Pecker again, they said, OK, we just misremembered the exact date, but you do know that you were in Trump Tower on this day.

Because they were looking back at a deposition that he had given or a testimony he had given to a grand jury and saying, you said a little bit different stuff during this time period than you're saying now and basically chalking it up to the fact that it was years ago, so you're not going to remember every single thing that was said in chronological order. And Pecker said, likely, but this is how I recollected to the best of my ability.Now, again, a lot of this is also going to go to election interference because part of that conversation was how can you help us with the campaign. And Pecker saying, well, I can be your eyes and ears on the ground. You know, I'm not going to work for the campaign, but I can let you know if there's anything out there and potentially handle it for you.

Ted Cruz was surging in popularity in the Republican primary at this time. You know, and I was asking him, do you think that your campaign would have done better? Do you think Donald Trump still would have been the nominee without these tactics? And he kind of described it as a rough and tumble campaign. But we saw how the National Enquirer was really doing its best to help --",

I mean, they were using a national outlet to essentially, you know, attack someone's family. And it wasn't just his father.

You know, when Todd Blanche tried to downplay the publication and how many people are -- the subscription power of the National Enquirer, I mean, Trump, I remember, went on Fox and Friends and said well, have you heard this story? You know, he hasn't denied this story. I have no idea where the story came from. And Trump denied being part of it and he was going and using it to his advantage.",

It was just likely one of the biggest elections that Twitter has been a part of. And we know a lot of those people were trying to influence the election now.So, despite the fact that the National Enquirer only had, what, 350,000 readership and why would that matter anyway, I mean, that's just neither here nor there, given what we know about that time period and what we know about now with social media, and how all of that was being amplified.

The Justice Department subsequently charged people involved in trying to amplify, through an army of bots, negative stories about Hillary Clinton, positive ones about Trump, to influence the election. So, again, the power of the National Enquirer at this moment in time was enormous. And it's not just to bolster someone's reputation, it's to win the White House.And prosecutors really hope that that elevates this case in the mind of the jury, but also in the mind of the public, because obviously they've taken a lot of heat for bringing it, where succumb into political pressure. Is this really worthy of the time, the resources potentially convicting a former president? And every time I talked to them about that, they always say, this isn't about hush money, this isn't just about paperwork, this is about election interference and subverting democracy.",
