      "sentences": "Dana, this is another attempt by the Trump team to try to delay Trump's sentencing up in New York. Now, in this letter sent to the judge today, obtained by CNN, they're making two key arguments. The first is they are arguing that this sentencing could have an impact on the 2024 presidential race. They're also arguing that they're still appealing how that historic Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity could apply to this conviction.Now, when it comes to that first argument about the election, they're trying to frame this, this case, this sentencing, as they have with all four of his criminal cases, as election interference. In this letter, they point to statements that the Democratic ticket has made about this case, and the fact that this sentencing, right in the middle of September, will take place around the same time that early voting starts in some states. They say, quote, \"Setting side naked election-interference objectives, there was no valid countervailing reason for the court to keep the current sentencing date on the calendar. There is no basis for continuing to rush.\" Now, Dana, there are legitimate, untested questions about just how close to a presidential election you can do things in a criminal case are related to a presidential candidate. And I said those are untested because, look, we've just never been here before. But his team is also continuing to appeal this question of how the Supreme Court's ruling could impact this conviction. They argue that the Supreme Court ruling means that certain pieces of evidence that were introduced during this trial need to be thrown out. Anything that could be an official act. Like, for example, they argue, his conversations with Hope Hicks, or things that he tweeted. Now, Dana, most legal experts do not believe they're going to be successful on that argument. But here, Todd Blanche, he says, \"The judge in this case is going to decide if the Supreme Court case applies to this case on the 16th and then sentence Trump on the 18th.\" They believe that is not enough time to adequately exercise the former president's rights to appeal. So, we'll see what the judge does here, Dana. A lot of really interesting legal questions being raised in this letter.",

A lot of people are very devastated by what's happened with inflation and all of the other things. So we're doing this as a intellectual speech. You're all intellectuals today. What happened to her laugh? I haven't heard that laugh in about a week. That's why they keep her off the stage.

I was talking to a Republican the other day about this and they made a really interesting point that Donald Trump has not really had to run a campaign so far. It was, you know, he kept being bolstered in the polls by people sympathetic to his indictments, this assassination attempt that he was running against Joe Biden, which people were unsure if they could -- he could run another -- serve another four years. And so, it wasn't a campaign. And now that he is against a campaign that is motivated, that has momentum, that has energetic, Donald Trump does not have the foundation at this point in his campaign to carry on with that. He doesn't really have a ground game in these battleground states. He hasn't really had a consistent message other than making fun of Joe Biden.

And yes, he won in 2016, but he lost in 2020. And, you know, every time there's been talk of Donald Trump is a changed person, he's going to be focused more on policy. He's changed because of the assassination attempt. It doesn't happen. It doesn't materialize. He's not able to stay focused. And I think, to Leigh Ann's point, it's a lot worse for him right now because of the fact that he isn't sure how to run against Kamala Harris. He is so focused on still his talking points that he had, what was effective against Joe Biden and pivoting now to her when he sees that a lot of the Democratic base is getting motivated by Harris at the top of the ticket. That one of his biggest arguments about Joe Biden being older than him and not being necessarily -- not necessarily running the country has totally been taken away from him and he's just -- has not been able to figure out how to effectively campaign against her.",
