Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" investigators announce a reward for information leading to the arrest of the mass shooting suspect in Texas. Details, plus the husband and father of two victims describes why he chose to run away from the gunfire.Regulators weigh bids for First Republic as they try to avoid what would be the second biggest bank failure in U.S. history. Plus, the crisis in Sudan, the first U.S. evacuation ship is expected to arrive at a Saudi Arabian port in the hours ahead. You will hear from those who managed to escape the fighting and what they endured. Thanks for being with us. Well, a small Texas town is in mourning and on edge after a deadly shooting in which five people were killed. This man lost his wife and nine-year-old son in the shooting. Meanwhile, more than 200 officers from multiple law enforcement agencies are involved in the manhunt for the suspected shooters. And, there is an $80,000 reward being offered for any information that could lead to his arrest. Authorities have identified the suspect as 38-year-old, Francisco Oropesa, a Mexican national. An FBI official told reporters, Sunday, they had, quote, \"zero leads\" on the suspect's whereabouts. CNN's Ed Lavandera has the latest.",

The husband and father of two of the five victims is detailing to us exactly how the night unfolded. Wilson Garcia says he was at home with a group of friends when they asked, he and two other men, walked over to the home, their neighbor's home, Oropesa, and asked him to stop shooting his weapon so close to their property because their baby was trying to sleep. He says they asked him just to shoot the weapons on the other side oftheir property. It was a very tense exchange. Garcia said they had already called authorities and 9-1-1 five times prior to that. And then, 10 to 20 minutes later, that's when Wilson Garcia says that Francisco Oropesa came back to their house, didn't say anything else, and started shooting people. One of the first to die, he said, was his wife. He says that the man then started going to the house shooting people in other rooms. Oropesa says one of the women told him to get out of the house as quickly as possible, because his wife and son were already dead and that they didn't want to lose him because his two other children shouldn't lose both parents. Horrific details that Wilson Garcia is detailing of those nights. In the meantime, investigators continue this manhunt. They have been searching for Francisco Oropesa since Friday night when he was able to flee the scene. But at this point, investigators say they have no idea where he might be. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The FDIC held an auction over the weekend trying to entice big banks to acquire this ailing regional bank. That is according to a person familiar with the matter. But we don't know yet the results of that auction, nor which, banks actually placed bids to buy First Republic.Now, unlike Silicon Valley Bank, which imploded almost out of nowhere last month. First Republic Bank has been really teetering for weeks. Share prices down by 97 percent since early March. It traded above $122 on March 1. Now sitting below $4. And this is not some tiny community bank. It's the 12th largest commercial bank in the U.S. It was sitting on $233 billion of assets, as of the end of March. That means that if the FDIC ends up seizing control of First Republic, this would be the second biggest bank failure in American history. Now, First Republic is based in San Francisco. It caters to wealthy clients. It has branches in Beverly Hills and Palm Beach, Greenwich, Connecticut, even has a branch right across the street from our offices here in Manhattan. The problem though is that two-thirds of its deposits were uninsured as of the end of last year. And we know uninsured deposits, they fled banks after the Silicon Valley Bank collapse last month. First Republic says that 41 percent of its deposits left the bank in the first quarter alone. That translates to a staggering loss of $72 billion in deposits. And that's despite the influx, the injection, of $30 billion of deposits from big banks just last month. Now, the question is whether not big banks are going to come to the rescue with an acquisition here. Or whether U.S. officials can stop this banking crisis before it spreads elsewhere. Back to you.",

Part of the problem for him is he's really raising these 1940s types of notions that unless a rape victim fights and screams, then they're basically not being sexually assaulted.He also has a little problem where he can't make up his mind. Is he really trying to argue that she consented which she's saying it didn't happen versus she's making it up. Arguments like you didn't scream enough or that you were laughing because she said she laughed to try and keep Trump off of her.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration is making clear that the border will not be wide open and regular border rules will be enforced. Meantime, Chicago's mayor is urging Texas Governor Greg Abbott to stop what she calls the inhumane and dangerous action of busing migrants to her city. Lori Lightfoot sent Abbott a letter stating in part, your lack of confederation or coordination in an attempt to cause chaos and score political points has resulted in a critical tipping point in our ability to receive individuals and families in a safe, orderly and dignified way. We simply have no more shelters, spaces or resources to accommodate an increase of individuals at this level with little coordination or care. That does not pose a risk to them or others.
