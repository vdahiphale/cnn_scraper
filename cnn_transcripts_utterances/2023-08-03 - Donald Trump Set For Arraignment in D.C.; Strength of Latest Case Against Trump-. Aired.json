But he will be able to be observed by a lot of people in the courthouse and in the courtroom itself, where he faces his charges related to January 6 and the 2020 election for the very first time. But the courthouse right now is in a state of hunkering down. There are judges that are here going about their business as usual. There are other criminal defendants who are having appearances today before judges, including a January 6 rioter, at his sentencing, where a judge remarked that nothing today will have any bearing on what that sentencing will be. And so it is a mood where this court still has a lot to handle, with so many January 6 rioters, many still Donald Trump supporters, coming through this courthouse on a daily basis, and also takes a pause to make sure that there is security in place, a lot of protocol around the former president coming into this federal courthouse for the very first time to make his appearance. We haven't seen any other really boldfaced names around here, other than just a few people from the special counsel's office trickling into the courthouse so far, but there have been a few people related to Donald Trump who have been out there already this morning talking about what is happening inside this courthouse, including ongoing investigations. One of those people, John Eastman's attorney, Harvey Silverglate, he was on CNN earlier today speaking with Poppy Harlow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're not seeing many people against the former president or necessarily people who are in favor of the former president, just not seeing those crowds yet. You could argue it's early, but, by this point in all the other arrangements, we had seen a fair number of people gathered. But a lot of the security, a lot of the attention right now is focused on the backside of the courthouse, the backside from where Katelyn was just reporting, because this is where we expect Trump to enter. We believe he's going to drive here along Third Street within his motorcade, and they're going to be bringing him. Back here into the courthouse. There are U.S. Marshals here. We have seen members, officers from, obviously, the Washington, D.C., police, with Secret Service agents. We have seen federal law enforcement all out here. And what they have also done, Kate, here, is what I want to show you. They put these snowplows here as just an extra layer of security here to essentially prevent anyone from trying to cross these metal barriers. We don't know if they're going to stay here. Maybe, once the motorcade gets here, they may move these trucks. But it's certainly an added layer that we didn't see in Florida's. We saw some of this in New York City, but we did not see this much security in Florida. So, here in Washington, D.C., they're not taking any chances. And they certainly have ramped up some of the security. And just all across here along the courthouse here, this is one of the other entrances that they have set up metal barriers. They are letting people come in this way. The streets are mostly open right now. We will see if that changes as the day goes on. But, right now, this is sort of the security of, metal barriers, these snowplows, and just law enforcement all around the building patrolling. We have seen bomb-sniffing dogs. We have seen other law enforcement officials here on bikes, sort of just preparing, waiting for the former president to make his appearance. And, for the most part, like I said earlier, we have not seen the level or the numbers of supporters that we have previously -- previously seen for the former president. But we will see what happens as the day goes. But the one thing for law enforcement here, with January 6, this is where it happened. The Capitol is just across the street. No one is taking any chances here, Kate.",

The charging document details how Trump and his campaign attempted to use this slate of fake electors in seven key states to try to secure his victory, or at least halt the congressional proceedings. With us now is CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig. Elie, reading through the indictment, it really struck me how important the fake electors are to the case being made by Jack Smith. So, just review, exactly what was that scheme?",

This is Arizona. And when you talk about action, what was done, they sent these documents into who? The U.S. Senate, the archivist of the United States, the secretary of state in this case for Arizona, and the chief judge of the federal court there. So, when people say, OK, speech is one thing, action here is the sending in of these documents. Let's take a quick look at what the document says, basically. We're not going to read all this, but it says:  We are the duly appointed electors for Donald Trump for president, for Mike Pence, for vice president. Again, these are states that actually did vote for Joe Biden. And then the actual electors, the people, signed these certificate, saying: Yes, this is us. We are the people.

They're going to say:  Everybody knew Donald Trump didn't win. We were just doing this for another reason. Specifically, these were being offered by us not as replacement electors, but alternate electors, just in case we won, we, Donald Trump's team, any of the then-ongoing court challenges. They're also going to argue, this was speech. This was political protest. This was a way to petition government and basically just register discontentment. Those will be the defenses.

I mean, the point is that there is nothing like this. This is not like a normal dispute between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans. It's about whether we're going to have a rule of law and have democratic elections. And there's got to be a line that someone could cross where you just can't accept them, regardless of your party.
