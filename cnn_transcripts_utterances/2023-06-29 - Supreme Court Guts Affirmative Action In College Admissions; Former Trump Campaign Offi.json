We have now learned that the federal grand jury, in Miami, is still investigating, three weeks after Donald Trump was indicted. More on that in a moment with Maggie Haberman. But first tonight, to the ruling that will change the landscape, of the education world and, also, maybe upend diversity policies, across this country. The fallout has been fierce, from the Supreme Court's decision, to gut affirmative action, from higher education, with President Biden condemning it, saying quote, \"This is not a normal Supreme Court,\" as he blasted the conservative super-majority, saying he believes they may be doing too much harm, to the country. The dissents, from the Liberals, on the court, was scorching. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writing, quote, \"With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the majority pulls the ripcord and announces 'colorblindness for all.' But deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.\" Conservatives are cheering this decision. Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion, said Harvard and UNC, the University of North Carolina, the two schools, at the center of this, that those programs violated the Constitution, writing, quote, \"The student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual -- not on the basis of race.\" Joining us now, with more, on what all of this could mean, going forward, is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic senator, Alex Padilla, of California. Senator, thank you, for joining us, tonight. Do you see this ruling as a step backwards? SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA): Kaitlan, thanks for having me on such an important day. Not only it's a step backwards. This ruling really does take us back decades, yet again, another example, of an extremist majority, on the Supreme Court, undoing decades, decades of precedent, and in this case, undoing affirmative action, which, maybe they just don't understand, what affirmative action is, or what affirmative action isn't. Affirmative action is not quotas. It's simply allowing the university systems, to consider race, among all the other factors, and criteria, in an admissions process. We've been through it here, in California, measure on the ballot in 1996 that was approved by the voters, forced this upon the University of California system, other state university systems. And they have not fully recovered, after nearly three decades, of trying to make up for that loss, of an important tool, in increasing diversity, on college campuses.",

And surprise, surprise, it tends to be, historically disenfranchised communities. And here, we are now talking about higher education. With today's ruling, the Supreme Court has made it harder, for young students of color, young, diverse students, from a life experience standpoint, to envision let alone access higher education. And, I don't want to assume what's going to happen, tomorrow, with the student debt case before them, the student loan case before them. But we could be very well on the verge of, for those who are able to get into colleges, and universities, for it to be much less affordable, for them, to obtain their four-year degrees.

Cornell William Brooks is the former President and CEO of the NAACP. And Wen Fa is the Director of Legal Affairs at the Beacon Center of Tennessee. Thank you both, for being here, tonight. When Chief Justice Roberts said today, in this, kind of had these two carve-outs, basically said, admissions committees can consider race, as long as it's limited to the specific context of a personal essay, for example.

The Supreme Court described the world that we may aspire to. It is not the world we live in. So, when students write about themselves, they write about themselves, in the context of a 2023 America. So, in other words, the George Floyd generation, which has literally seen, on television, discrimination and violence, and America's racial legacy? Were they to write about that, were they to write about that in the context of themselves, that might be considered constitutionally suspect. The point being here is that yes, individuals apply to college. But they apply to college, from groups, from communities, which are segregated, which was subject to racial discrimination. That cannot be ignored. And that is nowhere near in -- nowhere in the history or the context of the 14th Amendment. This decision is unfounded, constitutionally speaking.",

Personally, I've, worked on some of those cases. And from my perspective, covert racial discrimination is just as wrong, and just as illegal, as overt racial discrimination. And I think that's an issue that you'll see, before the Supreme Court, in the coming years. COLLINS: Cornell William Brooks, I think the other question is, beyond colleges and universities, they now have to go and revisit their admissions practices. But how do you believe this sets the stage, for challenges, to diversity efforts that we see, in businesses, and all these other aspects of American life?",

The ripple effects of this are of tidal wave proportions.So, in other words, by calling into question, by holding constitutionally suspect, as an unconstitutional, the diversity rationale, or the use of diversity, what you're going to see is perhaps, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion offices closing, companies are rolling back their commitments to diversity, which has consequences, and implications, for great many people, not merely African Americans, not merely Latinos, but a variety of other ethnic groups and women. Among the most prominent beneficiaries of affirmative action had been White women. When we think about, say, any of the cable networks, our major newspapers, where they were, when affirmative action started? We didn't see the diversity, on television, and in print that we see today. The consequences here could be devastating, likely devastating. California has yet to recover, from its repudiation of affirmative action. And the point being here is think about this. Where you have literally people being underserved, because they don't have access to Black doctors, which has an impact, on life expectancy, maternal expectancy, infant mortality, where people literally regard the court system as less than legitimate, when they don't see lawyers of variety of ethnicities? The point being here is that racial proxies are not enough. We live in a country that is color-conscious, color-coded and segregated. And to pretend otherwise is to literally to submit, to solidify America's legacy of racial supremacy -- racial supremacy. We cannot duck the question. And we certainly cannot ignore the victims.",

It could be that they're looking to do what's called a superseding indictment on Trump, and Walt Nauta, with additional charges. It could be that they're just looking to bolster evidence. But it means that this case is still very much ongoing, which again, just adds another fascinating and kind of shocking dimension, to a political candidacy, that this investigation, which has been really the most potent against Trump, is still in stages of discovering information. COLLINS: Yes. And the other complicating factor here is that we now know it's Susie Wiles. Anyone who covers Trump knows her. People at home may not recognize her name. But she is the individual, from Trump's Political Action Committee, that he showed that classified map to. They had referenced it in the indictment saying, \"During the meeting, Trump commented that an ongoing military operation in Country B was not going well.\" He \"showed the PAC Representative a classified map of Country B and told the PAC Representative that he should not be showing the map to them,\" and not to get too close. \"The PAC Representative did not have a security clearance or any need-to-know classified information about the military operation.\" But the fact that Trump is still with Susie Wiles, nearly, on a daily basis, just adds another layer, to the potential witnesses, that are around him, on a daily basis.",

One of the people in that meeting was Margo Martin, who travels with him frequently. Other people who are connected to his world, in various ways, are also part of this indictment. Walt Nauta himself is his co-defendant, and is on the plane, repeatedly. It does speak to the unprecedented nature of what we are seeing, in terms of the sprawl of this case, that the level of his prevalence, on the political scene, and his dominance, of this race, on the Republican side, for the presidential nomination, and the fact that it is overlapping with all of these legal matters. It is complicated. He is fundraising off of these indictments. He is fundraising off of these investigations. It is a core part of his messaging. So yes, this is going to, I suspect, keep coming up as a question. And just as an additional point, Kaitlan, as you know, the judge has told him that there is going to be a list of, or a bunch of witnesses, the government has produced a bunch of witnesses, that are connected to the case, who Trump is not supposed to discuss the case with.

The Russian Investigative Dossier Center, which obtained these documents that were then provided to CNN, found that at least 30 other senior Russian military members were also listed, as VIPs, in the group.
