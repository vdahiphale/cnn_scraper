The strike is supposed to last just three days, but the union groups involved say they'll plan an even longer strike in November if they don't get a new contract by then.Meantime, members of the American Actors Union, SAG-AFTRA, are still walking the picket lines nearly three months into their strike against television and film studios. After a full day bargaining session on Wednesday, talks are set to resume tomorrow. And as United Auto Workers continue their strike against the Big Three automakers, General Motors says the strike cost them $200 million over its first two weeks. Ford and Chrysler's parents, Stellantis, have not said how much the strike has cost them. Let's bring in CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, who joins us now with more. Vanessa, the UAW is set to give an update on where negotiations stand tomorrow. What do we anticipate we'll hear?",

He's holding it at 2But a person familiar with negotiations says that General Motors and the Union has made progress on key economic issues. And this is important because over the last three weeks, we have seen the Union announced strikes against General Motors three times, while just announcing strikes, expanded strikes against Ford and Stellantis twice. General Motors also telling us that the first two weeks of the strikes, the strike has cost them $200 million. And according to analysis that we have from Anderson Economic Group the total impact of the strike over the last two weeks has been about $4 billion. That's including that impact to those automakers, to consumers, to dealers and to the lost wages that many of these employees have seen. Also to note though, the lost wages for people who are on strike and the layoffs that these companies have announced more than 3,000, those individuals, Boris, though are eligible for strike pay. That's about $500 a week from the Union.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we were calling it the hot labor summer. As you mentioned, strikes across multiple industries. There's a couple of things going on. One is that many of the people who were working in these industries worked over the course of the pandemic, when many of us were working from home. And at that time, especially in the auto industry and also in healthcare, they watched these companies that they work for make record profits. They also look at the pay of many of these CEO's. Mary Barra makes almost $30 million a year, and she has seen her pay in increased by a significant amount. And the folks who are working for these companies feel like they should be on that same pay raise increase as these CEO's.Also, I think you have unions in some industries looking at unions and other industries and seeing the success of the Writers Guild who was on strike for many months come to a pretty good agreement at the end of their strike. So a lot of unions paying attention to what other unions and other industries are doing and wanting their fair share -- Boris. And it appears to be a ripple effect.

And so, though you can't really use the engine thrust reversing system that would usually bring an airplane to a stop.The runway there in Chattanooga, 7,400 feet long, a mile and a half long, they used up every inch of it and then some. So they went off the end of the runway there. Thankfully, nobody was hurt. The procedure says get out as quick as he can after something like that. So they evacuated. Even the firefighters there in Chattanooga said, good coordination, pilots did an excellent job. Now the NTSB is going to investigate and see exactly what went wrong here.

A federal court has approved this new map that significantly boosts the Black population of a second district out of seven in the state. Alabama Republicans fought the change, but their proposed map was twice rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.Also, friends and family of Ryan Clinkunbroomer are gathering today to pay tribute to the fallen law enforcement officer. The LA County Sheriff's deputy was shot in an ambush style killing last month. The 30-year-old had just gotten engaged days earlier. A suspect in the killing has been arrested and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for next month. And Adnan Syed, the subject of the popular serial podcast, is again arguing to keep his freedom. Syed was released last year after more than two decades in prison for the murder of an ex-girlfriend. A Baltimore judge overturned his conviction after city prosecutors found flaws in the evidence. But now the State's High Court is considering whether that decision violated the rights of the victims brother to have adequate notice to attend the hearing.

But that Turkish drone, it came really way too close for comfort there for the U.S. forces that are operating in northeastern Syria.What happened was early this morning, local time in Syria, the U.S. did observe an armed Turkish drone about half a kilometer away heading towards U.S. forces. It was in a restricted operating zone that the U.S. uses there to conduct its anti-ISIS work, in anti-ISIS missions. Well, according to our sources, the U.S. issued several warnings to this drone. Over a dozen warnings, warning that they were going to potentially shoot it down if it did not respond, and if it did not leave the area. Now, ultimately, an F16 fighter jet did in fact shoot that drone down. Now here's what Pentagon press secretary General Ryder told reporters today about how this all played out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON SPOKESMAN: U.S. commanders assessed that the UAV, which was now less than 1/2 a kilometer from U.S., forces to be a potential threat. And USF16 fighters subsequently shot down the UAV in self-defense at approximately 11:40 local time. It's important to point out that no U.S. forces were injured during the incident. We have no indication that -- that the -- that Turkey was intentionally targeting U.S. forces. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
