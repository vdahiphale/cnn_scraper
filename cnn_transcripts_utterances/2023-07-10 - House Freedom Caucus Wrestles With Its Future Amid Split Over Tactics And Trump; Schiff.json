She is obviously someone on the far right of her conference, but she is not viewed as welcome within the House Freedom Caucus because of her alliance with Kevin McCarthy.She's made a strategic decision to ally with them. She wants some key committee assignments. She supported him. But as a result, these members of this group simply just do not trust her, which is why she got kicked out of the group, which is a pretty remarkable statement in and of itself. And it's not insignificant to talk about this because they are the ones who can really hold things in limbo in the House. Just a few weeks ago, a handful of them decided to essentially paralyze the House for about a week because they did not get their say on the way things should go moving forward on spending. As a result, Kevin McCarthy had to cut a deal and to agree to move forward on spending levels to fund the government at a much lower level than what he agreed on in the debt limit deal. And that could potentially lead to a big shutdown fight in the fall. So these members and what they decided to do and their tactics have huge implications in Congress and on Washington.",

There are conservative leaders that sometimes decide they want to actually have the controls and get things done. We saw it with Jeb Hensarling, who is the head of the Republican Study Committee.You saw it with Mike Pence, who went from the head of the Republican Study Committee into Republican leadership and went into the fold. And by doing that, just like Marjorie Taylor Greene has done, just like Jim Jordan has done, you do risk eroding your cred with the more rabble rousing types. BASH: Yes, John Boehner started out as a rabble rouser and then he became speaker of the House. But I think that it's important to talk about what this means in the broader scheme of things within the Republican Party. Because as I'm reading this and we're talking about this, I'm thinking about the fact that the Freedom Caucus was formed to be a fiscally conservative group and to keep the Republican leadership on track on that. And just like so much of the Republican Party, it has been subsumed by the personality cult of Donald Trump.",

Even if you look at the Speaker's fight, right? You had people that were saying in the Freedom Caucus who were saying, we don't want to back Kevin McCarthy. Then you have Trump out there saying it. Then you start to see some members of the Freedom Caucus who are actually close to former President Trump. Marjorie Taylor Green, one of them, really coming out strong for Kevin McCarthy, just like Trump did. And then you start to see that break in unification.

Adam Schiff, who's one of three prominent Democrats in the United States House running for Senate even though there's no open Senate seat. Maybe there will be eventually. But Adam Schiff, $8.1 million. $8.1 million. And then you have Colin Alred, who is running for Senate in Texas, and then it goes down. By the way, John Tester, $5 million, that's a lot of money in Montana. Montana is not expensive. OK, the other thing we want to say is that if you look at all of those names, keep it up there. You know what we're missing? A Republican. All of those top fundraisers, they are all Democrats. The Republican who came the closest is Bernie Moreno, who is running for Senate for, for the Senate seat in Ohio. He wants to run against Jared Brown. He got $2.2 million.

That's Maureen Dowd's argument in this weekend's New York Times. Her column Saturday Headline is stinging it's seven Grandkids, Mr. President.The headline is a rebuttal to a piece of reporting from the papers Katie Rogers about Hunter Biden's daughter, the four-year-old lives in rural Arkansas. Her mother sued for child support and reached a settlement with the President's son. According to the Times, the President does not acknowledge the girl and he expects his staff to follow his lead. Quote, in strategy meetings in recent years, aides have been told that the Bidens have six, not seven, grandchildren. That's according to two people familiar with the discussions. Again, according to the Times. Dowd finds that anathema to decency and to the Biden brand. Quote, The President's cold shoulder and heart is counter to every message he has sent for decades, and it's out of sync with the America he wants to continue to lead. And our panel is with us now. This is a story that is sad and disturbing on so many levels. Yes, it is political for a couple of reasons. Number one, yes, Republicans are using it and are going to take advantage of it in a way that is unfortunate and inappropriate. But the reason they are doing that is because and able to do that is because of the brand and the kind of person that we all know and believe Joe Biden to be. Because it's who he says he is and it's somebody who is a family man. That's what we see all of the time. This is what Joe Biden said just in April, at the end of April. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Best part of it all, I have six grandchildren and I'm crazy about them. I speak to them every single day. Not a joke. Matter of fact, I just got finished going through the calls and only one of them answered the phone. Guess what? They're crazy about me because I pay so much attention to them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
