You can see a rather subdued day for the Dow, not so for the NASDAQ again, up more than one percent. Those are the markets and these are the main events. Joe Biden's allies push back at questions about his age and memory. Vladimir Putin suggests a deal can be reached to free detained US reporter, Evan Gershkovich. And it's also of course, the Super Bowl for advertisers. The Mondelez CEO joins me to explain why they are shelling out big bucks for a spot for Oreo. Live from New York, it is Friday, February 9th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. Thanks for being with us. Any moment now, we're expecting to see Joe Biden with the German Chancellor. Now Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived at the White House. You see pictures there. He just arrived moments ago. The meeting comes as US President Biden faces headaches on multiple fronts. His meeting with Olaf Scholz will center of course on providing aid to both Ukraine and Gaza. The White House meantime is trying to defend the president now that a special counsel report has come out on his handling of classified documents. While Joe Biden is not facing any charges, and that's key to remember here, the report raises damaging questions about his age and mental faculties. Members of the Biden administration, though, are pushing back. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Joe Biden stood -- President Joe Biden stood in front of reporters answering their questions, and he grew increasingly frustrated. And at one point in time, emotional, just talking about how this report tried to make references to his memory and brought up that he didn't remember the date of when his son, Beau died. And so this is how they kind of plan to kind of head-on straight address some of the things that came out of this report is to have the president keep going on the campaign trail, but just address some of these questions. Even at the press conference earlier today, they really kind of pushed back on the things that the report was alleging to, and talks about Biden's age and memory and what they've done in the past, especially when this has come up time and time again about Biden's age and whether that will impact how voters feel about him running for re-election, they have pointed to how his age just really signals and represents the amount of experience he has had in office and how he is best suited for this role and to govern America and at this point in time while there are so many things happening in this country and in the world.",

But when these questions do arise about his age and his memory, Biden has been clear, and he made it clear at the press conference yesterday, saying that my memory is fine, and when someone asked him whether the conclusions or allegations that came out of this report, whether that will fuel voters' concerns about his memory, and whether he is best suited to be president, again, he simply stated that he is more than capable in this job and that he is best suited to continue running for president and to govern the US in the next four years -- Paula.",

The vice president did today, she talked about some of the meetings they were in October 8th and 7th -- October 8th right after the attacks in Israel. She talks about that. We also have a quote -- we also listened to the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff, Mark Milley, who said that he engaged with him frequently, found him alert, sound, does his homework, reads all the papers, read ahead materials. He is up on very serious matters of war and peace and life and death. Right? So the people who are in the meetings with him, the most important meetings, the Situation Room meetings, they know. I was at the White House for a year, and I'll tell you, staffers knew when you go in -- when my friends would go in to brief the president, the president of the United States would ask questions and pepper them. He knew information. So it's not somebody who I think is not in charge and that rumor or that feeling is just not accurate. So the campaign has got to get out there, they've got to show the president engaging. They've got to show him really being on top of the issues that people are taking care of, but it may not be an issue in the ways that we're used to, right? It may not be in the sit-down interview at the Super Bowl, but it might be him going to people's homes, it might be him doing more individual meetings with two or three or four people, those things may end up on social media.

Gas prices are going down. Unemployment is going down. He could talk about all of those things, investment in science and technology and semiconductors are going up.

But right now, what's happening, everybody is very aware of this inside the Biden world is the Republicans are having their own intramural fight.

Let them sort that out, and when they sort that out, then you have the president's ability to come in and talk a little bit more about the fact that Donald Trump, when faced with the greatest threat America has faced, probably since World War Two or 9/11 for sure, which was the pandemic, Donald Trump fell on his face, he couldn't do it.

I mean, up until this point, what we have seen is a ramp up in US pressure on Israel, a ramp up in the rhetoric, includingfrom the president himself, about the ways in which the Israeli military is conducting its operations in Gaza, what we have yet to see is tying any of that tough rhetoric to actionable steps using the kind of leverage that the United States has over Israel, including military aid and weapons shipments to Israel to tie any of that to Israeli military policy. The White House just doesn't seem to be willing to take things that next step further. What they are making clear, though, is that they believe that a military operation in Rafah right now, would be a disaster. That's according to the National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, if the Israeli military doesn't do the kind of planning that would need to be done to protect the civilian population. So for now, more rhetoric, no clear sense that they will go any further than that. But I think one last thing to keep in mind is the fact that this is all coming under the context of ongoing negotiations with Hamas for a potential ceasefire, and there is a school of thought that this rhetoric about a planned offensive in Gaza, in Rafah may not be a bluff, necessarily, but it may be part of a pressure tactic to get Hamas to agree to a deal that would be more favorable to Israel's terms for the release of hostages and a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.",

So, you're in Vegas for the big game. I'll ask you later if you've got tickets and where they are. But for now, I want to ask you, everyone knows what an Oreo is, right? I think so.

But again, if you want to have a brand like Oreo top of mind of consumers, andwhenever they're going to go for a cookie, you want them to first think about Oreo, you need to constantly keep the brand alive through communication, innovation, new things. The brand is also a brand that's very linked to cultural events. For instance, we're running this around the world with what is locally very active, which happens to be the Super Bowl here in the U.S. But we link the brand to many other big events that are going on around the world.

There is as you were saying the wages, there is thetransportation, there is all the different ingredients that we use. And what is strange is that now in 20 to 23, we had big inflation there. So, this year, what we're seeing in 24, is some of these factors are coming down, but then others are going up quite a bit. And so, the net effect for a company like ours is that we are still seeing quite a bit of inflation in our input costs this year, and we will have to unfortunately increase prices again. Now, the good news is that for this year, it's mainly our chocolate brands, milk at Cadbury, Toblerone that are affected because cocoa main ingredients of chocolate is at its highest level in the last 30 years or so as it relates to the cost. So, it's a strange phenomenon that everybody would expect the cost to come down. But it seems to be every year there's something else that starts to increase in incredible way.",
