Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. And we begin with the rehabilitation of Europe's former problem child. Greece has come a long way since it stood on the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago after years of painful austerity measures, tax hikes, pension cuts, and huge bailout checks. Its post pandemic economy is now outpacing the eurozone average. And, despite a spying scandal, rising inflation, and a traffic train crash that caused the death of 57 people, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' center-right party tapped into underlying optimism, especially among younger voters to win a convicting victory on Sunday. And he joins me now, exclusively in the first interview since his party's election win on Sunday. Prime Minister, welcome back to the program.",

We have delivered our main commitment, which I undertook four years ago, and I think the Greek people have rewarded us, not just for the progress that the economy has made, but also, they bought into our plan for a future. For a Greece that is much more prosperous, that is going to get closer to Europe when it comes to wages.

First and foremost, it isclear that your migration policies resonated with the people in your country. However, it has probably not escaped your attention that the E.U., the commissioner for migration has sent a message to the Greek authorities for a full and independent investigation of what was broken by \"The New York Times,\" which is the allegation that your government basically illegally allowed the sort of setting adrift some migrants in the Aegean. And I want to play a video that I know that you have seen, which is what the E.U. -- sorry, \"The New York Times\" got exclusively from the actual aid worker in question, which shows migrants, these migrants being put onto a truck and them being put onto a boat, then onto a coast guard boat, and finally being set adrift in the -- on a raft in the Aegean. So, my first question to you is, will you order your government to make a full and independent investigation of what happened?",

      "sentences": "I have already done so, Christiane. I take this incident very seriously. It is already being investigated by my government. So, that's avery straightforward answer to your question. But I want to also make a broader point about migration, which I think will be of interest to your viewers. Back in 2015, 75 percent of all of the illegal migrants who arrived into Europe came to Greece. We essentially had an open border policy, and this put the whole sort of Schengen (ph) zone in Europe under tremendous pressure. I've been advocating since I came into power for a tough but fair border control policy, and I can tell you that the less people we have at sea, the less risk we have of people dying at sea. And I am very, very happy that we have significantly reduced the -- we have essentially killed the business model of the illegal smugglers. We have fewer people, significantly fewer people arriving on Greek island. But at the same time, we also are able to shelter them in humane facilities. We have significantly accelerated our asylum procedures and we have also addressed a very painful problem, which was the issues -- the issue of unaccompanied minors, which we also inherited when we came into power four years ago. So, I think we have an overall comprehensive migration policy, and I think we've also made the case to Europe that you cannot have a comprehensive European approach to migration unless you control your external borders. At the same time, you need to open legal pathways to migration, but you need to crack down on the smugglers. They are the ones responsible for putting people at risk at sea. And frankly, this is something that my government simply cannot tolerate.",

I cannot comment, you know, on the outcome of the Turkish elections. They will also -- they're having a second round. We're also going to be having a second election, but I also know that the Turkish foreign policy is not going to change from one moment to the next. Turkish foreign policy over the past years has been revisionist. What they call their Blue Homeland doctrine is clearly threatening Greek sovereignty and Greek sovereign rights, and we have an obligation to defend the sovereignty and our sovereign rights. At the same time, I will be the first, Christiane, to always make a gesture of goodwill towards Turkey, hand out, you know, my hand in a gesture of friendship. I think there is a way of resolving our main issue, which is the delimitation of a maritime zones in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean as long as we adhere to international law. We've been able to delimitate our maritime zones with Italy, we did the same with Egypt. There's no reason why we counted the same with Turkey, as long as we agree that we need to adhere to good neighborly relations and use the toolkit of international law to solve our disputes. So, I would hope that if -- you know, after the next elections, President Erdogan continues, and I also have the honor to serve my people as prime minister, that, you know, things will -- could continue to improve.

It is said that the E.U. has also created so-called the Mitsotakis exception regarding migrants coming into your country, because you are stopping them coming from further into the E.U.

We need to continue to have growth rates that are significantly higher than the eurozone average, which means more investment, more job creation, but at the same time, also very much advocating a very progressive agenda when it comes to public health, public education, and the reduction of inequalities. If you ask me what is sort of my one overarching priority, it would be to deliver higher growth rates by reducing inequality at the same time. And we have actually reduced inequality over the past two years because we have offered targeted assistance during the pandemic and during the cost-of- living crisis to those who required it the most. At the same time, I am really pushing our green and digital agenda. And of course, the modernization of the state, as you pointed out, is a big priority for the second term. I think that we've done incredible things when it comes to facilitating the interaction of Greek citizens with the state in terms of using technology, but we know that there's still lots of issues when it comes to the hard-core public sector that we need to address, and this will certainly be one of my priorities should I have the opportunity to serve for a second term as prime minister. But I think what is important to understand when it comes to the recollection is that we have basically been able to defeat, you know, the populist opposition for a second time in a row. And I think that it is proof that, at the end of the day, if you deliver results for people, you know, the populist narrative, you know, the fantasies of easy solutions over tangible results, this is, I think, an encouraging message for everyone, certainly in Europe, that if you can actually deliver real change for people, people will reward you in the ballot box. And for me, this has been the most encouraging message of this election. Not only do we increase our, our share of the vote, our actual number of votes but also, the opposition, the populist opposition was essentially destroyed in this election. We have a 20-point margin. We gained twice as many votes as they did. So, I think there's something happened in Greece which, I think, will resonate across other liberal democracies when it comes to this sort of inherent fight between people who are focused on offering solutions and those who are just engaged in the lovely politics of offering empty promises.",

But then, also, the public sector, the state has got to be there to leverage in the private sector investment. And many businesses say to me, we want to invest, but we need to know what the vision, what the mission is of the government. We need some stability to know where we are going, stability on regulation, stability on taxes, stability on the government's priorities as well. But we can unlock that investment. I was talking to date U.S. investors who have big stakes in the U.K. economy, and one of the things they say to me is that our planning rules, our relationship with Europe all make the U.K. a less attractive place than it was a few years ago.

The large- scale busing though from places like Texas and Arizona, I think, one, has been fine on the merits, because they asked these migrants, well, where do you want to go? And they say Chicago and New York. They say, OK, this is the bus. And by demonstrating to blue cities that are, in theory, sanctuary cities, that this is a real problem, that these folks, they're desperate, but they also are a burden to public services and to the taxpayers. The City of Chicago has declared an emergency, over 8,000 illegal migrants arriving since last August. Just 8,000. You know, a city of 2.6 million. What do they think is like in the border? What do they think it's like in El Paso? So, I think that's actually -- that policy has really brought home that point. And we wouldn't hear, you know, the mayor of New York, Eric Adams, saying, we need to close the border and do a better job at it unless New York now has skin in the game the way border cities do as well.",

You know, I think it's important to make the case against him on a number offronts, especially -- and this is going to be tricky, you know, for someone like DeSantis, who wants to win over a fair amount of these MAGA voters, you've got to be willing to sail off of 2020. Because if you didn't lose in 2020, what electability case do you really have against him, right? He's -- he was -- he's not a loser, he's a victim, and maybe he should be the rightful heir to the nomination yet again to write this wrong. So, I think that's a key area where you can't dance around. You just got to say, the election was legitimate. He lost and the problem is that he could lose again.",
