And at the very start where Israel's Prime Minister today warned will be a long and difficult fight against Hamas. There's little doubt about that. It is a battle being waged right now in the sky as over Israel in other locations within rocket range of Gaza. Israel's Iron Dome system has been engaging incoming targets. You hear that from time to time here in Tel Aviv, right in the last few hours, it's just been a distant boom, far off but closer to the border obviously, much more noticeable. According to an IDF spokesman just a moment ago, the effort now just is getting underway with the aim of disarming Hamas as a fighting force.",

And one of the most searing images that we have seen since the attack began. We just got new video from that speech, that scene that speaks to the deadly chaos. Abandoned cars spread across the roadside shot up burned out. In all we're told upwards of 260 bodies have now been recovered from just the festival site alone. The attack on it, of course is part of a coordinated wave of strikes in Hamas is initial assault on Israeli border locations.

KAYE (voice-over): Iron Dome was developed by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, who later joined forces with Raytheon technologies. The air defense system was first put into place in 2011. Its technology considered a game changer for Israelis. This video from Raphael advanced defense system shows how Iron Dome works to stop incoming rockets. According to the company, Iron Dome has the ability to shoot down multiple rockets in mid-air using a mobile battery system that includes radar, a control center and interceptor missiles. When radar recognizes that an enemy rocket has been launched, the control center calculates its flight path. If it's deemed dangerous, a missile is fired from the launcher, which holds 20 interceptor missiles.",

Obviously, that Iron Dome system has done extraordinary things for protecting Israel over the years. But this kind of attack that we have seen in the last 48 hours is really unprecedented for the multi-pronged nature of it.COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, it sure is, Anderson. And one of the things to note, though, about the attack, is the fact that the missiles that the Hamas sent into Israel. They actually had a fairly short flight path their trajectory was also fairly limited. And that made it more difficult for the Iron Dome, or, frankly, any other system to intercept those missiles and those rockets. So it's a pretty hard task before the Iron Dome system anyways. But the fact that the missiles came in, and such a low distance, and it's such a low altitude that made it a little bit harder for the Iron Dome to pick up many of them.",

That is so what you're basically dealing with is the abduction by a de facto before in government of the probably about 100 or so Israeli citizens and others that are a part of this group. And really what it is a grand hostage taking scheme at this point. And that is something that is going to be really difficult for the Israelis involved in a military way because they could be dispersed they could be moved into areas that are very different from an intelligence standpoint, and from a breaching standpoint. So it makes it really hard to go after not impossible, but very hard.",

So far, we have not seen indications of that ground incursions starting imminently. But I think it's a question more about when that happens. And not if that happens, just based off of the atrocities that have happened so far. The sheer number of casualties and of course, the hostages because you can't exactly get extricate hostages from the air that will have to be some sort of ground presence on the ground in order to try to get them out.",
