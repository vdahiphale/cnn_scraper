He's also a politics and foreign policy reporter for Axios. All right, Barak, you heard Danny Ayalon there congratulating Israeli forces. Has the IDF commented on this yet at all? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Hi. The IDF did not comment on it yet. I think in something like five or 10 minutes there will be a press conference with an IDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari. But I do not expect them to take responsibility for this attack. It seems the Israeli policy right now is to keep silent, at least in public, at least on the record. While off the record and in back in conversations, the Israelis basically confirmed that it was them who assassinated Al-Arouri. And Israeli officials tell me that now they are preparing for a pretty harsh Hezbollah retaliation for this assassination. They think that Hezbollah might even launch long-range missiles at targets inside Israel, even as far as Tel Aviv.",

But he was even more significant than that because Al-Arouri had two roles. One role was a political leader inside Hamas, number two in Hamas' Political Bureau. But his more important role was the commander of Hamas's military wing in the West Bank. From Beirut, he orchestrated attacks in the West Bank against Israel in the last year. Those attacks have dramatically increased. But I think the most important thing to know about this attack is that it happened in the heart of Beirut, very close to Hezbollah's headquarters. And this would lead, I think -- it's very likely this would lead to an escalation in the situation on the border between Israel and Lebanon. It could, in a very extreme scenario, even lead to a war on the northern front.",

I think, you know, it means that they knew or that they know this could lead to a war with Lebanon, and they still did it because they thought that he's one of the masterminds of the October 7th attack.And I think they wanted to send a message not only to Hamas, but others in the region that they are ready to act against anybody who's trying to attack is rule, or who was involved in the October 7th attack, regardless what the retaliation might be. And I think it's very interesting that the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is scheduled to give a major speech tomorrow. And I think all eyes should be on Nasrallah and what he says and what he does. Because this will determine how the region will look like in the next weeks and months.",

Wander Franco, the shortstop for the Tampa Bay Rays, under arrest in the Dominican Republic. He's accused of having an appropriate relationship with a minor. He is a Dominican native who was arrested Monday after appearing before prosecutors to respond to the allegations. Franco has been on administrative leave from Major League Baseball since the accusations came to light last summer. And a surprising discovery on a California beach. Yes, that is a rusty old bomb that washed up on shore just days after the heavy surf pounded the coast. Look at that. That is an ordinance disposal technician there. The bomb squad with the Santa Cruz Sheriff's Office responding, determining that it actually was safe. Then personnel from nearby Travis Air Force Base collected the weather device. The beach where that explosive was found was among the areas evacuated last week because of those 25- to 30-foot waves. And someone is starting the new year a whole lot richer. Winning that ticket for the $842.4 -- can't forget that .4 -- I guess it doesn't mean much considering it's $842 but still -- million-dollar Powerball prize that was purchased in Grand Blanc, Michigan, which is near Flint. It was the second-largest lottery jackpot ever won in Michigan. And the person who won has not contacted Michigan lottery officials yet. So, hey, if you recently bought a ticket at the Food Castle in Grand Blanc, check your ticket now, pronto. The winning numbers are 12, 21, 42, 44, 49, and the Powerball, 1. Man.",
