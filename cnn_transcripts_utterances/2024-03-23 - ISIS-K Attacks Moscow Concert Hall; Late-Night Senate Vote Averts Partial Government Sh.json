In many cases, interestingly, Putin had opened his borders to send Russians who wanted to fight on the side of ISIS so that effectively they would -- they would die there rather than be in Russia as a potential destabilizing force. Now you also heard the Russian security services, just in the last weeks, even as Putin himself may have dismissed this warning from the United States government, the Russian security services said they had thwarted at least two attacks, where they said ISIS was prepared to attack a chemical plant. And then at a synagogue, where the same cell apparently was planning an attack on a synagogue and they thwarted this.

So on that line, this attack, that this could be carried out right on the outskirts of Moscow, again, at a very popular venue on a Friday night, innocent Russians being attacked in this way, certainly there will be questions. Now whether those questions will be asked openly, given Putin's authoritarian grip, he has really tightened. There is no opposition left in Russia.

We also have the talks that we believe are still ongoing here in Doha.And then you had the U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken meeting with Israel's prime minister and the war cabinet in Israel. Now we'll start with that. So we did hear from the secretary of state saying that he believed talks for a ceasefire were -- the gaps were narrowing but there are still gaps. And when he was talking to Israel's prime minister, he highlighted the fact that the U.S. does not support a ground operation in Rafah, saying that it would be a humanitarian catastrophe. The fact that there are so many that are sheltering there, anywhere up to 1.5 million. And of course, the fact that the main entrance land crossing into Gaza is in Rafah as well. So really pushing Israel's prime minister not to consider that. But we did hear from Benjamin Netanyahu shortly afterwards. And it appeared that he had taken no notice what the secretary of state had said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator): I met today with Secretary of State Blinken. I don't think that I greatly appreciate the fact that, for more than five months, we are standing together in the war against Hamas. I also told him that we recognize the need to evacuate the civilian population from war zones. And of course, to take care of the humanitarian needs, we are working for this. But I also said that we have no way to defeat Hamas without entering Rafah and eliminating the rest of the Hamas battalions there. And I told him that we hope we will do it with the support of United States. But if we have to, we'll do it alone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Sympathy has been pouring in since she released a video announcing her condition on Friday. She asked for privacy as she focuses on chemotherapy treatment and returning to full health.Catherine has been out of the public eye since late December and speculation about her has grown to a fever pitch in recent weeks. Now despite the rampant conjecture about her condition, Kensington Palace stayed mostly silent about the Princess of Wales for weeks. As frustrating as that might be for the public and those of us in the news business, it is standard operating procedure for British royals. CNN's Tom Foreman explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Even when Queen Elizabeth the Second was in the final year of her life, slowing down, using a cane, canceling engagements, the Palace said she was fine. And the story of solid health held on, even after a tabloid revealed she had been in the hospital. KATE WILLIAMS, CNN HISTORIAN &amp; ROYAL EXPERT: But I think that as soon as the winter is over, she will be keen, to get back on her feet, back out there, meeting people. It's just whether or not the doctors are going to agree with it. FOREMAN (voice-over): Like so much around the Royals, secrecy about health is a deep-seated tradition. The castle was cagey about Prince Philip's condition, the year he died. Rumors of eating disorders swirled around Princess Diana long before she confirmed them. DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES: I have it, on very good authority, that the quest for perfection our society demands can leave the individual gasping for breath. FOREMAN (voice-over): Meghan Markle says her mental health was so taxed, by life in the Palace, she considered suicide. But she talked to Oprah about it only on her way out.",

But even when the royals had lost almost all their practical power, maladies of the monarchs remained largely private, such as King George VI's battle with stuttering and lung cancer.
