And before we do, I want you to see on your screen the committee hearing where the Secret Service head is getting grilled is continuing. We will check back in on that in just a bit.But first, we want to talk to Democratic Governor Jared Polis of the great state of Colorado, who is the president of the National Governors Association and is one of the many who have now endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Thanks for being here, Governor. 24 hours ago, this was a rematch between two old white men. Now, this is a very different race. What do you think Democrats need to do to harness this new energy and not squander it? GOV. JARED POLIS (D), COLORADO: Well, look, the Democrats needed something to mix it up, and we got it. We got a vibrant, exciting, experienced young candidate with a vision about the future of our country. We also have somebody who's uniquely qualified to be president. I mean, she's put criminals behind bars, right? She's served in statewide office, and of course, she was right alongside President Biden on the international stage and working to be ready day one to lead the most powerful and most important country in the world. So I'm excited, and that excitement out there is palpable. Kamala Harris is going to be an amazing president. And as the father of a 10-year-old daughter, I was so excited to be able to tell her yesterday that our country is about to have our first woman president. It's about time.",

They're ready to go, whether they bring a swing state, whether they bring a key demographic. I think it's a great opportunity to grow. But, look, this is always decided on the top of the ticket, right? So this is going to be Trump, if he stays in and doesn't drop out, versus Kamala Harris.

MIKE JOHNSON (R), HOUSE SPEAKER: In some of the states, there are impediments to just switching someone out like that. 14 million people went through the process and chose this nominee, Joe Biden. Now a handful of people have gotten together and decided he's no longer suitable. That's not how this system works. They are violating democratic principles. And I think that's a real problem.
