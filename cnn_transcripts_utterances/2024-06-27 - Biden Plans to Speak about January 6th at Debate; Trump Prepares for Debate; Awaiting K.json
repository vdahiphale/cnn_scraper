The other is a gentleman named Saeed Jalili, who many in the west will still know because he was once Iran's chief nuclear negotiator.Both of these politicians have said that they would continue the path of Ebrahim Raisi, which of course means a tough line towards the U.S. and a tough line towards Israel as well. Of course, one of the things that we know is that right now there is lot of turmoil here in the Middle East. And Iran and Israel were very close to an all-out war quite recently that could have also had massive repercussions for the U.S. and its assets here in this region. Now, there is still one moderate who is in the race. His name is Massoud Pezeshkian. And he's actually called for better relations, especially with countries here in the middle eastern region. It's unclear how much of a chance he actually has though. In the end, though, one of the things that we've also picked up is that a lot of people here are telling us that they will also be closely watched the debate on CNN between President Biden and Donald Trump. Of course, whoever becomes the next U.S. president, also a big issue here in Iran as well. Kate.",

Our special coverage of tonight's historic presidential debate starts now.And right now President Biden is at Capp David, where he spent the last few days deep in debate preparations. This morning CNN has learned a little bit more about how President Biden is specifically preparing to handle - not even talking - not just talking about policy, but also the insults and attacks that are sure to be coming from Donald Trump during this debate against his family, including specifically likely against his son, Hunter. CNN's Kayla Tausche is with us here in Atlanta. You have fresh reporting about what is to come from President Biden on the debate stage. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, we're hearing specifically about a key tenant of his messaging as it regards to January 6th. We've learned that President Biden intends to frame the insurrection as a watershed moment for voters, not unlike the way that the 2004 election was the first election that voters went to the polls after 911. So, it became a referendum on 911. And in 2008, that election was at the height of the financial crisis. And so that became the pivotal moment, the pivotal issue that voters were really galvanized by.And President Biden intends to frame the insurrection in the same way, that it should be - it should light a fire under people to get them to the ballot box. This electorate that's been largely disengaged. And one source that I spoke with about this messaging said that the president will say that the embodiment of that threat to democracy is returning and that the insurrection, coupled with the overturning of Roe, should be the two forces that show Americans, in their words, that democracy is unraveling. To that end, the campaign is also launching attacks on Project 2025, which is Trump's transition playbook. They launched a website. I'm told they're going to be pushing QR codes to people. One of their strategies is to use Trump's own words and Trump's own plans against him because they believe that they're not popular with voters and that voters are not aware of a lot of the things that Trump has said. So, we'll see how that plays out throughout the day today. As I've been reporting, the Biden schedule for today is fairly fluid. When they went to bed last night, they wanted to allow for the possibility that President Biden woke up this morning and wanted to do another mock debate, depending on how he felt. They have a few hours before they arrive here in Atlanta. And then there are a few campaign events before they really get ready. There's still some discussion over whether the president will eat before the debate, whether he'll eat afterward, how many orange Gatorades he'll have and the like.",

I can tell you that Donald Trump's team has been paying very close attention to the news coming out about the preparations that Joe Biden is doing.  I mean actually one Trump adviser had told me a turning point for them where you saw them go on offense much more aggressively and actually tried to raise the bar for the expectations regarding Joe Biden's performance changed when they learned that he would be spending an entire week at Camp David,I also know that they are paying very close attention to this specific messaging, including on the discussions around the January 6th attack on the Capitol. The Biden campaign's intent to want to push him toward talking about abortion. Obviously, both issues that Donald Trump has struggled on messaging wise for the last several months. These are all conversations that Trump's advisers are having with the former president behind the scenes. Now, to go through his schedule, over the past two days he has been at Mar-a-Lago. He will be leaving his Mar-a-Lago club later today. He's expected to land in Atlanta around 5:30 and do some last preparations with his team before heading over to the debate. And to just think about the messaging that actually Trump's team wants to focus on. They want him to avoid personal attacks. You heard Kayla talk about the Biden team preparing for potential attacks on Hunter Biden. That is a line of attack that Donald Trump's team does actually not want him to go and do. He did talk about that back in 2020 in that first debate between the two men and it didn't go well for him. And so Trump's team has actually been urging him not to talk about personal grievances or personal attacks on Joe Biden's family and instead focus on the economy, inflation, and the border. And these are all things that we heard them roll out in a new ad campaign today. And what's really notable about this ad campaign, it's actually the first time we're seeing ads from the Trump campaign since he became the presumptive Republican nominee. Take a listen to that ad.

What would a debate victory actually look like? Joining me now, Democratic media consultant Brian Goldsmith, former senior adviser to Tim Scott's presidential campaign, Matt Gorman, and CNN political commentator and former lieutenant governor of Georgia, Geoff Duncan. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here. Brian, I'm going to start with you because we've got this new reporting that is coming from our Kayla Tausche about the plans on the debate stage for President Biden, and basically what he's saying as he's going to very much starkly show and talk about the seismic shift that happened in this country after the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Something that you should expect, correct? BRIAN GOLDSMITH, DEMOCRATIC MEDIA CONSULTANT: Oh, for sure. I think it would be very surprising if the president didn't talk about January 6th. On the other hand, I think most of the people who are convinced by the need to preserve American institutions and our democracy are already winning the president. He's got to convince people who are struggling with house payments and car payments, who believe that the economy is in a recession right now. So, I would lean much more into project 2025, the threats to American families, than the threats to American institutions.",

They want to save capitalism and they want to have, as Brian said actually, I agree with a lot of what he said, talk about the economy.
