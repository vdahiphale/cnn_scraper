The President-Elect in the nation's capital today, the first time since the election, where his latest cabinet picks are sending shockwaves through Capitol Hill, with even some Republicans privately asking, Really? I'm Kaitlan Collins, live from Washington. And this is THE SOURCE. Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. Tulsi Gabbard as the Director of National Intelligence. And Pete Hegseth as the Secretary of Defense. The shockwaves from those cabinet selections are still reverberating here in Washington tonight, where gas could be audibly heard, on Capitol Hill, after the President-Elect posted on social media that he was picking one of his fiercest loyalists, and one of the Justice Department's biggest critics, and at one point, the subject of one of its investigations, as his choice for the nation's top law enforcement official. Now, Gaetz denied wrongdoing, and was never charged by the Justice Department, in that federal sex trafficking probe. But he remains under investigation by -- former -- sexual misconduct by the House Ethics Committee. That is until he resigned from the House, tonight, according to Speaker Mike Johnson. Republicans on the Hill seemed unsure of how to respond, at times. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Well, it's an interesting pick. Highly loyal to President Trump. Again, I don't know enough about him, in terms of his ethic charges, and that's why I say it's a somewhat interesting pick. We'll have to see how that all unfolds. REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): If you want to clean out the Department of Justice, this is who you want. SEN. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R-WV): The President has the prerogative to nominate who he wishes. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): I was shocked that he has been nominated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Wanting someone who is not only a loyalist, but also willing to carry out his agenda at the Justice Department. Purging career employees, getting retribution against his political opponents. He passed over several more conventional names that he had been considering, and potentially smoother confirmations.And I have some brand-new reporting, tonight, on what the Justice Department leadership could look like under Trump. I can report tonight that the President-Elect is seriously considering naming his lead attorney, Todd Blanche, to serve as the next Deputy Attorney General. Now, nothing has been finalized or announced, I should note. But Blanche is a former federal prosecutor, who has now represented Trump, for the last 18 months or so, including during his criminal hush money trial, earlier this year, in New York. Trump and Blanche have grown close, and in that time and because of Trump's trust in him, it was widely expected inside Trump's inner circle that if he won, Blanche would likely follow him into the federal government. If Blanche is ultimately nominated here, he would need to be confirmed by the Senate, before running the department that is one of the most prioritized by Donald Trump. And tonight, certainly one of the most controversial. I want to get straight to Capitol Hill, this hour, where CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent, Manu Raju, is working his sources.

That is still a bit of an open question, at this moment, Kaitlan.But one reason why that has been delayed, for this so long, is that the Ethics Committee, we are told, couldn't release that information earlier, because it was so close to an election, so they waited for after the election.

And Bill Stepien, who was Trump's 2020 campaign manager. It's great to have you all here. Sarah, just what was your thought when you saw this play out today? SARAH MATTHEWS, FORMER DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY FOR PRES. TRUMP: There's not a lot that surprises me anymore, when it comes to Donald Trump. I will say, this pick did shock me a little bit. But then again, I look back on what he ran on, in his 2024 campaign, who knows all about retribution. And so, of course, he's going to pick someone like Matt Gaetz to lead the Department of Justice, because he doesn't want an independent Department of Justice. He wants it to do his bidding. And so, someone like Matt Gaetz would be willing to do that. And what I will say, though, is that this is going to be an uphill battle for Senate confirmation. He is loathed on Capitol Hill, and I can't stress that enough. His colleagues in the House do not like him. You saw even when Markwayne Mullin, who now serves in the Senate, and will be voting on this confirmation. When he was in the House, so, and served with him.

I look to people like Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins. Even Mitch McConnell. I mean, what does he have to lose at this point? I think that Todd Young, the list goes on. I think there are some principled senators, who know that this would be a mistake. And so maybe, maybe there's a chance that he doesn't get confirmed.

That was a Democrat-funded dossier, a fake dossier, that went years of investigation, wasting millions of dollars with Mueller. If you think about the -- I think it was probably the dirty trick of the century, when Tony Blinken put together this letter with 51 so- called intelligence experts that said that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. And then, they used the FBI to go out and basically pre-bunk it, going to social media outlets, like Facebook, and saying, This Russian disinformation is going to come forward. They used it to suppress this information, and affect the outcome of an election. This was a huge misuse of the DOJ. When President Trump was in office, and then if you think about what's happened since then, the DOJ has been abused, to go after President Biden's number one opponent. Think about moms and dads at school board meetings that have been harassed by federal agents, because of this DOJ. The DOJ's failure to enforce the U.S. Code, when people are marching on the houses of Supreme Court justices to intimidate them. I mean, this is a highly political, partisan DOJ.",

I was actually panicking a little bit. Because I knew once you injected yourself, it would be in your body for a whole week. GUPTA (on camera): That sounds miserable. SOREP (ph): So, I had to stop very quickly. And then, I tried again, and the side effects was worse. But then I had another break, and then I tried again, and then, oh, finally, it worked for me.
