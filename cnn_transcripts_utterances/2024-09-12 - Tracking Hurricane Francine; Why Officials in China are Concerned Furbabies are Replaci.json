At a women`s conference last year, China`s strongman leader Xi Jinping lectured delegates to foster a new type of marriage and childbearing culture. (On camera):  This newfound pet popularity comes at a time when the Chinese government is offering things like financial incentives and time off from work all with the goal of promoting parenthood.

It started with a National Parks post about an open bag of Cheetos found dropped inside New Mexico`s famous Carlsbad Caverns where only water is allowed and for good reason. The post said aside from the risk of attracting animals, the snacks softened by the cave`s humidity formed a perfect environment to quickly spread mold and fungi via curious critters like insects. Rangers reportedly spent 20 minutes removing resulting molds and debris from inside the cavern to mitigate the effects. I mean, I know Cheetos claim to be dangerously cheesy but who knew? All kidding aside, rangers say the spilled snack may seem trivial but quote, \"to life in the cave, it can be world-changing.\" (END VIDEO CLIP)",
