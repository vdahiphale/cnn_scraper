French fury hundreds arrested after a second night of protests across France nationwide outrage following the killing of a teenage boy by police in a Paris suburb a protest march happening in Paris at this hour attended by the victim's mother. President Macron calling for calm as he mobilizes 40,000 officers to help keep the peace, we're live in Paris for the latest. Plus more Moscow mystery high level intrigue is one of Russia's top generals, who is rumored to have known about the weekend's mutiny attempt, vanishes from view. CNN asked the Kremlin about General Sergey's -- whereabouts we were told no comment more details on that shortly. And central heating, the heads of the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank and the Bank of England see more rate hikes ahead as global inflation remains elevated. Fed Chair Powell saying it an ECB Forum that U.S. inflation won't fall to the 2 percent target until perhaps 2025. Therefore rate hikes this summer are possible. U.S. investors way ahead of him so little market reaction in response to that green on the screen as you can see there for U.S. stock market futures and a mixed picture. I can show that to you too across in Europe, a sizable upward revision to U.S. GDP in the fourth quarter of last year helping sentiment this morning though too suggesting the economy remains resilient, even in the face of those persistent rate hikes. Growth rising at a 2 percent annualized rate that's up from a previous print or read of 1.3 percent. So that's a huge revision higher. Also today, chip stocks recovering from Wednesday's weakness after a strong forecast from Micron that fears that the U.S. could restrict the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China remains. Nvidia warning of the negative future effects of a chip export ban we've got all the details on that coming up too. For now U.S. bank stocks also higher pre market after they passed the latest round of Fed stress test. The results suggest that the U.S. banking system remains strong paving the way for potential dividend hikes from major banking firms. Lots to get to as always, but first we do begin in France and a massive March is currently underway in protest over the fatal shooting of a teenager by police. Around 150 police people were arrested last night amid violent demonstrations. And Melissa Bell joins us now. Melissa, this is a protest against that killing by police of that teenager. But it's also as you've been pointing out now for some hours today a protest about years, perhaps of perceived maltreatment.",

And itspeaks to the violence that they expect tonight, to spread. Now what we saw overnight was specifically state institutions being targeted. So you're looking at schools, police stations, anything that represented the Republic, and that's been the message of politicians this morning. This is not about the state. This is about the misdoing of one particular police officer now being investigated. In fact, we've just been hearing Julia who's actually now been suspended. That's been the line taken over and over again after this crisis meeting that was chaired by Emmanuel Macron this morning. Whether or not that is now going to be heard in those neighborhoods where already, you're seeing it that march, which is moved from outside the police station where it was meant to take place deep into the city, the parts of those neighborhoods, where so much of this anger is being felt. And what you're likely to see over the course the evening are those very real frustrations to do with not just long standing feelings or discrimination but very often allegations of specific instances of police brutality that it has been impossible to pinpoint to label to call by their name. Because of these difficulties linked to a proud tradition here in France of secularism, where the state institutions refuse to look at questions of ethnicity, race, everyone in France is meant to be a citizen equal in front of the Republic that has made investigating these kinds of allegations and this feeling that you're now seeing it spreading on the streets very difficult indeed, Julia.",

Now, we got that news from the U.S. Coast Guard, who then said that U.S. medical professionals would now conduct a formal analysis on what they presumed to be human remains. On top of that we've got the transportation safety board here in Ottawa Julia telling us just late last night that they have finished collecting relevant documents and completed the preliminary interviews. What's important here is that they say that they have the voyage data recorder from the polar prints and that was the mothership that for communication purposes was tethered to the Titan that is very important. They also say that those large pieces of debris that we've been seeing for 24 hours now that are now on shore, that they've catalogued those. They looked at them and are now in the possession of the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard saying that they will be brought obviously to the United States for thorough analysis. So many investigations going on here but a week out Julia certainly more clues more evidence that they can delve into further and for so many people that are interested in this perhaps more conclusively they can determine why this happened.

Also, Bud Light has spent a ton of money on new campaign ads, including one that deals with country music and the NFL. And also the CEO in that interview saying that he plans to increase the investment into Bud Light three fold. He also said that he believes that Bud Light will make it through this.

That's according toH2 Green Steel. The firm is in the process of building a plant in Sweden using hydroelectric power to produce green hydrogen that will then be used to heat the ore in its steel ovens, the plant could be up and running by the end of 2025. The aim is to clean up an industry that's responsible for more than 7 percent of global Co2 emissions. And joining us now with Henrik Henriksson, he's the CEO of H2 Green Steel. Henrik, welcome to the show, I had great fun preparing for this interview going back over old chemistry lessons with iron ore, and blast furnaces. But you're planning to do this a little differently. So explain the concept of Green Steel and how we get there. HENRIK HENRIKSSON, CEO OF H2 GREEN STEEL: Yes, so thanks, Julia. So the traditional way of doing this is admitting two tons of Co2 for one ton of steel. And what we are doing is taking away 95 percent of that. So it's coming down to only 100 kilos for one ton of steel. And it's basically free platforms. It is green hydrogen that we produce from renewable energy coming from wind and hydropower. We use that green hydrogen in the process, though, then called DRI, where we replace them the fossil natural gas with green hydrogen. And then we produce a product that you can call green iron. And when that is still hot, we push that into a brand new steel mill to produce them Green Steel, so free platforms, green hydrogen, green iron, and green steel. And the first plant we're building is in Boden, Sweden, location is chosen because there is an abundance of renewable energy at fair low cost. And using then the location to build a blueprint, you can save for them, rolling it out and starting it in 2025, 2.5 years from now, and then rolling out the concept to South America and Southern Europe, but also to North America.",

But in Boden, Sweden, you can say that energy is landlocked, we cannot get it down so as to approve the country. So we're paying roughly around 30 megawatt per effort to euro per megawatt. And if you base it on that sort of electricity price, the Green Steel will be around 20 to 25 percent, more expensive than the brown steel. And that is accepted by our customers and customers that are coming mainly from the automotive industry, but also from construction and building material appliances. And they see that they can actually get a premium for their products, if they are then truly sort of Co2 neutral when they are produced. And these are companies that signed up on science based targets that have done their homework. So I will say 20, 25 percent today, they feel it's a fair price, because they also expect that the price on carbon will continue to rise in Europe, especially with the carbon price we have here. And there is a strong correlation between sort of the price on carbon and the cost of carbon, and then the premium that we can charge for the Green Steel. So today is around 20, 25.",

And I was going to ask you, by thetime you're up and running by 2030, really producing 5 million tons of Green Steel, I believe is that is the target. How the price of producing green hydrogen and Green Steel will have adjusted? But I think, more important point was that, by that point, with regulation with the challenges of reporting what your carbon emissions are, actually the cost of producing carbon is going to be that much higher? So it's that trade off that matter. How do we scale this, Henrik? I mean, 5 million tons is important. But what it's 3 percent of world's steel production, we need to do this on a far greater scale.",

So we do not see our self as adisrupter of this industry rather than enabler. And what we have done now is we have shown that there is a market for Green Steel, there is a premium for it. We have created a definition with our 25 customers. And we've shown that it's technically possible, and you can actually finance a project like this. With a startup, we now no balance sheet, no income statement, and we can find 5.5 billion U.S. dollars to get this off the ground. And we're already building the factory. So I think we've shown the income, but guys, it's possible. And they are following now, which I think is very positive. And it takes maybe a little bit longer, a little bit slower, because they have a lot of assets that they of course need to cater for and adjust to. But so I think that the scaling here will already sort of start moving now, when we see that it's possible, but the real scaling, I think, will not be to do exactly what we do. I think it would be rather than keep the existing steel industry that so called downstream where you do sort of the rerolling. And then instead of importing iron ore to Europe, and I think to North America, and so on as well, you should import the product that comes out of our second platform. So the so called green iron and that is a product that you can ship around the world. It's called Green HBI, green hot briquetted iron. And I think that will be the quickest way because then you can reuse a lot of the assets that's in the industry are already the technology, the competence, the knowledge, and that would be the quickest way for us to really move this industry up to 2030.",
