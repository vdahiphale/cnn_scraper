Prosecutors saying that he's being released on a $500,000 bond.

      "sentences": "Just moments ago, this initial appearance for Congressman Santos wrapped. As you noted, he pleaded not guilty to these 13 charges and he has been released. What's unclear right now, if he or his attorney will address the reporters you might be able to see are assembled over my shoulder.Now, we did not see the congressman enter the courthouse. He was driven to this hearing. We didn't have the chance to ask him any questions. And it's unclear if he's going to come out and address reporters now. But the Justice Department has accused him of repeated dishonesty and deception to ascend to the halls of Congress and enrich himself among the \"brazen things\" that they have accused him of -- that they have accused him of filing for -- fraudulently for unemployment benefits while he was running for Congress. They accuse him of fundraising off of political donors, saying that he was going to buy TV time, but instead of transferring that money to his personal account and using it to pay personal debts or even buy designer clothes. They also alleged that he lied on his required financial disclosure forms for the House of Representatives. So, if he comes out to address reporters, clearly a lot of questions for the congressman.",

Some of the things we knew about, right, there were so many reports a lot of this had been aired in media outlets. We didn't know about the unemployment part of this.",
