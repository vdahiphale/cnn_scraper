We know today that there was a woman who works with Donald Trump quite closely, her name is Margo Martin. She's an aide to him that has remained on his payroll since he left the presidency and she has been in Florida with him quite a lot assisting him with his various needs.Margo Martin also worked within the White House at the end of the Trump presidency. She was a deputy communications person there. And so, investigators are very likely to want to ask her about what happened in those chaotic last days of the Trump presidency when there were boxes being packed up. When documents were being handled by various people in the White House, how things may have gotten to Mar- a-Lago. And then also she's one of the few people that stayed with the president, the former president, when he moved to Florida. So she may be asked about all kinds of things that she could have seen or heard at Mar-a-Lago as well. Now it's not clear at this time what she said in the grand jury. We know that she didn't have a marathon day of testimony. She was only there for a few hours this afternoon, but she does become the latest witness in a long line of witnesses. My colleagues and I here at CNN, we have also been able to confirm that Margo Martin is one of more than two dozen people who have been sought by prosecutors in this classified documents investigation around Donald Trump that they are trying to get answers from or that they already have gotten answers from. Two dozen people at least, that includes resort staff working at Mar-a-Lago. It includes people who are very close to Donald Trump himself. It is the type of group that scours the grounds. One source told us today that they are casting an extremely wide net. Anyone and everyone who may have seen something is being pursued by prosecutors in this investigation as it is in this mature phase. And right now we're also waiting to hear whether we can learn if one of Donald Trump's personal defense attorneys, Evan Corcoran, who has handled communications with the FBI and the National Archives in this investigation, whether he will be forced to answer more questions before the federal grand jury.

You certainly don't want to be under that when it falls from a thunderstorm cloud, right. These are the reports coming in from the National Weather Service. Just a really impressive hailstones that fell from Ft. Worth, Weatherford and Mineral Wells. 2 1/2 to 3 inches, that's the size of the hailstones.There was also 12 reports of wind damage, 49 reports of hail damage in particular. But the National Weather Service highlights some of the larger hailstones that were reported. Those are 2 inches or larger in diameter and there was actually nine reports of that and you saw a picture of just that a moment ago. Now there's still the potential of severe weather as this line moves eastward overnight, so heads up Shreveport to Lake Charles. This is an area that we'll see the line of storms move through the overnight hours and into the early morning hours on Friday across the Gold Coast region. Here it is on our forecast radar. There are some showers and thunderstorms kind of picking up some of that moisture, maybe perhaps a bit of circulation from the Gulf of Mexico. But they start to Peter out as we get into the middle of the day on Friday, and really, we just focus our attention on precipitation though along the entire eastern sea board. Here is our chance of severe weather for Friday, damaging winds, can't rule out a tornado, although the risk is not as high as what we experienced on Thursday. Panama City, Mobile into New Orleans, that 30-A corridor right along the Florida Panhandle has a potential for some strong to severe weather. Look at the rainfall totals across that region, could see 1 to 3 inches locally and we're anticipating some snowfall across the Great Lakes. In fact, lake enhanced snowfall across the upper peninsula and portions of Minnesota as well as Wisconsin. So look out for 6 to 12 inches of snowfall across that region. Back to you.

It is Poland that feels very much on the frontlines of this war, it is Russian missiles that have landed right up near that border. It is millions of Ukrainian refugees that flooded that country that they needed to support. And it is Russian expansion that Warsaw feels is a huge threat to it and to NATO. So in many ways it is quite natural and logical to see that Poland, Warsaw is the first to make this move, but it is also that question about the calculus. These MiG fighter jets, they are Soviet era jets. So, you're talking about 30 years old. They were towards the end of their life span if you will. They were going to be replaced by NATO anyways for Warsaw. So in some ways Poland is sprucing them up and saying OK we are going to send them as quickly as we can in several days to Ukraine and there might be more coming. But the question is, is this going to put more pressure on other allies. You can say four jets are going to make a huge difference on the ground.

      "sentences": "Well, look, over the last few months, Max, Bianca, we have seen negotiations between Turkey, Sweden and Finland over the concerns that Turkey has raised around accession of Finland and Sweden to the NATO alliance.And in fact, we heard yesterday from Finland's president visiting the province of Khamaranmaras which was amongst the hardest it by last month's earthquake, the epicenter of last month's earthquake. And according to Turkish state media, the president told reporters during that visit that he believes that Finland has done all that is expected of Finland in order to be able to join the alliance and to gain the ratification of the Turkish government. And crucially took part in those negotiations with the Turkish government. And we have seen over the last few months in addition to those talks between the three nations, we've seen policy changes in both Helsinki and in Stockholm. So this has been a significant shift and of course the expectation has been for weeks now that Turkey may soon come to a decision to ratify at least Finland's accession to the NATO alliance. Of course Finland and Sweden previously expressing their intention to join the alliance simultaneously together. Today of course the focus appears to be squarely on Finland's accession. Turkey has of course repeatedly expressed concern and also focused Sweden. And particular on Sweden's role in dealing with groups that Turkey considers to be terrorist organizations, namely Kurdish groups operating in the country. Turkey has accused the Swedish government of taking too lax of an approach when it comes to these groups. Now it appears that that focus has shifted to Finland. Whether or not this may prove to be a positive point for Sweden, whether Turkey will soften its position on Sweden that remains to be seen. But as you said there, we've heard from both the Turkish and Finnish president hinting that this may be the result of talks which are set to begin in about three hours in Ankara. Turkeys president saying that Turkey will fulfill its promises, will do as is needed. And of course we also heard from the Finnish president earlier in the week saying that it was understood that in the event that Turkey would agree to ratify Finland's accession to the NATO alliance. A face-to- face meeting would be set up between the two leaders and that Finland had in turn accepted that invitation. So, this is certainly the expectation for today's talks. But we are waiting to hear from both leaders. They are set to take part in a joint press conference later this afternoon around 9:45 a.m. Eastern time. So, we're waiting for more details on the next steps when it comes to Finland's accession and whether Turkey has finally changed its position on Finland's accession to NATO.",
