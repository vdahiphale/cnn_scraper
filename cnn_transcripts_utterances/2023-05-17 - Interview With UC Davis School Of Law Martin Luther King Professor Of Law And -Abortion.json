Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm piano Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, say they were in a New York catastrophic car chase here in New York City on Tuesday night. A spokesperson for the couple saying that they and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, were pursued by a \"ring of highly aggressive paparazzi\" and that the chase lasted more than two hours, resulting in multiple near collisions. New York Mayor Eric Adams says the incident was reckless and irresponsible but question the duration of the chase. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY): I would find it hard to believe that there was a two-hour high-speed chase. That would be -- I find that hard to believe, but we will find out the exact duration of it. But if it's 10 minutes, a ten-minute chase, is extremely dangerous in New York City. We have a lot of traffic, a lot of movement, a lot of people are using our streets. Any type of high-speed chase that involves something of that nature is inappropriate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She was there to receive an award. It was as they left in their limousine that these incidents unfolded. Now, what we have managed to find out since the announcement of that news came that they had felt threatened, that they had spent two hours trying to get free of that situation is that at no point did they themselves feel that they were any -- in any physical danger. They were afraid. They were worried, it seems, for the bystanders, the people who are on the sidewalks as the paparazzi tried dangerously to make their way towards the limousine. And according to them, it took them a couple hours to be extricated from that situation. But I think what matters here is how that would have felt for Prince Harry. As you said a moment ago, we don't know exactly how long this lasted or what the precise nature of what went on for the paparazzi watching or for New York authorities trying to keep an eye was, but from the point of view of Harry, and this was what came through in the statement that came to the press earlier this morning, that sense of being hounded that the couple would've had as they left the event.

And I think it is that fragility that he would have felt last night, of being at once hounded because he's chosen to leave and less protected because he has chosen to leave. A very similar parallel, striking really, to what his mother went through. And of course, because what we've had is a statement from Prince Harry and Meghan themselves, we've had that perspective, the idea that those two hours he felt -- go for two hours, the fear that they felt, we've had that account from their point of view.

And this appeals court voted two to one to narrow but not completely block that judge, that Texas judge, Judge Kacsmaryk's ruling. So, what can we expect to see now? Because that had ultimately gone to the Supreme Court, which had put the lower court's ruling on hold, pending appeals.

This panel is arguably even more conservative than the last one. So, looking at that alone, we would expect those judges to have a lot of sympathy for the plaintiffs' claims. The wild card here is that the U.S. Supreme Court did allow the status quo to stay in place. And usually, one of the factors the Supreme Court is supposed to consider in reaching a conclusion about that is who is likely to win when the case is all said and done, and their willingness to leave the status quo in place means that there are some skepticisms from, at least, by justices that the plaintiffs are ultimately going to win, for one reason or another. So, the question if you're this Fifth Circuit panel and you think the plaintiffs are right, for whatever reason, is, do you push the envelope and give the plaintiffs a big win and hope to persuade some of those conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to change their mind? Or do you kind of acknowledge the writing on the wall that maybe these plaintiffs don't have standing, maybe this case is to procedurally flawed and do you kind of make the case that some of their legal arguments make sense even if this particular cause of action has to go away on some technical ground leg standing?",

So, I mean,the two major claims that the plaintiffs are making in this case are either that the FDA never had the authority to approve mifepristone in the first place or alternatively, that the Comstock Act, which is a 19th century anti vice law bars the mailing of mifepristone and likely bars all abortion because any abortion in the United States involve something put into the mail, whether that's a scalpel or a medication. So, none of those arguments, obviously, allow voters in the states to make up their own mind. And of course, none of these things involve them moving away from the federal court, right? I mean, anti-abortion groups are relying more than ever on the federal courts, in part, because I think they understand that's where they can win. A sort of national ban on mifepristone would be impossible to achieve I think through democratic politics and may well be possible to achieve through rulings of conservative federal judges. So, I think it makes the Supreme Court's decision and Dobbs, suggesting this was a sort of very big win for democracy, look either naive or dishonest, depending on your point of view.",

So, they will say things like a permanent and -- or substantial impermeant of this -- of the important bodily function. I am paraphrasing. This isn't language doctors would use. And so, doctors are not really sure what the language means. And then, on the other side of the ledger (ph) or the penalties, right? So, in some -- in Texas, for example, performing an abortion if you're wrong about the application of an exemption can land you in prison up to life in prison, right, and it's a felony in every case. And if you're a physician, you're looking at this and saying, OK, if I'm wrong, if my interpretation of this legal language I don't understand is incorrect, I could lose my medical license, I could lose my liberty, I could not see my family for at least a decade, right? And it's not surprising that doctors are not willing to roll the dice on that. And so, even when you have these exceptions, if you couple the exceptions with really severe penalties, you are going to see a lot of people being turned away when they're seeking care, and that's not going to just include people seeking abortions, it's going to include, in many of these states, the cases we're hearing, are people who had wanted pregnancies that lost those pregnancies, stillbirths, miscarriage, management cases, other people who are being affected by this. And I think these are unintended consequences, but they are not surprising. When you couple vague language and harsh penalties this is what you get.",

What we have a strong feeling about is that the dominant narrative today that covers almost all Global South countries, be it in Latin America or Africa or Asia is that this war is provoked, but this war is justified with the NATO enlargement, which I believe can be destroyed by matter-of-fact of invasion in 2014 to Crimea, when we never had NATO discussion and we never had article and constitutions saying that our foreign policy goal is to be a full-fledged member of NATO.

And I think and I hope that those anti-corruption bodies that we launched, the agency, the anti-corruption agency or the bureau, the anti-corruption bureau or the reform that we started, the judicial reform, even though it's sometimes not ideal because it might take years, and we have many European countries that are still reforming their judicial system. So, it's something that we started back in 2014, as I -- which I call global reconstruction. Education system is under reform. Health care system is under reform. Decentralization is yet another important reform with the logic to give some power to the regions and local authorities because they will always better know what do people need in the regions. So, this is a global reconstruction that we started back in 2014. And of course, the mother of this reform is anti-corruption reform. There are a bunch of laws that have been adopted by the parliament in terms of -- to tackle this anti-corruption process. But then, you know, at the end of the day, it's always about culture.

And I think that this culture of being European nation has been crystallized by the war because we do pay the highest price possible for that, price of our lives.

Your book is titled \"The Shadow DocketSupreme Court Uses Stealth Rulings to Amass Power and Undermine the Republic.\" First of all, maybe a little bit of a civics primer for all of us, what is a shadow docket? STEPHEN VLADECK, AUTHOR, \"THE SHADOW DOCKET\": Yes. So, it's not really much more than just an umbrella term for most of what the U.S. Supreme Court does. We tend to talk about the merits docket, that is to say the 60 to 65 decisions the court hands down each term, applicants (ph) have been argued. But in reality, that's just a small slice of the overall applicant (ph) of the Supreme Court. The shadow docket is a term that was coined by a Chicago professor in 2015 to describe everything else the Supreme Court does, the unsigned and usually unexplained orders that actually account for most of the Supreme Court's work and that can oftentimes be just as consequential and just as impactful as the big fancy merits decisions that we actually tend to focus on in the -- you know, in our public discussions.",

      "sentences": "Right. So, the typical lawsuit usually gets the Supreme Court at the very end of litigation. So, after years of back and forth in lowercourts, whether lower federal courts, lower state courts. And usually, it's only at the very, very end that whoever lost in the last round will go to the U.S. Supreme Court and ask the justices to take up the appeal. As you say, the justices can choose whether or not to take up the case. One of the things that we've seen though in recent years is another type of order where even before we get to that point, before the case has made it all the way through, a party that lost below say the federal government that had one of its policies enjoined or someone challenge on a state COVID measure who lost in the lower courts might go to the Supreme Court early in the case and asked for something called emergency ruling, you're asking the justices basically to freeze the status quo or to unfreeze the status quo while the rest of that litigation process plays out. That's where we have seen a real uptick in the last five or six years in how often the justices are granting that kind of relief in the impact of orders, granting them that kind of relief, and in where those impacts have been felt by all of us, from federal vaccination mandates, to state abortion bans, to congressional district maps. We really have seen these kinds of orders reshape large swaths of American public policy.",

I want to point a quote that you wrote, as the shadow docket has grown, themerits docket has shrunk, giving the justices less time and fewer resources with which to conduct plenary review cases not presenting real or conjure emergencies.

I mean, so, the typical disposition is something like the application for a stay presented toJustice Alito and by him refer to the court is granted. That's it. You know, we might get concurring opinions, we might get some dissenting opinions, but it really is the exception that the court will write a majority opinion when it hands down these orders. And, historically, that's not unusual. You know, 20 years ago when all the court was doing through emergency applications was last-minute stays of execution, I don't think there was a big clamor for the justices to provide lengthy explanations. But now that these orders are having these profound effects on the ground, the fact that we see the court intervening, oftentimes undoing hundreds of pages of analysis from other court judges and providing no explanation of its own, I think it's a real part of the problem and it deprives all of us, the lower courts, the relevant government decision-makers, the public of any ability to assess why the justices ruled the way they did.",

      "sentences": "Justice Alito has kind of pushed back on this idea in multiple ways. One of the quotes you have from him is, the catchy and sinister term'shadow docket' has been used to portray the court as having been captured by a dangerous cabal that resorts to sneaky and improper methods to get its way. He obviously doesn't like, not just the phrasing, but the entire concept that the court is doing something untoward. And you take almost an entire chapter to try to push back against that. What's your evidence against what he saying?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the evidence is the decisions. I mean -- and so, for example, one of Justice Alito's responses to critiques, I've been criticalof the fact that the court is treating some of these orders as presidential and yelling at lower courts that have not followed unsigned unexplained orders. You know, Justice Alito denies they are doing that, but we can point to the specific cases where it's happened. So, I think part of what's going on here is that for Justice Alito's perspective all the court is doing is what it had always done in the death penalty context and just in a slightly different context. And what that totally fails to acknowledge and fails to account for is why it's problematic that the court is not explaining itself, that we are not seeing rational, is that we're not even seeing the vote count. I mean, we don't even know which justices are on which side in a lot of these contexts when the decision is happening with these downstream effects, when the decision is affecting who is voted for for Congress, as we saw in the congressional redistricting cases, when the decision is affecting whether or not a controversial immigration policy will be allowed to be enforce for upwards of two to three years, when the decision is blocking California or New York COVID mitigation measures. And so, I think this is where the Alito critique fails to account for what the court is actually doing. What he is defending as a strawman, and if you actually look at the whole body of these cases, just what the book does, you really see a far more troubling pattern not of conservative versus liberals, but of a court that just seems to be unbeholden to any need to explain itself, even when these decisions are having such massive effects.",

But we really see this pattern start to pick up in 2017, before there were any big changes in the court's composition in the middle of the Trump administration. And then, it's with the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh to replace Justice Kennedy with the confirmation of Justice Barrett to replace Justice Ginsburg, that's when we see it really accelerate. I don't think that's because these are conservative as opposed to liberal justices. I think it's because the speed breaks, the sort of the moderating influence of having justices like Anthony Kennedy who is in the middle were removed. And so, the court, I think, has just found it more and more convenient to use these unsigned unexplained orders to resolve more and more these applications. Not necessarily intentionally, but in a way that has produced all the significant downstream effects.",

And we see the court move away from having oral arguments on emergency applications, having expended briefing, writing opinions. And I think what got lost in the history is that, for 35 years, those moves, which I think are deeply problematic, we're confined to the unique space of the death penalty. And so, we didn't really talk about it much. We didn't notice it much. You ask people who clerked on the Supreme Court in the 1980s and 1990s about the shadow docket, what they remember is the death docket. The real shift, right? The move that the book tries to document from 2016 and '17 onwards is all of these pathologies that have come to mark how the Supreme Court handled last-minute applications in the death penalty context have become normalized into context that have nationwide policy implications, whether it's about President Trump building his border wall or whether it's about the attempt to ban access to mifepristone on a nationwide basis. And I think even if that move in the early 1980s was remotely justifiable in the death penalty context, it just doesn't hold up once the Supreme Court is handing down orders in this context that are having such massive legal and practical impacts on the real world.",

This is where I think we also have to bring in all these stories about the justices' ethics and financial disclosure. Historically, the principled checked on the court was Congress. Indeed, until 1935, the Supreme Court sat in the capital. And I think part of what has gotten us to where we are is that, progressively and especially in the last 35 years, Congress has basically taking its hands off and had gotten out of the business of being part of this ongoing interbranch dialogue about keeping the court in its lane. So, when John Roberts writes back to Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and says, I'm not going to come testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee because of separation of powers concerns, I think that's a reflection of a very modern and not remotely historical view of the separation of powers. Historically, the court was part of the conversation as opposed to today where it seems so completely above and oblivious to it.",

It's not that the Supreme Court should be guided by public opinion polls and it's not that the Supreme Court should just do what a popular majority wants it to do, but the Supreme Court does not have an army, right? The reason why we as a polity follow the Supreme Court is because there's, at least, some substantial belief in the court's legitimacy as an institution. The more that the belief erodes, the more that we lose faith in the idea that the justices are exercising judicial power as opposed to political power. I think the more dangerous a slope this means we're on. Because if we get to a point where there are large swaths of the population that refused to accept the legitimacy of decisions from the Supreme Court, then the Supreme Court, at that point, becomes almost a pointless institution, one that can't stand up when we need it to do to the majority. That would be a huge problem for our constitutional system and it's one that, frankly, the justices should be at the front of the line in trying to avoid. But from the perspective of the court as an overall institution, we see a bit more of a historical ebb and flow that suggest that our current moment, however frustrating and exasperating it may be, is not one from which we can't recover. What we need though is we need to have consensus that the court, as an institution, ought to be more accountable, that Congress ought to be more involved in relationship with the court about its docket, that the justices should be more committed to providing principled rationales for their decisions, even if we're not all going to agree with them. And finally, that the justices should, I think, be less in the business of criticizing critics who are worried about the court, who are trying to save the court from itself. That's why, I think, this is such an important moment for the court, but also one that has a lot of -- sort of, a lot time, a lot of games still be played.",
