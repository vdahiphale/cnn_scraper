We'll havemuch more on that storm in just a moment, but for now, let's check some of the other news-making headlines. And another military coup in Africa, this time in Gabon. President Ali Bongo Ondimba whose family has had a hold on power for more than half a century, is under house arrest. Military officers announced the takeover on national television after election officials declared the president had won a third term in a disputed election. The coup leaders say all government institutions have been dissolved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, the leader of the coup says he has not yet declared himself the new head of state. Our David McKenzie is following the story from Johannesburg and joins us now live. Good to have you on the story. So, David, how did this coup take place? How did it unfold? And is anyone heeding the president's call for help?",

The Bongos, the father and son, have ruled that country for more than 50 years, and there he is making that desperate appeal to the international community. But at this stage, these coups that have happened for different reasons in different countries, there has been no real success in returning democracy to those countries. And in the case of Gabon, it's also an issue of democracy that is on paper on some level only. And that is also a factor that needs to be looked at in many of these countries that have faced these military takeovers. Lynda?",

So, he's been somebody who's been really close to the family, somebody who has risen and who was also an aid account to his to be now from a president's father when he was in charge. So, he's no stranger to the way that government and the way structure has been in Gabon. Now, we've also been able to get reports from other well-done CISO organizations that have been able to see and implicate him in several purchases and several items, especially in the United States, for the ruling family. So, he has been also involved in a way that the corruption has been carried out in the country. But what we do not know is the procedure and the process that he's going to go ahead and then how this particular regime and how this website is going to either lead to a transition to regular elections, either redo the elections or even just how to move back towards democracy.",

You know, after the trip that he suffered earlier, he really hasn't been as active or as present in the activities in Gabon.
