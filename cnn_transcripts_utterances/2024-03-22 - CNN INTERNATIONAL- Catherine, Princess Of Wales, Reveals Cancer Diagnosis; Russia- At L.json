In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London. And at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventive chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment. This of course came as a huge shock and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from a major surgery in order to start my treatment but most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte, and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be okay.

But it is important to know that there are other types of abdominal cancers or in the abdominal space, cancers that are identified for which it is difficult to attribute where the cancer cells actually came from. It is what we call a cancer of unknown primary. So we really don't know what we are dealing with yet here, but what I would say is I thought she looked quite good. She did look strong and brave and I thought that the words that she gave about speaking to her children, that she was alluding to, it seemed a favorable prognosis and we very much hope that that is the case.

We are showing all this wonderful footage here of Kate out and about, shaking hands, meeting people, that simply can't be the case for the moment. She is having chemotherapy, she will have to be sheltering at home, we believe for quite a long time. I don't necessarily expect to see her as we had expected to see her.

So it is all very different now, and I think that it is great to hear this openness in the Royal family. And I think also, it is really -- I think it must have been really tough for Kate.

I think one of the things that we see on the images that are incoming on some of the live pictures but also some of the tape pictures, as well as just the amount of security forces that are out there, the amount of emergency medical personnel that. And then of course, that fire also in the Crocus City Hall. The initial images that we got, and that we saw seem to show those four attackers already pulling out long rifles outside of the Crocus City Hall and then going inside. And, you know, I've actually been at the Crocus City Hall and in that place in Krasnogorsk, on a number of occasions. It is an extremely large venue that we're talking about. It's sort of a shopping and entertainment center. And the pictures that we saw from the inside of that venue also strongly indicate that it is large that there were a lot of people who were inside. And as you pointed out, Isa, eyewitnesses saying that apparently the attackers shot point blank at this point in time. The authorities are confirming 40 people killed, Isa.",

And correct me if I'm wrong here, Fred is whether the gunmen, the four gunmen that we saw there with rifles, whether they've been neutralized. We also don't know, in terms of people trapped, how many people trapped inside. But let me just bring you up to date with what we've just hearing from the U.S. Embassy, Fred.The U.S. embassy in Moscow is shocked by reports of a terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall in Moscow. This is their words. And it's interesting because the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Fred had issued a security alert just two weeks ago. Talk to that.",

The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says she showed tremendous bravery for coming forward with her diagnosis. You can see there, the French president Emmanuel Macron also praising her resilience. We've also heard in the last hour or so from us first lady Jill Biden who wrote on X, that about for instance, you are brave, and we love you.And as we've heard from Max earlier, in the last 10 minutes or so, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also wished Catherine healing and said their hope she could do so in peace. Ana Stewart is monitoring all the reaction and joins me now. And Ana, really so many people are shocked, of course, by this news -- by this news. And hearing it directly from the Princess of Wales.",

Of course, we got that first statement in January, I think it was 17th when we discovered that the Prince of Wales had been admitted to hospital to have planned abdominal surgery. But the weeks that followed, speculation grew and it really the last few weeks sort of hit a -- sort of pressure point, I suppose.And now I'm sure lots of people will understand why the Prince and Princess of Wales have been so quiet on her condition and her recovery. Because it's been a very difficult -- a very difficult few weeks and few months for them at this stage. And I think having all that pressure from the media, from social media, from the public, to explain themselves and give more information on the -- on the medical condition. Well, now they have all that information. And the plea from the Princess at the end of her video statement was we hope that you will understand that as a family, we now need some time space and privacy while I complete my treatment. So, here's hoping that she gets that privacy she wants.",
