One of those options was the possibility of shooting down this plane. That is something that they have not ruled out. But previously, as he was presented that option, he was warned about the potential impact it could have on the ground, shooting the balloon up in the sky and the potential debris and the fallout it could have, and the impact it could have here on the ground and affecting people. So, we will see what else the White House and potentially Pentagon has to say later today, regarding this balloon. As you mentioned, it has been seen over North Carolina, potentially heading more towards the East Coast. But this certainly represents just another inflection point and tension point with China, as the U.S. is confronting how exactly to address this balloon.",

So, as the Pentagon revealing in any fashion, how just quoting the president, how they're going to take care of it.OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PPENNTAGON CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The Pentagon, so far, today quiet about what its plans may be. We know they've certainly been involved in the options, or at least the evaluation of the options to this point when President Joe Biden asked what his military options were when this balloon first entered over U.S. airspace. It was the Pentagon, and going all the way up to General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who recommended against shooting it down, because of the potential risk to people and property below. But having been here all morning, we know there are senior Pentagon officials in the building today. I don't need to tell everyone watching. It is a Saturday. So, that is unusual. And we're waiting to see what options there are moving forward. Obviously, if the reason you didn't shoot it down overland was because of the risk of people and property. That risk no longer there when this floats out over the water later on today. And we've been tracking it based on sightings from where it was over western Tennessee, towards central and moving towards eastern Tennessee today. So, we'll keep watching it and wait for an update on what the possibility is going forward here. And what the decision and when that decision is finally made about what to do with this balloon. Pending on watching this very closely, they said yesterday they were tracking it continuously. I will point out they said, it does not give the Chinese any surveillance or intelligence gathering capabilities above and beyond the spy satellites they already have. So, that the decision was made to leave this in the air for now. But Fredricka, we'll let you know if the, for now, changes on that.",

With all of the photos that are flooding, social media, some of them in really high resolution, showing this surveillance balloon through the skies coming into the Charlotte area in the late 9:00 a.m. through the 10:00 a.m. hour. Look, people have been posting it. The people who see it very well also talking about planes that they've seen following this around there as well. Look, some of the police departments a bit tongue-in-cheek, but also warning people, look, we knew that this was the path that was going to take, judging from what we were seeing it do. And so, please do not call 911 and report that you've seen this. Also, tongue-in-cheek from Gastonia Police Department, a little west of us here, asking people to please not shoot at the balloon.",

I know you reported earlier that it is exhibiting or conveying that it is embarrassed, but what is it going to try to do? SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, look, China is just doubling down on the claim from them that this is just a weather balloon that's gone off course. The Pentagon, of course, completely rejecting that claim. But what is extraordinary is that the Chinese government is expressing regret. That's extremely rare. It's a big shift from the normal playbook of hitting back or denying what the U.S. has said. So, China's Foreign Ministry said, \"It is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological purposes. Affected by the Westerlies, and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace.\" Now, the decision making in the Chinese government is a black box. It's extremely opaque, but clearly they're trying to de-escalate the situation, they're trying to lower the temperature. There was another statement today from the foreign ministry that accused some politicians and media in the US. .for hyping up the incident to \"attack and smear\" China. There is also an editorial in state media asking the question of why China would be clumsy enough to rush spy balloons into U.S. airspace, when it has more advanced reconnaissance satellites? So, really, we're left reading the tea leaves, left with this mystery why Beijing let this happen. Was it deliberate? Was it an accident? But as you said, either way, this is embarrassing for Beijing. It derails that highly anticipated meeting of Secretary of State Antony Blinken coming to Beijing. That Beijing had been gearing up for months for. Even though there were low expectations for any concrete outcomes from Blinken's trip to China, the whole point of this trip was to put the guardrails on the relationship. This event only highlights how much distrust there is between both sides and why a lot of experts say communication and a face to face meeting is more important than ever. And it's important to note that it's not actually in Beijing's best interest for this meeting to be postponed. This was supposed to be a part of China's reopening to the world after ending zero-COVID. China has been on this charm offensive. They want to improve ties with the U.S. reengaged with officials, and really move their attention and focus on boosting its damaged economy here at home, Fred.",

So, there is -- the one is a shoot it down, two is do we -- would we have the capacity to bring it down? It's going to have a lot of intelligence in terms of what we could learn about China's capacity. What happened with the balloon? Remember, this balloon is like a misnomer. This thing is huge. It's cargo. It's just about three school buses, let alone the balloon. There is a third possibility that, in my discussions with military folks is, you know, look, China still has operational control over this thing. It's maneuvering it hopefully to the shoreline. With whether it has a self-detonation capacity, the Chinese do not want us to take possession of this. We don't know. And so, I think Biden's lack of clarity is probably smart at this stage.",

Just because of the extreme temperatures and wind chills they've been dealing with.You can see the cameras shaking from time to time, just indicating how intense those winds are. The current temperature on Mount Washington is minus 26, sustained winds of 81 miles per hour, that is equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, making that feels like temperature outside for any exposed part of your body, minus 74. And the sad thing is, that is a huge improvement to what it was just a few hours ago, which was minus 108. Again, it's hard to even fathom temperatures that cold. But it wasn't the only spot. Cadillac Mountain in Maine, topping out at minus 62. The Frenchville Airport at Maine topping out at minus 61, and areas of Vermont, topping out at more than minus 50 when you talk about those wind chills. We are starting to see improvements. Take a look at some of these current temperatures back into the positive now for places like Portland, and Boston. Even Albany looking at a positive one, at least right now. So, we are starting to see those temperatures begin to rebound. And they will continue to do so as we go through the next 24 hours. Because while it was intense, it's a very short lived cold blast that we've been experiencing in the northeast, and really much of New England. And interestingly enough, it's going to rebound quite significantly. Boston going from a high temperature of 17 today to 48 tomorrow. Fred, that's actually 10 degrees above their normal high temperature, similar scenario for places like Portland and New York as well.",

I think what they're talking about is, A, we need to calm down, B, it's not a weapons platform. We know pretty much what it's doing and how it acts. And C, we have history here.In April of 2001, we had a Navy EP-3 spy plane flying 70 miles off Hainan Island and a Chinese fighter jet clipped it. The fighter jet went into the ocean. The pilot died. The Navy plane, the U.S. plane, had to make an emergency landing. There was a very complex negotiation about the Chinese took that plane apart piece by piece, examined all its equipment, got all they needed to know out of it, and literally gave it back to us in boxes. But it was very uncomfortable. We had to exchange very diplomatically worded letters and so on. So acting slowly, deliberately, carefully here, if it goes out over the ocean and we can take it down in a way that we can get intelligence value out of it without destroying it totally is one option which is actually viable. I think that we've got a lot of politicians yelling and we've got some intelligence professionals and defense experts working for the best solution. And I think we should let them do it.",

MILLER: I think it's very important, although this is not the first time, nor probably will it be the last, that Mahmoud Abbas has suspended security cooperation. I suspect that their cooperation continues. If in fact, the Palestinians had information that there was an imminent attack, I think they convey it to the Israelis. And recently, in the last day or so, two Israelis wandered into Palestinian areas and were extricated with the support and help of the Palestinian security forces. So I think there is security cooperation, but clearly Palestinians needed to do more in areas like Jenin and Nablus where these armed groups are operating. The Israelis also need to understand that a counterterrorism strategy is legitimate.
