CNN does not officially call the race for of the House of Representatives, but it is trending in Republicans direction.Also in Washington, President Biden is reaffirming his commitment to a peaceful transition of power as President Elect Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House.

President Biden just welcomed incoming President Donald Trump to the White House just four years after the former President had declined to extend that same courtesy to then President elect Joe Biden when their roles had been reversed. This was a meeting inside the Oval Office that lasted just about two hours and only four people were in the room. Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Susie Wiles and Jeff Zients, their respective chiefs of staff and Karine Jean-Pierre just started briefing reporters in the White House briefing room. And this is how she summarized the meeting. She said it was a substantive exchange of views.They talked about a range of domestic and foreign issues, she said. She said that President Biden brought up a number of issues that he sees as important on Congress's to do list, like funding the government. And that at the end of the day, he very much stressed what he has been saying in public, that it is very important for there to be a peaceful transfer of power between the two administrations. So the President, as you said, clearly choosing to set aside, at least for today, some of the tough words that he has used on the campaign trail in recent years against the former President saying that he believes he presents a stark threat to democracy. So as we wait for that official readout, which should give us a better sense of the range of issues that they talked about, just that political dynamic is quite stark. Now, as for just the mood here at the White House, of course, it's been a bit of a hectic and busy day. And staffers I have been talking to made very clear emotions have been running high. The idea of the former President, now the incoming president, coming back to the White House when so many people here inside the building, of course, had wanted a very different outcome from the election. As for the President himself, I was told by folks who have met with him in recent days that he has seemed intent on just being focused on the work, keeping his head down. But one Senior Democrat I talked to did say he is quite sensitive to and aware of the blame that he is getting after the election and that that is something that he is not happy about and feels like has been unfair.

And Donald Trump said, and I very much appreciate it, Joe.Well, we all know what happened four years ago, and that was a breaking of tradition, a tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. But four years later, Donald Trump seems to be committed, at least at the moment, to as smooth a transition as possible. And Joe Biden has set the tone.

MULLER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah. So right now, I think maybe the surprising thing is how normal it all seems, right? This is what we typically expect every four years. Certainly 2020 wasn't just denying the election results. It was also COVID, which resulted in all this separation that people had from one another. So lots of things that we didn't like. And I think eight years ago, you can look at those pictures of Donald Trump in the Oval Office with Barack Obama, and he looks surprised, he looks in awe that he's there for the first time. And now I think, though, he's coming in as a man with a mission, as a man who knows the mistakes he made in the first-term and the things that he wants to change and adapt for the next term.

Presidents have regularly had these kinds of entities, but there's no question there are disclosures, there are conflict of interest forms that have to be completed.There's tons of paperwork. There's a lot of bureaucracy. There are sunshine laws and open records laws and maintenance requests that have to be maintained over the next several months. So to the extent that these two men are leading this sort of entity, it'll be very illuminating, I think, in the weeks ahead to see what kind of information gets displayed to the American people. For Musk himself, obviously he has a lot of government contracts, but those contracts are things that the agencies are doing. And I think there's going to be an interesting question about whether or not he's pressuring certain agencies or not, or whether he's just going to come in and just sort of see what he sees and try to change things, regardless of what his own personal conflicts will be.

Those are people who have been on the committees in Congress that have dealt with military matters. So that's generally the three buckets you might choose someone from. In the case of Mr. (Inaudible) he is a -- Hegseth I mean, he has a military background. There's no doubt about that, his heroic military background, but he doesn't have the managerial experience, nor would one call him necessarily a defense intellectual, nor has he been elected to Congress to manage or think about military affairs.

There were more critics of Donald Trump back then. There are fewer critics right now. And Donald Trump will be able to work his will over the House GOP. No question about it. There's a very much a Trump House Republican conference. And just a huge blow for Democrats who had hoped that they could flip the House. The House had very few competitive districts. There were millions of dollars were spent in key districts like in California and New York and in the suburbs and in places like Arizona, places where they thought they could pick up seats, places that Joe Biden won some cases by double digits back in 2020. But given Donald Trump's gains across the maps, Republicans down ticket were able to ride his coattails. And now they will have power in the House, subpoena power in the committees once again. Also the ability to shape and drive legislation on the floor, put whatever they want on the House floor, then it will go over to the United States Senate, now run by Senate Majority Leader -- and incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune. The Senate will be a different complication. You need 60 votes to get most legislation through, meaning Democrats would be needed to pass most legislation, but nevertheless a huge boost for the GOP.

You just noted we got to this by projecting two more races. That gets them to 218. There are nine outstanding races right now, four of which Republicans currently hold the lead in, but not clear that those leads are all going to hold. But let's say even most of them do. You're talking about a majority here of 221, 222 probably at the maximum. In fact, there was a great moment. I don't know if you saw this morning with President Trump when he was talking to House Republicans, he walks in, he takes the stage, he looks to the leadership team and says, what are you guys? Plus four, plus five? And like -- the leadership team was like, eh, it was kind of in response, they weren't that plus four plus five. Maybe wishful thinking here, given where we are in these outstanding races, but the trifecta is here. This is a Republican Party, including up on Capitol Hill, much more in Donald Trump's image than the Republican Party he found in 2017. There's no doubt about that.
