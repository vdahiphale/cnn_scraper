Unless there is a breakthrough this weekend, active duty troops and border agents may soon have to work without pay. Food assistance for millions could be at risk. Government loans to farmers, students and small businesses wouldn't be processed. And air travel could be disrupted if unpaid TSA workers don't show up, as has happened before. Well, after his failed vote on Friday, McCarthy emerged from his conference suggesting a new option. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE SPEAKER: I think if we had a clean one without Ukraine on it, we could probably be able to move that through. I think if the Senate puts Ukraine on there and focuses Ukraine over America, I think that could cause real problems. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Even after Republicans huddled for nearly two hours on Friday evening to discuss their limited options.And at this, point there is still no clear consensus about what, if anything, they are going to bring to the House floor on Saturday. But Kevin McCarthy did emerge from that meeting with a slightly new message. He said he could be open to a stopgap spending bill as long as it doesn't have money for Ukraine. That is a slightly different position for the Speaker, because, up until this point, he has said that any bill to fund the government needs to include border security provisions. So clearly a last-minute shift in strategy after his efforts to work with Republicans have come up short. And that failure to rally around a Republican plan has created some tensions in the ranks. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR): We're the governing majority. This is what we're supposed to do as a governing majority. We're supposed to lead. And it's kind of hard to lead when you got a significant number of people that are on the wrong snap count when you call the play. So that's where we are. REP. DANIEL CRENSHAW (R-TX): They killed the most conservative position we could take and then called themselves the real conservatives, which is like, make that make sense. REP.

They wanted these close playoff races and now we've got them.The battle to the American League West title may not be decided until the last out, which is so compelling. The Seattle Mariners went into Friday night's game with the Texas Rangers with their backs against the wall and ended up with one of their most dominant wins of the season. Shortstop J.P. Crawford coming up huge with a grand slam home run in the fourth inning, leading Seattle to the 8-0 win. The Mariners are now just two games out of first place with only a pair of games remaining. The Houston Astros taking another step toward a seventh straight playoff appearance on Friday. They got an absolute gem from pitcher Jose Urquidy against Arizona. He threw six scoreless innings in his first start in more than a month. Jose Reyes' two-run double in the 6th was all that Houston needed to hold off the Diamondbacks. Originally, they thought it was a three-run home run but it was overturned on review. So with the 2-1 victory, Houston now needs just one more win to clinch a playoff berth. Take a look at the AL West standings. The Rangers can punch their ticket with either a win or an Astros loss. But there's still a possibility of a three-way tie for that division title. Elsewhere in the WNBA, Asia Wilson and the defending champion Las Vegas Aces are heading back to the finals for the third time in four seasons. They finished off a three-game sweep on Friday night against the Dallas Wings with a dramatic 64-61 win. The Aces held the Wings scoreless during the final five minutes of this one and closed on an 11-0 run. So Vegas has a chance to become the first to win back to back titles since the L.A. Sparks in 2001 and 2002. And the New York Liberty are one win away from advancing to their first WNBA finals since 2002. They open game three on an offensive tear. They outscored the Connecticut Sun, 37-16 in the first quarter and that ties the playoff record. So Breanna Stewart showing everybody why she was named the league's most valuable player earlier this week. She finished with 25 points and 11 rebounds in New York's 11-point win with game 4 set for Sunday afternoon. And finally, Ryder Cup history made in Rome. Viktor Hovland and Ludvig Aberg pulling off the largest margin of victory ever for an 18-hole match, 9 and 7. They only needed 11 holes over 2 hours and 20 minutes to beat Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka.
