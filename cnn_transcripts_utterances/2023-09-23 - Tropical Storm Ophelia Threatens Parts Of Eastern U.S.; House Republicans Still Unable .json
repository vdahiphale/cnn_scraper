The sustained winds are 65 miles per hour, still gusting up to 85. Now that forward movement is off to the north at 13. But look at all of the outer bands on the northern side of the system. That's why we're starting to see some of those heavier rain bands now spreading to states like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, even into New York. You've even got some rain spreading into areas of Connecticut and Massachusetts, nowhere near the center of this storm.However, the heaviest rain is certainly focused over Virginia and North Carolina. We have even had a couple of tornado warnings off and on this morning, across this area. Very quick spin-up, but still a concern. That storm will continue to make its way off to the north in the next 24 to 36 hours, taking with it all of those gusty winds as well as the very heavy rain. So by tomorrow, the focus really becomes more of the mid-Atlantic and especially into the northeast. Flooding is a concern not only for today, but also tomorrow. We just see the location of that begin to shift. Today, mostly a focus between North Carolina and Virginia, stretching into the mid-Atlantic, whereas tomorrow, the focus really more so becomes much of the northeast. Storm surge, most of the threat for storm surge is going to be farther north now, not really much of a concern anymore for areas of North Carolina and as well as South Carolina. But we had some pretty impressive peaks. For example, Beauford, North Carolina, peaking at about storm surge about three feet. And then even as you spread farther north, we're still seeing those two and three foot storm surge levels across several other states, including Virginia, Maryland, Delaware. Now, another concern is also these gusty winds. You've got power outages. You've got some reports of trees coming down across Virginia and North Carolina. Most of these sustained winds have been between 20 to 40 miles per hour. But we have had a few of these wind gusts up around 50 to even 60 miles per hour in some of these spots. And keep in mind when you get the ground saturated, it doesn't take necessarily a very strong wind, Victor and Omar, to bring some additional trees and subsequently some power lines down.",

And this is because President Fain said that GM and Stellantis needed a strong push to come with a better offer.However, if you notice, Ford was not noted in those additional targeted strikes. President Fain saying real progress was made with Ford. And here's some details. According to the union, Ford's latest offer reinstated cost of living adjustments, which was something that many of these workers gave up in 2009. They're now offering more profit sharing. And temporary workers can now become full-time workers in 90 days. And there's additional job security, which essentially means that if a Ford employee is laid off, they will receive two years of income and benefits. But notably missing from the announcement on Friday was where things stood with wages. We know that the union has been asking for a 40 percent wage increase over four years. The last public offer from the three companies was around 20 percent. Ford and the UAW saying that while they have come to terms with some of these other demands, there's still a big gap on the wage issue. And these new targeted strikes will certainly have an economic impact. This is going to impact dealerships because dealerships will not be able to get parts from specifically GM and Stellantis, and this will then trickle down to the consumer, who is looking to bring their car in for a repair, potentially those parts will not be available. We have some recent economic reporting from Anderson Economic Group that says just in the first eight days of this strike, with just the three plants, we have seen a $1.6 billion economic impact. With these new 38 facilities that are now being targeted by the union, that number, Omar and Victor, is expected to grow.",

Laura Dickerson and the regional director up there is doing a great job as well.So it is through job security in our agreements. We're tired of this. And it helps to have President Biden show his support to us. If we're going to put trillions of dollars into this infrastructure to make these vehicles go, these jobs need to be here in this country.

We reached out to the government of Panama, a Central American country, that serves as a transit point for many immigrants coming from South America and other parts of the world. They told us that during the month of August, listen to this, Victor, nearly 82,000 migrants crossed through their territory. And so far, this month, more than 55,000 have done the same.This massive number of immigrants is causing problems not only across the U.S. southern border, as we have previously reported, but also in Central America and Mexico. Take a look at how these migrants are traveling through Mexico on cargo trains, using bed sheets as tents to protect themselves from the sun during the long trip north. One of those migrants told CNN that as risky as it can be, they prepared traveling on the cargo train, because taking the bus can be way more expensive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They take too much money from us when we go by bus. Drivers get 500 pesos per person, and that's why we arrived in Mexico City without any money, because they get greedy, right? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): If they stay, it makes me sad.

And what we've seen in the meantime, they have a great strategy, and they're moving towards it.
