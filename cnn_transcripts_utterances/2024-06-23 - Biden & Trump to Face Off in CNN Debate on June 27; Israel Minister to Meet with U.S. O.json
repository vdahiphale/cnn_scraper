It has some potential questions, some potential answers.His team will sort of bat those around, discuss potential retorts, zingers, responses to what they fully expect will be a barrage of attacks from Trump over the course of this debate, both on President Biden's policy, but also on his fitness for office and even on his family. And certainly they want to be ready for anything that Trump throws in their direction. Eventually, this preparation will culminate in mock debates, you know, these 90-minute sessions behind a podium as if the debate were really happening. And it has been interesting that we have heard from Bob Bauer. He's the president's personal attorney who actually played Trump in these mock debates back in 2020. He has described getting into that character in preparation for these practice sessions. Listen to what he said. BOB BAUER, JOE BIDEN'S PERSONAL LAWYER: Whenever you do this, you want to strike a balance between trying to approximate the experience, but it's not an opportunity for theatrics. That's a distraction. So you want to find some balance between recreating the experience and not attempting to, if you will, audition for Saturday Night Live.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALAN SCHROEDER, AUTHOR, \"PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES: RISKY BUSINESS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\": I think the visuals of this debate will look pretty familiar and incomparable to past debates. But I think it gives Biden, certainly, he's the one that didn't want the live audience, it gives him a kind of a comfort factor in knowing that he doesn't have to worry about, you know, Trump enthusiasts sort of interrupting or being too boisterous for his liking. But yeah, definitely the mic being off when the person -- when that person is not speaking, that's something new. And, of course, that's an outgrowth of the 2020 debates, when Trump really was speaking over the moderators, over Biden. And so it's an attempt to really control that. They both have negative perceptions that they're going to attempt to overcome in the debate. And, you know, each one is going to try to bring those negative perceptions about the other to the forefront during the program. But, you know, it's really a great opportunity. It's really a great chance before tens of millions of viewers to kind of give people a chance to look at you freshly and a chance to look at you in a new light.

Now, those numbers come from the Hamas-controlled Gaza government media office. This here is the aftermath of a strike on a residential block in the Al-Shati refugee camp. The Israeli military says its jets struck Hamas military infrastructure in the area. A rescue worker told CNN the airstrike felt like an earthquake. Protesters were on the streets of various Israeli cities on Saturday. In Tel Aviv, the demonstrators called for a hostage deal and early elections. Many want Benjamin Netanyahu removed from power. In Tel Aviv's hostage square, thousands gathered to mark hostage Naama Levy's 20th birthday. She's one of more than 100 people Hamas abducted on October 7th and is still holding.

Temperatures in middle and upper 90s going up the I-95 corridor. 98 degrees, the forecast for Washington, D.C. It looks like we'll get up near 100 again on Sunday for places like Philly, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia. A lot of these places have not seen 100-degree temperatures in years. As you take a look at the next couple of days after that, notice by Monday and Tuesday, temperatures do start to come down a little bit. Some middle and upper 80s. We'll find a cold front come through that will briefly bring some relief. Notice, though, some low 90s already sneaking in there by Tuesday. So the heat risk will be major again from New York to D.C. down the I- 95 corridor into the Carolinas on Sunday. Then as we go into the work week, that heat dome will continue to linger and build.

But what I was shocked by was how unengaged the medics were. And so when I would see people passed out, I would see the medics, and I would just see absolutely nobody stepping in to help. It was almost given that there are so many people, we cannot help everybody, so we will not help anybody. And so I'm sure they did help many people. But in my experience, I saw medics, you know, away from the scenes and sitting in the ambulances and people taking care of themselves. One touching thing that I noticed was that a lot of people were helping each other. So the pilgrims with water, with anything, any ways of cooling each other, were fanning each other or giving food or sugar, depending on what the person needed. And so it really came down to us taking care of each other, which is part of the spiritual journey itself. But we expected medical support, and we didn't get that.",

I mean, the situation year on year is just likely to get worse. I know a Saudi study found that temperatures have gone up in Saudi Arabia and Mecca specifically, even faster than other places in the Northern Hemisphere.

I think if you look at the history of the Hajj pilgrimage, it has never been the way it is run today. You always have people come who are not registered.And this is a new front -- this is a new concept of being registered itself. So people are always going to come. You cannot neglect pilgrims because they've not registered. They didn't come through the official channels. Because, of course, I know people who came through the official channels. They still didn't get the support they needed. They didn't get food, water, shelter when they needed it. I am a registered pilgrim. When I went, I didn't have accommodation for myself in some places. And so I considered sleeping outside. So this is not a question of unregistered versus registered. I think the problem is insufficient care for anybody and everybody. And so as things get hotter and pilgrims continue to grow in numbers, which is what I think the organizers want, they want to increase some pilgrims, you have to take care of pilgrims regardless of their status. And when you're outside on the streets, it's in shambles. There's absolutely no cooling systems installed. They have some, but it does not provide enough cooling. And instead, what I saw were volunteers using hose pipes to cool pilgrims walking. And that's, you know, that's fine for a small street party. But you cannot expect that for a pilgrimage which has 2 million-plus pilgrims every single year. So they have the means. They know what the issues are. And they need to invest in it. I mean, as simple as that. Just one thing I'll add, to give them credit, a couple of years ago, we had issues with crowding and stampedes and people died. They've taken care of that. So it shows they have the means. They know when the issues are. They know how to fix them. So I'm hoping in the future, now they've seen what the heat looks like, what it does to people, they address this, and we don't see a repeat of this in the future.",

The whole point is that you make money, you spend money, right? You spend money to make investments, but if it slows down and there's a gap, then it puts economic pressures that are not being addressed and it leads to economic downturn. The consumer spending would reduce and it would lead to these kind of cycles where there's decrease in business revenue and interest rates are not helping.

So people are still spending money, but they're using their money in different aspects, and that hurts the big purchases where the U.S. economy and consumer spending, two-thirds of where the GDP comes from, it hurts that degree.

Until now, only tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products were cleared by the agency. Anti-tobacco groups are slamming the decision, calling it, quote, \"a blow to public health.\"The FDA says evidence shows that the vapes made by NJOY could help adult smokers switch to a less harmful product, but the agency adds this doesn't mean they're safe or FDA approved. According to the agency's own statistics, teens and young adults are more likely to use flavored e-cigarettes than adults. For more context, I want to bring in Dr. Divay Chandra in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. And he's the Director of the Electronic Cigarette Research Initiative and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. Thank you so much for joining us. So, the case that the FDA made to authorize this, that offering more options for smokers who are trying to get off cigarettes could be extremely beneficial. Is there research to back that up? DR. DIVAY CHANDRA, DIRECTOR, ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE RESEARCH INITIATIVE: So, you know, the way the FDA makes these decisions is based on applications that are submitted by the manufacturer. Now, you and I don't have access to all of that information, but they say that they are following the science, they're looking at the data, and they have done a scientific review, and they feel convinced that the net effect will be beneficial. They do acknowledge that there may be young adults who may be more likely to use menthol flavored products. So they say they're aware of the risks, but they say in total, you know, this approval will be beneficial. So that's their -- that's their stand on this issue.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, you know, I think to understand this question, we have to look at both sides of the debate, right? So the -- the people who support, you know, making electronic cigarettes available to the general public say, look, you know, 500,000 people in the U.S. die every year prematurely from conventional cigarettes. You know, we need to do something about this.So the idea is that we provide these individuals with this quote- unquote, \"safer cigarette,\" which is the electronic cigarette. We wean them away from combustion cigarettes or traditional cigarettes, and thereby, you know, we reduce mortality from tobacco, right? And in order to do this, you need to make these products widely available. So that's kind of one side of the lobby. You know, the other side of the lobby says, well, you know, if you make these products widely available, you know, kids who are in high school, you know, there's a vape shop, there's the societal pressure, you know, nicotine is very addictive. We are just going to propagate nicotine addiction. And these individuals will vape for decades, you know, and we have no idea what's going to happen to their lungs. So those are the two sides of the aisle. You know, like you had summarized very nicely earlier, approving tobacco-flavored products has been quite palatable because, you know, traditional cigarettes are tobacco-flavored, right? And tobacco flavor does not appeal to youth. Menthol is slightly different. So that's why, you know, the controversy is occurring.",

But I think most experts agree that there is -- there's conclusive evidence that compared to not vaping, vaping is harmful, OK, particularly in terms of asthma symptoms, also in terms of susceptibility of the lungs to infection like pneumonia.So I think, you know, everybody will agree or 90% of people will agree that it is conclusive that vaping is harmful. The only justification for releasing these products is that maybe people who are using something even more harmful, you know, which is traditional cigarettes will be weaned away from the traditional cigarettes and will use electronic cigarettes. So, you know, it's this harm -- this concept of harm reduction. You know, you're reducing harm from traditional cigarettes. So clearly they are harmful. But as a society will be, you know, have net benefit from these products becoming available. I think time will tell. It's very controversial.",
