There are a number of tools that the legal and regulatory process provides, companies like GenBioPro.Congress has been very clear that the authority to regulate medication is vested in the Food and Drug Administration and not in, sort of, external interest groups or others that are seeking to undermine that process. And so, the company is carefully considering all of its options. It is reviewing the orders as well as the regulatory structure in touch with the regulators, and we will be keeping you updated as it continues to map out a strategy here.",

I believe that there are a range of legal and regulatory tools that both companies and the federal government have, and everyone is united in their commitment to keep this product accessible and available.That is, of course, what GenBioPro is all about. This is a company that's spent nearly a decade developing a generic version of mifepristone, the only in the United State, so that people could access the medication regardless of where they lived or their income level or their background. That the company continues to be committed to that. It will use the legal process and regulatory processes as it needs to. And it has been encouraging to see the strong responses that we've seen across the board from the industry, the government, other companies as well as patients and providers.

Deja Taylor's lawyer previously had told CNN that the boy's parents claim they kept their gun at their home secured, that the gun was secured with the safety and kept on the top shelf of the mother's bedroom closet, John.

And on that note, I would say that Taiwan is absolutely determined to fight for our own freedom and to fight for our sovereignty.

The Midwest and states like Michigan and Wisconsin, of course, have been critical to President Biden as he made his way to the White House in 2020.Now, one -- some sources have said that part of what gave Chicago the edge was the Illinois Governor, JB Pritzker, his pledge to help fund this convention through fundraising and his own wealth. States -- cities like Atlanta and New York had also been in the mix for this convention. But additionally, we also know that officials in both Wisconsin and Michigan critical battleground states have supported Chicago hosting this convention. Republicans will be hosting theirs just across the state line in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in July of 2024. Milwaukee, of course, was where President Biden was supposed to hold the convention back in 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic hit. He ultimately had to hold -- host that convention in his home state of Delaware. Now, this is one of the big pieces that people have been wondering out -- about as President Biden prepares for a likely campaign. Just yesterday, he said that he is planning to run again in 2024, but that he's not quite ready to make that announcement yet. So, there are still pieces that needed to come together. The convention being one of them. People are still waiting to hear where that campaign headquarters will be, who the campaign manager will be as well.
