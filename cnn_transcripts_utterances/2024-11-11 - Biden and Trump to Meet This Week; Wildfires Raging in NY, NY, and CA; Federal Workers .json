And now, she takes the job of U.S. -- U.N. ambassador, assuming that she is confirmed. It's also a job that Nikki Haley once had, interestingly enough, someone who ultimately grew to become one of Donald Trump's biggest rivals in the Republican Party and who will not be part of his administration this go around. She joins Tom Homan as the two people who have already been named to positions in a new Trump administration. Homan will be a border czar. He was of course, Trump's ICE director in his first term as president. He is someone who has been intimately involved in shaping Trump's immigration policies. He actually wrote an entire chapter for the Project 2025 book on immigration and has -- was a contributor to that. In the last couple of weeks, we have been trying to get a sense of how Homan views the efforts of trying to send, you know, this giant migrant movement out of the country, and here is what he said on Fox just moments ago about how he sees that taking place.

We always knew he was in line for some sort of role, potentially overseeing spending, but it has been far more expansive than that. And he has grown apparently close with the Trump family. Take some -- look at some of the pictures posted to social media by Trump's granddaughter with Elon Musk, with the Trump family. And clearly, is finding himself with an influential part of Trump's early sort of cabal of people who are -- or are helping set up his new government. It's an interesting development given how much wealth he has, how much conflicts he has throughout the world, what he has already done in China, what he is doing with the war effort in Ukraine.

How much influence do you think Elon Musk could be having on Trump's views and agenda and policy? KARA SWISHER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR AND HOST, \"ON\" AND \"PIVOT\" PODCASTS: Well, I don't know. I haven't covered Trump. I know Elon very well, but I'm told that whoever the last person in the room is for Trump often has control of him. And of course, Trump's attracted to the wealth and the -- you know, the glamour around Elon Musk. I guess it's glamour. I don't quite know what it is, nerd glamour. And so, he's going to have some influence. He definitely inserts himself all the time, and that's his style. That's why he's just suddenly shown up there like the guest that wouldn't leave. And I've heard from Trump people calling me saying, oh, wow, this is odd. And I'm like, yes, it is. You'll see much more of it. But he's not going anywhere until Trump throws him out, which could happen because they're both really strong personalities who like to be at the center of attention.",

And so, Trump, you know, goes through people like tissues essentially.And I think even if it's Elon Musk, and Elon has a lot of money and means and things like that, they're going to clash at some point. There's also a lot of people around Musk who are -- you know, they're going to get increasingly nervous. Again, as I said, I've heard from a number of them that, you know, they were like, oh, you're kind of right about this guy. And I was like, yes, I told you he's -- he wants influence.

And it is not hard for people to put two and two together if they want and see that it's hard not to interpret that Musk's presence on the call could have something to do with Trump's potential leverage he could be looking for to have over Zelenskyy when he wants -- when he's vowed to end the war.",

We had some light rain moved through overnight. You can see it's already exiting offshore, but again, it was very light. We did have some of those showers come over that fire in Northern New Jersey, but not really amounting to much rain. Well, less than an inch. You know, only getting a few tenths of an inch of rain out of that, which is better than nothing, but it's really not enough.You have strong winds that can spread those fires. It takes those embers, puts them somewhere out. Again, about a half an inch of rain can stop the spread of fires, but you really need more than two inches to really start to extinguish those fires when you have drought conditions. And the drought conditions have really been gripping a lot of the Northeast since the beginning of fall. More than half of the Northeast, from Maine all the way down to D.C., West Virginia, is under drought conditions, some extreme drought conditions for parts of New Jersey. And it's because we really haven't gotten rain since the beginning of fall on September 1st. Look at the rainfall deficit for fall. We're talking more than seven inches in Philadelphia, more than eight inches in New York, 6.5 inches in Boston. So, again, really haven't gotten much rain at all. In fact, Philadelphia just this morning broke its record for the longest streak without measurable rain at 42 days. The previous record was 29 days. So, breaking that record by almost two weeks. And that record was extremely old, set back in 1874. Now, we do know that wildfire days are increasing, especially in the southwest, where wildfires are a huge concern. But even for parts of the east where you might not expect it, wildfire danger is increasing. In Northern New Jersey, where we have that fire right now, wildfire days have increased by 10 days since the 1970s. So, we're adding more dry, warm, and windy days throughout the year. Sara.",
