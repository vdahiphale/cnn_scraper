Now, all across Israel, anti- government protesters are taking to the streets again, adding pressure on Netanyahu to call early elections, an outcome that he seems determined toavoid for as long as possible. But would a different government really change things? The once powerful Labor Party recently voted overwhelmingly for its new leader, the former IDF commander, Yair Golan. On October 7th, he put on his old uniform and drove to the kibbutzim to save as many people as he could in the hours when government forces seemed to be paralyzed. If he can revitalize the traditional left and a peace camp, he could prove key to Israel's future and to that of the Palestinians. He attended today's anti-government protests in front of the Knesset, and he's joining us live Jerusalem. Yair Golan, welcome to the program. Congratulations on your recent nomination as head of the Labor Party. Can I start by asking you though, about what we just heard from our Correspondent Ben Wiedemann in Lebanon? You used to be Northern commander, you know, that whole area and that dynamic really well. What do you think is going to happen? YAIR GOLAN, LEADER, ISRAEL'S LABOR PARTY:  Well, what happened in Lebanon is a good manifestation for the fact that we are countering a massive Iranian front against Israel, composed by Hezbollah, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, and the Houthis from Yemen, as well as the Hamas and the Jihadist Islam heavily supported by Iran in the Gaza Strip. And I think this is -- it symbolizes the fact that Israel is in the front line of international liberal democratic front against the most fundamentalist religious fanatic jihadist elements in the world. So, we need to understand this, you know, very basic fact.",

Right now, the latest from one of the extreme right coalition members, Ben-Gvir, has been to say we need to get back into Gaza in full-scale. We need to encourage all Gazans to emigrate, to get out.

And therefore, we need to figure out how to consolidate a trusted alternative with our regional allies, with the moderate Muslim countries backing by the United States of America, by the E.U., by other democratic elements in the globe in order to ensure that Gazans have -- will have some sort of a reasonable alternative. And at the same time, Israel will gain enough security in order to feel safe and secured in this troubled region.

But I need to ask you, because many Israelis have said there's no such thing as a Gazan civilian, everybody is Hamas. And you yourself were quoted right after October 7th as saying the following. First of all, close all supplies to Gaza. I think in this battle we should not allow a humanitarian effort. You have to tell them, listen, until the hostages are not released, for all we care, you will starve to death. It's completely legitimate. So, that's what you said. I mean, you're a Labor leader.

And concerning future coalitions I'm -- I swear to sit with anyone.

And so, it was about making sure that I could make those things heard. And yes, Drama Day, I've had this before with \"Queenie.\" And it wasn't meant to be. So, I think it just ends up being funny because I feel like we have to be funny if we're going to talk about really difficult things, which isn't necessary, but that's definitely the person that I am.

And she joined as a social media assistant, but her plan was to sort of sneak in and then start writing pieces and changing the world.

And it was really important that she was the only black person in the office, as I have often been many times, I think every time. And so, for me writing that, it was thinking about how there are so many, black women who are the only black woman in the workplace. And I actually went to South Africa to talk about this book. And loads of women were like, you're in South Africa, which is, you know, there are black people here, but I'm still that person and it really helped me to understand what it felt like. And so, it was really important for me to capture that and to capture that hostility that you feel when you have, you know, a dozen eyes on you that are kind of like, why is she here?

And then, as we get into it, we recognize that what's actually happened is her moving has disrupted this idea of home that she doesn't have a good relationship to in her head, and we explore that in this series. We understand what home means to her, what relationships mean to her, what abandonment means to her, and we kind of -- we start to understand that things have begun to unravel and that she's not telling her boyfriend what's going on.

And if they cannot get it, they will die. And at the same time, we will have more bombardments tonight. On top of that, these last two months, continual restrictions and denials of aid, meaning you have a nutritional crisis on the ground, a lethal lack of water, one or two liters per day, a shower every two weeks. Grandmothers and teenage girls, Christiane, queuing up all day for a shower. So, we've had two more months of that. So, the physical and psychological capacity of people has been smashed. And they are just holding on. And I mean, just holding on. Yes, there is hope. Gazans are amazingly resilient.
