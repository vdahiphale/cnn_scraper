And risking it all for the American dream, a rising number of pregnant women and minors make the dangerous trek through panama for a chance at asylum in the U.S. We begin with a massive cleanup underway in the Southeastern U.S. after powerful storms that spawned deadly tornadoes barreled through Mississippi and nearby states Friday night. At least 26 people were killed and dozens injured. The secretary of homeland security is set to tour the area later today. And in the past couple of hours, President Biden approved the Mississippi governor's request for a major disaster declaration to get federal disaster aid flowing as quickly as possible. The mayor of hard-hit Rolling Fork saying his city is gone. Here's Congressman Bennie Thompson describing the destruction in his home state. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS) (voice over):  It was devastation beyond imagination. People were absolutely stunned is what it just occurred.

So, we have to use a different technique. We take that climate model data. We feed it into these high resolution weather-type of models.Those models indicate that these areas that we're just talking about here in the mid south become even more vulnerable by the end of the century. When you turn up CO2, when you turn up some of these greenhouse gasses in the model, the storms become more intense, more frequent, and we also see this kind of increased in the Eastern United States frequency. And, you know, I think the events of Friday evening really are kind of a poster child of what's to come when you start talking about tornado disasters. Our cities continue to grow larger. We have maybe the same or a few more of these types of events due to climate change, but the results are more of these disasters because of the comingling of climate change and the way we build.",

As CNN's Rafael Romo shows us the number of migrants daring to cross the notorious Darien Gap is soaring, particularly the number of children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  This Venezuelan family of five is safe for now. Before arriving to a shelter in the Panamanian capital, they crossed the perilous Darien Gap, a jungle region connecting Columbia with Panama, to escape the financial crisis in their home country. The mother is pregnant and all three of their children are younger than eight. The father, the only man in the group, says they thought they were doing fine in the beginning. Apart from cliffs and all that, we were kind of calm, he said, until we started seeing dead bodies. His son wanted to share with us some of the horrible things he saw. It was terrible, he said. We found six dead bodies. The deadly dangers his family saw are nothing new at the Darien Gap, as many migrants have also reported seeing or being victim to homicides, robberies and sexual violence along the route. What's new is the fact that more and more families with children seem to be risking it all for the American dream. According to UNICEF, nearly 46,000 migrants crossed into panama and the first two months of 2023. Of those, 9,656 were minors, a figure that is seven times higher than the one observed in the same period last year. In 2022, more than 570 pregnant women, like Angrela Jimenez (ph), also enter Panamanian territory through the Darien Gap facing risks that are compounded by the fact that they're expecting. I fell, she says. I'm not kidding you. I felt like four times and rolled down hills. The Darien Gap has caught the attention of U.S. immigration authorities. GLORIA CHAVEZ, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION:  I wanted to be there.

That's basically what this says.And this is a conversation, as you know, and as so many know, that people are having and neighborhoods and in sporting events and, of course, at governing body level of, you know, around the world, and it's not something that is easy to figure out and it's balancing, of course, transgender rights with how we view women's sports. And it's something that may well take decades to decide, and even 50 years from now, people still might be trying to figure it out. But we have now seen two of the biggest sports in the Olympic world, swimming last year, track and field this week, saying that if you've gone through male puberty, you cannot compete in women's events. It's a significant development. Obviously, transgender rights advocates are not happy, those who want to, quote/unquote, protect women's sports are happy. But it's Sebastian Coe, who is the president of World Athletics, said, and he, of course, an Olympic gold medalist, ran the London Olympics in 2012, he knows the Olympic movement very well, he said this is something they're going to continue to study and continue to look at with the science and medicine and try to figure out what's next.

It's certainly have been at college level with Leah Thomas, the swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania last year, a very controversial story that resonated around the United States last year.

Do trans women have advantages in sport? What do we know about that? BRENNANI think we're going to see a lot more studies over the next few years as this issue continues to grow. It's something that resonates and is important to so many people around the world in sports and not in sports. There are also the very hateful decisions being made at the state level in the United States that complicate this. I don't see that decision here as being in the mode of, say, the governors from Florida or Texas and some of the things that are happening in the U.S. states in the us, but I do think it's all part of that same conversation, which gets so emotional. People can just calm down and have conversations somewhere in the middle. We may well come up with an answer, but I think it's going to take quite a while.",
