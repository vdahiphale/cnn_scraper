I'm Kim Brunhuber.So, we are learning more about the man the FBI says tried to assassinate Former President Donald Trump. Investigators say he was Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Public records show he was registered to vote as a Republican and he made a small donation to a Democratic aligned group. The FBI says he opened fire on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, before countersnipers shot and killed him. Now, as for Trump, he says the bullet pierced his ear and a spokesperson said shortly after the attack that he was doing fine. It all happened while cameras were rolling. Have a look at this.

Officials say one person who was attending the rally is dead and two others were critically injured.Now, as for the gunman, this video here appears to show him after he was shot by law enforcement. Investigators say he fired from atop a building, as you can see from this map here. Trump was on the stage which is also marked on the map. Hours later, Trump was seen in this video exiting his plane unassisted in New Jersey. The video was posted to social media by his campaign.

So, there should have been some attention brought to it. There's going to be a lot of investigation regarding this. What did the Secret Service have planned to keep eyes on all of these buildings to make sure that something like this didn't happen.As far as the reactionary aspect of the Secret Service mission, that was superb. You saw the agents respond very quickly to the former president, get him down on the ground, behind the armor. You saw the countersnipers do what they needed to do to mitigate the threat. The problem we're seeing is something that takes place and should be recognized during the advanced stage of the Secret Service's mission, where they're assessing the totality of the threats that a unique location may bring, such as high ground, high buildings that look down onto a potential site. So, this is going to get a look. The FBI investigation will not be the only investigation. I assure you, Congress will likely direct the Department of Homeland Security, where the Secret Service reports to, they will direct the DHS inspector general to conduct an investigation. And of course, Congress will hold their own hearings. And they'll likely start by calling the director of the Secret Service to come testify to explain exactly how protection is provided for the former president and others.",

You know, the important thing here is we don't know what was being communicated both amongst the agents as they were down behind the armor, again, safe, bodies covering the former president, and we also don't know what was being communicated over the radios.

So, these are pop up venues that go to places like the Pittsburgh area.So, you know, it's hard to do. And the Secret Service has the job of making sure that all of these sites are protected adequately. So, I expect this to continue. The next major sites we're going to see are the RNC and DNC.

STEVE SCALISE (R-LA):  A lot of those memories come back. You know, when you hear the video, the audio, especially with the pop, pop, pop, it was very similar. You know, the first one or two shots, you're not thinking it's a gunshot shot. But then by the third one, you know, and beyond it it's clear what's going on. I was hit early off and went down. In the case of President Trump, you know, you could tell when he was hit. He went down to kind of -- fortunately, as you pointed out, just that one difference, maybe the turn of the head made all the difference in the world, and thank God that he's still alive and OK, but it easily could have gone the other way. So, you know, this is one of those days where, you know, God was on the ball field with me. I think God was there with President Trump.

But whether you want to describe it in the, you know, kind of pointed and confrontational terms that Democrats and certainly, you know, Trump critics have moved toward in this environment, I don't know. I mean, I think there's going to be a natural instinct to pull back from that.Again, I wonder if the parallel is going to be true in terms of Trump pulling back from the way he describes his political opponents. I also think it's going to make it tougher for those Democrats who have been trying to find a way to nudge Biden out of the race. I think these freezes things in a way that helps him, because anything that kind of -- you know, or runs down the clock toward the Democratic Convention makes it harder to move him aside. It is a big shock, you know, and thinking about kind of the tactical political advantages, I think, is kind of a smaller part at this point than thinking of what it says about the road that we are on politically and why all the different things we have seen from the Scalise shooting to January 6th to the Whitmer threat to this is part of a continuum that is pointing us in a very clear direction that we have to choose whether or not we want to continue careening towards.",

And we're at a really critical spot in American history, but just with this election as well, where we're incredibly polarized.

Former U.S. Republican Charlie Dent spoke to us about the need to improve trust in American society and to dial back the anger and political violence. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ASPEN INSTITUTE CONGRESSIONAL PROGRAM:  Political violence is never acceptable. And sadly, in our country, we've had four presidents of the United States assassinated, Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, of course, John F. Kennedy. We had the -- RFK was assassinated. Martin Luther King. George Wallace was severely wounded. Reagan shot. Gerald Ford, there were two attempts on his life. The shooter missed both times, as I recall. And so, sadly, you know, we have this terrible tradition in Congress, you know, the threat level against elected officials, particularly in Congress, is intolerably high. Of course, Steve Scalise, Gabby Giffords, and Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked with a hammer. This is out of control. And it's -- I think a lot of it has to do with the political discourse that is -- it is just so angry. So, vengeful and so much rage that -- that's -- I hate to say it. And of course, the social media. You know, a lot of people go on social media and say the most vile things. I mean, I haven't even looked at social media tonight. I can't imagine what's being said right now. But truthfully, this is a big part of the sickness in our culture right now, and it's translated into this horrific event. And thank goodness the former president is OK. But it's a sobering moment for all of us. And it's important that, you know, we respect institutions like the FBI and the Secret Service. These agencies, they're populated with professionals, you know, who really don't -- I've never found them to be partisan during my time in government service. I felt that they were professionals and they tried to do their jobs as best they could. But it just seems that so much of our government -- it feels like people think that the government has -- at least much of the bureaucracy has a partisan inclination. And so, many folks don't trust institutions to do their jobs. And at a time like this, it's important that we have trust in the FBI and the Secret Service to get to the bottom of what happened. We all want to know what happened. And it's a -- it's just -- it's tragic that this is where we are. So, many institutions that had always been respected and admired are now tarnished with a partisan taint in many cases, unfairly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
