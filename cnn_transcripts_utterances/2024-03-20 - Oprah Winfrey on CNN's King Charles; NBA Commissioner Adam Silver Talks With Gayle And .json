The greatest reward has come from people like Charles and actually a young man who let me know that he started tearing up watching that special from the very beginning.You know, it's interesting to me because being a woman all these years and having suffered myself up and down yo-yoing, I never think about the men because I always thought men were treated differently, Charles. I always thought if you're overweight and you're a guy -- if you're a hundred pounds overweight in your guy you are not going to be ostracized in the same way that me being overweight or women being overweight, a 100 pounds, 105 pounds. And so I think to hear from so many men who also feel a sense of freedom and liberation to now make a choice that they feel is healthier for them has been the most rewarding for me. For me, you know, I was debating whether to do it or not because you know you get trolls for everything and everybody has something to say about it. But the risks -- the benefit of people finally recognizing that obesity is a disease far outweigh to me any criticism that I would receive for doing it and also people no longer blaming themselves for something that you cannot control in your brain. When the doctor said on that show that it's like holding your breath underwater and trying not to rise, to me, that is the greatest metaphor because all these years, I realized that's what I've been doing. You go on the diet, you're trying to not rise and then you rise again and you can't even understand why. And before you know it, you are 10 pounds, 20 pounds 30 pounds. And all of us have done this, who have this, is an issue. You have your limit. Yes, I have my limit. I'm not going to go over a certain number. Then you go over that number than you say I'm not going to go over five pounds over there. And to know that you're always going to back because, if you have the propensity for it, if you carry the marker for that's what's going to happen in your body, and somebody else's body, it may be different.

If we don't find a way to present our game on networks where people can find and present in a place where they produce it the way you and your colleagues do at TNT, you know, and great job that ESPN does, people aren't going to watch it. So the players and the owners have a partnership. You know how our cap system works. It's, in essence, a revenue sharing system. And it's a fantastic model because everybody's incentive. In essence, it's a 50- 50 split. But as I say to the players and to my bosses, who are the owners, that there's so much competition these days in media. I mean, just think of what's going on at TNT in terms of changes in cable, what's happening at CNN, and everything is moving digitally. So as we're looking out the next decade, we've got to think about how we're going to produce and present our games in a way where they're going to be easily accessible. Because look, a lot of people, you must talk to fans all the time who don't get cable. And they feast on social media. And our players are incredibly popular there. But it's not a substitute for watching live games. And the thing that really excites me, there's been a lot of talk about games, in essence, being ported over to digital platforms. And you saw it with NFL, with NBC, and Peacock. Amazon has games now, too. But in essence, they're still the same games. It's the same feet of the game. What's really exciting to me, as you move to these digital platforms, it creates opportunities to do things unimaginable before in traditional television. I mean, frankly, for people who do want to bet, and you talk about that, you can do that. If you want nothing to do with that, that's fine. For people who want to buy the shoes the players are wearing, that the jerseys are wearing, for people who want to be part of a larger community, for people who want different languages, different dialects, for people who want to listen to commentary from Charles, not just during the break, but throughout the game, or people want Mike Breen to be doing play-by-play, or just to hear a group of people who are just fans having fun watching the game. So I think production is going to change dramatically over the next several years. And the other part about our game being global. I mean, even now, 75 percent of our viewership comes from outside the United States. Isn't that incredible?",

So they're entertainers. I don't think any more than fans begrudge Beyonce or Taylor Swift.To me, if you're generating the interest from the fans, you deserve to make what the market will bear. At the same time, whether it's the owners of the teams or the people producing the games, as I'm constantly reminding the players, but it requires a whole ecosystem to support you. I mean, sometimes I use the analogy, it's like when you watch a movie and they're the stars you see on the screen, but then you could sit there for 15 minutes and watching the credits because all those people are necessary. And that's kind of like the NBA. There's tens of thousands of people who are employed by the league and the teams and the related businesses all to produce this game. So to the extent that interest continues to grow, and I think basketball is the fastest growing sport in the world, and we're unique in terms of the NBA, in terms of global appeal, that there's no reason player salaries shouldn't continue to grow.
