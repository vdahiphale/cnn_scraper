Hezbollah suffers from a war weary Republic, with Lebanon being an economic collapse. Iran wants to safeguard Hezbollah in defense of its nuclear program. Should Israel attack it? And I think Hezbollah and Iran truly believe that with the Biden administration so clearly against Israel launching a war in Lebanon, that that would keep Israel at bay.

And just one day after the Russian president Vladimir Putin suggested that Moscow may respond by supplying weapons to the rivals of Ukraine's allies. Washington believes the visit is meant to send a message from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADM. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: Well, we're going to watch it closely, of course, like we do, all Russian naval exercises in the Caribbean. This isn't the first time they've done this. They've done it several years past almost every couple of years or so, they do this. So we'll watch it closely, but we're not anticipating any significant national security threat as a result of these exercises. And I'd have to say largely, although this is not atypical for them and they are prescheduled, it very much we believe is messaging by the Russians clearly unhappy now that we've got the supplemental funding and we are supplying Ukraine with weapons.

The president of Sudan's governing body visited the area near the village of Wad Alnoura on Thursday.The government says that's where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched a gruesome attack the day before, injuring some 200 people. Witnesses say that the militants used armored vehicles and heavy weapons and that most of the victims were civilians. Sudanese activists later shared this video on social media saying that it shows the remains of some of the victims, scores of them. The militants have been fighting Sudan's army since April, 2023 forcing millions to flee their homes. Well, it's been a bit of a battle of the balloons between North and South Korea lately. Pyongyang recently, of course, sending balloons filled with waste across the border south. And now South Korean activists are floating their own versions with cash, K-pop, and TV shows north. Balloons have been crossing the border for years and some South Koreans are getting a little fed up with it. CNN's Mike Valerio with more on that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE VALERIO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a place that blooms with life, a serene and stunning setting, 60-year-old farmer Kim Young-bin cares for his giant onions with water flowing from North Korea. It's part of a beautiful and, he says, inseparable bond between North and South, now fraught with tension once again. \"There used to be a time when we talked about peace,\" he says, \"but it's all changed now. We only hear difficult situations between the Koreas, so we farmers are very uncomfortable.\" Kim tells us he's farmed this land in Cheorwon, South Korea for 36 years and he disagrees with this.",

We're not talking about the fields in the foreground. We're talking about way in the background, the DMZ, about 4 kilometers, 2.5 miles away from where we're standing. Now, Farmer Kim has told us that during moments of heightened tension in the past, the South Korean army has kept him from entering about half of his property because it is so close to the DMZ in order to keep him and others safe. The question now, how will North Korea respond, especially after a show of force by the United States, a B-1B bomber on Wednesday flying over the Korean Peninsula and for the first time in seven years engaging in land target practice with live munitions. We asked Kim if he wants to leave. His answer? \"I want to move to somewhere else, but I can't afford it. We're very upset that the balloons are making our daily lives inconvenient and our areas seen as a war zone. It's very unfortunate. There's nothing we can do. If I could, I would want to stop them, but it's difficult.\" So for Kim, there's no choice. Staying in his field, surrounded by waters from the North, longing for a time before new heights of tension in the sky. Mike Valerio, CNN -- Cheorwon, South Korea. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That was NASA's dream of outsourcing the transportation of its own astronauts to the International Space Station to private companies -- SpaceX and Boeing. Now SpaceX has been doing this for about four years but Boeing and its Starliner spacecraft just joined the party on Thursday by safely delivering NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams to the ISS on its inaugural crewed test flight. They did encounter some minor hiccups on the way. Two new helium links started up. And then they also had some issues with the thrusters. As it was approaching the space station, they missed their first docking attempt, but safely made it on the second one. So a big day for Boeing and NASA's commercial crew program. But this was also a big day for the company that has another spacecraft docked at the ISS -- SpaceX. SpaceX down in Boca Chica, Texas Starbase, they just launched the fourth flight test of the biggest, most powerful rocket that's ever flown -- Starship. And it achieved both of its goals, both the super heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft were able to perform soft or controlled splash-downs into either the Gulf of Mexico or the Indian Ocean. So this is really the beginning of reusable, rapid reusability for this rocket. And its really at the center of NASA's Artemis missions. This is the spacecraft that NASA is hoping will land its astronauts on the surface so the moon for the first time since the Apollo program. So a very big day in space news for both Boeing and its Starliner spacecraft, and SpaceX and Starship. Kristin Fisher, CNN -- Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
