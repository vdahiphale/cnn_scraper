And, apparently, the circus elephant got spooked while preparing for a show and got loose in Butte, Montana yesterday. Viola had strolled half-a-block, halting traffic -- there's a little Butte right there -- when circus handlers found her eating grass behind a nearby business. She was not harmed during this wild adventure and returned to her day job performing at the circus. Glad to see Viola's doing OK. I wonder how she did at the slots. Thanks very much for joining us this morning. I'm Jim Acosta. Our next hour of NEWSROOM with Wolf Blitzer starts right now. Have a great day.",

We're live in Tel Aviv as the tensions build. Also happening this hour, a Boeing whistle-blower is on Capitol Hill right now testifying about the safety of the company's planes. More on his disturbing claims, that's coming up. Also, a new study on the high price of climate change, a look at how it's costing you a lot of money. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. We begin this hour in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a message for his foreign allies. He says Israel appreciates their support, but insists it will make its own decisions about Iran. Israel is weighing how to respond to Iran's direct attacks over the weekend. The U.S. and European allies have urged restraint, pushing for sanctions over military strikes. Our Anderson Cooper is joining us live. He's in Tel Aviv following all these rapidly evolving developments. What are you hearing Anderson, first of all, about a potential Israeli military response?",

No official word yet on what decision has been made, what timing of any kind of counterattack would be. Jeremy Diamond is here with me in Tel Aviv.

The Israeli military says more than 120 ballistic missiles were fired at Israel in this attack, only a handful of them actually making it through Israel's air defense systems. And the Israeli military believes this missile was likely intercepted. And you can see the holes in the sides of this fuel tank. This missile was actually found in the Dead Sea. It was recovered, and it was taken to this base in Southern Israel. But now Israel says it must respond. It must reestablish deterrence. They say this attack cannot go unanswered. The only question now is how the Israeli military will respond and when. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so you can just imagine the destructive power that it could have had it made it through that air defense system. And so it's interesting, as we're looking for what the next steps of Israel's response will be, the Israeli prime minister invoking the fact that the allies, Israel's allies, helped with that air defense effort. But, still, he's saying that's not going to box him in as far as what Israel will do to respond to Iran. He's saying that Israel will make its own decision.",

And even as the attention has been on the situation between Israel and Iran, this has been a very deadly week in Gaza. We saw even just yesterday dozens of people were killed in various Israeli airstrikes in Central Gaza, in particular, one particularly deadly situation in the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, where at least eight children were killed in one strike. So it's important to keep in mind that, even as the focus is on these kind of big geopolitical issues, Israel's military campaign in Gaza still very much ongoing, and they are also vowing to finish the job there. And that's certainly a complicating factor as they consider this response to Iran. Netanyahu wants to finish the job in Gaza. And I think he also knows that a hot war with Iran is going to detract his attention, detract the military's attention from actually finishing off Hamas in Gaza, which he has said, of course, is his stated objective.",

And then we have also heard from the U.K. foreign secretary, who was in Israel just this morning, saying that the G7 is looking at coordinated Iran sanctions. So, that's something that we will be watching for out of this meeting. The secretary of state, Tony Blinken, just arrived there this morning. The other thing that I want to note, just to pivot for a second away from the region, is that U.S. officials just last week told reporters that there is really an unprecedented amount of support that China is giving to Russia in order to build up its defense industrial base. And that's allowing Russia to build up its military expansion in a way that it hasn't done since the Soviet era. They think that Europeans could put some pressure on China in this vein. So that's another thing that they will be discussing at the G7 this week.",

I think they're trying to minimize the Israeli response as best as they can in order to make sure there's no, like, huge regional war out of this thing.But it's a tricky thing, because you can never know what the -- how the Iranians are going to respond. The assessment I hear from both U.S. and Israeli officials is that the Iranians will respond to any Israeli strike in their territory. The question is, are they going to respond the same way they did on last Saturday? Is it going to be even bigger, or they're just going to try and sort of close this incident with some sort of a symbolic response? But those are all question marks. This is why, when you enter such a thing, you don't know how you're going to come out of it.",

It's more a division between the former generals, Minister of Defense Gallant, and former IDF Chiefs of Staff Eisenkot and Benny Gantz, and the civilians, Netanyahu himself, Ron Dermer, and Aryeh Deri, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party. So this is the division, between the generals, who want a more aggressive response, and the civilians, who want to -- who are more careful. But I will give you another point, and I'm sure you and many of our viewers will understand it very well, and this is that we are less than a week away from the holy day of Passover, when Jews all over the world, and especially in Israel, have their family seder, Passover seder. This is a big thing. So for Netanyahu to decide right now to go on a strike with Iran that might lead to a war a few days before this huge religious holiday, it's a big thing. It's like the president of the United States taking such a decision four days before Christmas. So it's a main issue. Even though it seems like an anecdote, it's a main part in the decision-making.",

It included assistance for both countries. President Biden concludes the op-ed in \"The Wall Street Journal\" by saying -- and I'm quoting him now -- \"There are moments in history that call for leadership and courage. This is one of them.\" The battle over foreign aid has led to internal chaos in the House, with Republican Speaker Mike Johnson's job on the line right now.
