We are live in London and Kyiv this hour. And President Biden reflects on the State of the Union, but not everyone agrees with his status update. But first this evening, rescue workers are frantically racing against time. More than 60 hours on from the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria. And freezing temperatures, teams on the ground are still desperately trying to reach any survivors under the rubble. There is still hope with moments like this one from early on in the day.

And there is a heck a lot of training that would go into, even getting a Ukrainian pilot to be able to fly them in the first place. But now, the U.K. has become the very first country to commit to actually training Ukrainian pilots to fly these jets. Now, what they're not committing is the actual jets themselves. Instead, they said that, look, they're going to ramp up sanctions on Russia. They're going to provide more training, and they're going to try to accelerate the timeline to actually send the weapons that they have committed already.

CNN obtained images of similar Chinese balloons, hovering over Taiwan in recent months, including this one on New Year's Eve and this one a few months earlier. At least four balloon sightings in the last two years, says Su Tzu-yun, director of Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He said the island's relatively small size, about the same as the state of Florida, gives Taiwan's military limited time to intercept balloons or even shoot them down. SU TZU-YUN, DIRECTOR OF TAIWAN'S INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY RESEARCH:  The spy balloon crossed to Montana state, a very important ICBM site of the United States. RIPLEY (voice-over):  Su says balloons can capture high-resolution images of sensitive sites, potentially making China's ICBMs more accurate. Taipei says Chinese spy balloons should not be tolerated by the international community. Last year, dozens of civilian drones from China captured videos of Taiwanese military outposts. Soldiers responded with rocks and flares, managing to shoot at least one drone down. Taiwan's defense ministry says 121 Chinese military planes flew near the island just last month.",
