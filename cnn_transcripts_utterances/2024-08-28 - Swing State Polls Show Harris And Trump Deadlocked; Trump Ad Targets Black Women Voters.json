What Trump had going for him, above all, was Joe Biden's age and the perception of Americans that he wasn't up to the job for another four years. Once that was removed as a factor, the Democrats jumped up in the polls. It's not so much Trump losing support, it's the Democrats gaining support among people who don't want Trump.",

And also it's notable, I mean, we're talking about Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, none of these are places that have to be won in order to win this election. So, these are actually places where Harris is now putting Trump on defense.ASHLEY ETIENNE, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, V.P. HARRIS 2021: Absolutely. I mean, she's, her presence has expanded the map. I mean, she can play in so many different places. And I think the other thing we've not been paying much attention to is she's got $540 million on hand to actually play heavily in those states. But here's the thing, you know, I think at this stage of the game, what matters most is money on hand and is infrastructure and messaging. Each one of those Trump is failing on to your point earlier. This is only one additional sign that there's a crisis happening within his campaign and is raising questions about whether or not he can make up the difference in any of these states with any of the constituency. So, I think that's the real challenge with him now is she's raised three times as much money as he is. He has very little infrastructure in the States. I think he just went up in Georgia last month. And then in terms of messaging, the border crossings are down, the economy -- you know, inflation is down, you know, unemployment is down, so all of the attacks on her are now working to her advantage. So, those three areas, I think are, again, double downing on the fact that the Republicans are having a problem.",

I think she has this unique flexibility, if she can communicate it, to own the good and walk away from the bad. There are some real baked in unfavorability with the Biden era, the inflation, the economy. And if she can try to seem like she's signaling a different direction.But to Joe's point, there are some really bad policy proposals in my opinion on both sides, whether it's Trump and 18 percent import tariffs or giving $25,000 to first time home buyers, in theory, a good idea will likely drive up demand and therefore the cost of homes. I'd love to have a robust debate around those things. But in the Trump era, we don't even get to talk about policy. It becomes name calling. It becomes the memes that he's put out. It becomes sort of this race to the bottom. Glad we have a debate, but we don't even live in a society these days where we're like functionally talking about policy.",

And I think that if Kamala Harris becomes the President of the United States of America, lead this great nation and she starts enacting policies that leave people wondering why they weren't told about it before she actually took the oath of office, I think it would be a crisis in this country.

So, diehard RFK supporters still have the opportunity to directly vote for him rather than Trump.But then to Eric Levine's point earlier, for normie column Nikki Haley voter Republicans or even swing voters you need to win elections, he, Tulsi Gabbard, the anti-vax crowd are absolutely radioactive and he risks losing them.
