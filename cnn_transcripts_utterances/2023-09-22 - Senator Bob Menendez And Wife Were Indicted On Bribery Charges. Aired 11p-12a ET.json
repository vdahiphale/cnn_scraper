      "sentences": "Well, good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates. A week that began with Merrick Garland being accused of weaponizing the Department of Justice against Republicans ends with one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington, D.C. now indicted for corruption.The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, stands accused of conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right, essentially using his official position to force someone to give him something of value. Tonight, we are taking a deep dive into all of it from the investigation to the indictment and, of course, the political fallout. Here are the big questions I've been asking all day after seeing all the reports. Let's cut through all of it. Here are the real questions. Number one, did he do it? Right? Did he do it? Could a senator who left a hung jury in his last trial for conspiracy, bribery, and honest services fraud, sounds familiar, laid to allegedly personal favors, really have been so brazen a second time around? Is this how the political structures really made or is this corruption at its very finest? And, of course, now that the Senate rules force him to step down from his position as chairman, should he also step down from the Senate? Or maybe the better question is, will he actually do that? And, of course, you've heard a lot about the two-tier justice system, right? And witch hunts and beyond? Well, will the very same Republicans who have alleged those political witch hunts and a two- tier justice system come sprinting to this man's defense? Or will this be proof that lady justice might just be, well, independent? And what will the people in the court of public opinion, let alone the court of law, make of yet another allegation of an abuse of power by the very people who we were told to trust? I want to bring in John Miller, CNN's chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. John, I have been champing at the bit to talk about this all day because, look, this is extraordinary right now. There is an extraordinary level of detail in this indictment. It goes back years, all the way to 2018. Full stop, there is a presumption of innocence. We know this very, very well. And yet, this is damning as it's written. So, what is standing out to you most of all?",

It's on that level more shocking than your average bribery case. It's people allegedly possibly acting as agents of a foreign government and a foreign government trying to recruit a U.S. official is very important.",

The bureau believed it was ready for prosecution, so did the U.S. attorney in Newark.But it was sent across the street and the judgment of the attorney general and the public corruption section was to pass on it. After that, of course, you saw the other case that ended with a partial acquittal and a hung jury. And now, this case. So, he has really been under the spotlight for a long time.

But why was he allowed then to continue as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee?I want to dive into this with Susan Glasser, staff writer at \"The New Yorker.\" Susan, it's so good to see you. I've been wanting to pick your brain about this matter in particular because the prosecutors are alleging here that Menendez misused his power as the Senate Foreign Relations chair, giving sensitive information to the government of Egypt. What is your reaction to that allegation?",

I mean, first of all, there have been enormous amount of backstage lobbying in recent years involving Egypt because its human rights abuses are such that there are various laws that are in place that Congress has passed, that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has passed, in order to make sure that the U.S. is not doing business with human rights abusers and the like.And so, often, it requires the State Department to certify that Egypt and other countries are meeting certain criteria. There's a big dispute about that because really, it's not. And yet, nonetheless, it's a very important strategic partner of the United States and Israel in the Middle East. And so, we have a long history of giving aid, military assistance, weapon sales to Egypt to the tune of billions of dollars, billions and billions of dollars since Egypt and Israel first made peace with each other decades ago. And so, at times, we've had to calibrate that partnership when you're balancing human rights versus its strategic needs. So, somebody like Menendez, if he was really in Egypt's corner, pushing things along behind the scenes, that's a very significant matter because this was a subject of real dispute here in Washington.",

So, what will the case look like for the prosecution and for the defense?Well, joining me now is Renato Mariotti, he's a former federal prosecutor, and CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson is a criminal defense attorney. Gentlemen, I'm glad you're here. I just want to dive in for a second to help people understand what we're talking about. These allegations are quite serious. He is being accused of taking and including 13 gold bars, nearly half a million dollars in cash, $80,000 in his wife's safety deposit box, home furnishings, home mortgage payments, compensation for a low or no-show job, and Mercedes-Benz as well. Part of the evidence is that he even Googled, apparently, with respect to the gold blocks, how much is one kilo of gold worth? It's actually a Google search. And there's evidence of text messages, emails between Menendez's wife and the co-defendants. Again, the web search, not just to name a few of the things. And so, I want to take a second and draw on both of your legal expertise. I'm going to ask you, Renato, to be the prosecutor, and Joey, you to be the defense counsel here, because I want to understand what would be your position here. Renato, I'll begin with you. Given the evidence we're seeing, this could all play out in court based on what we currently know, what is the strongest way to present this case?",

So that people can pay money and you not do anything for them so that you don't represent the interests?The issue is not the extent to which he got gifts, the extent to which there were dinners or lunches or text messages. The issue is to what extent that influenced his official action would he not have engaged and the behavior of doing the best job he could for the interest he thought and sought to protect. And to the extent that he might have intervened as it related to Egypt, to the extent he might have intervened in criminal investigation, it was his role as a senator to do so, to advocate and to use all of his abilities on behalf of the people of the state of New Jersey to be the best senator he could. Unless you connect the dots and establish that it was a this for that, you can talk about all the gold bars, you can talk about all the Mercedes, you can talk about all the hundreds of thousand dollars you want. Where is the nexus or connection that motivated him to engage in the behavior he did? I would suggest it does not exist.",
