It is soaring over 700 points on tracks for its best day since November last year. Those are the markets, and these are the main events. It is full steam ahead for the U.S. labor market as May job numbers blows past expectations. Crisis averted: President Joe Biden prepare to sign into law a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. And never mind the Metaverse, Meta tells his staff to come back to the office. Live from New York, it is Friday, June 2nd. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. All right, good evening. Tonight, they say good numbers comes in threes. Well, U.S. markets have got a greenlit debt deal, strong jobs numbers, and also signs that the Fed may soon hit the pause button on rising interest rates and that's music to the ears of a lot of investors as you could see here. Look at the Dow go. Up more than 700 points, only an hour left until the trading day or trading week rather ends. It jumped on the bow and it pretty much gained momentum throughout the day. The broader S&amp;P 500 has added more than one-and-a-half percent. The NASDAQ is more than 140 points higher. Global markets rejoiced as well. The Hang Seng closed four percent higher, the Nikkei put on 1.2 percent, London's FTSE and Germany's DAX also posted healthy gains as well. U.S. jobs growth last month was much stronger than forecast, 339,000 new jobs were added in May. Economists had been expecting about 195,000. High employment can lead to inflation. So a good jobs number, it can be bad news when the Fed is trying to slow the economy down, but there are some mixed signals here. The unemployment actually ticked up to 3.7 percent, and wage growth slowed. investors now put the chances of a rate rise this month at 33 percent. Matt Egan joins us live now from New York. So Matt, it really was kind of a mixed jobs report because you seemingly had these two divergent results. Obviously, you've got the stellar number in terms of just how many jobs were added, 339,000, but the unemployment rate actually ticked up to 3.7 percent. Just help make sense of it for us.",

Fitch saysthat, yes, the fact that they were able to reach a deal that narrowly will eat into deficits, they think that's a positive. But they are concerned about these negatives around governance in the United States. They said that there has been a \"steady deterioration\" in governance over the last 15 years. They pointed to these repeated brinksmanship episodes around the debt ceiling, but they also just pointed to the general polarization in the United States, even the 2020 election and efforts to overturn that. So there is this broader concern that although the U.S. economy is the biggest in the world, although the dollar is the world's safe haven, there are these governance and polarization issues that raise questions about whether the United States still deserves that AAA credit rating. So Zain, it is still possible that we have a situation like we did in 2011 where a debt ceiling debacle was avoided, and yet the credit rating gets downgraded anyway.",

All right, the cogs of the U.S. Treasury will soon start turning again, after being jammed up for nearly five months. The government technically hit the debt ceiling in January, and the Treasury has used a series of measures and maneuvers to continue paying the bills. The deal to raise the debt limit passed Congress before Monday's default deadline, and once President Joe Biden signs the bill into law, the Treasury can start borrowing money again. Phil Mattingly is in Washington, DC for us. So Phil, just walk us through -- I mean, it is really difficult in these sorts of situations for both sides to claim, you know, the deal as a win, but just walk us through what's in the deal and if Republicans because they did manage to sort of save over a trillion dollars, can they say that this is a win for them?",

Thank you so much. All right, most economists think the debt deal won't have a major impact on the U.S. economy. It pares back government spending ever so slightly over the next two years. That may lower GDP growth by a small amount and cause some job losses. The deal claws back some COVID-19 funds. It maintains climate measures and it ends a pause in student loan repayments, which my next guest says will hit consumer spending. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics joins us live now from Philadelphia. Mark, thank you so much for being with us. If you can just explain to us that aspect of it, this idea that student loan payments have now been reinstated, and what effect, what tangible effect that will have on consumer spending. MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Yes, it'll be a bit of a headwind, Zain. If you do a little bit of arithmetic, roughly 20 million student loan borrowers will start to pay again on their debt, about $250.00 to $300.00 more a month for these folks and if you add it all up, it's about $5 billion a month. And you know, that will shave a couple of three-tenths of percent off of consumer spending GDP growth over the course of the coming year. So, you know, it's not one of these things that's going to cause consumer spending to come to a standstill. Consumers have a lot going for them. We saw today's job numbers. They were fantastic. But it is a bit of a headwind, and it is coming at a time when the economy will be struggling later this year and into next. So recession risks are still quite high, and this headwind will, you know, if I were king, I wouldn't do it right now, but I guess there's no really any good time to do it.",

I mean, thetop line 339,000 job gain, well, that is just a pretty strong labor market, probably too strong for most. But at the same time, as you pointed out, the unemployment rate rose. If you dig even deeper into the bowels, there are some reasons to think that the economy is slowing, number of hours work per week declined. We saw wage growth moderate. So all in all, I think the Fed, it is kind of awash, I think, and when it's all said and done, my sense is they will pause the rate hikes at this next meeting in a couple of weeks. That's what I think they will do, but I certainly think that's what they should do.",

I mean, the broader economic impacts are pretty small. And when you think about it, the center held, right? I mean, the Republicans kind of in the center, and Democrats kind of in the center coming together getting enough votes to get it across the finish line, so that was a compromise, and you've got people on either end of the political spectrum complaining about it, that's a compromise. So I think there is a lot to take some solace in this. So I don't think they'll downgrade, but having said that, you know, we've got a lot more script to be written here over the years.

Now the number of those injured, Zain, exceeds 300. But, you know, it's 7:00 p.m., it would have been very busy. As you can imagine carriages that would have been packed as well. What we don't know at this stage, Zain, is how many people are trapped. We see people clamoring around as you saw in those pictures on the side of that train. Clearly there are people stuck inside. We don't know yet how many there are. But authorities are telling us that what happened is two passenger trains and a goods trains collided. What we don't know at this stage, Zain, is how the carriages came off the track then hitting the goods train which I assume would have been an adjacent trap. That we do not know at this stage. But rescue teams have been told, have been rushed to the scene of what looks like a very horrific crash. And more than 50 ambulances and several fire service units have also been sent to the scene. Now, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he has tweeted in the last 40 minutes or so, and he said he's distressed as you can see there on your screen by the train accident. And he says his thoughts are with the bereaved families. And also, the government has also announced in the last half hour or so it will offer compensation to the train accident victims but as you all know, Zain, and many of our viewers will know, India has one of the largest rail networks in the world. It's exceptionally busy, it's very important. Millions of people of course use the train every day. It's one of the cheapest ways to travel these trains crisscross India and what I was looking two of these passenger trains, they were very speedy trains. So, we are keeping an eye on the latest developments but it -- the pictures, the images we are getting right now it sounds and looks like a horrific accident. Fifty people dead. We do not know at this stage how many are trapped but as soon as we have more details of course we'll bring it to you. 300 injured exceeding 300. Zain?",

TIRRELL (voiceover): Ferguson is one of many patients taking drugs like Ozempic for weight loss who say they've also lost interest in some addictive behaviors. Doctors told CNN that patients most commonly report an effect on alcohol use. It may be because these drugs in a class known as GLP-1s have an effect not just in the gut but also in the brain. It's something being studied at the National Institutes of Health where researchers just published a paper showing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, reduced what they called binge-like alcohol drinking in rodents. DR. LORENZO LEGGIO, RESEARCHER, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH: We believe that at least one of the mechanisms is how this drug reduces alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol, such as those related to transmitters in our brain which is dopamine. So these medications are likely to make alcohol less rewarding. TIRRELL (voiceover): And it's not just alcohol and nicotine.
