Poland did not say who fired it.And we have more breaking election news. CNN can now project that Josh Harder, the Democratic incumbent in California's ninth district, will hold on to his seat, defeating Republican Tom Patti. This means Democrats will control at least 207 seats in the House. But the numbers there, you see, the wind is at the back of Republicans, which is 217. One spot left to hold that majority. Joining me now to discuss, CNN political commentator David Swerdlick, Democratic strategist Nayyera Haq, and former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh. A lot to unpack here. And as we see, the wind is at the back of Republicans right now. We know that Republicans are likely -- it's the lawyer in me that is hedging -- but likely to now be in the majority. There are questions about who is going to lead. But there is also an announcement tonight, right? And a lot of what is being said about who might lead the Republican Party, well, you've got somebody who has been the de facto leader for the better part of two years. So, my first question to all of you is, are you exhausted already thinking about all of what's to come over the next two years? What do you think?",

A couple of years later, he is not an open seat, it is running against a comfortable incumbent president, and he has been out of the game for a minute. His party has suffered losses and setbacks.

I do not plan to be involved in politics. While I will always love and support my father, going forward I will do so outside the political arena.

Now, to the point about his hold on the Republican Party, it is absolutely there, but we also saw the Trump era drive people out of the Republican Party.

Now, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is promising to have an independent and thorough investigation of what exactly happened when five officers entered the cell where Jarrett Hobbs was being held.Martin Savidge has our report. I really want to warn you that this video is very hard to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  New video shows a brutal beating of a Black man in custody by five officers in Georgia. Forty-one-year-old Jarrett Hobbs was arrested and held at the Camden County Detention Center in September. The video, provided to CNN by Hobbs's attorney, Harry Daniels, shows five officers entering the cell and start beating Hobbs and wrestling him to the ground. In the second video released by his attorney, the officers are seen dragging Hobbs out of the cell where the beating continued. It's not clear what preceded these two videos. In a news release, Daniels said the video is undeniable and the deputies' actions are inexcusable. Daniels further claim that before the attack, Hobbs was experiencing a psychological episode at the jail and asked to be placed in protective custody. Daniels says there is a third video that does not show the incident but provides audio unlike two videos released. But Daniels says he is not releasing that video at this time. The Camden County Sheriff's Office said in the statement it has ordered an internal investigation of the incident to begin immediately. Hobbs was arrested in Camden County for violating his probation stemming from a federal case in North Carolina. According to his attorney, he was charged with speeding, driving at revoked or suspended license, and possession of a controlled substance. According to North Carolina court documents, Hobbs's probation officer who was not president at the time of the incident, testified that jailers heard a large banging from the defendant's holding cell. Defendant was reportedly kicking his cell door and was told by jailers to stop after already being warned to stop previously. It goes on to claim that the defendant resisted the jailers and subsequently punched one deputy in the face while punching another deputy in the side of his head. One deputy sustained a bruised eye and a broken hand as a result of the incident. Hobbs's attorney is calling for the attorney general to bring charges against the officers. (On camera):  CNN has reached out to the district attorney and the sheriff's office for comments. So far, we have not heard back. Meanwhile, Hobbs is in prison in North Carolina, according to his attorney. And lastly, we should point out in full transparency, some of the information in this report was given to us by CNN contributor Bakari Sellers, who is also an attorney and also represents Hobbs.

Why did they begin to physically assault him?Most people look at this video, Bakari, and say, what am I missing here as opposed to the brutality? What is the bigger story? Is there even one?",

The fact that they gave false reports to the United States probation officer, United States attorney in North Carolina, is appalling within itself. The United States Attorney's Office dismissed those claims. When they saw the video that was produced by the Camden County, they knew that Mr. Hobbs did not commit any assault but assault was committed against him. The sheriff gave a statement today that he was going to investigate this matter immediately although he had just learned about it. These issues took place at the end of summer, September the 3rd. The (INAUDIBLE) president for the local chapter went to the jail, questioned -- asked a question about Mr. Hobbs. He did not get any answers. And not until this video came out then and only then the sheriff decided to jump into action. We learned today that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation will help to investigate this matter.",

He, in fact, once he was accused of assault on police officer, that was something to consider that the United States probation officers look at it and while he is on probation. He proclaimed that he had not committed assault.So, the United States probation, United States attorney as well as his attorney in North Carolina retrieved a video. Once they got the video, they produced the video to us. In the third video, that video does really show what happened inside the cell. It shows what happened.
