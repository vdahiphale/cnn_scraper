It is a major development possibly with serious implications.Plus, a former world leader and guest who's appeared on this program in prison tonight, his health failing. His son's lawyer says he's been poisoned. They say Putin is involved and they're OUTFRON tonight. And morgues in China overflowing, full of people who were sick from COVID. The government is saying, though, they're not COVID deaths. Why? We're live in Beijing tonight with a special report. Let's go out front. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Putin calls it a war. For the first time, Vladimir Putin using the word \"war\" to describe his brutal invasion of Ukraine. For ten months, it's been called a special operation. In fact the word war has been banned. And then today, hours after Zelenskyy visited with Biden in Washington, Putin said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Our goal is not to spin the flywheel of military conflict but on the contrary to end this war. We have been and will continue to strive for this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It has serious implications because it allows Putin to call for full mobilization and impose marshal law across Russia if he wants to.And Putin's use of the word war comes after his defense minister said Russia was going to be upping its fighting force by half a million soldiers. So it is unclear whether Putin finally slipped up in using the word war, but to be clear, it is not a word he has used in ten months. And he said it as we're getting yet another phone call showing the dire straits among those Putin already has called to his frontlines. This intercepted was provided to us by Ukrainian intelligence and what you're going to hear tonight is a call from a Russian servicewoman and she's talking about how bad things are in Putin's army. Listen for yourself. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, INTERCEPTED RUSSIAN SOLDIER PHONE CALL) SOLDIER (through translator):  They don't give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) about people anywhere. It's everywhere, not just here. It's so awful. Nobody cares about anyone. They just made camp here in this forest of small trees without any shelter or building, nothing.

It's a massacre Putin has denied despite the clear evidence.

People watched their neighbors sit in the streets and rot for a month because they were afraid the Russian soldiers would shoot them, too, execution style if they moved them. That was the reality of life occupied by Russia, for people who are living in a suburb of Kyiv.Now, we don't know if President Zelenskyy is back here in Kyiv just yet. We do know that there's video emerged tonight from the polish border where he met with the president of Poland, President Dudu -- President Duda, I should say, and the obvious -- if he was taking the train hike he did on his way out, he would have arrived back here by nu, but his movements are kept carefully and closely guarded secret for obvious security reasons. But he did have meeting with the Polish president. We know that his wife, the first lady of Ukraine, appeared at a conference of ambassadors today. It would make sense if he were to make an appearance tomorrow if the conference does continue. But where that is, whether he'll be showing up, what he'll be saying, those are all open questions. Meanwhile the significance of Putin calling this a war, Russia has been making up their own narrative throughout this conflict, Erin. But one of lines they said was striking after the Zelenskyy Biden meeting. They said the West -- the West was responsible for turning Ukraine in their words into a hostile terrorist state. They're saying that the West turned Ukraine into a hostile terrorist state as they continued bombing civilian infrastructure and making life miserable for millions of people.",

Live in Kyiv tonight.And out front now, I want to go to Yousur Al-Hlou, video journalist for \"The New York Times.\" And I mentioned the incredible investigation that you and your team have done over months about the massacre in Bucha. So can you tell me how you were able to trace the Russian soldiers? Right? This isn't just like, okay, it's Russian soldiers. You got the exact unit and where they're from and their faces and names, who these individuals are and then got them on the phone. YOUSUR AL-HLOU, NYT VIDEO JOURNALIST:  Thank you for having me, Erin. And yeah, it was like you mentioned a month-long process. And like your colleague was on the camera earlier, I was also in Bucha in the earliest days of its liberation in early April and was witness to the bodies that were strewn along the roads. And in one street in particular where dozens of bodies, some with their hands tied, they have been executed. So, my colleague Masha and I decided along with our colleagues in New York to set out to find who killed these people, these Ukrainian victims along one street. And through the course of our reporting, we heard from residents who lived along the street that their phones had been routinely confiscated. So when Russian soldiers trespassed and entered their homes and search for men of military age, they took their cellphones. So we asked ourselves could they have taken cellphones of victims? Can we identify who might have pulled the trigger or who might have been near that same crime using that sort of piece of evidence. So while interviewing families of those victims we asked for their relatives, their dead relatives cellphone numbers, and at the same time we obtained hundreds of thousands of phone records from Ukrainian authorities. And we did a very simple search function, which we took every single one of the 40 victims phone numbers, and we sort of -- we looked for them in the phone logs. And we found that along this one road of at least 41 victims six cellphones were used to dial Russia. Six cellphone numbers belonging to five Ukrainian victims were being used routinely throughout the month of March. So while we can't say that the soldiers who dialed -- you know, who dialed back home to Russia killed those victims, we can say that those soldiers were near the scene of the crime within hours of the killing of those victims.",

I mean, tell me about one of those conversations.AL-HLOU:  So, it's the multi-step process because the numbers dialed was a phone number. We identified using that phone number who the relative was, and by analyzing the social media accounts we figured out who the soldier was in that family. I don't speak Russian. My incredible colleague Masha does so together we prepared for the questions and Masha placed those phone calls. She spoke to dozens of family members of over two dozen soldiers, and in two instances spoke to the actual soldiers themselves. Those two soldiers confirmed their military unit, and they confirmed that they were in Bucha. One of those soldiers admitted that their command was to clear the road to Kyiv. And he admitted that it was a systemic and deliberate clearing operation, meaning that anyone in their way civilian, non-combatant was ground for killing.",

And I want to go now to Evelyn Farkas, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, now executive director of the McCain Institute. Evelyn, you know, when you listen Yousur lay this out, right, that they were -- it seems the Russians were systemically doing it, they admit to it, but would literally take the cellphones of people after they killed them of innocent civilians and use them to call home, and then bring them home -- bring them to their relative to get that cellphone. Just to imagine this, right? I know we've talked about it, but Yousur and her team actually showed this happened. EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFNESE FOR RUSSIA, UKRAINE, EURASIA, BALKANS &amp; CAUCUSUS:  It's amazing. It's so impressive how much evidence we can garner now using modern technology. There were some comparisons I saw on the internet, and I served in Bosnia after that war. All they had where photographs. They did not have what we have today, video and then phone records that you can trace back to people. But it is pretty horrific. I mean, the killing is against the Geneva conventions, and then taking the phone, that is looting. The fact that they can do that and sleep at night is pretty mind-boggling.",

So, if, indeed, he is not saying that is a war and he can mobilize any Russian men of military age or perhaps older, that would make a lot of Russians uncomfortable, and I think you will see more of them fleeing.You have already seen the opposition, of course, quite angry because there are many people in jail right now, including Vladimir Kara- Murza, who's one of the pall bearers for Senator McCain's funeral, a very well-known Russian activist dissident. People are in jail and serving real time for having called the war a war when it was illegal. It is still technically illegal. So, they're saying Vladimir Putin should also served seven years.",

And what we did is we composed a team of five independent medical experts, some of the top medical experts in the world, Nobel Peace Prize winners, Congressional Medal of Honor winners and a well-known toxicologist. And while I was in Georgia getting the tapes that we listened to earlier, my neurologist was there with me and we took samples, hair and nail samples from Saakashvili as well as a biopsy of some of his fat tissue in his stomach area. And we sent them back to a lab in the United States for testing. And those tests along with some of the blood testing results we received revealed heavy metals, arsenic, mercury, among others. So that is what told us that he was being poisoned. In addition to that he is undergoing what's called a poly pharmacy. He's on a regimen of at least 14 different drugs and most of which are non-FDA approved Russian drugs. One of them in particular is highly addictive. And to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, our toxicologists have indicated Saakashvili needs immediate detoxification. And you can see the images from court today and his rapid decline. And he's dying. And without U.S. assistance and EU assistance, he will die in prison a political prisoner.",

These images that you're looking at are in Nebraska right now.At this hour, blizzard warnings already in eight states as this once in a generation -- that's what they're telling us it is -- winter storm is sweeping across virtually the entire country. Life- threatening weather triggering states of emergencies already. Airlines already canceling more than 2,200 flights today, more than 6,500 delays, and it's going to be worse tomorrow, way worse. Erie County, New York, tonight is just an example expecting up to 3 feet of snow. Minnesota already has dangerous road conditions. Spokane, Washington, temperatures are at negative 27 degrees, which is nothing apparently compared to Montana. Florida is expecting its coldest Christmas since 1983, in nearly 40 years. I want to go straight to Derek Van Dam who is in the CNN weather center. Derek, it's pretty incredible to see something like this covering pretty much the entire country. Where the most dangerous conditions expected over these next 24 hours?",

We'll try to highlight just the snow at first.From the National Weather Service, an update from them, right across central Indiana and to southern Michigan. This is an area they've highlighted for the potential of snow squalls. That means visibility dropping below a quarter of a mile. Here is the arctic front. It just moved through Minneapolis, Cincinnati, you're next. Your temperatures will tumble in the coming hours. Interstate 80 moving east and west out of Chicago all the way into 96 across western Michigan. That is an area that is going to be hammered by heavy snowfall. So, this cold front marches eastward. The windy weather and the arctic air that settles in behind it, it is a one-two punch. It's got its eyes set on the east coast, but I think we're going to keep that all rain. Let's track this because the temperature drop here is absolutely phenomenal. Nashville, you're sitting at 48 degrees. You advance this less than six hours, just by midnight tonight you're going to drop over 30 degrees Fahrenheit and that's not the end of it. The cold front marches east, Atlanta, you're next, and then D.C. to New York, your temperatures tumble this weekend -- Erin.",

Workers at funeral homes and crematoriums reportedly working extra hours to deal with the surge in what they are calling COVID deaths.Now despite this, China formally reporting no new COVID deaths, none. Selina Wang is OUTFRONT in Beijing tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The burning can't go fast enough. The smoke behind me has been billowing constantly from all the bodies burning and these crates are all full of yellow body bags. Workers later opened the metal containers here at a major Beijing crematorium revealing rows of body bags as they load more coffins in the freezing cold temperatures. Crematoriums in major cities are swamped as COVID sweeps the country. But China has only reported a small handful of COVID deaths since reopening late last month. I spoke to a man earlier who said his close friend passed away from a fever. Normally, the hospital would hold the body but told him there are too many dead bodies. He said he has been waiting for hours and still has no idea if his friend's body can get cremated today. There is a long line of cars that snakes around the whole area waiting to get into the cremation area. I'm in the parking lot right now and it is completely full of cars. I am speaking here because there are many security guards patrolling the entire area. Grieving family members clutch photos of the deceased. Some tell us off camera they know their loved ones died from COVID and waited more than a day for cremation. Busy shops nearby sell items with paper money, clothes, houses, and animals used in burial traditions strewn on the side of the road. A woman who sells flowers says she is running out of stock. A man selling urns says business has jumped. Even the convenience store and crematorium grounds are getting busier. Normally you aren't so busy, right, I asked? The man nods and tells me normally there is nobody here. It is not just in Beijing. Social media video shows crowded crematoriums and funeral homes around the country. At this funeral home in Jinan, the man is saying, it's going insane. Here it is packed with cars. Vans carrying bodies stretch all the way to the distance in front of this crematorium. This is a COVID designated hospital in Beijing. There has been a steady stream of elderly patients in wheelchairs being let into this hospital. I spoke to a man waiting outside for his elderly family member who he said is very sick with a high fever from COVID but he said this hospital is running out of bed space. I asked the worker outside of this hospital, did a lot of people die here? Yes, every day, he responds. I asked, is it all because of COVID? Yes. People with underlying conditions, he says. China is now going through the painful reopening the rest of the world has already gone through, but it's not sharing the same data. The government now says it is narrowing the definition of COVID-19 deaths only to patients who died of respiratory failure directly caused by the virus. People we spoke to at the crematoriums may have said their loved ones died of COVID but their deaths and so many others won't be counted in the official tally. (END VIDEOTAPE) WANG (on camera):  And, Erin, it is no surprise that state media is ignoring the scenes we've shown in the story. But for much of the pandemic, Chinese state TV was showing America's overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums repeatedly. The message was look at China's low death toll in comparison, proof that China's system is superior. But even after reopening, China is still claiming the death toll is low, that less than ten people have died of COVID this month in total. So amid skepticism over the number, the government says it has changed the way it counts COVID deaths. Their method, it goes against the World Health Organization's guidelines and will severely underestimate the true death toll -- Erin.",
