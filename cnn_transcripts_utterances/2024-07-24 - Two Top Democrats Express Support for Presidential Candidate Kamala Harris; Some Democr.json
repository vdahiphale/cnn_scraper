That was certainly the message from many of those family members and representatives on Monday. Once again, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued words of confidence towards those family. He said that the government remains determined to ensure the safe return of all those hostages. That is the message that he has carried through throughout the war in Gaza. But of course, there has been that mounting pressure from not only family members, but also citizens in Israel, some of whom have accused the Israeli Prime Minister of trying to prolong the negotiations for his own political gain, not doing enough to bring an end to the war in Gaza. And of course, there has been that pressure externally as well from members of the international community, not least in the United States.And this is why his visit is at such an interesting point in time. There has been that growing tension, growing friction between the Israeli Prime Minister and the U.S. President Joe Biden. We've seen the Israeli Prime Minister publicly contradict U.S. statements, take a different route perhaps from the one of which President Biden, his administration would like to see the Israeli government go down when it comes to these ceasefire negotiations. But what we have been hearing in the last week is a tone of optimism, both from Israeli officials and U.S. officials. We heard from Biden on Monday saying that he believes that the parties involved in these negotiations are on the verge and coming to some sort of agreement. We know that a broad framework has been agreed to that the hammering out those finer details and technicalities. But of course, all eyes will be on Netanyahu as he makes his address to Congress, and particularly the response that he receives from both the Democrats and Republicans.

And that just caused made things even worse for her politically. Democrats and joining Republican calls for her to step aside and some Republicans even pushing for her impeachment. That was what Nancy Mace, a congresswoman from South Carolina, had offered a measure to actually force an impeachment vote on the floor of the United States House by Wednesday of this week. But she decided to step aside before that were to happen. It was clear that she her support was pretty much gone on Capitol Hill and within different aspects of the Biden administration as well. But I caught up with some Democrats and Republicans in the aftermath of that decision, including one congressman, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He told me that Cheatle gave him the wrong impression, apparently a misleading impression about why she wasn't able to provide him with more details. REP.
