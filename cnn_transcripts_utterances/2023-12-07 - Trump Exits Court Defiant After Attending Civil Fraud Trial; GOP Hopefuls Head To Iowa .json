Now, the former president is preparing to take the witness stand again. Why this time will be different.Also tonight, some of Trump's GOP rivals hit the campaign trail in Iowa and New Hampshire after their fourth debate without him got fiery. We're going to break down the lines of attack and Nikki Haley's response to being the top target. Plus, smoke in the air over Gaza and fierce fighting on the ground, Israeli forces intensifying their hunt for top leaders of Hamas two full months after the brutal attack on Israel that launched the war. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Will Blitzer is off today. I'm Pamela Brown and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. And we begin this hour with Donald Trump's return to his high-stakes New York civil fraud trial. The former president spending a full day in the courtroom as an accounting expert testified for the defense. Let's bring in CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, how is Trump's team making its case here?",

This case strikes at the heart of his identity as a businessman and threatens his ability to even do business in the state of New York.Now, the judge has already found him liable for fraud for inflating the values of his properties. Now, they're focused mostly on penalties and a few other charges. But Trump, he doesn't have to attend any of this. But when he does, it brings all this attention to whatever is happening in the courtroom. And today, an NYU professor, an accounting professor, testified in support of the defense. And he testified that people can come up with different values for the same properties and that banks were not relying on Trump's property valuations when they lent him money. So, this witness is really especially helpful for the defense. And this is going to be the last defense witness before Trump is expected to take the stand again on Monday.",

But something far more significant coming down the pipeline here in D.C. in March, he faces the first of two federal criminal trials. So, today, he appealed a decision by the judge overseeing that case who found that you're not immune from prosecution just because you were president on January 6.

Also, there's still the question you referenced, Pam, the gag order. There's still the risk of the former president going out and saying something that oversteps the bounds of what he's allowed to say. And he could get himself in trouble.
