      "sentences": "So, Boris, what we have learned is that there's a U.S. intelligence assessment compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.And described to my colleague, Natasha Bertrand, and I that says that 40 to 45 percent of the surface-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza since the start of this conflict have been unguided munitions, so-called gravity bombs or dumb bombs. Experts that we spoke to emphasized that dumb bombs are less precise and pose a greater danger to the civilian population on the ground than do precision-guided munitions. And particularly, in a place as densely populated as Gaza where the difference in life and death can be the matter of few feet, right? It's one of the reasons why the United States has phased out their own use of unguided munitions over the past decade. And so for some of the current and former U.S. officials that we spoke to, what they say is that Israel's heavy reliance on these unguided munitions really strains the credibility of they're saying that they are doing everything they can to protect civilian life on the ground. Now I should emphasize that there are ways to make unguided munitions more precise, in particular through sort of pairing them with a -- with a kind of tail fin with sort of a targeting tip or tail that you can put on them. But it's not clear at this point how many of these Israel has, is it using them, and what are the rules of engagement? What do they consider to be the acceptable level of potential civilian casualties for anyone strike.",

That's the biggest drop we have seen since February of 2020. That is encouraging news for renters. Not quite where we were pre-pandemic, but still a little bit more affordable. Also on mortgage rates, just this afternoon, we are seeing mortgage rates dipped below 7 percent for the first time since August. Also encouraging for first time home buyers. Just to note that this data we just got actually doesn't really include the decisions that the Fed made yesterday about pausing rate hikes in the new year but also potentially cutting rates in the new year.

They found that when they combine this approach with an existing immunotherapy drug called Keytruda that that reduced the risk of the cancer recurring or of death by 49 percent out of a three-year follow- up in this study.
