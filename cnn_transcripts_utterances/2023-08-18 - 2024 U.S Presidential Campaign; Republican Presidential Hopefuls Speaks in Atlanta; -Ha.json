It's just not clear as to why that was not done and why this trial proceeded given that huge gap and that huge issue related to the detective in this piece of evidence. SIDNER:  Yes, because the defendants certainly have every right to see every piece of evidence against them. And that didn't happen in this case which is why the judge made the decision he did. One of the attorneys for the FedEx driver says that the Justice Department needs to get in there and start investigating.
