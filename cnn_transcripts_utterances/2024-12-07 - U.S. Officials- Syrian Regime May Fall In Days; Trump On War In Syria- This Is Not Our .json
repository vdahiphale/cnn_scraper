I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we begin this hour with breaking news out of Syria.Just moments ago, rebels announcing they entered the city of Homs freeing over 3,500 inmates from a military prison. And as they march toward Damascus, it is not clear where President Bashar al-Assad actually is, with conflicting reports about whether he is in the capital. Syrian rebels are now saying senior Assad regime officials are preparing to defect to them in Damascus as they press on with their advance. For the latest in this, let's go to CNN's Nic Robertson who is joining us now from London. Nic, this is moving pretty quickly. How did this war reignite and how are these rebels able to move so quickly across Syria right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it really reignited because Russia and Iran and its proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hezbollah in Syria, who have been propping up Bashar al- Assad looked weak because Russia is fighting in Ukraine and Israel has dealt some deadly blows to Hezbollah and to Iranian interests inside of Syria. That opened the way for the rebels.How were they able to do it? Look, they've clearly gotten organized. They've clearly built their ranks. It appears that Julani, the leader of HTS, the main rebel group, the umbrella rebel group, has reached out to other rebel groups. They've worked together. It appears as if they've had significant training coming from -- you know, coming from military experts who are well equipped and well-knowledged in fighting and warfare and it has been effective. They've fought effectively. They've brought their forces to bear on all the different major cities from Aleppo to Hama to Homs. They say they now completely control, fully control Homs, not just liberating the prison, but taking control of it. And you can tell that they've been working methodically. They get to the outside, they go in. They don't claim that they've controlled the place. 24 hours later, they say they've controlled it. And this has gone on hour by hour through the day. And in fact, we woke up early today and the rebels' movement had sprung up, reemerged, if you will, reawakened itself in the south of the country. So by the end of where we are right now, at the end of the day in Syria, you have rebel elements on the very northern outskirts of Damascus, you have rebel elements on the southern outskirts of Damascus and sources tell me that there are recon elements of rebels inside of Damascus itself, and this is why they are able to say that they think Assad is no longer in his normal places in Damascus. They don't know where he has gone. They do believe that he has left, but is he elsewhere in Damascus? Is he somewhere else in the country? Or has he left the country completely? It isn't clear at the moment, but it is, as you say, an absolutely rapidly moving picture there.",

Also, we know that there are many people in the suburbs of Damascus who have risen up, have protested. You have rebel groups associated with the Druze and others forcing going north into Damascus.So it looks like it could be end of days for Bashar Assad and more importantly, the regime that he and his father held grip over the Syrian people for decades. And so, I think at this point, the fight of the Syrian Army will depend on what they believe the status of Bashar Assad is. Is he going to stay and fight like Volodymyr Zelenskyy did when the Russians invaded? Or is he going to flee like the president of Afghanistan did when the Taliban came? And if he flees, I think the Army collapses. Look, you already have reports of over a thousand Syrian Army personnel have fled to Iraq. We know that the Russians have redeployed elements of their Air Force back home. We know that the Iranians have redeployed their military personnel and diplomatic personnel back to Iran. So this looks like, it could be a major collapse happening in the next few days that will reshape the Middle East in extraordinary ways and for years to come.",

They will lose a warm water base at Tartus in the Eastern Mediterranean, and they will lose a strategic airfield just north of there, Latakia, and that will basically mean the end of that foothold they've had in the Middle East now for 10-plus years, that is significant.Number two, what you'll see is an Iranian retrenchment further going beyond what happened with -- in the wake of the attacks by Israel, so if Hezbollah was always the right fist of Iran's axis of resistance, the arm was Syria. It was the means by which Iran ferried people and munitions and weapons into the country, both by air and by land. And they will now presumably lose that conduit between Iran and Lebanon in terms of rearming Hezbollah. So that's good for not just the United States. That's, of course, good for Israel, so that's important there. So I think these factors are when you couple that with the decimation of Hezbollah, the decimation of Hamas, you see a very big, probably the most important impact being borne by the Iranians and then being further isolated in the region.",

Again, the ability to traverse munitions and weapons all the way through Iraq and Syria and into Lebanon. Keep in mind, that's why we have about 900 troops in Southeast Syria right now. They were there originally of course, as base to -- to help defeat the ISIS caliphate that rose up in the 2014 or so and eventually defeated by the United States, our Kurdish allies and others, but were also there to watch the Iranians, to keep tabs on them and understand what they are doing in the region particularly as it extends into Lebanon and how it might affect the Israelis. And I figure, at this point in time, the Israelis are watching very carefully about what happens, how it impacts not just Iran, but what it means for Lebanon, Hezbollah, and Lebanon and the future of the Lebanese state.",

It was important that he had that meeting with Zelenskyy, although they came out and the body language looked grim, it just -- there were no smiles, they looked a little awkward. But needless to say, Zelenskyy and Macron and all the Europeans are very concerned about the decisions that Donald Trump will make when he comes into office on January 20th with regard, first and foremost to Ukraine, will the United States continue to support Ukraine with weapons and munitions? Will they push for or will they negotiate a ceasefire that does not benefit Zelenskyy at all?

You had, you know, all of the flags out there, all of the cameras. They had that warm, they shared that warm hug and handshake. It was kind of reminiscent of when they would meet in Donald Trump's first term and everyone had described it as somewhat of a bromance, their relationship before things kind of became tense throughout the years.But, look, this was the type of welcome that Donald Trump wanted, and it's what I've been hearing from my conversations with those working on the transition and those working on Trump's team since then. That this is, you know, what Donald Trump wanted for his return to the world stage. I think one key question, though, of course, is what is his relationship with many of these leaders going to look like moving forward? As you mentioned, he is still President-elect. He is not the president. He has another month or so until he is sworn in to office. But, really, this was kind of a taste of what maybe we will begin to see over the next four years. And I remind you as well that Donald Trump loves to meet face-to-face with world leaders. He actually doesn't love traveling on foreign trips. At least that was the case, I remember, when I covered his first White House, his first term in that administration. But he does like to meet in person. He likes to, you know, play off each other. He likes to have negotiations in person. He often says he goes with his gut. I think that's a lot of kind of what we saw with these different meetings today. But one key question, of course, that I know a lot of people are asking is what is his foreign policy going to look like moving forward. And I think that was, of course, a key conversation that came up in his meetings with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Macron, especially as it relates to what he's going to do about U.S. aid to Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. But also, you know, any ideas for his promises, what he made repeatedly throughout his time on the campaign trail, to end that war very swiftly. We haven't really heard much from Donald Trump about what that would look like, how he could do that, so curious to see whether or not that came up today. I am told that we're going to get some sort of broader readout from that meeting between him, Macron and Zelenskyy. So I'm going to - you know, I think a lot of eyes will be on what exactly he revealed during that. But again, he's still President- elect, so only so much he can say and promise at this point.",

On the other hand, we do know that the shooter was found dead at the scene at this - from an apparent gunshot wound. And the FBI is now investigating. Authority is trying to figure out why he specifically targeted this Christian school. They're trying to piece together exactly what happened. We were also told that as they investigated, they found that the shooter was homeless, was a convicted felon, had a long criminal history and also had records of mental health illnesses. We also know that the shooter went to the school saying that he wanted to enroll a family member in that school. Authorities later saying that they believe that that was a lie and really just a way to gain access to the school. He began shooting as the children were on their noon break. They were coming back into the classrooms, and that's when he began shooting. Unfortunately, authorities got there just two minutes, which is actually a good thing, but unfortunately these two children were already shot and in critical condition. Authorities, of course, immediately tried to help these two boys and got all of the other students into buses and brought them to a nearby church to be reunited with those parents. That was, of course, very traumatic for all of these people. Unfortunately, Jess, this is not uncommon. It is now about 78 school shootings this year in the U.S., and this is just another one.",
