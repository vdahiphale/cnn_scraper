And we are -- the Burchetts are praying people. And so, I asked God to show me what -- the right thing to do. And I'm not proselytizing to you, I'm not trying to save your soul, but that's the path I go down on a lot of bills. I pray for my wife. I pray for my daughter. I pray for my enemies. I pray for the speaker. I pray for this president, you know? And when things come up, I pray for his son. And as a Christian, that's what I'm supposed to do. But when someone mocks me like that and mocks my religion and honestly, the Bible is pretty clear about God being mocked. So that's what sealed it right there for me.

Just going back to what you were saying about Kevin McCarthy, Manu rightly has been trying to get McCarthy and people around McCarthy to answer the question whether or not after this he is going to go back. There will be a speaker's vote, and he could try to get nominated again and just kind of roll the dice since he did it 15 times before.

This isn't when someone who stepped back from the speakership and didn't seek reelection. We have seen people leave under sort of pitiful circumstances.

Republican members just angry, hearing Republicans who support Kevin McCarthy, attacking what they're calling so called conservatives who have went after and took McCarthy out of the speakership. Then you're hearing one McCarthy detractor after another, criticizing the speaker, including Congresswoman Nancy Mace, one of the members who did vote to oust him, saying that McCarthy broke his promise to her about dealing with issues involving women's rights, and she was furious on the steps of the Capitol. But we do expect in sometime around 06:30 p.m. Eastern Time, House Republicans will gather behind closed doors to discuss their way forward. We'll see what ultimately comes out of that closed door meeting. That is -- we have reporting from our colleagues Melanie Zanona and Haley Talbot. They are hearing that this meeting will happen tonight. And that was -- could be a significant moment as well, because the question remains, what will Kevin McCarthy do? Will he decide to run for speaker? He has not said. He refused to answer questions when he walked off of the House floor. He walked back into the speaker's office, and he is still huddling with his advisors at this moment. There is a groundswell of support among McCarthy's allies for him to run again. And talking to a number of them, they will say they are sticking with him no matter how long he wants to go. But the onus is on him to decide how to proceed. If he does decide to go forward, it's clear he does not have a majority of the House to elect him as speaker. The Democrats will vote for Hakeem Jeffries. The McCarthy detractors will vote for somebody else, and nobody will get a majority. But if McCarthy steps aside, who is that consensus pick? That is not decide -- that is -- there's no unanimity on that as well. There's sharp division about who will lead their conference. So these are some of the key questions that they will be grappling with behind closed doors tonight. And Jake, the question also is, when will the next speaker's race be? We're told unlikely tonight. We'll see if it happened as soon as tomorrow. But that is a very significant decision here because the House cannot do anything until there is a speaker who is elected here.

Congresswoman, I appreciate you not bringing what I expect was a big tub of popcorn that you were holding earlier today. The Democratic Party united in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy. But I have to say the institution of the House of Representatives does suffer, does it not?REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA), JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Well, you know, Jake, we had extensive conversations within the Democratic Caucus on this, and I think we really thought through this very carefully. I don't think any one of us actually takes any joy in this. I had this very strange feeling sitting on the House floor. I didn't feel like cheering. I didn't want to clap. I don't think any of us did, because the reality is that we need a Congress that runs efficiently, but we cannot be responsible for a governing party that cannot govern. And this Republican Party has been unable to govern for a long time, and really in the nine months that they've been in office. And it has constantly been chaos and driving us to the brink of despair and shutdown and, you know, threats about all kinds of things, not to mention the polarization, the division, the racism, all of the things that this extreme Republican Party stands for. So we don't take any pleasure in this. But let's be clear about something. The Republicans have the majority in the House. It is their job to pick a speaker. They cannot come to us and say, you pick a speaker. That's not our responsibility. If we're picking a speaker, we have our speaker. It's Leader Hakeem Jeffries, soon to be Speaker Hakeem Jeffries when we take back the majority. But as long as Republicans have the majority, they have the responsibility to pick a speaker. They have the responsibility to govern. And if they can't govern, then turn it over to us. And we Democrats will govern in the same way that we governed for the last two years when we had the majority with a very slim margin under Speaker of America, now speaker then Pelosi, we were able to get a tremendous amount done for the American people. Let's just be clear, it's their responsibility. TAPPER: A 100 percent. The majority party is in charge of picking their own speaker. No disagreement at all. But they're having a problem. They have somewhere between five to eight members who are not going to pick Kevin McCarthy and I don't know, I assume they're going to be able to pick somebody. But hypothetically, if they came to you and said if a majority of them said, look, I know you don't agree with let me just pick. Tom Cole or Tom Emmer, somebody for whom I assume you disagree with all of his politics, but maybe you at least think he is a respectable person on the other side of the aisle. If we made some concessions in terms of power sharing, would 10 or 20 Democrats be willing to support this just so we can function as a House of Representatives? Maybe not you as a member -- as the chair of the House Progressive Caucus but is that a reasonable turn of events do you think?",

I mean, the House and the Congress has not actually been doing their jobs, passing budgets, so on and so forth. Here's the problem. The problem is that he only wants a budget that meets his needs. And that is not how Congress works. It's a bipartisan system right now.The Senate is run by the Democrats. The House is run by Republicans. And there has to be a scenario in which some speaker can come to an agreement that is fundamentally bipartisan. He will never be on board with that. That is why all of the talk about process is only one part of the picture fundamentally underneath the process are demands that are on the far right of even the Republican Party and really are going nowhere in this Congress.",

It's so much more important to people like Matt Gaetz and Donald Trump to weed out the disloyals in the Republican Party than it is to actually pick fights on policy with Democrats.",

And that came after Donald Trump had issued a post this morning linking the judge's clerk to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer without any evidence in that post. And he also emailed that post out to a lot of his big distribution lists.And the judge saying that he was imposing a gag order on all parties, saying that none of them could make any public statements about any of his staff. And he said that if they violate this order, there would be serious sanctions, and that could include anything from financial penalties to even potentially jail. So, you know, the judge drawing a fine line here, trying to cut down on some of the rhetoric that Trump has made, particularly targeting his clerk, who is a constant presence beside him, who is very active with the judge. But he didn't extend that to the judge or to the other parties. And Trump today was out making statements against Attorney General Letitia James, who's brought this case. He made comments about her walking into the courthouse, continuing the refrain that this is a witch hunt and criticizing this investigation and this litigation. Anderson?",
