      "sentences": "Yes, very close to us, Jim. We saw multiple rocket interceptions by the Iron Dome system and that system has been working overtime across Northern Israel as we have been seeing rockets coming in from Hezbollah on the ground, further south than they typically do, near Haifa, a major population center where there is also a major Israeli airbase, the Ramat David Airbase.And then, all across here, a little bit further north in the Galilee, we have also been hearing a number of rocket sirens. This as the Israeli military is conducting the most intense bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon since the beginning of this conflict. And it is also the deadliest day, we should add for Lebanon since October 8th, when Hezbollah began firing rockets into Northern Israel and Israel began responding in turn with airstrikes throughout Lebanon. More than -- at least 182 people are dead, more than 700 people are injured in Lebanon as of now, but that death toll is very likely to continue to rise. And that's because the Israeli military has just begun expanding that air campaign from Southern Lebanon, where they were striking earlier today to the eastern part of Lebanon, known as the Beqaa Valley, where Hezbollah is believed to have brought in many of its munitions and weaponry of via Syria from Iran originally. Earlier today, the Israeli military ordering -- or urging, we should say, civilians in Lebanon in that area of the Beqaa Valley. to begin evacuating from their homes, in particular, according to the Israeli military spokesman, if they know that there are weapons in their homes or near their homes. In many cases, though, civilians in these neighborhoods may not be aware of Hezbollah weapon stashes in those areas, and certainly just giving a couple hours' notice for civilians to evacuate may at times be impractical and difficult for those warnings to be heeded, as we have seen so many times before in the Gaza Strip. What is clear is that the Israeli government has made a decision now to continue driving up this ladder of escalation to attack Hezbollah targets no longer in the kind of tit for tat that we have been seeing for much of the last year, but rather trying to deal a very decisive blow to Hezbollah in an effort to effectively cow Hezbollah into submission to stop firing rockets into Northern Israel. So, far, at least, it is only resulting in Hezbollah escalating its rockets -- rocket attacks on Northern Israel. So, we will see where this is going. But we are heading towards a very dangerous place at this hour, Jim.",

He chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He also serves as a U.S. representative to this year's U.N. General Assembly.Senator, I have a suspicion that it's going to be busy for you in New York this week. What's your reaction to what we're seeing in Lebanon this morning? SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD), U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO THE U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND FOREIGN RELATIONS CHAIRMAN:  Well, Jim, first, it's good to be with you. We recognize that Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. They have sent missiles into Israel targeting civilian populations. Hezbollah, like Hamas, are enabled by Iran. Our objective in trying to de-escalate the conflict is to move forward with an opportunity for a ceasefire and return of the hostages from Gaza and then to have the regional security arrangements so that the Palestinians and Israelis can live together in peace. So, it starts with trying to get this off ramp in Gaza, but we recognize Israel has a right to defend itself.",
