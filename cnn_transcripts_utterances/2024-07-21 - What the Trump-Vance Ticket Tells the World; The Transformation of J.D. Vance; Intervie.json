Bush said, America is not just another country on the roster from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. It is something special.And that is something that American politicians have always insisted upon and that has given meaning to this otherwise ungovernable and hugely disparate country. But that is a thing that he took time to attack when he could have been talking about, for example, he's got some vulnerabilities on his extreme views on abortion. He could have talked a little bit about his attitudes toward women and found ways to make those more inclusive, found ways to tell the kind of story of his own life and related in a way the way that Sarah Palin so effectively did in 2008. If you compare this speech that he gave to Sarah Palin's it's remarkable how much less good it was and it was less good because he would not relinquish his odd ideas in favor of a more general appeal. This is very much about his personal sense of mission. You don't get to the vice presidency and beyond without that sense of mission. But the question we all have to ask is, what is in it for the rest of the country?

And it seems that the Zionist failure and defeat persuade them to expand tensions to other regions.

So, the first thing I had to do was really understand what -- what's the nature of the problem? Who and where are people most at risk?And so, we looked at emergency department visits -- heat-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations by zip code in the county and we found a very big disparity. Some zip codes with four times the rates of heat-related illnesses than others. And the top correlating factors was low income, high percentage of outdoor workers, and urban heat islands, high land surface temperatures. In other words, areas with low tree canopy, a lot of pavement, a lot of waste heat from buildings and cars. These neighborhoods can be 10 degrees hotter than other neighborhoods in our county. And -- so, this is where people are most at risk. And that has really helped me in responding. People are having a hard time staying cool at home. Either they don't have adequate cooling or they can't afford it anymore. They may be exposed at work. We have over 300,000 workers that work outside every day in the county.",
