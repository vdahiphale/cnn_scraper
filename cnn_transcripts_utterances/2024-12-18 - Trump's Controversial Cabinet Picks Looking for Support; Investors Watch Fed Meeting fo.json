If you're just joining us here are some top stories today.The suspect in the ambush killing of United Healthcare's CEO is now indicted for murder. Luigi Mangione facing 11 charges, including murder as an act of terrorism. Mangione is accused of gunning down Brian Thompson outside a New York hotel two weeks ago. Later today, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will become the latest tech titan to meet with Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The CEOs of Apple, Meta and TikTok have already visited the president-elect in Florida. Blue Origin, the space company owned by Bezos, is a space race -- in a space race against Elon Musk's SpaceX. And Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan are discussing a potential merger. The automakers say they are exploring various possibilities for collaboration and leveraging each other's strengths. They didn't offer any detail on the timing of any possible deal. U.S. lawmakers have unveiled a stopgap spending bill that would keep the government running through to mid-March, but it's not clear if it can make it through Congress. Conservatives are frustrated with House Speaker Mike Johnson for negotiating with Democrats. The bill includes nearly $100 billion in disaster relief and another $10 billion in economic assistance for farmers. Many Republicans are irate over the number of provisions tacked onto a bill that was intended only to extend current funding levels and prevent a shutdown. Several of Donald Trump's controversial Cabinet picks have been lobbying Senators on Capitol Hill trying to pick up support ahead of next month's confirmation hearings. Much of the focus right now is on Health and Human Services Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who's been making the rounds with lawmakers. CNN's Manu Raju has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., making the rounds on Capitol Hill for a second day, meeting with Republican senators and trying to get them in line. One of the big things he has been trying to do is try to reassure some who are concerned about his views on vaccines. He has, according to Republican senators, not reiterated what he has said before, to repeat that debunked theory that vaccine use leads to childhood autism. There's been signs, of course, just not making that case. He has said that before. But in his meetings, he has said that he is concerned about rising rates of autism, says he wants to get to the bottom of that. And he's also indicated he wants to have a top-to-bottom review of vaccines altogether. Now, in a good sign for him, he had the Senate Republican leader -- incoming Senate Republican leader John Thune told our colleague Ted Barrett that, indeed, he could support him for the job. At least he suggested that he could, because he said he viewed his answers about vaccines in a very positive light. And also, he has reassured Republican senators who have concerns about his pro-abortion rights views, saying instead that he would 100 percent support Donald Trump's position on abortion, if confirmed, as the health and human services secretary. Now, I caught up with another key senator, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who actually met with Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence. Gabbard has been controversial in her own right. In 2017, she met with then Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad for a very controversial trip. She also has espoused views that have been critical of Ukraine, as Collins and others have pushed for more U.S. support for Ukraine. I asked her about both her meeting with Gabbard and also whether she could vote for Gabbard or RFK Jr. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): We talked about Syria, her visit to see Assad. We talked about Ukraine. We talked about Putin. We talked about NATO. We talked about her positions on introducing legislation that would have removed the criminal charges for Snowden. And so, it was a very broad and wide-ranging discussion.",

And at the moment, no Republican senator is coming outward and saying they're publicly opposed to any of these nominees, all keeping their door open, even if they may have some concerns about their positions, which is why the Trump team is confident that they can get most, if not all, these nominees confirmed early in the new year.Manu Raju, CNN, Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percent in their final meeting of the year, making it a nice round one percentage point of cuts to borrowing costs for the year. But then comes the tougher part, which involves communicating some kind of plan for 2025. And that includes what's widely expected to be a pause in the cutting cycle in January.Why? Well, it's a few things. And actually, a lot of it's good news, including solid growth, tracking up more than 3 percent annualized. We can then add in a stronger than expected labor market, plus a U.S. consumer that's actually increased spending into the holiday season. Then there's rising prices that actually have cooled a lot, but not enough. And then comes the bad news. Plenty of geopolitical risk, whether that's the Middle East, Ukraine or the potential impact of tariff policy from President-elect Donald Trump. Now, the decision to pause rate cuts, though, would be far more, I think, about the relative economic strength, at least in my mind, than future policy decisions like tariffs that may not, in fact, materialize. So first comes their updated economic projections and the so-called dot plot of where they think cuts in rates can come next year. Now, if you remember back in September, they were thinking four rate cuts next year. That could very likely be reduced to just three cuts based on what they see today. Though, let's be clear, as we've seen this year, nothing is set in stone. And Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be keen to emphasize a degree of flexibility when he speaks on Wednesday. And that leaves the Fed with a core message that they've cut rates a full percentage point, that the economy is doing pretty well, and that they do remain data dependent and that they can't react to things like tariffs until they get them. And then they'll see how things progress between now and the January meeting. Julia Chatterley, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In a forthcoming autobiography, parts of which were released on Tuesday, the Pope said he was told of a female suicide bomber who planned to blow herself up in Mosul, whilst a van travelling at high speed had the same intent. Both these assassination attempts were foiled, the Pope said, by the U.K. intelligence services and by the Iraqi police.Now, of course, Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, was under the control of Islamic State from 2014 to 2017. In his autobiography, the Pope says he was advised strongly against visiting Iraq due to the security risk and the COVID-19 pandemic. But the Pope said he was determined to make the trip to a country that is rich in biblical history and, of course, is home to one of the world's oldest Christian communities that has faced extensive persecution in recent years. Whilst in Iraq, the Pope was also able to have an historic meeting with the Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, the leading Shia authority in Islam. The news of the assassination attempts against the Pope came as Francis marked his 88th birthday, making him one of the oldest Popes in the Church's history. However, the Pope shows no sign of slowing down and he's a busy schedule ahead of services during the Christmas period. Christopher Lamb, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
