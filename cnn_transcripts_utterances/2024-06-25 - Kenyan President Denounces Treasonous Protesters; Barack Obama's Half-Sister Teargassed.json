And Airbus shares falling as production delays are rippling across the entire air industry. Tonight, we are still live in London. It is Tuesday, June the 25th. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. We start tonight with Kenya's president. He is decrying what he is calling treasonous events in Nairobi as demonstrations in the Kenyan capital turned violent. Rights groups say five people were killed and dozens were injured as the police clashed with the demonstrators. The protesters stormed the country's parliament and Nairobi's city hall, it was set blaze. The demonstrators began in response to proposed tax hikes.

The Commission says that Microsoft has tied Teams, which -- you're all familiar with them, I mean, Good Lord, we live our life with it in some shape or form. Teams, the workplace collaboration with its other products giving it an unfair advantage. Brad Smith is Microsoft's president as Teams has already been unbundled. Now, yesterday, the EU accused Apple of breaching its Digital Services Act. It is threatening to fine both companies 10 percent of their global revenue, for Microsoft, that's a small fortune, $20 billion. Clare is with me. Clare, all right.

This is really similar to what we heard from Apple yesterday as well, saying that it has already made changes to be in compliance with the DMA. And so I think it will be interesting to see whether the EU decides to buy that, whether these investigations began months ago, maybe these companies have made changes since then. Does the EU agree to let them operate that way or does it say you need to make further changes? The other thing that I think is really interesting, Richard, looking out into the future about this is I think we may start to see more sort of fracturing of tech services by country. We are already starting to see this. Apple has said it doesn't plan to roll out its AI services in the EU because it feels like they are going to be not in compliance with the DMA, but I think more and more, we may start to see these tech companies have one set of services in the EU because they want to be in compliance with the DMA and have different sets of services in the US and elsewhere, which could mean frustrated consumers in some areas.

The market had expected an easing of pressures. The Bank of Canada was the first to lower rates amongst the G7. The ECB has similarly done it now. The BOE, meanwhile, Bank of England, held its benchmark rate at a 16-year high. Now, Monzo has taken advantage of the higher rates by expanding its business, particularly its lending business, and a success so far, with the digital lender reporting its first full-year profit. Revenue more than doubled to 500 million. It's about $650 million. Monzo says it was recently valued at more than $5 billion. The expanded lending has come at a predictable cost, setting aside more than $250 million for loan defaults. TS Anil is the CEO of Monzo. Good to see you, sir.",
