Under oath in minutes, a former president, a current presidential candidate, a current defendant in at least four other cases. Among the open questions, will he take the Fifth. Will he attack the judge or intentionally create a spectacle? Will he implicate his children? Or will he slip in a way that might hurt him in any one of his criminal cases. Not just high stakes, high unprecedented stakes.",

      "sentences": "Great point, John.Trump is expected to be leaving Trump Tower any minute now for what has become an oddly familiar drive to the Manhattan courthouse where once inside he could speak to cameras set up in the hallway. He's done it many times before. But today is different. He'll then head into the courtroom where cameras are not allowed, have not been allowed since the start of this. Once in court, some very wild dynamics comes into play, including while testifying Trump is going to be sitting right next to a judge that he publicly called a wacko, unhinged and also Trump hating. Talk about weird dynamics there. This also marks the first time that Trump himself is facing extensive courtroom questioning since he left the White House. Even before opening arguments some, you know, month and plus ago. This judge already found that Donald Trump is liable for persistent and repeated fraud. And since then has fined Trump two times for violating a limited gag order. We have team coverage as this is going to be playing out all across the next few hours. Let's start with Kaitlan Collins -- CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins, who is outside the courthouse. Kaitlan, what are you learning about how Trump's been preparing for this and what his mindset is going into today? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR: I mean, this is a major moment for Trump, Kate. He has been angrier about this than almost anything else that -- any of his other legal cases that have been surrounding him because this is deeply personal to him. It goes to the heart of what he has built his entire career upon, his real estate empire. And while we already kind of know the outcome of this, given this judge has already found him liable here. The question is how expensive this is going to be and just how much of a threat to that empire this truly poses to him. And that is why he has been so angry about this. That's why he's shown up several days to this courthouse behind us to sit inside as he's watched other witnesses be called to the stand. At times where he has complained openly about how that questioning has gone. He's whispered things to his attorneys who then stand up and object to that. You've heard him speak about it in the hallways. Now it's going to be a very different dynamic for him today because he himself is going to be the one under oath on the witness stand. And I think that is a moment that shows just how much he cares about this, the fact that his children have been going to testify and really just the first time we've seen him testify himself in open court in over a decade. It's something he certainly has done before, but never in a moment like this one. And so he has been preparing for it. Really just the logistics of what this is going to look like. And, you know, he's got three attorneys that will be inside that court with him today. But really Trump has been running this. He has been directing his attorneys what to do here. And so that's the question of what he says when he's actually under oath compared to what you've been hearing him say out in the hallway every day.",

I spent a lot of time talking to them about how exactly this was going to work. And essentially what it looks like is guesswork. You have the lawyers estimating when exactly these trials are going to be. They do believe that a lot of this is going to shift, that some of these days might change, but they have to build an entire campaign apparatus and schedule around those trial dates, when they expect Trump to be in court. And this is really just the kickoff of these enormous amount of trialsthat he is expected to face for the election in 2024. And they do believe that they have put an infrastructure in place on the ground in several of these early states so that if Trump is having to be tied up in court, that they can actually still run a campaign without him on the ground.. But that is a very difficult thing to do. So, again, this is a massive undertaking. One of the things that we really noticed when we were talking to these campaign advisers, to these allies of Donald Trump's is just how intermingled all of this was. We had a -- campaign advisers who are working directly with lawyers, campaign spokespeople who were getting messaging from the lawyers. The fact that fundraising appeals go between being attacks on these various cases to attacks on Ron DeSantis. There is no two lanes anymore. We are completely in a lane where the politics and the legal has combined and now his team is going to have to navigate that as we get closer to the election.",

Donald Trump just left Trump Tower behind Kristen Holmes there. So, the players are starting to move around right now.Kristen, I want to go back to you with one question here because many legal analysts are suggesting that part of Trump's plan today may be to blow things up, to go in there and literally blow the trial up with, you know, histrionics and testimony like that. Have you picked up anything, any talk among the lawyers or I imagine campaign staff that he plans to make a show of this on the stand today?",

They really just went through the logistics. There wasn't any kind of talk about there being, you know, histrionics. However, we do expect him to go to those cameras outside of the courtroom. He is going to want to take every opportunity that he possibly can to spin this narrative into what he wants it to be.John, we have talked about this a number of times. Donald Trump does not want to play these cases out in the court of law. He wants to play these cases out in the court of public opinion. So what happens in those courtrooms, when he comes out he is going to say whatever it is that he wants and whatever narrative he wants to tell. And that's why he's going to likely go to those cameras. And I am told by a number of sources that are close to the former president who say he's actually acting confident going into this hear - this trial about this testimony. But, again, a lot of this is going to be what he does on the outside of that courtroom. Now, a really important thing, and I know Kara mentioned this, is that anything that he says in that testimony under oath can be used against him in other trials. And one thing that we have been watching is just the fact that there have been some concerns recently over verbal slip- ups that Donald Trump has had on the campaign trail. Is that something that could happen when he's under oath today, when he's making his testimony. That could cause problems for him in the future. But, again, in terms of have I heard that he's going to have -- make a scene, try to take command of the stage when he's actually in the courtroom, no, I have not. But I have heard that there is a likelihood he's going to try to command the area outside of the courtroom to tell his own narrative.",

Also with us, former Manhattan prosecutor, Jeremy Saland. And, gentlemen, I mentioned what I was talking to our reporters before, that there has been some speculation that when Trump, when he gets on the stand in a few minutes,  he will go in there and try to blow things up. And by that I mean just derail the trial, go after the judge, go after the clerk. The reason being -- and this is a quote from Alan Dershowitz in a \"Rolling Stone\" article, Dersh says, quote, \"when a defendant honestly believes he can't possibly get a fair trial from the judge, one of the tactics is to antagonize the judge\" - I think we have a graphic of this - \"to the point of causing reversible errors.\" In other words, go after the judge, taunt the judge, draw the judge into doing something that will hurt the case going forward. JEREMY SALAND, FORMER MANHATTAN PROSECUTOR: You normally would never say poke the bear of the judge, that the ramifications could be quite serious. But when you're looking in this situation, it's a potentially - potentially a double win for Donald Trump. And what I mean by that is you have his court of public opinion, which we know that's where he's going with regularity. It's a campaign fundraising opportunity and galvanize the masses. But when you already have, to a certain and large extent lost because there's already been a ruling by the judge as to this fraud, then this is the opportunity to say, I'm going to push that judge to a point where he or she, in this case Judge Engoron may do something inappropriate that results in an error - a reversal error.

The generic Democrat beats Donald Trump by 8 points. By 8 points.
