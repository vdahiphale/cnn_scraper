The U.S. state of California rocked by more mass shootings just days after a massacre in the city of Monterey Park. A pair of new shootings claimed the lives of at least seven people on Monday in the coastal city of Half Moon Bay.Authorities say the shooter opened fire in two different locations, one of which is a mushroom farm. The farm's owners say the event has left them shaken and they don't know the suspected shooter. Police took 67-year-old Chunli Zhao into custody and they say they found a handgun in his vehicle close by. The local sheriff addressed the impact of the violence on the small farming community.
