And that's the big question here, did this flight fly through some severe turbulence because of a thunderstorm? Was it because of something else? Was it because of the wake of another airplane or was it because of a mountain wave kind of scenario where there is wind hitting the side of the mountain and then pushes the plane up and down. You can even see in some of that flight aware track that the speed was really erratic, too. So, the crew and the passengers went through a really, really big incident here.

In fact, they had indicated to us that no approach had been made from the Ukrainians to broadcast the President Zelenskyy message before the final, which, of course, took place yesterday in Qatar. But there's that video. The Ukrainians have come out and they're adamant that they have been approaching the FIFA through various different channels. They prerecorded a video address, which you saw a clip of there, from President Zelenskyy and it was just a generic sort of message of peace as the Ukrainians called it. And they've been very critical and are very angry about the fact that FIFA refused to broadcast this message ahead of the World Cup final.What the Ukrainians say is that they were told by FIFA that it was just too political. That this is a sporting event and that politics should not have come into it. The Ukrainians reject that saying it was nothing political necessarily about the message at all. But, you know, even though the game itself went off very well and it was very exciting. I don't know whether either of you got a chance to watch it, it has left sort of bitter taste in the mouths of the presidential office in Ukraine. And, of course, it's yet another thing that has sort of darkened the whole reputation of FIFA and the World Cup in general over this period.

Now it is just a relatively small number of counties are seeing that red, that high level of Covid numbers. But, still, there are some pretty big population centers. So, one in ten people in the U.S. live in a place with high Covid numbers.Despite that, the booster is not going so well. When you take a look at uptake numbers, when you look at 65 and over, it's only 35 percent. That's tiny compared to elders who got the original vaccine. And as you can see, the numbers just go down, down, down, as you get younger. So people just aren't really hearing this.
