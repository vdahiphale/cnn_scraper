      "sentences": "And I'm Jake Tapper. The presentation we're about to see is the culmination of nearly a year and a half of exhaustive work by the bipartisan House select committee. The panel is expected to announce that it will refer at least three criminal charges against Donald Trump for the Justice Department, stemming from Trump's actions on and around January 6 and his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.A source familiar with the matter tells CNN, those charges include insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding for efforts to impede the certification of the 2020 presidential results, and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government. In addition to criminal referrals against Trump, the panel may recommend charges against some of his closest allies. CNN has learned that the committee has been weighing criminal referrals for former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, elections Attorney John Eastman, and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark. The committee also plans to reveal its decision on how to hold Republican lawmakers' members of the House accountable for defying the panels subpoenas, congressional, subpoenas, including the House GOP leader and would be Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The committee says the justification for these dramatic and historic steps will be spelled out in the pages of its final report. Panel members were told we'll approve that report today and release an executive summary with top line findings from their extensive investigation. The committee's full report on the January 6 attack will be available to the public on Wednesday. Now all nine members of the committee are expected to have a role in today's final public meeting before the panel expires at the end of 2022. The select committee is effectively handing off to the Justice Department where special counsel Jack Smith is conducting his own January 6 investigation. He and federal prosecutors have been tasked with the final decisions on whether Trump and or any of his allies will face criminal charges. Let's go right to CNN's Sara Murray who's been covering the January 6 investigation on multiple fronts since day one. Sara, what is the primary goal of the House select committee today?",

They want to drive home their belief that Donald Trump was the one who was culpable responsible for January 6. And they want to lay out the body of evidence that is the basis for at least three charges that they plan to refer to the Justice Department crimes, they believe the former president committed.Now obviously, the committee is primarily focused on the Department of Justice, but they do believe that they have uncovered evidence that could be relevant for other potential referrals either to state bars, or perhaps to the House ethics committee when it comes to the Republican lawmakers who snubbed those subpoenas. We're also learning that congressional investigators have already shared what they believe to be evidence of crimes committed to a district attorney in the Atlanta area who's investigating Donald Trump and his allies.",

We expect this Republican report to be issued later this week to talk about Nancy Pelosi, though she is not directly responsible for day-to-day security measures within the Capitol It is expected to discuss her and other issues.Now at the same time, there is legislation that could become the first piece of legislation to go into law in the aftermath of January 6. There is an agreement to overhaul a statute that governs how Congress counts the votes when it certifies state certified electoral results. That is the Electoral Count Act, that revision to that law has been - is going to be included in a bill that will be - that must be passed by the end of the week to keep the government open. [12:05:00] In addition, what that includes, Jake, is that it would have ensured that the vice president would have a ceremonial role, cannot simply disregard the state certified electoral results.

I think we're going to see rather extensive details. And just I think it's important to remember what the committee's mission is with the Department of Justice. As we've been saying, this is symbolic in a certain way that they're sending this over. They do not have the power to indict, to prosecute, to convict.

What it is saying today, essentially what these criminal referrals you've been reporting on from your sources, Jamie, is that they don't believe that President Trump should ever hold office again. As we know, he is running for office right now.And one of the charges that the committee is likely to refer to Congress is insurrection. And if you look at that statute, it says that person if they were engaged in an insurrection should be banned from holding any office again. So, it is historic, it is unprecedented. I'm going to be looking at that. And also, what the committee is going to do about their fellow members of Congress who did not respond to the subpoenas. And I think that's going to be really interesting to see what did they do? Do they treat them differently from others that they referred to DOJ? Do they handle it within the, you know, the family if you will, refer to an ethics committee? That's another point today that's going to be interesting.",

This is, of course, in far more significant that it's an entire committee, and it's about a particularly serious matter, but it has no legal weight.The referral itself is simply a direction to look into these activities.

When you look at, look, the interview they did with Pat Cipollone, the former White House Counsel. Cassidy Hutchinson, their star witnesses, they were able to get to an interview before they interviewed with DOJ.And also, I think it's important to note that the committee has said that there was perjury committed that means people lying to Congress, a witness lying to Congress, witness tampering. Only they really have that evidence, right? So, I think that is important too to share with DOJ. And I can tell you, well, DOJ might not like the political optics of this, congressional committee sending a referral to them. They are going to be poring over this evidence to see exactly what is in there to help supplement what they've already had, and also perhaps build new charges like on the perjury funds. [12:10:00] TAPPER: And Audie, I mean we shouldn't discount the fact that this is huge. If you take the 30,000-foot view of it, there is a former president who remains very popular. Maybe he's losing popularity, but he's still very popular with Republicans in this country, with his MAGA bass. Several \"news channels\" still remain in his thrall.

And so, what the, you know, certainly for the investigators, and of course, Jack Smith, who was not even in the picture, back in July, when the committee had held its last hearing, you know, they want to see that evidence, because this could make a big difference to see what they have, you know, going forward.

This is kind of in building up. They had an idea that this was coming their direction. They are watching and they are paying attention particularly to what it says, you know, potentially about obstruction. When it comes to the investigation with Trump, you've seen Liz Cheney referenced that in some of the hearings. They're not as worried about these criminal referrals as they are about the myriad of investigations into him. And it was so interesting what Evan said there about, you know, the Justice Department is getting all of this for the first time when it's released. Trump's legal team will also get to see it. We're expecting to have transcripts of witness testimony with all of this looks like, typically in a normal investigation, they would not get to see something like that. And so, they will get to see, and remember it was his daughter, Ivanka Trump, it was Bill Barr, it was a lot of these officials. They're more worried about the other investigations, the January 6 grand jury that's happening here in Washington, the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation, the Georgia special grand jury. But I think what's notable here and what I've picked up on from speaking to these people is they have huge differences in the legal team. They are not on some kind of unified front (Crosstalk).
