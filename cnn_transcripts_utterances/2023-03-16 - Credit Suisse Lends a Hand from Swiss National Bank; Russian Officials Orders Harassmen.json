It's made in China but was never meant to be used for military purposes. Still, both Russia and Ukraine claim the other side is using them on the battlefield. More now from CNN's Ivan Watson in this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukrainian military footage of a drone strike on a Russian rocket launcher. The bloody war between Russia and Ukraine is being fought on the ground and in the sky, using drones and unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, some of which were never intended for military use. (on-camera): This is one of the weapons in this war, a drone that could fly far behind the frontlines, carrying a powerful bomb rigged to hurl deadly pieces of shrapnel like this. (voice-over): Ukraine's territorial defense gave CNN an exclusive look at what's left of a weaponized UAV, originally manufactured in China. Ukraine State Security Service says an agent reported the launch of the drone from Russian-occupied territory, and troops shot it down at 2:00 a.m. on Saturday. (on-camera): This is remarkable. The officer is explaining his men shot this drone down using rifles, rifles. UNKNOWN (on-camera): That's right. Yes. WATSON (on-camera): So, the drone was flying low. The drone was flying low and visible to the naked eye, he tells me. This is where the bomb landed, the explosive device on the drone. (voice-over): Troops rigged the unexploded 20 kilogram bomb with explosives and then sprinted for cover. Officers identified the drone as a Mugan 5, which the manufacturer, Mugan Ltd., also confirmed to CNN. The company is based in Xiamen, China, designing UAV airframes for activities like forest fire prevention and agriculture. (on-camera): Mugan drones have been available for sale on Chinese online marketplaces like Alibaba and Taobao for up to around $15,000, prompting some tech bloggers to give it the nickname the \"Alibaba Drone\". (voice-over): Mugan 5 condemns any use of its drones on the battlefield, adding that the company ceased to accept orders from both Russia and Ukraine since the start of the war. But in January, Russian forces displayed these images of what is also a Mugan 5. The Russian military claims it was a Ukrainian UAV that shot down. Drone Expert Chris Lincoln-Jones calls these militarized UAVs dumb bombs. CHRIS LINCOLN-JONES, DRONE WARFARE EXPERT: this drone we're looking at would be more effective if it had a decent camera in it. WATSON (voice-over): The former British army officer who specialized in drone warfare says he expected more from a military superpower like Russia. LINCOLN-JONES: This seems to be a crude, unsophisticated, not very technologically advanced way of conducting operations. WATSON (voice-over): Ivan Watson, CNN, in Eastern Ukraine (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well that's exactly right, Finland's president is expected to visit the province of Kahramanmaras in Turkey's southeast, was the epicenter of last month's earthquake and one of the areas hardest hit by the quake.This is now almost six weeks on since the earthquake struck and this is a country still grappling with the aftermath, still dealing with the humanitarian crisis left in its wake. And of course, this is also a region now, parts of the southeast, which is dealing with severe flooding, which so far has killed at least 14 people. And it continues to be called for international support, and this will certainly be an important and timely visit. Of course, as you mentioned there, this visit will also be followed by high-level talks between the Finnish president as well as Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul tomorrow, where this potential NATO membership with Finland is expected to be very high on the agenda of those discussions. Now, of course, this has been a major sticking point for months now following Turkey -- following Finland's announcement that it wishes to end decades of nonalignment in order to join the alliance, along with Sweden it must be said, and of course, Turkey has for months now expressed concern over the accession of both Finland and Sweden to NATO. Of course, NATO requires all existing members to unanimously approve any accession to the alliance, and it has been a huge sticking point, continues to be a major priority for the alliance. Now, as it has understood at this stage, Turkey's primary concern is with Sweden, and accuses the Swedish government of being too lax on groups that it considers to be terrorist organizations, namely Kurdish groups. And NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has himself acknowledged that Turkey's primary concern is with Sweden, not with Finland. And now, of course, we are learning that this may be an opportunity, is maybe the time that Turkey wishes to express its decision to allow Finland or to rather approve and ratify Finland's decision to join the NATO alliance. Now, Wednesday, speaking to reporters, President Erdogan hinted as much, saying that Turkey was willing to do its part and that it would fulfill the promise made by its country. And we heard similar hints, similar suggestions from Finland's president, who also reportedly said that in the event that Turkey would announce Finland's accession to NATO, while the Turkey's ratification of that accession it would seek a face-to-face meeting between both presidents and that Finland has now accepted that invitation. So, this is certainly what is expected to be discussed at tomorrow's meeting. But, of course, questions still remain over Sweden's potential membership of NATO. This would be a huge concern for NATO, particularly ahead of July's NATO summit. Rosemary.",
