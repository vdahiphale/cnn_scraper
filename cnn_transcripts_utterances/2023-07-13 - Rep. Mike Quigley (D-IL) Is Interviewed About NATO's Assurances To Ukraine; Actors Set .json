He is the co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus.Congressman, thank you for coming in. A lot happened in Lithuania at the NATO summit. And I wanted to ask you kind of the overall -- Zelenskyy going in made very clear he was frustrated that there's not a clearer path to being offered in terms of a timeline for NATO membership for Ukraine, but he did leave Ukraine - leave Lithuania saying -- calling it a success in the big defense commitments that they were able to lock in. Do you consider what came out of the summit a success for the United States? REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): You know, I do. I think Zelenskyy sees those commitments as a bridge to NATO. I think the problem was they should have led with Secretary Austin's statements, that they have no doubt that Ukraine will become a member. Let's put this in perspective. I said a year ago they should be in NATO because their fight was -- that fight is the reason we formed NATO in the first place. And to be blunt, they're doing NATO's dirty work now for 500 days. If they had been run over, don't we think Moldova would be next and other NATO countries. And, in the meantime, many of those NATO countries weren't meeting the financial commitments to defense. Many of them were, frankly, paper tigers when it came to defense. And now they're much more unified. Ukraine has a counteroffensive going on. So, sure, I can see why Zelenskyy was, I guess, miffed, at the beginning of the conference.",

And Putin, in the meantime, has to show strength given he looked so weak that very bad day for him. I think in the end this disunity has to have some positive impact for the Ukrainians in this conflict. But my concern is, every opportunity has risk. A weakened Putin, a threatened Putin, has to show how strong he is, how tough he is. He was willing to blow up a dam and commit war crimes.[09:35:00] I'm concerned for the nuclear power plant there just as one example.",

Let's understand why. The Ukrainians are firing artillery shells in a couple days at a greater number than we produce in a month. The math won't last forever.I toured that plant in Iowa, and they want to increase production by 500 percent, the Pentagon does. That's not going to happen overnight. Second, I was in Kyiv, I was in Bucha, I saw the war crimes. In the end, what Zelenskyy said is right, we have to end this war quickly, we have to give them the weapons necessary so that the carnage can end, that the Putin war crimes can end and ultimately save lives in the net.",

And I believe many of them have gotten out of rules committee in - overnight, being offered by right wing Republicans having to do with transgender rights and abortion that are threatening to hold up the passage of this bill.
