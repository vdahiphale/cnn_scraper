I am Becky Anderson at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. Hello and welcome to a special edition of CONNECT THE WORLD. \"The polluters should pay.\" That is a message being heard over and over again here at COP27, developing countries imploring the world's richer nations to finally move forward on the much debated loss and damage fund that would address the damage caused by climate change. The calls for compensation coming hand-in-hand here with the drive for innovation as countries look for new sources of green energy. Today host Egypt and the United Arab Emirates struck a deal to develop what would be one of the world's largest wind farms. That will be here in Egypt. It would cut the country's carbon dioxide output by about 9 percent. But this is, for now, a plan for the future. The current reality is that more and more countries are enduring withering drought, devastating floods and prolonged heat waves. Developing nations, as it so often the case, hit the hardest. They say the time for help is long past due. Senior international correspondent, David McKenzie, is with me here again today. David, you've been talking to the president of the Seychelles, one of those countries most hard hit and in dire need of help.",

Then there is a possibility it could be dismissed as, you know, an aberration. But this is not. This is consistent with the criticisms that have been surfacing, particularly since President Putin called for this conscription about a month or so ago. He said now there are more than 80,000 trained, more than 50,000 of those put in the front line. But the consistent narrative, this is the one amplified by this letter about the loss of deaths or wounding of over 300 marines, is that the troops are getting to the front line. They're not adequately informed about where they're going, they don't have the right equipment, they don't have enough ammunition, they don't have enough weapons, they don't have enough protective helmets and flak jackets. It's also consistent with what we're hearing from Ukrainian troops, who tell us that they see these new recruits being forced, these new Russian recruits being forced to the front lines. And they can say, you know, these Ukrainian troops that are witnessing this are experienced at the front line. They can see these Russian conscripts on the other side being inexperienced. They're watching them in drones, they don't know how to behave on the battle front, is what one Ukrainian soldiers said to us. And they're seeing these new recruits being used as essentially cannon fodder, sent forward by more professional private military contractor mercenaries, if you will, of the Wagner group. Sent forward by them to really illuminate where the Ukrainian troops are. The Ukrainian troops fire at the conscripts moving forward. That gives away their firing position. But the Ukrainians are saying they can see the bodies piling up. So the image that emerges is a consistent one, that the battlefront right now is very hot. We know on the Ukrainian side there are casualties too there. It's a very intense battlefront right now. But from the Russian side, the losses are even shocking the Ukrainians at the moment.",

And yet these babies pack a punch, 11 of them spiking out of active farmland in central England, generating enough electricity per year to power 16,500 homes, locally-grown power now a vital source of energy security in a world where fossil fuels have become a weapon of war.",
