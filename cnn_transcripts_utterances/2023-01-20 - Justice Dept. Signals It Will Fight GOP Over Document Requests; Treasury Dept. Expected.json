But in this letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, the Justice Department makes it clear that they are unlikely to comply with his broad requests for information on a number of different matters.Now, the department makes it clear though, they believe oversight is important. They do want to cooperate, but they need to balance that against the need to protect ongoing criminal investigations. Jordan has made it clear though he wants to examine how the Justice Department has handled a series of matters, including its ongoing investigations into former President Trump and current President Joe Biden, and the possible mishandling of classified documents. This letter really lays out the hurdles that Jordan is going to face. So right now, he's not getting anything from the Justice Department. But this letter lays out how they want to go into these negotiations to see if they can possibly accommodate any of his requests. But in a short time, those requests are going to go unanswered.

They issued letter after letter, subpoena after subpoena to the Trump administration. The Trump administration didn't respond. Sometimes that went to court and that led to a years-long drag-out -- knockdown drag-out fight. And we'll see if that ever gets to that or if there was some sort of accommodation where the House Judiciary Committee could get some answers. But there are some log -- some questions that some Democrats have. Democrats want to make sure that the documents that were mishandled by the president were -- did not include any information that could harm national security. Including one Democrat that I just spoke with, Senator Ben Cardin, who said that the president needs to be completely transparent about what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: There may be some. But I would say, Alisyn, that these requests, I think are designed to achieve this response. In other words, there's a lot of things that the House could be engaging in oversight regarding the Justice Department. There's been a lot of high-profile investigations over the last few years. And the former president had obviously significant investigations into him. There's a lot of questions about how the Justice Department handles things.

You can see the images there, taking that ammo from North Korea and bringing it back to the fight in Ukraine. That's the part of this that makes Wagner a transnational criminal organization. The U.S. had talked about this just a couple of weeks ago, about late last year. And here they say is the evidence, the photographs that back that up. Interestingly, it was Wagner that was using the artillery and the ammo provided here, not the Russian Ministry of Defense. And that gets at how Wagner is operating, essentially a mercenary organization that is competing with at times and operating independently of the Russian military primarily in Bakhmut, a town in eastern Ukraine.

And just wanted to add that we're just getting in a news bulletin from our London bureau that Germany has just announced 1.08 billion in military aid to Ukraine. So, thank you for that, Oren.Let's bring in now retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Steve Anderson. So, General, great to have you. So, between Germany's 1.08 billion military aid and the U.S. has this $2.5 billion military aid package which I'll just read to everybody what that includes. 90 Stryker Combat Vehicles, 59 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, ammunition for rocket systems, additional munitions for aerial defense systems. So, what will all this change in terms of Ukraine fighting the war? BRIG. GEN. STEVE ANDERSON (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, thank you, Alisyn. This is going to give the Ukrainians maneuver capability that they presently just don't have. I mean, the Bradleys and the Strykers, and the German Leopards, the AMX light tanks from the French, and the Challengers from the UK, they're going to give them the ability to move, shoot, and communicate and conduct offensive operations. And, of course, that's what we really need here. The Ukrainians -- the United States want to see the Ukrainians succeed at the point of driving the Russians all the way out of the areas that they've occupied since the 24th of February, and also since 2014 in Crimea. So, they need to have that offensive maneuver capabilities that these vehicles are going to get them -- give them. So, this is really good news.",

And President Zelenskyy pointed this out that a few months later, the U.S. -- the West typically just sends it over. Explain the reluctance, and if you think it makes sense, especially in the context of these tanks that are being held back.",

      "sentences": "Well, I really don't understand reluctance quite frankly, Victor. I believe that we need to support the Ukrainians to win the war. Thus far, we've been doing things to make sure they don't lose. And there's a dramatic difference between the two. I mean, for instance, logistics. We need to give them all the logistics they need to sustain all this incredible equipment we have given them. And thus far we haven't done that. We need to give them, as I mentioned, the armored mobility, but we need to give them more air defense, we need to give them drones like Gray Eagle and Reaper, we need -- we have -- we could give them A-10 aircraft.Now, I'm not saying put American pilots in the seats. What I'm saying is there's a lot of things we can do to make sure that Ukrainians actually win and just don't lose. And that's what needs to happen this next year, otherwise, we're going to have a very long protracted war. The right thing to do is give them everything they need. Now, I would also add. I don't think they need M1 tanks. I think the M1 tank is too big, too heavy, it runs on jet fuel, too difficult to maintain. I think that we made the right call in giving them Strykers and Bradleys, but we need to do more to make sure that Ukrainians can actually win.",
