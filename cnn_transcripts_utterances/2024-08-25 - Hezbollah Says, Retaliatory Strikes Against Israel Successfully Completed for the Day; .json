That's where Hezbollah militants now say they've completed their retaliatory strikes on Israel for the day.This is what played out in Northern Israel after the group fired at least 200 rockets from Lebanon. Hezbollah called that the first phase of its retaliation for the recent killing of its top military commander and called the strikes a complete success. But earlier, Israel said it hit Hezbollah positions just as they were preparing to launch their strikes. The IDF says more than 100 fighter jets took part in the operation, destroying thousands of Hezbollah's rocket launcher barrels. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this about those strikes.

They've always had a strong fighter jet military response to Hezbollah ready and available, and it appears that they used it last night. In fact, while we've been standing here, we've just seen two Apache gunships fly side by side slowly along the coastline here, as if on patrol.That's unusual. Usually, you get the occasional Black Hawk large larger sort of, troop transporting aircraft, if you will, pass along the coastline, but two Apache gunships, which are, as they say, gunships. They are offensive weapon systems, aerial platforms. So, to have them patrolling along the coastline here really underscores for Israelis, it is a slightly different day today. In terms of assessment of damage, of course, that's key to the IDF's considerations on what to do now, what's known as BDA, battle damage assessment, not only of the impacts that Hezbollah claims that have precipitated on 11 military targets here in Israel, but also the IDF saw the Israeli Air Force as well, their own strikes inside of Lebanon. So, that's what they do next -- and we're hearing fighter jets in the sky as well over us now. What they do next will depend on that battle damage assessment. And it does at the moment seem to be a pause and wait, but significant, as Ben mentioned, and as you questioned, the Israeli Defense Force are not speaking in any detail at all or giving any clarity or understanding of the extent of the damage at those sites. And one of those sites is a significant major defense installation very close to the border with Lebanon, so strategically important for Israel. Not a standalone site, but one that's backed up by many others. But the integrated air defenses that Hezbollah is saying that they attacked, the integrity of those will also speak to Israel's next moves. But at the moment, it does appear to be a pause and see what happens next, and only, according to Israeli officials, only one civilian casualty an echo up close to the northern border.

Almost all Israelis changed their minds after the 7th of October, claiming that after those events, Israel has the right, not only the right, the duty to do whatever it wants without any limits, no legal limits, moral limits, more than this.Most of the Israelis do not feel any kind of empathy toward the Palestinian victims, toward the Palestinian punishment, the Palestinians of Gaza, obviously. Not only they don't feel empathy, they think that feeling empathy or expressing empathy toward Gaza is betrayal, is almost illegal in Israel today. In other words, Israel turned to become more militaristic, more nationalistic, more racist in those months with justification, which is questionable. I mean, as horrible as those atrocities on the 7th of October were, does it really permit Israel to kill 40,000 people, to distract the entire Gaza? And does it serve Israel at all? But the name of the game in Israel right now is punishing, taking revenge, and not caring about none of the people in Gaza.

This latest kind of spasm of violence of what sound like very significant strikes from both sides, do you think that it has crossed any red lines that it will take us into a new escalatory pattern or is it remaining within the kind of the red lines of a war on the border that's gone on for more than ten months now?",

Israel is saying they launched 200 and they launched 100 aircraft and destroyed thousands of launching systems owned by Hezbollah.So, we need some official information to see how today's raids back and forth have actually gone to in order to understand the probable next moves. If Hezbollah actually inflicted significant damage on Israel, and it's not clear that they have, then Israel, I think, will be certain to continue to prepare for further attacks to preempt Hezbollah from launching additional attacks. And the other issue, of course, that everyone I think is worried about is whether in a future Hezbollah attack on Israel, whether Iran joins that attack. So, we are at very early stages of this. You know, this has only been happening for a few hours. I think probably the answers we're looking for will emerge in the coming days. But I don't think we're going to see much more today, but we could see additional action in the coming days. And the question then is, does Iran join in and does Hezbollah launch a much larger attack the next time around than it did this time? 300 missiles count as (ph) a large attack.",

The Iranians have basically said that if they attack this time around, it'll be much larger than the attack last April, and I fully expect that to be the case.And so what you're seeing is a commensurate buildup of U.S. military capabilities that could defend Israel against a much larger attack and potentially strike at Iranian targets to prevent further attacks. So, it is very much deterrence. It's not about necessarily boots on the ground. It's about shooting down incoming Iranian missiles that are coming in from long range.",

He's basically describing an accurate picture, a precise picture, or a zeitgeist, if you will, of Israeli society in the last ten months.He probably goes back into the origins of the occupation and the incompatibility of having this green line this division and so on, and that led to things and terror and counter-terror. But in one thing, he's based on your quote, of course, in one thing, he's absolutely right, and that is the despondency, the devastation, the humiliation and the agony that people here feel since October 7th, which is hard. If I take, you know, what's going on with Hezbollah in the last 12 hours, the best case scenario, as far as the vast majority of Israelis are concerned, is that both sides are telling the truth that we preemptively struck hundreds of missile silos successfully and that Hezbollah is also telling the truth that they struck -- I don't know yet, but that they struck what they intended to strike and that and leave it at that. Again, I don't know what exactly Gideon said but I think you and I have discussed this previously.

Israel said no, and then the Americans asked Israel to be more discriminate in how it uses munitions. Israel defied the U.S. And again and again and again, the U.S. never crossed that thin or almost invisible line between rhetoric and policy.Now, the U.S. justified Israel, the U.S. protected Israel, the U.S. backed Israel, the U.S. supported Israel immensely, both materially and diplomatically. But at some point, I think the learning curve, the American learning curve became flat.

So, that's what the U.S. has been trying to do. That's what the main sort of message that the U.S. has been communicating to the Israelis, to Iran indirectly is to lower the temperature, take a step back and try to focus on the ceasefire negotiations and to use that as an off-ramp to try to de-escalate the situation. Now, Israel conducted two very, very high profile assassinations over the last few weeks. One was the assassination of Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, while he was visiting Iran, and the other one was the assassination of a top Hezbollah military commander, Fuad Shukr, in Lebanon. And so we have been anticipating a retaliation by Iran and Hezbollah for the assassination of these two figures. Israel has been anticipating it and so has the U.S. as well. So, the question was not whether they could successfully sort of convince Iran and Hezbollah not to retaliate. The question was whether they could convince them to retaliate in a limited way that was manageable, that could save face, that could sort of check the box as a retaliation, but not aggravate the situation so much that the region descends into a war. And so that's what we're seeing playing out right now. Hezbollah has struck these targets in Israel. The Israeli military was well- prepared. They did launch that preemptive strike. And so what we're seeing right now is the retaliation that we had expected, but not in a way that is completely out of control.",

Do you share that evaluation? Does the Biden administration -- have they gone far enough to try to bring an end to more than ten months of fighting?EL-GAMAL:  That's a great point, Ivan, and I was watching your coverage earlier with Gideon Levy and Alon Pinkas, and I completely agree with their statements, of course. You know, I was just talking a minute ago about the diplomatic efforts to get the Israelis and Iran and Hezbollah to de-escalate, but I think we can fairly objectively assess that the Biden administration has failed diplomatically to bring an end to the war in Gaza. [03:45:01] They failed diplomatically to come to a solution when it comes to Israel's actions in the region, when it comes to Netanyahu's escalation of the situation. You know, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, has consistently, over the last several months, jeopardized the safety and security of people living in the Middle East, including Israelis, including his own hostages, the Israeli hostages in Israel. And I say that because, and, again, this is not my opinion, Ivan, but this is based on statements from Israeli negotiators who have said and complained that they have no mandate to sign a deal. They have no mandate to bring the hostages home. They feel like they're engaging in these negotiations almost as a show, because the prime minister doesn't want a deal and hasn't wanted a deal over the last few months. And he continues to engage in escalatory actions like the assassinations that I've just mentioned. And so the U.S. as Israel's strongest ally in the region as the country that objectively has the most leverage over Israel to stop this war and to bring the region back from the brink has failed to do so. And it is precisely because the Biden administration has refused to use any of that leverage over the Israelis. And, in fact, not only refuses to use it, Ivan, but continues to send Israel weapons and continues to fund what they know now is a war that is absolutely decimating and eradicating the Palestinian people and also bringing the region closer to war. I understand that this is a harsh assessment, and I don't say that lightly, but I'm saying that based on everything that we've seen and heard over the last ten months.
