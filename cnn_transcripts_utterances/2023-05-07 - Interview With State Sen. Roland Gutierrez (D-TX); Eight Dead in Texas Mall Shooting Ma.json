Joining me now to discuss, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin of Illinois. Senator, we have so much to talk about, obviously. Let's start with the horrific news out of Texas, eight people killed after a gunman opened fire at a shopping center. Congress passed the first significant gun legislation in decades after the Uvalde shooting. It still obviously fell far short of what you think is needed. Do you think there is any appetite for any more potential bipartisan efforts to build on the law, perhaps to expand the red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others? Or is the message to Americans who are tired of living like this simply that that's it, there's nothing more Congress is going to do? SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL):  There is something more that America can do, and it's called an election. And if people across America are fed up with these mass shootings and killings and the terrible things that are happening even to our children as a result of it, they're going to vote accordingly. We need to have that kind of a revolution in thinking across America that this is unacceptable. This was not dictated by the Constitution.

We really appreciate it. Chairman Turner, let me start with you, because you both met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. What can you tell us about the meeting? Did you express any concerns to Netanyahu over his push to overhaul Israel's legal system, weaken it, not to mention including extremists in his Cabinet? All this has caused tremendous unrest domestically in Israel. REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  Right? So, our trip comes just on the heels of Speaker Kevin McCarthy being here. And our focus largely, being from the Intelligence Committee, were on the relations between the United States and Israel and how we can help strengthen the security situation in the area. We also stopped in Jordan and Egypt. And, talking to all three countries, they were all very much encouraging the United States on a policy basis to have a stronger role, thinking that there are real opportunities to increase the security situation here, but at the same time painting a picture that there are serious threats in the area and that the United States should be playing a role. TAPPER:  So, Congressman Himes, Netanyahu recently told CNN that a credible military threat is the only way to stop Iran from its nuclear weapons program and the like. And Netanyahu vowed to do everything in his power to prevent that country from developing nuclear weapons. Negotiations on Iran's nuclear program have obviously been on the back burner for months, if not years. Do you think the White House needs to treat this as a higher priority? And, based on your conversations overseas, how close is Iran to building a nuclear weapon? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  Well, the prime minister, as he has been every time I have met with him -- and that's probably three times -- he was very, very focused on Iran, and probably said to us nine or 10 times that it was intolerable for him to imagine an Iran with a nuclear weapon. That's not news. Of course, if you have spent time around Bibi Netanyahu. Now, we know where he is on the JCPOA. The reality is that the JCPOA, whatever you thought of the deal, when it was in effect, the Iranians were not making -- enriching more uranium. Now they are. So, the problem, of course, is that, with Iran so brutally abusing its own people, I think the prospect for negotiation is arguably further away than ever before. So, we're in a little bit of a fix right now, because we don't have a lot of leverage. The prime minister is, of course, where he always has been, which is enormously hawkish. And there's just not a lot of diplomatic tools available to address the challenge of the possibility of a nuclear Iran.",

The United States has never really come close defaulting on its debt before. So it's hard for us to imagine what that might look like. But, of course, it could be catastrophic. Frankly, the full faith and credit of the United States is the bedrock on which the global financial system is built. And if that comes into question, all kinds of things could happen. Look, the U.S. dollar could -- could -- its position as the global reserve currency could be eroded. People may choose to invest in the United Kingdom or in the European Union, rather than the United States. So I'm not sure that either the chairman nor I know what the solution looks like in the coming weeks, but there had better be a solution.",

It's an all-too-common occurrence here in the United States. Our panel joins us now. Congresswoman, welcome to STATE OF THE UNION. I wish you were here under better circumstances. You flipped your Trump district in Michigan blue. And I'm wondering. Obviously, there is no appetite in Congress for the kind of sweeping gun measures that Democrats would like to pass, but what about something like red flag laws, aggressive ones, where people can really try to keep guns out of the hands of people who are going through crises? Is that any -- is there any possibility of bipartisanship there? REP. HILLARY SCHOLTEN (D-MI):  No, I think that there is, Jake. And one thing that I am seeing every day in Congress is a renewed interest to address this national trauma. Now, this goes far beyond the carnage that we see, bodies stacked up behind an outlet mall. Look at all those people fleeing the mall, the trauma that reverberates around our country, the mental health crisis that's rising in our young people, who have been forced to bear the burden of gun violence in our country, which is now the number one killer of children in the United States of America. This is a uniquely American problem, and we don't have to live like this. I hear from people every single day in a swing district like mine, Republicans alike, who are ready to do something about this problem, and I'm ready to work on it as well.",

I'm very much in favor of those. Part of the problem is, is that this is -- these mass shootings are a form of social contagion, where it is, people are -- have a switch flipped when they see this, and then they try to -- and they copycat. And we saw similar things with, like, political assassinations in the '60s and '70s, and then it just sort of stopped.
