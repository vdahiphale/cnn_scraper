Good evening.Dueling campaign events in Iowa today as Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis battle for each and every vote in the Hawkeye State with just six weeks until the Iowa caucuses. The Florida governor has wrapped his tour of all 99 counties in Iowa. While there are candidates trading barbs right now, the former president is dredging up his lies about the 2020 election, handing out these signs. You can see it on screen right there. Accusing his chief political rival, President Joe Biden, of subverting democracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have opponents. We have a lot of opponents. But we've been waging an all-out war in American democracy. You look at what they've been doing and becoming more and more extreme and repressive.

Well, his reasoning was that the Biden administration is forcing people to drive specific cars. Talking about electric vehicles. He also said that they were rigging elections, going back to 2020.But the main crux of his argument was what we have heard before. These investigations, these cases against Donald Trump are, quote-unquote, \"election interference,\" essentially saying that the Biden administration is making a political argument that they have stepped in that he's facing these 91 criminal charges because they don't want Trump running for president. This has been his argument both legally and politically. But, Jim, I do want to point one thing out here when we get to the politics. We are just about six weeks out from those Iowa caucuses. We are here tonight before Donald Trump took the stage. Another speaker asked the crowd how many people here had never caucused before. And about half the people in the room raised their hand. And I bring this up to show that despite his ongoing legal problems, Donald Trump has not only -- has an enormous, he has been leading in the polls here in Iowa, but he has new support as well. And that's important to point out when we're talking about this. That there is a chance that right now he is leading and could win those Iowa caucuses in just about six weeks.",

The Democrats are.I thought the speech, I didn't see the first one in Ankeny. I watched the second one in Cedar Rapids. I thought it was -- once again as so often when he gets up on the stage, it encapsulates both his opportunity and the obstacles that he faces. I mean, you know, in that speech is a critique of where things are in the country under Biden that has resonance for a lot of voters. Talking about high interest rates, talking about the border, talking about crime. The difficulty of buying a house. But then you get, with Donald Trump, as always, you get all of the other obsessions that he really won the election. That it was stolen from him. The kind of the threats against his political opponents. You know, you kind of get the feeling that there are Republican strategists everywhere who are saying, well, if you can just stop with the critique, that would be fine. Except Trump, inevitably, no matter what he says, is a bigger part of this occasion, if he's the nominee and a challenger typically is.

They want to believe that all of these institutions are conspiring against them. That are marginalizing them and disparaging them in American society.And he has been, as we saw again today, just enormously consistent in identifying any time he is held to account for what he did after 2020, or in other cases like the classified documents. That it's really an attack on them. I am your sword and your shield. I am your retribution. All of that kind of language. To me it is a remainder. Maybe no one else can push these buttons as effectively as Trump, but it is a reminder that there is a depth of alienation in a significant cohort of the electorate that isn't likely to go away whatever happens to him in 2024. But certainly he has been effective in the context of Republican primary of basically saying they're going after me because they really want to silence you.

He never came up with a plan to repeal -- excuse me, replace Obamacare. We never got that.And he seems to be repeating himself in what he said back when he was president. The problem though, Ron, this time around, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that Obamacare has become increasingly popular, more popular over the years.

In 2017, Americans came to see it as something that benefitted even the vast majority, 85 percent or so, with insurance because it protected people with pre-existing conditions and other provisions. And Trump going back at this really is indicative of what I was talking about on our first answer.There's a lot of dissatisfaction with Joe Biden's record. Abd we see it, you know, over and over again in various angles from polls. But Trump is running on an agenda that is more aggressive and militant than he ran on in 2016 and certainly than he ran on in 2020. He's talking about repealing Obamacare, he's talking about mass deportation, he's talking about internment camps, military action against Mexico, sending the National Guard into blues cities. Vast trade wars with China and other countries. Maybe he can sell those policies. But in many ways, you kind of look at this, and the ACA repeal is another example of this, every day he throws Joe Biden a life line. Right? I mean, rather than talking -- when he's talking about high interest rates now and how hard it is to buy a home, that is difficult terrain for Democrats. When he's talking about repealing the ACA and setting up internment camps and what a second Trump term might mean, that really is the most plausible pathway for Biden to get beyond the circle of voters who are satisfied with him into a winning coalition in 2024.",

I mean, Biden won that county by 10 points. Nassau County, which is the heart of district in 2020.But the Republican gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin won it by 10 in 2022. I mean, you look at recent polling by Siena College in the state Trump leads Biden there. Biden's approval is only 41 percent. There's a lot of concern about immigration and crime which dominate the news in the New York media market. You have the New York Mayor Eric Adams out there making arguments that in many ways echo the Republican criticism of Biden. And so this terrain is more difficult than it might appear from, you know, the fact that I said Biden plus eight district. The advantage Democrats have is their likely candidate is the former -- the person who formerly held that seat, Tom Suozzi, the former Nassau County executive. He's much better known than any of the other Republicans. He could win the seat in an off, off, off-year election in February. But the erosion for Biden in this district, in this area, I think is indicative of the kind of issues they're going to have to figure out a better answer for between now and next November because it is the kind of thing that Republicans who saw the DeSantis debate against Newsom are really going to want to stress.",

A very consequential ruling last night in the federal election subversion case right here in Washington, D.C. that was brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith.Now Trump and his team are fighting against this case because it is currently scheduled to go to trial in March. They are trying to get the charges dismissed. And the most recent attempt by Trump and his team was to claim that he had absolute immunity, protection, because everything in the indictment happened while he was the sitting president, and in their eyes, that means he cannot be charged with any crimes. The only problem with that theory is that the judge completely disagreed. District Judge Tanya Chutkan who's overseeing this case resoundingly rejected those arguments. She said it did not fit with the text of the Constitution. That there was no Supreme Court precedent backing that up. She even quoted some of our founding fathers, folks like Alexander Hamilton and George Washington from his farewell address where they made clear that the founding principles of this nation were that the president is not a king. The president is not above the law. Let me read for you, Jim, one of the quotes from this ruling. It was a 50-page ruling. There was a lot in there. Judge Chutkan said, quote, \"Whatever immunities a sitting president may enjoy, the United States has only one chief executive at a time and that position does not confer a lifelong get-out-of-jail-free pass.\" Those are some strong words from the judge. But it won't be the final word. Trump and his lawyers are definitely going to appeal this.

It was he relied on a clause in the Constitution that relates to impeachment that he tried to put a spin on that nobody has ever done before.No president has ever been indicted before. So that was one of his problems. The judge, Judge Chutkan, wrote really a magisterial type opinion. She knew this is going to be reviewed probably by the Court of Appeals first, and then by Supreme Court ultimately. So this is an historic writing she engaged in. And it's well done.

It doesn't. It doesn't also apply in a civil context for Trump, because they said his behavior at the Court of Appeals, at least based on the information that was before them, at this time shows he wasn't engaged in presidential conduct, he engaged in political conduct in trying to hang on to an office when he had lost the election.",

But as Russia steps up its military production on an industrial scale, General Nazarov's biggest fear is whether the West has the patience for what is turning out to be a much longer war. COREN (on camera): There are concerns that the West is losing interest in this war and the support is waning, especially in the US amongst Republicans. What is your message to those Republicans? NAZAROV: American support is vital for Ukrainians. It is really what is very important for us. What I want to say to Republicans, we need to understand that now we have a problem to conduct this war, but if we don't manage to win this war, in the future we'll have more problems, not only for our country, for my country, for our populations, but only for Europe as a whole.

JAMIE LOVEJOY, VETERINARIAN: Yes, so I think the hardest part about this is that we don't really know what's going on. There are quite a few different possibilities here. There is certainly the possibility that we have a novel pathogen or a new bacteria or virus. It is out there. It is a possibility. The University of New Hampshire has a veterinary lab that has found a pathogen that may or may not be linked, but really we haven't found concrete evidence that this is a new thing. So I think people have to recognize that this is possible, that this is just -- we have more dogs, we have dogs leaving their homes more than they used to.
