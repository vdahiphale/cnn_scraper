Natasha, this is fascinating. We have not heard from Jimmy McCain really at all on these types of issues. What did he tell you?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Phil. And look, the fact that he's speaking out right now, he really doesn't take lightly, right, because he never has spoken publicly about Donald Trump before, but he has decided to now because of what he saw last week at Arlington National Cemetery, which he believes is a violation of the men and women that are buried there.If you recall, of course, Trump did visit the cemetery last week at the invitation, he says, of these Gold Star families who lost their family members during the Abbey Gate bombing in 2021 in Afghanistan. And he posed in front of graves and he, you know, put a thumbs up and he was saying. And Jimmy McCain, who had actually just returned from a seven-month deployment to the Middle East to a base where three U.S. service members had been killed just weeks before he arrived there, he really saw that as deeply inappropriate and deeply insulting to the people that are buried in that cemetery because they didn't have a choice, he says, of whether to be part of this political campaign, this political backdrop. So just to give you a sense of what he told me, he said, quote, \"It just blows me away. These men and women that are laying in the ground there, they have no choice of whether to be a backdrop for this political campaign.\" And he also got into a bit of the psychology behind why he believes Donald Trump repeatedly tends to criticize service members, particularly his father, of course, as we've seen in recent years. And he said, you know, quote, \"Many of these men and women who served their country chose to do something greater than themselves. They woke up one morning, they signed on the dotted line, they put their right hand up and they chose to serve their country. And that's an experience that Donald Trump has not had.\" And he said, \"I think that might be something that he thinks about a lot.\" So essentially saying he thinks that Donald Trump is insecure about the fact that he has not served for the military.",

Yes, other members of his family, including his mother have broken with Trump himself publicly, including his sister Meghan.But he says that he is now going to be voting for Kamala Harris in November. He has changed his registration to Democrat, which is a really significant move, of course, for someone who is the son of such a prominent, you know, GOP senator. He was a GOP political candidate. So this is a big dramatic move for Jimmy McCain. And I should note, you know, it remains to be seen how the rest of his family is going to react to this because his sister, Meghan McCain, she has indicated that she is not going to endorse Kamala Harris and she said, quote, in a tweet last week, \"I am a lifelong generational conservative.\" She says, \"Please stop trying to turn me into a progressive. It's a fever dream.\" Jimmy McCain now says he's willing to do whatever it takes, whatever he can to actually help the Harris-Walz campaign this November.",

They want to make sure that IVF is available to every family that needs to take advantage of it.Because, yes, having families, building families in America is critical to the future of our success as a nation. And so I think it's something that members on both sides of the aisle will try to find a way to make sure that we can get there. We'll see what the details look like. But at the end of the day, the core issues facing the American people are the cost of food and housing. Donald Trump has the recipe to make it better for the lives of the American people having a secure southern border. We know what Donald Trump did, and we can see the terrible job Kamala Harris has done. This is the reason why migrants are getting welfare benefits in states all across America. California now wants to give $150,000 for illegal immigrants to buy homes in California. That is the type of policy, the value set that Kamala Harris supports.

They do not tolerate it. Illegal immigration is out of the playbook of the radical left Democrats led by Kamala Harris. So if you have criminals in our streets, like in New York, you have to deport them. You have to send them home. If you have illegals like in Chicago who are taking over schools, they're taking over recreation centers, they're taking over hotels, and they're not getting the vital need, the vital aid that citizens in these cities are looking for is going to illegals?

So the cost of mobilizing forces in our nation to deport illegal immigrants pales in comparison to the long run massive costs of just letting them stay in the United States. And if Kamala Harris has her way, turning the spigot on to invite more illegal immigration in the future, it is simply not a recipe for success.

But, again, also does he have anything else on the ballot there that could potentially help him.

Tester is really leaning on his long standing brand, which is someone who has been more independent, someone who, you know, bucks the party on things like immigration when he needs to.
