But most of the Republicans that I speak with continue to -- want to continue to support Ukraine. I look at this as Zelenskyy has said, this is not charity. This is an investment in global security and democracy.And the more we can continue to support Ukraine, it not only helps Ukraine, but neighboring countries. If Putin were to succeed in Ukraine, he will move to other countries, and that is damaging to America. But what Republicans, I'm talking with, the more rational Republicans, they have some concerns in terms of just not knowing where the money is going, and how it's being spent. And they're simply asking for more accountability. And they also say that it's not up without question, that if Zelenskyy wants to continue to receive money from the United States, he should be more than willing to just be more vocal and more upfront about exactly how the money is being spent. And if those questions are answered, then many Republicans won't have any issue with it. But just a little more transparency, and how the money is being allocated.",

Not only is Ukraine, an ally of ours, but we know that Vladimir Putin's ambitions do not end at Ukraine, and it don't begin there either really.He is someone who would love to restore what used to be the Soviet Union. And he's not going to stop there. And we have to be very vigilant about this. I worry when I hear so many people on the Republican side, and unfortunately, it's not just a vocal minority in the House of Representatives. It's the standard bearer of the Republican Party. Donald Trump has repeatedly called U.S. support for the free people of Ukraine into question. And so we got to get on the same page when it comes to this stuff. And I think to the extent we see any support among the American people slipping, it's because there's not that kind of unity of message that typically we have seen, at least in the context of foreign policy, across the ideological spectrum, both Democrats and Republicans. I think this President can run, in fact, on -- for re-election on his success, thus far, and keeping Russia from the take -- completely overtaking Ukraine, which is what many people thought would happen early on in the war.",

I feel like there was a missed opportunity to go to the site earlier on and show up federal help. It's great that we're getting federal financial help to that region. But oftentimes, the optics of seeing someone whether it is President Biden, whether it's the Vice President or Secretary Buttigieg being on the ground, meeting face to face with those people and reinforcing the financial support with the human kindness, that would have gone a long way. But I don't take away him being in Poland. I think that was important, but making sure that we have a high-level federal official on the ground there I think will go a long way.",

      "sentences": "OK, so guys, you know, affordability in this country is a real challenge when it comes to housing. So the White House says that this program should hopefully help with the affordability crisis, saying that it is cutting insurance premiums for homes that are insured by FHA, the Federal Housing Administration.So that'll work out to about 30 basis points or $800 in savings annually for most new borrowers. Depending on the cost of your home. It could be a bit more than that, it could be a bit less than that. FHA, guys, tends to benefit first time homebuyers. Let's say you don't have 20 percent to put down and right now home prices are very expensive, so perhaps you don't. And perhaps you have a lower credit score, well, you can get an FHA insured home. The catch, however, is that you have to pay this mortgage insurance premium so the White House is hoping by reducing these payments. Hopefully, it makes homes a bit more affordable. I should say the plan does have support from major industry leaders like the National Association of Realtors, also the Mortgage Bankers Association, saying that they support the plan. Although some wonder could this backfire? One conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute saying in a statement to me earlier that these cuts announced today will actually expose taxpayers and not help prospective homebuyers. This credit easing will cause the surplus of buyers to use their newly minted buying power to bid up the price of houses. This is simple economics. That said, the White House says this program launches March 20th.",

And, you know, the precise content and conduct that would be covered by this case, at issue is whether, you know, Twitter or Facebook, Google could be liable under antitrust law, for materials that are ISIS propaganda, training, films, recruitment films that lead up to various attacks in Paris, and Istanbul, for example.And the -- you heard there, the lawyer for Twitter, Seth Waxman, trying to bring some clarity to the limits of liability. And in a separate exchange with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, it came out that he said, you know, look, company's doing regular business at arm's length from, you know, the the people who are actually posting this material and operating -- and the company's operating legitimately, would not be liable, even if they know that, you know, bad people are doing bad things down the road. The key here said Seth Waxman is when posts material actually are part of planning and attack that Twitter or the other social media platforms would know about, a much deeper connection. Now the other thing that the families say is that, you know, the algorithms that rank and make recommendations that that is enough for liability. And that's why they've brought this case. It's interesting, you know, you step back and you -- the justices did not seem persuaded by the families, I have to say here. That they were troubled by some of this material, but they did not want to go so far as what the families were arguing. And I think, you know, compared to what we were talking about yesterday, and today about some of these issues, the justices are really struggling to take a pre-algorithm world and apply it to what we have now. You know, some of the hypothetical questions today were about, you know, somebody assisting a bank robber or murderer. But right now, it's how does a platform itself assist a wrongdoer? And I think that were -- the justices actually want to shed some light here. I don't think they're going to do anything as revolutionary as some of the social media companies had feared. But I think what we could start to see are incremental steps toward more regulation of sorts of the content and what the social media companies have to do.
