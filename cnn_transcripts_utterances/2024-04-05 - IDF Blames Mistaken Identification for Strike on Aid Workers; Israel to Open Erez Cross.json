      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin with new developments out of Israel, where the Israeli military has released a preliminary report on its killing of seven aid workers in Gaza. The investigation finds a series of devastating mistakes unfolded earlier this week when three vehicles carrying the World Central Kitchen workers traveled outside the combat zone. Those vehicles were hit in three separate strikes over the course of almost a mile-and-a-half. Israel says it was a case of mistaken identification after two gunmen were spotted nearby. Quoting from the report, one of the commanders, the Israelis say, mistakenly assumed that the gunman were located inside the accompanying vehicles and that these were Hamas terrorists. The IDF has fired two senior officers. I want to bring in CNN's Nic Robertson, our international diplomatic editor. Nic, does the report answer all the questions?",

      "sentences": "It still seems to leave some questions outstanding. For example, the World Central Kitchen has said that they were in coordination with the IDF, that they were following the protocols that the IDF outlines for them to do.So, in which case, why does the IDF report say that their commanders in charge of firing at these three SUVs, why did they not understand that these SUVs were associated with the World Central Kitchen. Well, the initial indications from the IDF indicate that this was happening at night and they couldn't see the identification on the vehicles, but that doesn't really get to that central issue. If there was coordination, why did they not realize it? How would they sort of team those pieces of information up? Another point that doesn't seem to be answered is, if the IDF had spotted gunmen on the trucks, the aid trucks, these are the big trucks, before they went into the convoy, how can they link the SUVs carrying the aid workers later on specifically with Hamas? Now, the IDF's separate briefing to reporters, they said they thought they'd spotted something that looked like a weapon over the shoulder of one of the people in those vehicles that they later decided was actually a bag. So, it doesn't -- there's that piece of detail that hasn't been fully explained. The IDF has said that what happened, happened outside of their rules of engagement, which is why they're disciplined officials, but we don't know what the IDF's rules of engagements are. They don't make those public, and they have said the rules of the engagement change in different situations. So there's still a lot of questions to be answered here, Jim.",

But for these outrageous killings, they say the report so far is cold comfort.Plus, the World Central Kitchen say they were shown a video by the IDF that was intended to support what the IDF has talked about gunman on the trucks. The World's Central Kitchen say the video that they've seen, that they'd been shown, how they been showing it so far, it's not -- they can't see what the IDF is telling them in that about the gunman. They don't get it. So they don't think the videos explanation of what's in the report either.",

You see this will -- I think it's a matter of days, weeks, it is not a matter of months. And, you know, when we do something wrong, when there's mistake made on our behalf on Israel's side, we take responsibility. We say the truth. We admit things even when it's the most painful, inconvenient truth to admit, and I think people have to remember that. That was a very, very tragic incident involving the unsung heroes of World Central Kitchen, as one of my colleagues calls them, unsung heroes of armed conflict. It should not have happened. And we should draw the right conclusions and implement lessons in order for this not to reoccur. And already, I can tell you that we've set up a situation room for better coordination between the IDF and these aid groups on the ground because they're doing the all-important work. And this specific organization, by the way, they were one of the first ones to show up right after October 7th, being there on the ground helping civilians on both sides of the border.",

And it was stormed by these terrorists on October 7th, as well as an increase of Jordanian aid, the humanitarian assistance that will continue to be facilitated via Kerem Shalom.I think it's important for viewers to understand that there are more food trucks entering Gaza now daily than before the war. So, aid is flowing into Gaza, and, you know, 240 trucks a day, yesterday, the day before, a couple hundred trucks every day. We're talking about more than a quarter million tons of food just --",

So, this is why we set up the situation room for better coordination. And, of course, there's a lot of focus on that too because, you know, you mentioned the phone call. Washington and Jerusalem, we do want the same things. We want to see Hamas eliminated. We want to all hostages returning home and in Gaza that will never pose a terror threat to Israel again.

In those movements, you also have to say, we're going to be here to there during this certain amount of time. So, if there's any delay in that, or if there are indicators that a non-government organization has terrorists within the convoy, then it kind of opens up the aperture a little bit on how you judge it.

And I got a chance to hear a part of your interview and your questions about Prime Minister Netanyahu, and allowing the money from the Qataris. And, you know, one of the things that Prime Minister Netanyahu has done is he's made statements for instance since the 1970s about being against a two-state solution. And so he was often playing Hamas against the Palestinian Authority so that neither one would have the political power or support to really demand and call for and make happen a two-state solution.
