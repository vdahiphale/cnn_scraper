And here it is later, clearly damaged. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: There had to have been some kind of an impact. I don't think, you know, well, the fuel spill on top of the -- on top of the aircraft on top of the MQ9 would have been as significant. I don't think it would have caused that damage. BERTRAND (voice-over): The newly declassified footage appears to directly contradict Russia's claim that the aircraft did not make physical contact. ANATOLY ANTOLOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S.: There was no collision. You see that the problem is that we didn't convict to this job.",

The eastern city is now home to a population of just 3,000 Ukrainians after one spot posting a population of more than 70,000. As CNN's David McKenzie reports, Russian back leaders say Ukraine's grip on the city is becoming more difficult, as one of the city's main roads faces significant and constant fire. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is a moment Ukrainian soldier downs a Russian jet near Bakhmut according to Ukrainian authorities. As both sides are publicly confident in their battle to control the city. With fewer than 3,000 civilians remaining, Bakhmut has been effectively destroyed amid the ongoing Russian offensive. But Ukrainians are unwilling to let go despite their heavy losses. PRES. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE (through translator): There was a clear position of the entire command, strengthen the sector and destroy the occupiers to the maximum. MCKENZIE (voice-over): To counter the onslaught, Ukraine needs equipment and ammunition. President Zelenskyy has long called for fighter jets. In a significant move today, Poland says it will provide several of its Soviet era MIG29 combat planes in the coming days. PRES. ANDRZEJ DUDA, POLAND (through translator): We will hand over four aircrafts to Ukraine, the remaining machines are being prepared and service for handover. MCKENZIE (voice-over): A move Ukraine hopes will inspire others to speed up their support. OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): It's particularly important to quickly provide Ukraine with the necessary ammunition. MCKENZIE (voice-over): For both sides, the situation on the frontline remains complicated. And troops from Russia's Wagner private military group have made very limited gains in the last week in Bakhmut. Gains that U.S. military officials say are coming at an enormous cost.",

In a letter released today, Governor Jared Polis writes, \"It is estimated that oil and gas extraction activities are responsible for almost half of total ozone in the Denver Metro area. These emissions have not yet been subject to actions that require steady measurable emissions reductions on a schedule commensurate with meeting our air quality challenges, and today, that will change,\" unquote. Governor Polis joins us now. Governor, thanks for joining us. What specifically are you demanding from the oil and gas industry? And do you have the legal standing to make that demand? GOV. JARED POLIS (D), COLORADO: So yes, we do. And essentially, what we're requiring is that oil and gas activities in most of our state where they occur, the Denver Metro region will have to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. That's the main precursor to ozone. Ozone is the main pollutant and air that causes, you know, coughing, makes asthma worse, it's particularly bad in summer. So we're going to reduce ozone emissions by about over 30 percent within just two years by 2025 in oil and gas industry. That technology exists today. Some oil and gas operators are ready to use it.
