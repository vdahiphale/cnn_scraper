China's ambassador to France sparks outrage suggesting former Soviet states don't exist. And what it's like to be a Palestinian reporter on Israeli TV. Unspeakable destruction and immense sadness. Those words coming from Norway's ambassador to Sudan, among the more than 1000, foreign diplomats evacuated from Khartoum. So, far fighting is raging on for a 10th day with no end in sight. After multiple broken ceasefires, diplomats from across the world are being airlifted out of the capital. Now, over the weekend, U.S. Special Operations Forces safely evacuated American embassy personnel. Sudanese civilians are making long and very difficult journeys by land and by boat to neighboring countries. And I want to bring in Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. We also have Sam Kiley in Djibouti for us where that was the first stop for many of those evacuated diplomats as well. We've got both Sam and Oren with us. Sam, I want to start with you. Djibouti is just one of the important exit routes which has been used by the U.S. to evacuate diplomats. I want you to tell me what you've been seeing and just how busy it's been over the last 24 hours.",

Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.:  But it's is impossible to ignore the giant elephant in the room, Russia. Russia, the convener of today's meeting invaded his neighbors in Ukraine and struck at the heart of the U.N. Charter. And Russia, time and time, again has violated universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, both outside and inside its own borders. That includes arbitrarily detaining political activists, journalists and opposition leaders, as well as the wrongful detention of American citizens. Right now, Paul Whelan, it's in a Russian penal colony simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. And right now, Evan Gershkovich is being wrongfully detained by the Russian government simply for doing his job as a respected journalist, as you are doing here today. Of course, Paul and Evan are also beloved friends, they're sons, they are brothers. There is a human cost to Russia's violation of international norms, to its barbaric practice of using people as political ponds. That cost is born by those detained but also by their family and friends as Paul's sister here with me today can attest to. Since the earliest days of this administration, we have sought to bring Paul Whelan home. As Secretary Blinken said recently, the United States has made a proposal, proposed release, and we urge Russia to move on that proposal. It's time to let Paul come home. In the meantime, we will not stop, we will not rest, and we will not relent until Paul, Evan and all hostages and wrongfully detained Americans are brought back safe and sound. Thank you very much. And with that I'd like to turn the floor over to Elizabeth.",

We've just heard from Antonio Guterres, but we are waiting to hear from Russia. Sergey Lavrov is going to be important.

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's pretty significant because it's the first time, as I understand it, forsome time that Sergey Lavrov has come to the United States, despite the fact that he is under sanctions. Much of the delegation or much of the -- many of the journalists that were meant to be traveling with him from Russia did not get their visas approved. And Sergey Lavrov has sharply criticized that decision by the U.S., not to issue all of the visas that the Russian Federation requested. And he said that we do not forget, and we do not forgive. And he, sort of, promised sort of unspecified consequences in response to that. But, you know, look -- I mean, Russia is the president, at the moment, of the Security Council, it's a rotating mechanism. And throughout the course of April, since it's held the presidency, Moscow has been using it as a platform to promote the kinds of narratives that it wants to promote, and to emphasize issues that it wants to emphasize. At the beginning of the month, it had a whole session on, for instance, the transfer of children from Ukraine to Russian territory. And the main Russian official responsible for that came along and appeared by video conference as the keynote speaker. She is indicted by the International Criminal Court and accused of, you know, basically child abduction by the ICC along with President Putin of Russia. Earlier in the month, there was a conference about arms control in which the Russians accused the United States and other western powers of abrogating their responsibilities to their treaties by flooding Ukraine with weapons. The U.S. had to point out that it was doing that simply because trying to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian invasion. And today, the session is about the U.N. Charter, it's about multilateralism, basically, about, you know, protecting the sovereignty of countries recognized by the U.N., which is, you know, obviously ironic, given that Russia is a country that has launched a war against its neighbor, Ukraine. And so, there's a lot of criticism that Sergey Lavrov has been allowed into Russia, first of all, though the United States, of course, have a responsibility to give him a visa under the U.N. agreements. And secondly, that Russia is the president of the Security Council at such a controversial time.",

Ambassador Greenfield, as well as, Paul Whelan's sister, Elizabeth Whelan. And she says, bring Paul home. The ambassador said that one of the most important things they will not rest until Paul and Evan Gershkovich come home. It is an important comment to make before the U.N. Security Council meeting. But you know, we've got to look at who's actually -- who yields the power right now. Because it seems that Russia is, sort of, dangling the grain deal as, perhaps, a way to get what it wants. The U.S., obviously, has a list of what it needs.",

It also, you know, has the chip, the bargaining chip, if you like, of Evan Gershkovich, that \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter who was taken into custody. I think it was last month, wasn't it? And accused of espionage, charges, by the way, that he and his paper both categorically deny.

And at the moment, the western powers are standing behind Ukraine's position. But nevertheless, this is a great platform for the Russians to issue that call for multilateralism.

It's set up a diplomatic firestorm in Europe when this Chinese ambassador to France basically questioned the legitimacy of former Soviet Republics in this French television interview. The Chinese embassy to France has since put out a statement on Monday, saying, \"Ambassador Lu Shaye's remarks on the question of Ukraine were not a statement of policy, but an expression of his personal opinion. They should not be the subject of over impersonation. China -- interpretation. China respects the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries.\" The statement goes on to say that China wants to play a role as a mediator, getting a political settlement in Russia's ongoing invasion and occupation of Ukraine. But it seems that the Chinese diplomat statements have already done some damage. The governments of three former Soviet Republics, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have all said that they're calling in Chinese officials to help clarify what this Chinese ambassador meant. The China -- the Lithuanian foreign minister has gone out and said that his government does not trust China to negotiate some kind of a settlement in Russia's war in Ukraine.
