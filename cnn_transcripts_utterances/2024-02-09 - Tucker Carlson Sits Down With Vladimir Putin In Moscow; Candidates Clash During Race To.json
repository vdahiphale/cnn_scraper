In fact, it was remarkable in the questions how phony they were, the outrageous falsehoods that were made not just about Russian-Ukrainian history, but frankly, about American politics as well. That went completely unchallenged.But amidst this two-hour essentially propaganda stunt for Vladimir Putin just over a month before his election is due in Russia in March, what did emerge of interest perhaps the one part that stood out was when he was asked about the Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, who's been, of course, incarcerated since March of last year, pre-detention that has been extended and extended. But, of course, this journalist could face 20 years in jail. Tucker Carlson did ask the Russian president about his fate. This was what he had to say.

In fact, specifically, the Russian president mentioned a Russian national who is currently serving a life sentence in a German jail for having killed a Chechen on the streets of Berlin in 2019, Vadim Krasikov. Now, you'll remember that at the time of Brittney Griner's release, it was Viktor Bout, a notorious Russian arms dealer that had been swapped for her release. And it could well be, we understand, that this particular Russian national that we understand had been part of Moscow's demands at the time of Brittney Griner's release may well prove to be the price of Evan Gershkovich's release. Certainly, some movement there and at least the hint of a glimpse of some hope for Evan's family and friends.",

PETER ZWACK, (RET) U.S. ARMY: Sara, this was a significant success I think for the Russian Putin's information operat trying to present a reasonable face. It gave them justification. He'd been pretty well shut off from much of what he would call the free-minded world, people would listen. But Carlson, just the spectacle of this visit, gave Putin a two hours op -- two-hour opportunity to transmit. And it comes as no surprise to me. I was in Moscow before the war, at a conference. And late at night in the hotel, there was Tucker Carlson on a interview in Russia talking about these things. He's a rock star there. And so, the Russians brought him in, and Putin played him. I don't think that Carlson expected to be, frankly, used the way he was. And Putin has used -- dominated 80 percent of the conversation. Also, the -- right before the war, if you remember, Putin published a treatise, kind of explaining Ukraine and Russia and how Ukraine had no right to exist. It was a real country.
