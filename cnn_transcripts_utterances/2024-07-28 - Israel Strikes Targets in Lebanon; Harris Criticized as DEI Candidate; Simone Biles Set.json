      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all of you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom.Israel's military hits Hezbollah targets after horrific attack in the Golan Heights. Republicans continue their verbal assault against the Democratic frontrunner, why calling Vice President Kamala Harris a DEI candidate could backfire on the GOP. And as the second day of Olympic competition gets underway, all eyes will be on the gymnast many call the greatest of all time. Israel is making good on its pledge to retaliate after Saturday's horrific rocket attack against the occupied Golan Heights. It says its warplanes hit Hezbollah targets deep inside Lebanon overnight, including weapons caches and what it describes as terrorist infrastructure. It all came after this attack, which was caught on video. Have a look. So, that's the moment when rockets hit the village of Mardal Shams on Saturday, killing at least 12 people and leaving 29 others wounded. Israel says many of the victims are children after a rocket hit a football field where they were playing. Israeli officials are pointing a finger at Hezbollah, which denies having anything to do with the strike. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is flying home from the U.S. at this hour and plans to convene his security cabinet as soon as he arrives. Now, we're also getting firsthand accounts of the horrific aftermath of the strike. As Jeremy Diamond reports from the scene, some victims were struck while they were literally meters away from safety. We are standing in a soccer field in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights where at 6:00 P.M. on Saturday evening this area was filled with children and young adults playing soccer on a hot summer evening. And that's the very moment when a rocket landed just right behind me here. 12 people were killed, children and young adults ranging between the ages of 10 and 20 years old. At least 29 other people were injured in what the Israeli military is calling the deadliest attack on civilians since October 7th. I spoke with one man who was in the area. His home is right nearby and he actually saw the rocket hit. Here's what he described to us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I saw it hit. I saw the kids panicking, running around. And that happened around 6And I just rushed straight here. I got here like two minutes later. And that's when I arrived to the scene.

We know the name of the guy who shot it. His name is Ali Mahmoud Yehia (ph). These rockets were made in Iran, Iranian rockets, 50 kilograms of a warhead. And it's time that we hit back.

More than 100 were reported wounded. One official at a nearby hospital says most of the victims treated there were women and children. Israel's military says it was targeting a Hamas command and control center inside the compound, but a Palestinian civil defense spokesperson says the school was sheltering more than 4,000 displaced civilians. We are now 100 days away from the U.S. presidential election, and a new CNN poll shows former President Donald Trump just three points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris nationwide, and that's within the poll's margin of error. On Saturday, Trump held a rally in Minnesota with his running mate, J.D. Vance. The state hasn't backed a Republican candidate in more than five decades. Now, during the rally, Trump lashed out at Kamala Harris, calling her worse than President Biden. Earlier in the day, Trump headlined a cryptocurrency event, where he once again slammed Harris. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This room is amazing, the people in this room, the high I.Q. individuals. I'm running against a low I.Q. individual, her. I'm not even talking about him, her. I got a low I.Q. individual. We have a country to run. The problem is that Kamala is worse than Joe. She's worse. She's a radical left lunatic, defund the police, all of the different things. And so far we're doing, she's got a little honeymoon going on right now, but when people hear about her -- and she's against crypto, by the way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I was [art of the South Asian women for Harris on call, raising, you know, over $280,000. Black women certainly led that charge and raised over $1.8 million.So, what we're seeing is actually mobilize a whole number of people who probably know this familiar attack, who know what it can do to you, especially can really get under your skin. And so I would say, I think that it's probably going to backfire. But I also want to -- I cannot underscore how we do have to be really careful as well, because it does stoke that level of like fear-based questioning of like this person be a candidate, you know, and raise these questions that really have nothing to do with their qualifications, accomplishments, and readiness to lead.",

I just want to give you a statistic. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, since 2023, 85 DEI -- anti-DEI bills that target programs at colleges have been introduced in 28 states and in Congress.

That is not a young, normal age, although thankfully the gymnasts are getting older just with the concerns about body and image and what have you and health with these athletes.But this is remarkable what we're seeing, just absolutely remarkable. Simone Biles coming back after the twisties three years ago in Tokyo. Many people remember, of course, all the difficulties that her honesty, her bravery, talking about the courage, talking about mental health issues. She's back. We've got the -- qualifying for the team competition. The U.S. is expected to win the gold, led by Simone Biles. Simone Biles is expected to win the women's individual all- around in a few days. And then, of course, there will be the event finals later on. She could pick up another three medals, probably gold, in those two if things go well. And, of course, that's the key issue here. As we saw with Ledecky last night, as we saw with Biles three years ago, sometimes they don't win, right? And the way they handle it can be so illuminating. And also such a positive, you know, image and role model opportunity for those athletes. So, Simone Biles again, greatest of all time, and you get a chance to see her again doing it as well as anyone has ever done gymnastics. It's truly a remarkable, extraordinary day in the Olympic Games to be able to have her back and competing and looking so good in these -- as she starts her competition.",
