You need to get right to it. But you need to establish your themes, and you need to set expectations as it were. So the prosecution is going to argue -- first of all, their theme is that this is not about just hush money or business records. This is about an effort to steal the 2016 election, and they need to give an outline and overview of their case. But they also need to brace the jury. You're going to hear from someone -- one person in particular, who's done some bad things and sustained some serious convictions. That is Michael Cohen. They need to address that head-on and say, but you should believe him now. And here's why.",

The first thing that any defendant does, any defense lawyer in any opening, is remind the jury 38 times, they bear the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We don't have to prove anything to you. And they're also going to rip into Michael Cohen. They say they're going to ask you to send this guy -- well, the jury doesn't sentence. They're going to ask you to convict this guy based on the word of a person who has lied to every single branch of our federal government. And I think they're going to set in the jury's mind, this is an unreliable case based on unreliable witnesses. So it'll be fascinating to see how they do it.

That, in and of itself, was a compelling message in the 2020 campaign and was effective. So I think that's good. I also think it reflects the reality, and it sort of goes to what Matt was saying, that either way don't think this trial is going to be decisive in the campaign. Now, I don't think it's good for Donald Trump, to be clear. I don't think it's good when the backdrop of your campaign is a courtroom. I don't think this is helping him.

But the short answer to your question is no. Hell no. I would not take the stand. I would not advise him to take the stand. There's no reason for him to take the stand. It's incredibly risky. Like I said before, the prosecution bears the burden of proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Anyone who takes the stand is taking an enormous risk. I know on TV, everyone takes the stand, because it's dramatic. It's quite rare in the real world. Here, if you're Donald Trump, I mean, look, it would just be a disaster. He -- if you get caught in a contradiction as a defendant taking the stand, it's over. If you get caught in a lie, if the jury doesn't like you, it's over. So I would beg, plead, urge him.

And over 70 million people under this frost or freeze alerts that blanket much of the Eastern U.S. Not many locations, necessarily, below freezing. We're hovering just above it. But of course, for sensitive plants, that could be a problem. So if you are watching this morning, first and foremost, thank you. But maybe you can get out there, because the coldest part of our morning is still occurring right now. Maybe you'll want to cover up those plants. [06:25:04] Look at this. This is going to continue. We're talking about 56 percent of the lower 48's population will experience temperatures this week below 40 degrees. Yes, that's chilly, well below average for this time of year. We'll start to rebound those temperatures later in the week. But the main culprit: this high-pressure system that is causing the clear and cool weather. Personally for this weatherman, I like it. It brings back the sunshine. The only real rain now across the Florida Peninsula. We watch an advancing cold front that'll bring some showery weather to the upstate New York and Northern New England. And then we focus our attention on Friday. Late in the week, we have the potential for more severe weather developing. Of course, we'll keep you ahead of that -- Kasie. Back to you.",
