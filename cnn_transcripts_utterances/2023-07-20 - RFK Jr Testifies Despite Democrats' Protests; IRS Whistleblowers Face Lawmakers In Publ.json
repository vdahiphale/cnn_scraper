But can tell you with certainly that Mr. Kennedy has made comments that Jewish and Asian groups have described as such.He recently claimed, as you went over, that Covid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people and people who are most immune are actually Jews and Chinese. Here's how the CEO of the American Jewish Committee responded. He said, \"Robert Kennedy Jr's assertion that Covid was genetically engineered to spare Jewish and Chinese people is deeply offensive and incredibly dangerous. \"Every aspect of his comments reflect some of those abhorrent anti- Semitic conspiracy theories throughout history and contributes to today's dangerous rise of anti-Semitism.\" And groups fighting anti-Asian hate also described this nonsense as hateful and offensive. And Kennedy was previously denounced by Jewish groups for the other comment you heard here, the one about Anne Frank. It's a truly ludicrous comparison. It was last year. He was attacking vaccine mandates. He said that, quote, \"Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did.\" Anne Frank, of course, was murdered by the Nazis. More than six million Jews murdered by the Nazis. Kennedy was denounced by both the Auschwitz Museum and Memorial and the U.S. Holocaust Museum for this. And he eventually apologized. So I'm not sure what he's denying now. He admitted he made the comments and he apologized for them.",

Yesterday, two IRS whistleblowers went before the House Oversight Committee and alleged that Hunter Biden got special treatment from the Justice Department as it investigated the president's son. We had Republican Congressman Pete Sessions, who is a member of that committee, on the program and he made a false claim responding to a question that I asked him about the U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, who was appointed by then-President Trump, kept on in his role by President Joe Biden, and has now brought tax and gun charges against Hunter Biden.

      "sentences": "No he didn't. No, David Weiss did not correct himself each and every time in the three letters he sent.There was no follow-up letter where Weiss corrected himself and said he did not have that ability, as Sessions said. In fact, Weiss reaffirmed his authority in his letters to Republican members of Congress, who were seeking information about the Hunter Biden probe, which was then and is still an ongoing criminal investigation. June 7th, in response to a letter that Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, wrote, Weiss said, quote, \"I want to make clear, as the attorney general has stated, I have been granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges.\" Jim Jordan responding, saying Weiss' response was, in a nutshell, insufficient. And June 30th, Weiss responded with more detail, reiterating his earlier statement and saying that he was assured that he would be granted the necessary authority in the District of Columbia, the Central District of California, or any other district where charges could be brought in this matter. On July 10th, responding to an inquiry from Senator Lindsey Graham, he disputed whistleblower claims that he requested special counsel status. Quote, \"I have not requested special counsel designation.\" And once again, he asserted his authority and said that he had, quote, \"never been denied the authority to bring charges in any jurisdiction.\" After the show, I followed up with Sessions' office and am still awaiting an on-the-record comment about why the congressman misrepresented U.S. attorney David Weiss' communications with Congress. There are legitimate questions about how foreign entities or outside groups use money to try to influence those who are close to politicians. That's why Obama White House officials raised concerns about Hunter Biden's activities towards the end of the Obama administration. But Republicans broadly are already facing criticism for inconsistency, their fixation on the actions of the president's son without proving any link to the president himself. And while turning a blind eye to the at least ethically questionable behavior Trump family members and the former president himself as they benefitted financially from his presidency and continue to do so as he runs for the White House yet again. Because if this is really about getting to the facts, you don't lie about them. Boris?",

Authorities say a gunman killed two people at a construction site where he worked. The suspect later found dead after a police shootout. Officials say there's no known connection to the tournament, which began as scheduled this morning. Also, contract negotiations are set to resume next week as more than 300,000 UPS workers prepare for a potentially historic strike. Experts say a walkout of that size could cause supply chain issues. It could cost the economy billions. Both sides say 95 percent of the deal has been reached, including UPS agreeing to give drivers air conditioning. You heard that right. But there are key disagreements around worker pay. Officials in Pennsylvania say they will try to resume their search for two missing siblings who were swept away in a flashflood. And 2-year- old Mattie Sheils and her 9-month-old brother, Conrad, went missing Saturday in the deadly flooding roughly an hour north of Philadelphia. Rough weather conditions this morning forced police to call of their search for a second day. But just a short time ago, they did announce that the search is back on. Boris?",

We know that police used GPS to figure out that she still traveled another 600 yards, six football fields, before coming to a stop. So, they made the point of saying, if she was looking for a child, how could that happen? Then they went into what she was searching on the Internet, from \"Taken,\" to how to steal from work.

So, there are questions after all the man hours that were spent looking for this young lady. You've got to think, more than 50 officers, you had community members, you had a drone in the air, you had a canine unit from a neighboring police township trying to find her. And all the Internet and the money that was put forth for someone to try to find this young lady. And all of this, the story did not add up. The parents were on television begging for her return. And now we have all the questions and the fact that she has not talked to police after they requested to talk with her one more time. So many questions in this. The Internet search, and searching \"Taken\" stood out in a lot of people's minds. This is something that a lot of people want to know what happened and why. We just don't know right now.",
