That means Biden judicial nominees are in limbo. And Feinstein's absence would complicate other big challenges coming up, like the debt ceiling fight and filling a Biden Cabinet vacancies.And so, there are more Democratic calls for Senator Feinstein to resign. Close allies, though, say she hopes to return soon and deserves more courtesy. The Senator has been absent since early March. Our great reporters are back at the table. That's a tough one. She's an icon in the Democratic Party. She's a legend in California. She's a trailblazing woman in the United States Senate. But, but the President's agenda is on hold here. One of my questions is now that it's crystal clear, Republicans will not give you the votes, is at some point, is the President of the United States going to have to call his former friend -- his good friend and former Senate colleague out in California and say, I need you here or I need you to go? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: It would, though, expose one of the more sensitive sort of issues that the White House often faces, which is the President's own age, which polling had shown is on the minds of Americans throughout the country. In previous whether -- situations with tensions and -- among the Democratic Party in Congress, whether it be with congressional negotiations over legislations or what have you, the White House stance has always been to send top White House staffers, whether it be Senior Adviser Steve Ricchetti, whether it be Louisa Terrell as well to the Hill and at least publicly say that Biden would take a step back. This has got to be something to watch, though, because as you noted, this involves one of the issues, one of the things in that being judicial appointments that the White House has celebrated for the past six months. So it will be something to watch.",

Just look at these numbers. 119 Biden federal nominees to the federal bench confirmed by the Senate. So far, only one approved by the Judiciary Committee to get it to the Senate floor since Feinstein has been out. So it puts that process on hold.We're a week or a month away from the debt ceiling showdown. The President's Labor Secretary resigned to take a new job. They need to replace somebody in the Cabinet. So Democrats have 51, absent Feinstein so they have 50. We went through this with the Biden agenda when, you know, when it was 50-50, again, at what point?",

And then other people, though, skeptically, will say, well, if she's coming back soon, then why are we working so hard to replace her on the Judiciary Committee?So I think privately, a lot of senators on the Democratic side don't think that she's coming back anytime soon. And I think they're going to -- they're willing to give it a few more weeks because, like you said, she is an icon up there, a trailblazer. But we will probably hear more calls for her to step aside in the next few weeks as this queue of judges continues to back up.

Instead, Gershkovich will stay behind bars at the notorious Lefortovo Prison in Moscow to await his trial, or after the decision. His lawyers spoke about how he's holding up inside, reading classic Russian novels, once said, and watching cooking shows. The U.S. ambassador, though, was much more critical, saying how troubled she was at seeing what she called an innocent journalist in these circumstances and calling on Russia to set him free. Meanwhile, there are new concerns being expressed about another prominent prisoner being held in a Russian jail. Lawyers for Alexey Navalny, the anticorruption campaigner serving an 11 and a half year prison sentence now say, he's been beaten up in his jail cell and separately, he's facing more criminal charges.
