I'm Fredricka Whitfield.There is a new round of talks today between striking auto workers and representatives from two of the big three carmakers. The historic strike is now entering its third full day. Today's talks are expected to be with Ford and General Motors. The UAW said it had \"reasonably productive talks\" when it met with Ford yesterday. And for the first time ever, workers are striking at plants from GM, Ford and Stellantis all at the same time. Workers say they want big pay raises and other benefits after years of concessions during rough times for the industry. The carmakers say despite big profits in recent years, the raises being demanded would drive them out of business. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is at a Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan. Vanessa, what are we learning about, the talks and whether anyone there on the picket line is at all optimistic?",

He also said that he is rejecting offers of 20 percent, these are the historic offers that the big three say they're making, rejecting those. He wants to see 40 percent in wage increases over the next four years of this contract. I want to bring in Cheryl Webb-Williams. She's actually one of these 600 workers that was impacted in terms of Ford laying 600 people off because of the ripple effect, because some union members here were told to go on strike. Sheryl, I want to ask you, you know where negotiations stand. You know what the union is asking for. You know what the automakers have put on the table. What do you think is a fair place to end up in these negotiations? CHERYL WEBB-WILLIAMS, FORD EMPLOYEE: I think Shawn Fain did a great job starting high because you leave room for negotiations.

As a general principle, do you think it is fair that the CEO of General Motors makes 362 times what a typical GM employee makes?MIKE PENCE, U.S. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, let met me say what I don't think is fair, is that Joe Biden has put forward an economic agenda from the very outset that launched the worst inflation in 40 years. I mean, literally, the cost- of-living has gone up almost 17 percent since we left office. Their war on energy has caused gasoline prices to go through the roof, and I have to doubt in my mind that all those hard-working auto workers are living in the same reality every other American is living in, and that is wages are not keeping up with inflation. I also think that this green agenda that is using taxpayer dollars to drive our automotive economy into electric vehicles is understandably causing great anxiety among UAW members. These guys are seeing the green new deal that -- you know, that was passed under the guise of an Inflation Reduction Act, you're seeing it driving their industry into electric vehicles, benefiting China that makes most of our batteries. And I think they're pushing back rightly.

But what we are hearing from the international teams that have been working on this for days now is that this has become a near impossible mission. They say that -- one team told us that they were able to recover more than 60 bodies since they got here. But right now, they are not able to do this anymore. This one team says they spotted the bodies of about 300 people. But the conditions are so challenging out there for them, they say that they don't have the right equipment to reach these really hard to reach areas, coves where these bodies have ended up, shallow waters where the boats can't go and they just don't have the equipment and the expertise, the man power to deal with a situation like this. And what they're telling us is while they did spot these bodies over the past couple of days, right now, those bodies have disintegrated into remains that they just cannot reach, they cannot retrieve because of the health hazard, and this is absolutely devastating for the so many families, survivors here in Derna who we've been speaking to, who have told us all they want is to find the bodies of their loved ones or their remains to give them a proper burial.

He's expected to meet with President Zelenskyy, who will be in the U.S. for the United Nations General Assembly. Biden will also meet with Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and this will be their first face-to- face meeting since Netanyahu returned to office. Netanyahu has not received an invitation to the White House since his return to power. Let me bring in now Joel Rubin. He is the former deputy assistant secretary of state under President Obama and he's also seeking the Democratic nomination for Congress in Maryland's Sixth District. Good to see you, Joel. So, let's start with Netanyahu. Why his meeting with President Biden will be so important and what would be the focus of their conversations, do you think? JOEL RUBIN (D), FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, Fredricka, it's a significant meeting on many levels. First and foremost, Israel is a close American ally, but there's a message here now that President Biden has with Prime Minister Netanyahu that he needs to share, which is that he needs to share which is that he is very concerned about Israel's democracy being pushed in the wrong direction by the prime minister. And so, that's why this meeting is going to be up in New York and it's going to be a tough discussion. There also some positive discussion points that the president is going to be engaging in related to possible normalization with Saudi Arabia, questions about the Palestinians within a possible deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. So, there's a lot on the plate. But I think the core message is that the president is deeply committed to Israel and he really wants to look at Prime Minister Netanyahu in the eye and say, say, look, you know, you have to straighten out what's happening domestically in Israeli. The Israeli people clearly are not happy with the direction of where the prime minister is taking judicial issues in their country.",

And if there are no funds proved in this fiscal year coming up, we're coming up to the deadline in a couple of weeks, that could ensnare Ukraine aid as well.And so, it's very important for President Zelenskyy to try to make his pitch and say, keep this focus going, keep supporting this supplemental, for example, that the president sent forward. We can't delay aid to Ukraine. We can't be the ones who undermine Ukraine's ability to continue its offensive, and I hope that domestic politics doesn't get in the way of this.

So, that makes any disaster relief, any international assistance incredibly challenging. We've seen North Africa and Morocco, for example, and in Turkey with the earthquake earlier in the year, functioning governments that we could work with to provide assistance.But the timing from an international response perspective could be fortuitous? And that there is the U.N. General Assembly this week in New York, a lot of important discussions could take place about extending packages of support and we're going to have to see in any ways outside of government relief efforts be advanced and that means through nongovernmental organizations and that's really a very short- term survival mode. There has to be work to get political reconciliation in Libya. That is been an ongoing challenge for years. Absent that, we're going to see Band-Aid approaches going forward and the poor suffering of the Libyan people. You know, I'm glad you mentioned this way. It is just -- it is devastating to watch. This should not be happening. The manmade impact and the floods compounded by the manmade impact of failed governance, it's really devastating. And so, the U.N., the international community has a role to play in resolving all of the these issues but in the near term, there's very much can be a band-aid approach until a greater international cooperation can come in and provide a package.

You're here with us now. I mean, close call for that, gentleman. But talk us through, Officer Brian, exactly what happened? It was the point of view of your body cam video that all of that was happening. So here this sudden rainfall comes in Atlanta and it catches people by surprise because it came with such force and throughout the city there were flooded areas. At what point, did you realize or hear that the street right outside of your headquarters what so inundated with water there would be a driver there in his vehicle stuck? OFC. RAYANADO BRYAN, ATLANTA POLICE: So, I was traveling on Peachtree heading to another call when I noticed the stalled vehicle. At that point, I didn't know there was anybody in the vehicle at that time. The water, I was -- parked the car there to make sure no other vehicle gets stuck in that area. Within a space of seconds, it just started seeing the car started to drift.
