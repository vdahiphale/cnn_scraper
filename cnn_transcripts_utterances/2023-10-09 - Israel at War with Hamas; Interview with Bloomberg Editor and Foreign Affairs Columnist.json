Hamas has shown a much greater capability than anybody had given them -- the -- anyone was aware that they could put together. So, that needs to be severely degraded.There's talk of decapitating Hamas. I'm a little skeptical about that because it's a multiheaded beast. You don't know where the head is, who is head is at any one time, and what you would qualify -- what Israel would consider to be the head of Hamas. I mean, quite a lot of the political leadership is in Turkey, not even in Gaza. If Israel went in with land forces, it would go in to try and engage as many fighters as it could possibly do so and take them out. Whatever Israeli intelligence has on the current leadership of those fighters in Gaza, they will want to take them out. The obvious complication being that there will be hundreds of thousands of ordinary civilian Palestinians, and now possibly more than 100 hostages, possibly including some Americans nationals. And so, that is a complicating factor that really is hard for the Israeli planners to game out. I mean, the Israelis have gamed out almost every scenario that the four of us at this table can imagine with -- to do with Gaza. They've had people gaming this out for years now. But this, with this many civilian hostages on the ground, I'm not sure they gamed out this one. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN THIS MORNING CO-ANCHOR:  All right. To Johnson, Bobby, Christiane, we appreciate your expertise, as always. Thanks very much, guys. President Biden throwing his full support behind Israel, but the war is happening as the U.S. House didn't even have a full-time speaker. How can Congress get started on sending aid?

What is your understanding in terms of your conversations either with your colleagues on Capitol Hill or with the administration about where things stand right now.REP. MIKIE SHERRILL (D-NJ), ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  Thanks so much for having me. As I spent last night with hundreds of members of the Jewish community here in New Jersey, many with very close ties to family and friends in Israel, many who have lost a loved one in the attacks. I can also tell you that the attorney general of New Jersey is very aware of the situation, has put out extra support for our synagogues, our mosque, our places of worship. However, he did say last night that there were no credible threats right now, but we are continuing to monitor the situation to make sure that people who are very concerned about it here are kept safe. And then, moving forward, we are getting back into session tomorrow.

That situation is under control here.What we have seen on the highway driving down here today, we've seen some of that heavy military armor. In fact, there's some part -- well, I shouldn't go into details about the dispensation of military equipment, but we have seen some on the highway and some relatively close by. And we have seen as well troops moving in this direction towards Gaza as well. Not huge numbers, but when we add that up with what we saw when we were up in the early hours of this morning, late into yesterday evening, and into the night yesterday, it is very clear there's a lot more -- there's a lot more tanks. A lot more howitzers, heavy mechanized howitzers. Those big guns that can maneuver around and fire artillery shells at long distance. Armored personnel carriers and additional troops coming in here. The security checkpoints are very tight. There's a high degree of concern again making sure these areas are controlled.

There is mass indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas. And frankly we're watching that unfold right now as well. The policy is essentially to punish the entire Palestinian population. Cutting off electricity to all of Gaza. Preventing anybody in Gaza from coming in and out. This is an act of collective punishment. And this is exactly the trajectory that we are unfortunately are on. I think what we're going to see is much greater death that's going to cover the entire Gaza Strip. And at the end of it, Palestinians are going to remain a population that is captive and under an illegal siege as recognized by the U.N. And we're only setting ourselves up towards another round of this in the future. What we need right now is the world community to come together and start dealing with this issue seriously. Understanding that this policy of giving Israel a carte blanche to behave however it wants towards Palestinians is not way to actually achieve long-lasting peace. You can't keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. The one thing that has not been tried so far is allowing Palestinians to be free of Israeli occupation and military dictatorship. And until we start taking Palestinian grievance seriously, until Israel starts seeing Palestinians as equal human beings who are deserving of the same human rights and decency and dignity that Israelis enjoy, I'm afraid we're going to be in stuck in this situation for a very, very long time.",
