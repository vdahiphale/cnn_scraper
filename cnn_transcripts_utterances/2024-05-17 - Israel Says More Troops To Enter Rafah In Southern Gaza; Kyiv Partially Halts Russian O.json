This happened during a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Austin. Attorneys for Daniel Perry say he was acting in self-defense, but prosecutors say it was Perry who drove his car into a crowd of protesters and initiated the altercation with Foster. Foster was legally carrying an assault-style rifle that night during the protest and attorneys for Perry say that Foster pointed the gun at him and that's what caused him to shoot several times killing Foster that night. But prosecutors also say -- pointed to social media attacks that Perry had gone into the crowd that night looking for an altercation saying at one point he had written to someone \"Might kill a few people on my way to work tonight\". And that Black Lives Matter protesters were -- compared them to a quote, \"zoo full of monkeys\". The reaction to this pardon, has been intense. Governor Abbott says that the stand your ground laws in Texas are the strongest in the country and it cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive district attorney. That D.A. in Austin criticized the governor today. He's saying he should be ashamed and that he's put politics over justice and made a mockery of the legal system. Garrett Foster's family and girlfriend have also been quick to condemn the governor's pardon saying that -- the girlfriend saying that the governor has declared that citizens can be killed with impunity as long as they hold political views that are different from those in power. And Garrett Foster's mother's attorney says, she is shocked by this pardon, as well. But attorneys for Daniel Perry say he is thrilled and elated to be out prison.
