And yet, they kept this narrative going that this was a very confusing situation and that the police did the best they could. But when you start peeling things back and looking at everything that investigators had gathered the day after, the day after that, you really start to see that they weren't so forthcoming and honest about the actions of the police in the coming days. And that's why the families are going to be calling for Steve McCraw to resign. Others are calling for the director of the Department of Public Safety to resign because they just feel there's been no transparency and people have not been honest about what happened here.",

The FBI has studied it. Homeland Security has studied it. We have psychologists and psychiatrists, and threat assessment experts. And as a result of this, I convened a commission on preventing gun violence, though we're really not talking about guns because -- though that is critical, it's not something that I have any power to do anything about. However, we do know there are signs. We just need to inform the public. And what really strikes me is so -- is one of the most upsetting things is not only do we continue to see this far too often, but so often it is the same sort of events.
