      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the final deadline of the week that shook up the world. All 19 men and women charged in a criminal conspiracy to subvert the election have surrendered in Georgia, including the former President. Plus, the mug shot on front pages everywhere. In the merch, Donald Trump wants everyone to buy. His campaign is hocking T-shirts, mugs, bumper stickers and everything in between stamped with a picture for the ages. And a chance at a breakthrough debate for Donald Trump's rivals gets eclipsed by the former President's fourth indictment. I am Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and inside politics.Right now, the Georgia case and a new form of presidential portrait. We are seconds past a noon deadline in Fulton County, Georgia. All 19 defendants charged in the criminal conspiracy to undermine the 2020 election showed up as demanded and submitted to the process. That, of course, includes Donald Trump, and the mug shot seen around the world. Go to a newsstand in his former hometown, for example, you can't miss it. The Wall Street Journal under the headline \"Trump booked\". The New York Post \"Let the mug shot speak for itself\", and the more liberal New York Daily News brands Mr. Trump an enemy of democracy. The former President also returned to Twitter, the platform formerly known as Twitter, whatever we're calling it these days, for the first time in 959 days, a tweet with his new tagline, a link to his website, with his mug shot, of course. And the last week before that was from two days after the insurrection. We start with CNN's Katelyn Polantz who is in Atlanta. Katelyn, it's probably pretty quiet there at this point, as everybody has surrendered.",

      "sentences": "It is, on one front, but we have a lot of moving parts still, Dana, in this case, this sprawling case against 19 defendants. As of now, all of the defendants have been arrested. There is one that is remaining in jail. There is a possibility he is going to be detained for a bit longer because he doesn't have a bond agreement like all of the others had. So, they could get into the jail, arrested and out just like Donald Trump did as well last night. But, as this case moves forward, where we are today is that there are a lot of options that these criminal defendants have, Trump included. But, what we're watching for is splits between them, essentially. One defendant did get a trial date set last night. He asked for a speedy trial. That was attorney Ken Chesebro, who was part of the group that was plotting out this plan that Trump used to overturn or to try to overturn the election results. Chesebro got what he wanted, a speedy trial, which he had asked for, and a judge had set the date yesterday for October 23. Really a quick turnaround. That would be a trial just for him. We're not exactly sure if that date will hold. They often do move.But, Donald Trump does not want to go to trial anytime soon. And so, you're going to see him start to distance himself from defendants that want something different from him. The other thing that's happening, Dana, is that we have these federal court proceedings where individuals who had some sort of affiliation with the federal government, either worked for Trump or were fake electors, are starting to ask federal judges, move my case out of state court because I was acting as a federal official at the time or I was acting at Donald Trump's direction, another thing to watch for that defendants might be saying, as we had forward in this case.

And because I have three attorneys at the table, this is not going to surprise you, because you probably don't all agree on how this case will go. We've seen a lot of commentary from others who are on different sides of kind of the strategy here. One criminal defense attorney, his name is Jack Cunha, he just spoke in the Wall Street Journal. He said about this case. \"They'd say that there may have been a similar goal that Trump remain President, but there was no coordination. They're going to say this isn't the mafia or a street gang. They'll say this is just hardball politics.\"MICHAEL MOORE, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, &amp; PARTNER, MOORE HALL IN ATLANTA: I think that's a fair point, I mean, frankly, going in at this stage. And the question, ultimately, for the trial is going to be whether or not we're criminalizing both legal advice and political strategy. And I'm not suggesting that this was a criminal. I'm just saying that I think will be the defense at the end of the day. And it will be that this was not an effort by all of these people acting in concert for this one thing. It may be that they were acting in concert, or at least acting to protect the interest of their party at the time and to make sure that they remained in power. But, was this concerted or controlled at the top? And so, that's always the question. Trump has been a master throughout his time of stay and removed, sort of from the wrong side of the \"versus\" mark up until recently. He has s always kept somebody in between him and the jailhouse, whether that be a lawyer, that'd be an aide, somebody else. And so, the question will be, here, can the prosecutors put his fingerprints on the facts of this case enough to make it so?",

It's a broader statute. So, from a legal standpoint, they'll know this is an issue. They are going to try to use during the application, but probably not based on that. I think that assumes the level of actual sophistication among the jurors. They go. You shouldn't use RICO cases in anything but the mafia. Their challenge is, as Michael was pointing out, really connecting the dots to these masterminds, because it's not looking like a violent crime enterprise. So, you do have to connect those dots.But, as a legal matter, I don't think that's going to be tough. The real challenge for them is the logistics of having that many defendants in the case.",

This iconic photo now in American history, it's so intriguing that it really encapsulates, I think, where we are in politics right now, because it's not just Donald Trump who is selling merch on this and raising money on this and his allies. The Democrats are doing so as well. The House campaign arm for the Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, put out a fundraising appeal featuring the mug shot.So, it just is this moment where you saw Democrats last night gleeful, thinking it sort of validated their arguments against Donald Trump for the last eight years, and you see the Trump MAGA universe, as Gloria said, using it to say how victimized they are here and a rallying cry for more and more support to galvanize around the former President.
