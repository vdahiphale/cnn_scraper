We also know, as you mentioned, that he will also be meeting with families of the victims of 9/11. And we've heard him on the campaign trail often say that it was September 11th and those terrorist attacks that day that prompted him to join the military. That that's what caused him to go into military service. He served as a jag in the navy for several years.And we also know that during the first debate in Milwaukee, his wife, Casey DeSantis Sara had a son of a 9/11 victim as one of her special guest at the debate. So, this is something that he does talk about. And we will see him with more people today as these events continue. As you mentioned, we also expect to see Vivek Ramaswamy who has floated some conspiracy theories about 9/11, who will be taking part in a memorial event later today. And Former Vice President Mike Pence, he's actually in Iowa today, but we know that he's going to be taking part in several events there in Iowa as he commemorates this very somber event. And of course, as a former vice president, he took part in those events when he was in office for those four years as well, Sara.",

A Summit that focused in part on countering China's influence where he feels that -- the administration feels they saw some real diplomatic wins there.

Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It was a win for Russia and China, they're celebrating today. I mean, what we should have had was Biden should have really pushed hard to acknowledge what he acknowledged a year ago, that Russia invaded a pro-American freedom-loving country. And that's a fact. And to deny a fact a year later is giving a win to Russia, and China is gloating because they're looking at Taiwan as this is happening, and it's a shame. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I want to look at the august approval ratings in August of the third year the presidency since 1955. Look at where Biden is. Look at this, 39 percent, that is the second worst on record at this point. Only Jimmy Carter back in 1979 had a worse approval rating. Of course, he went on to lose reelection to Ronald Reagan. Donald Trump was right near Joe Biden at 40 percent, of course, he lost reelection to Joe Biden. And then Ronald Reagan at 43 percent, he of course, blew everything else. So, thing can change as we go -- look going forward.But I want to note, why is it such a big deal that Joe Biden's approval rating is so low at this particular point? And it's because, normally elections involving incumbents are referendums. So, was your 2004 and 2012 vote for president more about the feelings towards the incumbent or the challenger? Look back in 2004. Overwhelmingly more about the incumbent, 62 percent. Look at 2012, 58 percent more about the incumbent. So, as the White House looks at this low approval ratings for Joe Biden and they, sort of, analyze like myself look at them, you say, oh my goodness, that low approval rating normally election is about the incumbent.",

Norm, I want to read you part of the judge's decision here in the Mark Meadows' because this could leave a mark going forward. The judge ruled that, even if Meadows took on tasks that mirrored the duties that he carried out when acting his official role as White House Chief of Staff, such as attending meetings, scheduling phone calls, and managing the president's time, he has also failed to demonstrate how the election-related activities that serve as the basis for the charges in the indictment are related to any of his official acts.They did not pertain to his job of chief of staff. It was campaign work. How will that color to use a legal term that appeared in this ruling? How will that color the other people who want to try to move their cases to federal court? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER HOUSE JUDICIARY SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP'S FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, AND FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS CZAR:  John, if it's political, you don't get to go to federal court. You only get to remove if its official. The judge has pretty definitively said that this complex of activities, that are the subject of Fani Willis' indictment, were political. Not official. So, it's fatal, I think, to Donald Trump's effort to get to federal court. Jeffrey Clark, some of the so-called fake electors. But it's more than that because this is also the core issue in the liability case. Was this merely aggressive political and legal move? Or was it so far beyond the pale (ph) that there is criminal liability?
