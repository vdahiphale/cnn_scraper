We are following a terrifying story from Baltimore, Maryland today. The Key Bridge, part of a major highway around the city, collapsed just a few hours ago after being struck by a large cargo ship. You can see it there on the right side of your screen. You're looking at live pictures of the scene as well as video of the moment when that massive bridge partially collapsed. A search and rescue operation is ongoing right now. Now, this collision happened in the middle of the night in Baltimore, which thankfully meant that there were not too many cars on the bridge, but there were several. Officials say a number of vehicles fell into the river. We understand two people have been pulled from the water. They survived. Officials say they are looking for at least seven others.

And you can see, if you look, some police boats clearly in the water. That's what those flashing lights are. And as we push in on that container ship, those are chunks of the key bridge mangled in the water. At least one of them strewn across the deck of that ship that's still sitting there in the river as rescuers are around it, trying to find anyone who might be alive in the water. As you mentioned, officials have said they're searching for at least seven people, but they don't know the exact number. But this is a long bridge, a wide river from our vantage point. You can see clearly a huge chunk of it. That's gone, Sara. The gap between the two sides. It maybe is a half mile long. It's hard to tell from our view. But look, they have shut down both sides of the bridge as this rescue is underway. This is about as close as we could get. But it is stunning to see what was the key bridge, an extremely important route not just for people who live in Baltimore, but anyone who travels the so-called the sell a corridor between Washington and New York. This is over interstate. This is Interstate 695. It is really a highly trafficked road. There are going to be implications there in the hours, days, months ahead. But right now, the focus is on this urgent search for any possible survivors who could still be in this choppy water. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's an old saying in maritime operations that go safe passage requires local knowledge. But we do know that they had those on board. So they're going to be looking at what was going on the ship. And then, in U.S. bridge collapses quite often over water. That is what happens is a ship or a barge hits the bridge, but often there's a secondary issue, and that is how old is the bridge and what was the construction of the bridge? How was the bridge fastened to it stage. Was there work going on in the bridge?

Or, two, they have a ship malfunction. Something happened with the controls, something happened with the rudder, with the various thrusters, you know, the bower or the other thrusters on the ship to help really do the fine tuning and the steerage and that's often a concern. You know, there have been stories in the past about ships where the, you know, the commanders were incapacitated for various reasons. But that doesn't appear to be the case here because the ship stopped. Apparently the ship did call for, you know, did report the emergency. And that will be an issue too.

Look, they already know a lot. They already -- that there's individuals on the boat who are probably who have explained what has happened. Did they lose capacity of controlling the ship? There would be a what we, you know, what we call like a harbor master, someone on the ship helping it get through this area. There is sonar, there is radar, there's GPS systems that are all monitoring the boat as normal course of business. So there's already a lot of information known.

They regularly talk to the crew after something like this. They give them a little period of cool down, but they don't want much time to go by because essentially they don't want their memory to be filled with something else. They want to be able to remember the incident very clearly. Also, investigators will want to speak to witnesses. And if they can get to anybody who was on board the bridge at the time, anybody who was driving at the time, any witnesses who were on shore. This is a very, very populated area when it comes to the business of the port. And so there may be people on the shore who were able to see this take place from different vantage points than cameras have. And so, witness accounts will be really important. There are so many angles for them to go down. And this is really only just now starting. Right now, the search is really the big concern, and we can hear the helicopters overhead now with the advantage of daylight to be able to see the banks of the Patapsco River, to see the center of the river to make sure that nobody else is still in the river. If this happened in the summertime, or when it is a little bit warmer, there may be other boats nearby who could have efforted a bit of a search as well. But we all know that this happened at one in the morning. The port is not very busy at that time. The river is not very busy at that time. So this does sort of complicate things as well and may have sort of hampered the search efforts here. But we're just now sort of learning the initial details.

But they also acknowledged that it was potentially something that he was playing more to a domestic audience. He's under huge domestic pressure, and maybe that was his reasoning. But what we understand at this point is that there will be, this meeting between Yoav Gallant and Lloyd Austin. So the two defense secretaries will be meeting. We know that in the meeting yesterday with the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, that they had brought up what they were intending to bring up with the delegation that has now been canceled namely, alternatives to what the Israelis want to do in Rafah, which is a massive ground offensive in an area where there's well over 1 million Palestinians sheltering at this point. And also, of course, it's the key land crossing for humanitarian aid. So this is likely to be a key message that will be given. Officials telling us that they will still get their message across and they will still be able to give the alternatives that they believe will be able to defeat Hamas.

It looks like there are people inside who have been walking around. We know that there is a crew on board. We have gotten word from the operating company at this point that there were no injuries from anyone on the ship. But as you mentioned, major concern for the people who were on the bridge, people who were inside cars or even construction crews that may have been working at the time. As you mentioned, officials have said they are searching for at least seven people. And they have found through sonar, they can detect that there are vehicles in the water. And so, look, I've been out here for hours now, it is -- there frigid conditions along the river. Winds are whipping, it is very cold and there are quite substantial waves and so conditions are not ideal for rescuers who are searching a really large portion of this river. It is a huge section that collapsed when that container ship drove into, actually collided with a column of the bridge. And as we pan to the left, what you have seen here is emergency vehicles that are along the riverbank that also seem to be participating in this operation. Look, it as a fluid situation, Amara. We're still waiting for more details on whether or not rescuers believe they can still save people in this water. But as of now, the mayor and various other officials have said they are going to continue this operation and search to rescue people.",

Well, in the next few hours, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in the most significant abortion case in America since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. Protesters representing both sides are beginning to gather outside the court in Washington. The case centers on the drug mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in medication abortion. For context, nearly two-thirds of abortions in the U.S. last year were medication abortions from mifepristone actually. The drug was approved by the FDA decades ago, and is proven to be safe and highly effective. Last year, a Texas judge ruled with anti-abortion activists seeking to invalidate mifepristone's approval. That ruling and an appeal against it have been on hold pending a Supreme Court review. Today, in about 90 minutes from now, the conservative majority Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments in the case. CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell is with me now. Just give us a sense of how high stakes this is, especially on top of the fact that, you know, Roe v. Wade was overturned two years ago.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Amara. I mean, because Roe v. Wade was overturned two years ago, abortion access, of course, has been a lot harder to get for many people in the United States. And medication abortion has been an increasing way that people access abortion here in this country.Now, 63 percent of all abortions are medication abortions, that's as of 2023. And the numbers have been going up over time. More than 1 million abortions happened in 2023, so that's more than 600,000 people who are accessing these medicines. Now, as you mentioned, this case focuses on a drug called mifepristone. It's one of two drugs used for medication abortion, which is approved up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. This has been proven to be very effective, 95 percent to 98 percent effective, as well as very safe. Experts say that studies have shown there are serious complications and about 0.3 percent of cases here and use of this medicine. Now at stake today is not necessarily the idea that this is going to go away completely. The Supreme Court is looking at an appeals court decision that essentially would roll back the clock on restrictions around how these medicines can be used to where they were before 2016. And in essence, that means this can really restrict access to this medicine, especially via telehealth, which has been an increasingly important way that people get access to these medications. Right now, the abortion is banned completely in 14 states in the U.S. So this is not technically available in those states. There are another 15 states that you can see there that have restrictions on access to medication abortion. But if the Supreme Court upholds the appeals court ruling, this would affect all states in the United States. So it really affect abortion access across the country, Amara.",

We don't see those kinds of complications in any great number, and that this drug has been proven to be safe. You know, a lot of this, I think, though, is going to turn today on whether there's even standing for these plaintiffs who are a group of anti-abortion doctors to have brought this challenge to the FDA. I've talked with legal experts who think, well, that's the first thing that Supreme Court needs to address and they don't even think it gets beyond that. They don't think that this group has standing but we're going to see of course, in the oral arguments this morning.",
