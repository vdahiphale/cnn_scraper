He has been detained ever since.But the story of Taylor Taranto and how he arrived encounters the Secret Service in this residential neighborhood in Washington, D.C. is one that really shows the long arc of January 6th. So this is a man now accused of being there on January 6th at the Capitol riot scuffling with police officers. He carried a cane at that time, and then since then had been posting quite a bit on social media about being an insurrectionist. He said at one point. And then he was live streaming himself talking about January 6th at an elementary school. He had gotten into a gymnasium at an elementary school in Maryland just outside of Washington D.C. Because he said on his live stream that he wanted to startle a Democratic lawmaker who was opposed to Trump supporters and opposed to January 6th. After that, he was live streaming himself basically say the he had a van or a car of some sort that was self-detonating and he believed could be positioned or sent by him to outside the Federal Building, the National Institute of Standards and Technology. That's when federal authorities picked up on him and then the next day is when they find him at the Obama -- outside of the Obama residence with his van, which had two guns in it and a lot of ammo, a machete as well and a mattress. Because Taylor Taranto appeared to have been living for two months since in the Washington, D.C. area. Now his lawyers have been arguing that he shouldn't be held as he waits trial or as you waits additional charges related to January 6th or these other actions. Because he has a family in Washington state and mental health services that can help him there. But he currently is being detained and the judge is looking at him on Thursday and going to decide whether he should still remain behind bars as the case against him progresses.

These cubbies are used for visitors who come into the West Wing. That's where they drop their cell phones off. It's also used by White House officials before they go into a sic to view classified information. They also would drop their cell phones in these types of cubbies. Now the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for her part, left the impression that it could be a visitor who was going on a West Wing tour who left this bag of cocaine there. She talks about the fact that this a highly traveled area. That this is where visitors are brought in when they go on these West Wing tours. But when I asked her whether or not she could rule out that it was a White House official, she could not do that. Saying she wouldn't speculate on who was doing this. She did express confidence in the Secret Service's investigation. But nonetheless that federal law enforcement official telling me that they don't know if they'll actually be able to identify who brought this baggy in. That's in part because of the number of people who would go through the West Wing entrance and also because of how small that bag that was -- where the cocaine was making it that much more difficult to identify fingerprints or potential DNA there.

So, especially if it's a tour guest or staff member. I want to say this, if you are bringing somebody for a tour and you're the one authorizing that person, you should know who you are bringing into that. It's a sacred place. That's the one thing. Now as far as security protocol, I hear what you're saying. You're saying somebody went through the perimeter checkpoints, right, the security. These are magnetometers. They're looking for weapons and looking for any biochemical agents. This dime sized bag which is really small, that can pass through. Somebody can hide that somewhere. You're not strip-searching people. So I understand that everybody is kind of like, how did this get through. We're not talking about a large substance. We're talking about something super small. So unless you want to start stripping people down, staff included at that checkpoint -- which I'm sure Secret Service is happy to do -- that's something that will have to change in the protocol.

We saw the troops marching with little resistance, as we said, towards Moscow just under two weeks ago. And there have been questions of course around where many of the troops have now ended up and were crucially, where Yevgeny Prigozhin has eventually ended up.Now of course, we do know that a deal was struck at the time with Belarus that Yevgeny Prigozhin would then move to Belarus. But we are now learning during just in the last few moments during a press conference, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko speaking to CNN's Matthew Chance confirming in his words, he believes Yevgeny Prigozhin is currently in St. Petersburg, in Russia. Now of course at the time of that failed rebellion, we do know that President Putin offered those who took part in the attempted rebellion three key options. They could either sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry, other law enforcement groups. They could return home. But crucially that third option was to go to Belarus. So Belarus has played a crucial part in striking that deal. But the fact that Prigozhin is not in Belarus is certainly interesting and of course there are questions around the repercussions that Yevgeny Prigozhin may face if he is in fact in St. Petersburg, in Russia, as Alexander Lukashenko has now claimed.",

BASHIRnow, whether in fact he actually did leave to Belarus. Whether some kind of other deal perhaps was struck with the Kremlin, with President Putin. We do know that over the last few months, Yevgeny Prigozhin and President Putin has certainly been at odds and not necessarily behind closed doors. Prigozhin has been a very vocal critic of the generals on the ground. He's been a very vocal critic of President Putin's approach when it comes to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Often calling publicly in videos for further weapons to be supplied to the Wagner mercenaries working within Ukrainian territory. And criticizing the lack of support that has been offered by the Russian government and the Russian Defense Ministry.

It starts early Wednesday morning when the U.S. Navy says at about 1But that wasn't the end of these encounters. Only several hours later in international waters in the Gulf of Oman -- so very near where this first incident happened -- another Iranian Navy vessel approaches another commercial oil tanker. This time that Navy vessel drew even closer hailing on that oil tanker to stop. So, it could be boarded or seized according to the U.S. Navy. The oil tanker issued a distress signal and that same U.S. destroyer, the USS McFaul, responded at full speed. Before it got there, personnel on board that Iranian Navy vessel opened fire with small arms, hitting the oil tanker and doing damage to the ship. No personnel were injured on board that oil tanker. But according to the U.S. Navy, some of those shots landed very close to the crew living quarters. And in fact, you can even see some of these pictures where those shots hit and some of the shrapnel from those bullets in these images from the defense department. As the USS McFaul, that destroyer approached, once again the Iranian Navy vessel changed its heading and left that incident. The U.S. has seen these sorts of encounters and attempts at seizures before. In fact, it was in late April, early May after Iran seize two commercial vessels within days of each other that the U.S. and its partner nations increased maritime and military patrols in the area specifically to avoid incidents like this. But even after all of this, the Middle East wasn't done yet. Several hours later in the skies over Syria, three U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones were conducting a mission against ISIS targets when -- according to U.S. Air Force Central Command -- three Russian fighter jets came in. And you can see video of this encounter released from U.S. Air Force Central. The Russian fighters got in the way of the MQ-9 Reaper drones. Dropped parachute flares and even opened up full afterburner in front of the MQ-9 Reapers forcing the U.S. drones to take evasive action against the heavier, more powerful and faster Russian fighters. The U.S. called it unsafe and unprofessional, warning Russian not to continue in this sort of behavior. But we have seen Russia continue down this path. According to the U.S. military, ignoring the deconfliction protocols, getting close to U.S. aircraft. Even in one, several weeks or months ago, trying to dogfight a U.S. aircraft. And of course, it was several months ago that Russian military aircraft actually hit a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone over the Black Sea forcing it down. Oren Liebermann, CNN in the Pentagon.
