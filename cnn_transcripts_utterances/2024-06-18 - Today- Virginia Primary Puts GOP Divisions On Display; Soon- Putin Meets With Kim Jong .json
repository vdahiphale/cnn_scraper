I'm Manu Raju in for Kasie Hunt.Today, a highly anticipated race between two hardline Republicans comes to a head. Virginia Congressman Bob Good attempting to fend off Trump-endorsed challenger John McGuire in the Virginia primary election. Now, Good initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the presidential primary over Donald Trump. He was also one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust former speaker Kevin McCarthy last fall. But Trump and McCarthy now see this race as an opportunity for revenge. And Trump spoke to voters alongside McGuire just a day before the message -- before the election, and this was his message. It's not just politics; it's personal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Yeah. If he's reelected, Bob Good will stab Virginia in the back, sort of like he did with me. As you probably know, he was against me for numerous years and then after I won the primaries, he became a big fan. But that's not good enough because those are the people that they tend to leave you very quickly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Stephen, good to see you here and not in the halls of the Capitol. Thanks for joining me. So this is such a fascinating race because one thing you don't see is Republicans targeting other Republicans or member targeting other members. Really, this is not -- it's a breach of protocol. This has been a much different Congress -- a much different House Republican Conference where members are going after each other. And this time, for Bob Good, it's not the center-right Republicans who are going after him because he's too conservative, they view. It's also Donald Trump. It's also Kevin McCarthy. It's also Marjorie Taylor Greene. So many people in the Republican Conference want him defeated.",

I mean, Vladimir Putin, right now, is involved in this war against Ukraine and one of the main sources for ballistic missiles and also for ammunition is North Korea. And there are a lot of payoffs -- we can talk about that -- but that's one.

And so, Russia obviously needs it and that is the match that we have. But also, I think if you look at Ukraine -- because Ukraine is not just Ukraine. The war is much bigger and the implications are much bigger. So this allows Russia to create problems for the United States because, again, North Korea already is trying to launch missiles. It has a nuclear program -- probably 50 warheads -- 5-0 at this point. So it creates another big distraction for the United States, and that's exactly what Vladimir Putin wants to do.",

They are in really transactional terms. Even the relationship between North Korea and Russia is transactional. They both need each other. So I think the main -- I have to look at what concretely is happening.

Geoff, thank you for joining me this morning.You write in a new op-ed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"With the first debate looming next week and the election only four months away, the hour is getting late for both candidates. This election will be won or lost by the voters in the middle. Even a hint of fiscal sanity will go a long way with the high concentration of conservatives who know they don't like Trump but need something to get on board with Biden.\" So tell us a little bit more about the concerns that you have regarding how the Biden campaign is dealing with the economy. GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, the economy is a tale of two stories right now. Some -- millions of Americans are going to wake up here shortly and their house is going to be worth more than it has ever been. Their 401(k) is going to be higher than it has ever been. Their jobs are going to never be more secure than it is today. Others are walking into an economy trying to just afford their first house or rent payment, or groceries. And so, it really is a tale of two stories. And I think this group of people with a high concentration of conservatives that can't stand Trump find themselves in the middle but need a reason to vote for Joe Biden. I think this should be a layup for the Biden campaign in just saying look, we need to splash some fiscal sanity into this. We have a spending problem in this country. And the last two presidents are guilty as charged. They both have spent nearly $8 trillion apiece on money that we don't have, growing the debt. And a lot of that money came on the backs or under the guise of helping us through COVID, which I think looking back now we didn't need a lot of those programs in place. It just put synthetic cash into the markets that have created this inflationary issue.",

And now, the rhetoric has gotten lighter. So, yes, incremental chess moves certainly will help to attract certain small pockets of voters. But I do think Joe Biden has got to give Republicans like myself some small victories. Be able to let us see the fact that there is some moldable policies around the border, around inflation, around spending. These are issues that we wake up every day and we care about. And so, I think the more that they can do to reach out through policy, I do think it will help mend those fences. But at the end of the day -- I think Adam Kinzinger said this the other day. In 10 years, I don't know if there's going to be a Republican that will want to publicly admit they voted for Donald Trump. He's just -- you know, the only thing worse than him being our nominee is him being our president because I can only imagine the train wreck in policies and the -- and the vendetta tour that he'll take, both domestically and internationally -- that's really what's put us in this difficult spot as Republicans.",
