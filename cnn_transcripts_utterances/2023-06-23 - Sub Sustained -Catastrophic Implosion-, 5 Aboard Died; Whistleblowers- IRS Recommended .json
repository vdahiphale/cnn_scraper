I'm Christine Romans.The search for the lost Titan submersible is over this morning after authorities announce the sub sustained a catastrophic implosion near the site of the Titanic, 13,000 feet deep in the North Atlantic. All five people aboard killed instantly. A Navy official says the pressure haul was found in two pieces in a field of debris. They will likely now be multiple investigations for what happened and how to prevent it from happening again. CNN's Paula Newton joins us live from Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Remember, Christine, there were quite a few successful expeditions to the Titanic wreck. There was some kind of stress put on the Titan at that point, because it was largely unregulated, wasn't tested going through the motions.You know, Christine, you've had so many people weigh in on this and one of them is James Cameron who he himself has been to the wreck of the Titanic and other deep sea explorations, dozens of times. I want you to listen to him now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES CAMERON, DIRECTOR, \"TITANIC\":  I think there is a great, almost surreal irony here, which is a Titanic sank because the captain took it full steam into an ice field at night, on a moonless night with a -- very poor visibility after he had been repeatedly warned by telegram, by Marconigram, by radio, during the day that that's what was ahead of him. And so, I think we're also seeing a parallel here with unheeded warnings about a sub that was not certified, where the entire deep submergence community actually -- well, not the entire community, but a large number of them got together to write a letter to OceanGate, the company, and say, we believe that this could lead to catastrophe.

The details come from transcripts of interviews that the agents provided to lawmakers in recent weeks.The agents also provided documents that appear to show at least some prosecutors agreed with the recommendation for charges on 11 counts, though more senior officials disagree. In a deal with the U.S. Attorney David Weiss, a Donald Trump appointee, Hunter Biden is pleading guilty to just two tax misdemeanors. Gary Shapley, a veteran IRS supervisor, who oversaw parts of the investigation, says that he saw political interference in the investigation. He told lawmakers, I am alleging was evidence that the DOJ provided preferential treatment, slow walked the investigation, did nothing to avoid obvious conflicts of interest in this investigation. The Justice Department and Weiss said that Weiss had ultimate power to decide on the charges. The Justice Department disputes allegations of political interference. As an example of that interference with the investigation, Shapley also told House lawmakers that investigators were not allowed to more thoroughly investigate WhatsApp messages allegedly from Hunter Biden where he was using his father as leverage to pressure a Chinese company into paying him. One such message reads: I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment may have not been fulfilled. The agents say that they do not know whether Joe Biden was actually with his son when the message was sent. President Biden has repeatedly said he never discussed business dealings with Hunter Biden.

You know, from what you heard in that Coast Guard press conference, what do you think went wrong with the Titan? BARRY LIPSKY, PUBLIC SAFETY DIVING INSTRUCTOR, TEAM LIFEGUARD SYSTEMS, INC.:  Good morning from Long Island, New York. The United States Coast Guard indicated that we had a catastrophic implosion of the submarine, which basically means that the submarine itself folded, and collapsed in. That is due to the tremendous pressure that the submarine was reacting to at very low depths like that. The air that we are in right now has pressure and the water has pressure, but down there at that depths, the pressure on the outside of the submarine was about 400 times as it was on the inside. So, even the slightest crack in the submarine, even if it is an eighth of an inch in size, will cause that submarine to just zipper open instantly and cause a catastrophic collapse of the submarine and pretty much vaporize anything and everything that is inside the submarine.",

Again, take a look at all of these reports just in the last 48 hours.About a dozen tornado reports, over 100 wind and hail reports each. Many of those same areas that have been hit are going to go through it all over again today. The main threats here, we are talking very large hail, it could be larger than golf balls, maybe even up around the size of tennis balls and baseballs. You still got lots of damaging wind gusts to be the focus, and a few isolated tornadoes. Two different target points here. You got areas of eastern Wyoming, west South Dakota and Nebraska, and this other area down south along the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle. That's where the focal point will be. Now, some of the areas in the northern tier are going to start to see some of those showers begin to develop around midday today. Farther south, it is really going to be closer to 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. before things start getting going. But they will continue into the evening and into the overnight hours before finally shifting farther to the east as we head into the weekend. Another big story though is the heat, especially down south across areas of Texas, New Mexico, and portions of Oklahoma. Because of this we do have all of the heat alerts in effect. Excessive heat watches and warnings for all three of these states here, indicating not just the fact that those temperatures will be high, but we have to factor in the humidity. So, that combined condition, what we referred to as the heat index, is going to be extremely high. But look at some of the temperatures, 94 today in Dallas, back into the triple digits by this weekend. For a lot of these areas, even though today is expected to be hot, over the next several days it is expected to get even warmer. So, taking a look at Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, those numbers are going to continue to go up. Not just this weekend but even into next week, to, Christine.
