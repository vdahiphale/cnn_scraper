That comes despite the fact that there is this bank crisis of failure of banks that actually prompted some experts to call for the Federal Reserve to pause this interest rate campaign.Now, today's move lifts borrowing costs from the Fed to the highest level since September of 2007. It was right before the Great Recession. And interest rates are going up rapidly at the fastest pace we've seen since the early 1980s. All of this, of course, is part of this campaign to get inflation under control. For everyone at home, that means higher borrowing costs, mortgage rates, credit cards, car loans. Now, the Fed also inserted significant changes to its statement to acknowledge these bank failures, the biggest that we've seen since 2008. The Fed had sort of a new paragraph that says the banking system is sound and resilient. They say that recent developments are likely to cause tighter credit conditions and make it harder and more expensive for families and businesses to get loans. They say that's going to slow down the economy. It's also going to weigh on hiring and inflation. And the Fed acknowledges that the extent of the banking crisis is uncertain. But the Fed is making clear through today's move that they are definitely focused right now, despite all the banking pressure on getting inflation down.",

Now, they say the job gains have \"picked up in recent months.\"They're also getting more pessimistic in some ways on the inflation outlook. They took out a line that previously said inflation has eased. They say inflation remains elevated. The Fed also issued new projections on where they see the economy going. And importantly, the Fed didn't really change where they see interest rates going. They still think they're going to have to raise interest rates probably one more time, one more quarter-point move. They also made some changes to the unemployment rate. They actually upgraded their view on the unemployment rate. They now see the unemployment rate going up, but not going up quite as high as before. They also upgraded their view on inflation, though, they do think that it's going to take some time before inflation gets back to normal.",

You know, the reason why that language was taken out about inflation cooling, presumably, is that there was a reversal in the numbers. It looked like inflation was moderating and then some other recent data that we got in in the last month or so has indicated that maybe that's not the case.So, I think they are going to be paying close attention to what the numbers look like in the months ahead. I know that there are some forecasters who are predicting that later this year, the Fed -- you know, things will get so dire the economy will weaken so much that the Fed will have to cut rates. The Fed is not predicting that right now, right? They are saying, you know what we've seen so far, what we've seen to date indicates that we will have to continue raising rates for a little while yet. So, I think that's what we should assume is the case until the data come in otherwise. DEAN: And, Matt, I want to get to some new reporting you have. It was a letter that was -- that was shared exclusively with CNN about -- from Senator Elizabeth Warren and several other senators. They want to crack down on these more regional banks -- the larger regional banks, that she also was no fan of Jerome Powell. What more did you learn?",

And this is because of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.Now, they're trying to get legislation through Congress. I don't know if that's going anywhere. But in the meantime, they are urging the Fed to sort of act unilaterally and ramp up supervision on these banks because of the stress that we've seen and this concern that the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank went too far. And so, we should expect to hear some questions to Jerome Powell today about this issue. I mean, he's got to talk about, first of all, what the stress in the bank market means to the economy. I mean, how much is it going to slow down interest -- slow down the economy? At what point does it cause the Fed to pause interest rates? He also has to talk about whether or not he's concerned about more bank failures. And then lastly, he's got to answer questions about what went wrong here, including the regulatory front at the Fed. How some of these red flags about these banks were missed? So, after a very difficult decision made here by Powell and his colleagues to raise interest rates, a decision I should note was unanimous, now he's going to face some tough questions about the road ahead.",

So, if they choose to proceed this way, it will be because they think that they can get this case through and it will hold up.Now, it's possible that they're wrong. And this doesn't affect the underlying misdemeanor of falsifying records, but it would affect the elevation of that to a felony. And if they're wrong, it could get thrown out before trial, it could actually get through to trial and after conviction, it could get thrown out on appeal. So, there are some unknowns here. But you know, they need to make their decision based on what they would do in any other case. No one is above the law. So, if they would bring this case and they would bring it in this way, against anyone else, I think they should bring it against Donald Trump. And, you know, see what happens.

And now Judge Howell is saying effectively that the former president lied to Evan Corcoran about that. So that's going to be very, very fruitful terrain, I think, for DOJ to mine with Evan Corcoran.
