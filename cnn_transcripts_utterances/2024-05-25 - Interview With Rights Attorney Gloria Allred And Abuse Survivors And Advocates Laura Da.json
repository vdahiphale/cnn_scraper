And the lack of action and accountability to protect them. This week two more women accused Sean \"Diddy\" Combs of sexual assault and other offenses. This comes after CNN obtained sickening video of the rapper attacking his girlfriend back then, Cassie Ventura. A horrific assault that Combs has now been forced to confront after years of denials. Now we won't victimize Cassie again by showing her being attacked, but you can see Combs in this short clip chasing her. Since it surfaced, we've been scouring the reaction to the assault and we found very little bit focused on the women. Instead, it's been on Combs, his stardom, his business, his career. In a statement Cassie Ventura said I offer my hand to those still living in fear. Now worldwide, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence. And women of color suffer the most. I've been speaking about all of this with an esteemed panel of women. The rights attorney Gloria Allred, along with Lejla Dauti and April Hernandez-Castillo, who are both survivors and advocates.

What I found was after fleeing my perpetrator was once it was all said and done and the dust had settled, so to speak, and I was physically safe and I wasn't at risk of the violence -- the immediate violence, I kind of looked around and I thought, well, what do I do now? Where do I go now? Who do I turn to now? And there was just nothing. And it wasn't even that the support was lacking in quality, it just didn't exist at all. And it was very much a moment where I thought I was desperate to find women somewhere who were just like me, who had experienced without experience, which is why I turned to social media and started sharing stories on behalf of the women in the community.

So, we have to empower her. And that's important.But we also have to make sure that we have enough women in office to make sure that this becomes a priority, eliminating, preventing, and imposing consequences for the batterers who commit and inflict these injustices against women. So we have to have also more women judges and more women in boards, commissions, agencies until we have an equal structure involving women and men and those who are also diverse in many ways, we are not going to end violence against women.

And usually the president and the foreign minister could be big voices in there. They could move the policy at least even in certain degrees in one direction or the other.But Raisi unlike his predecessor, President Rouhani, was not a big voice at that table. And therefore, he was not a big source of support for either talking to the United States or capping the nuclear program, or retaliate against Israel. And his silence or his more muted presence at the table resulted in that the Supreme Leader and the commanders of the IRGC and the security forces became even more dominant in charting Iran's foreign policy.",

And one other factor here is that everybody expected the Iranian presidential election to come after the American presidential election. Now, it's going to come before the presidential election, which allows the new administration in the U.S. whether Democratic or Republican to reboot with Iran more quickly than it had anticipated to be the case.",

What is at stake, I think, is really -- it's not just Israel, I think the entire Jewish people is at a historical junction. That we need to reflect on the history of the Jewish people, you know, for 2,000 years. If you go back 2,000 years to the great Jewish revolt against the Romans in the first century CE, it was led by religious zealots who thought that God will help them to defeat the Roman Empire, and they were wrong. They brought a terrible disaster on the heads of -- on the head of the Jewish people. And I think Netanyahu is building up to be the next Simon bar Kokhba, who led one of these disastrous revolts. And when the Romans destroyed the Jerusalem and the temple, they changed the nature of Judaism. Judaism then was a religion of -- you know, you had the temple and the priests with all the bloody sacrifices, and the Romans destroyed that. And Judaism became a religion of learning. Jews for 2000 years, they were a religion of learning everywhere they were. And then they built their state. We build our state. And the big question is, what did we learn in 2,000 years? And if you ask Netanyahu and his colleagues like Smotrich and Ben- Gvir, we learned only the joy of power, of feeling superior, the dark ecstasy (ph) of crushing weaker people under our feet. Now, if this is what we learned in 2,000 years, this was such a waste of time because we could have just asked the Romans. They could have told us 2,000 years ago how to destroy city and how to enjoy feeling like being superior to others and so forth. And I think it's a real question that I think Jews should, in Israel and elsewhere, reflect what did we learn in 2,000 years that the Romans didn't already know?",
