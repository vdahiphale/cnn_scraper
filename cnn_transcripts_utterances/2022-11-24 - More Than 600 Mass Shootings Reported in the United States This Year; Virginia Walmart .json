That said, the vast majority of people over this Thanksgiving holiday will be driving. Around 49 million projected by AAA, which is slightly above last year, slightly below pre-pandemic levels of 2019. When you look at specifically flying, we are expecting air travel to meet up eight percent compared to last year. And over the next few days, AAA is estimating that this is going to be the third busiest Thanksgiving travel period.And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was at O'Hare a little bit earlier this week. And he said he was cautiously optimistic about how things were going to go over the course of this week. And while we do expect some weather that may trip some things up, so far so good.

At least, if you're on the east coast, our major I-95 corridor from Boston through New York and D.C. all looking pleasant today.So, as you are hitting the road to go see grandma and grandpa, friend, and family, no real travel concerns there. But you can see some precipitation that's forming across the central portions of the U.S., specifically across the deep south, that could cause travel delays, especially, when you consider the high volume of people traveling. 55 million Americans are expected to hit the roads and the skies. Just in Atlanta, Hartsfield International Airport, they're anticipating two and a half million travelers this weekend. Now, so many of us gather around to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and the weather forecast couldn't be more perfect. In fact, temperatures in the middle 40s, but it's the wind that is so crucial for this work as, of course, considering that there are so many floats and balloons that would be impacted by strong gusts. But that is not the case today. High pressure in control of the weather that's going to allow for tranquil conditions. There's the possibility of some heavier rainfall across the deep south and also picking up some moisture in the form of snow throughout the Rockies. And eventually from Friday into Saturday, we have a winter storm watch for eastern portions of New Mexico and into the Texas Panhandle as well. You can see the snow showers ongoing in and around Denver. This is a more substantial precipitation, of course, being rainfall. Even a few embedded thunderstorms from Dallas to Houston, as well as little Rock and Oklahoma City. You can see the moisture picking up once again through the course of the day today for the deep south. And that moisture will spread eastward for the day on Friday. So, if you're traveling home for family and friends, you'll want to get out the door early for Atlanta. And along the east coast as well, we'll have some precipitation move through. But this storm system you see developing a secondary cold front and low pressure will bring even heavier rainfall into the weekend across the east coast. But more for the Sunday and Monday timeframe. Here's the forecast accumulation across the deep south and a small chance of some flash flooding as well. Here's your forecast weather for Sunday, travel delays anticipated along the east coast. Be prepared for that, Max. There could be some problems up in (INAUDIBLE) as well as Dallas International Airport. Back to you.",

We don't know what the outcome of this will be. But our reporting, Evan Perez and I, have confirmed a \"New York Times\" story and on our own believe that Pence is now open to discussing a possible agreement with the FBI, with the Justice Department to be able to give some sort of testimony. So, this is a really significant step that builds on quite a few things that have been happening in this Justice Department investigation in recent weeks. We know that Pence's deputies, Marc Short and Greg Jacob, were compelled to testify to a grand jury recently. They have shared what they knew about what was happening in the west wing and in their offices around that point of time, January 6th, the Capitol riot. And we also know that Pence, in recent weeks, has put out a book that divulges some particular conversations he had directly with Donald Trump. Those are the sorts of things he had not spoken about before. He had not been willing to testify in the House Select Committee's investigation or speak to Congress about what his side of the story was, what he witnessed those days. But as he was doing his book tour, writing an op-ed for \"The Wall Street Journal,\" releasing his book and talking about those things, those are the types of anecdotes that the Justice Department may be seeking to have -- to hear from him directly himself. So, we're going to have to see how much the new Special Counsel, Jack Smith, is going to be pushing forward on this. But right now, we're seeing a very aggressive step by prosecutors out of Washington. Katelyn Polantz, CNN. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Congress trying to get information as part of a political or legislative process versus the Justice Department, which is part of the executive branch, conducting a criminal investigation and then using the court system to facilitate that investigation.So, there's a huge difference there in terms of the ability to use executive privilege. The fact that the former vice president has also written some of the things that he might talk about in an interview or a testimony in his book, would even make arguments that would be made on the behalf of the former president even harder. Because if it's already out there, if he's already communicated that information publicly, then if he were to receive a subpoena to testify and then were to challenge it and use executive privilege. The fact that he's already put some of the information out in the public, I think, would make that an even weaker case. And that's not even getting into the fact executive privilege really is the domain of the current president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
