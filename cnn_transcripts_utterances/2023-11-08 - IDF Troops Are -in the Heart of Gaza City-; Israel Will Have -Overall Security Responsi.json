Secretary of state Blinken today in commenting on, this seemed to acknowledge that a security presence is necessary or could be necessary for some time there, an Israeli one, but announced his opposition, continued opposition to a full reoccupation. Have a listen to his comments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  When it comes to postconflict governance in Gaza, a few things are clear and necessary. One, Gaza cannot continue to be run by Hamas. That simply invites a repetition of October 7th. And Gaza will use it as a place from which to launch terrorist attacks. It's also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. Now the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict. But it is imperative that the Palestinian people be central to governance in Gaza, in the West Bank as well and that, again, we don't see reoccupation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Will they have a common understanding that a security presence for a finite amount of time works but one beyond that does not? That seems to be what Blinken was stating in quite clear terms and even said that, following the conflict, in a post conflict period, that others would take responsibility for security. Who those others are, discussions of an international force of some sort, what nations in this region or around the world would want that job, would take on that job and for what period of time, again, an unanswered question.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah not to enter the war, saying that it will be the biggest mistake in its life. As CNN's Ben Wedeman shows us from the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, residents near the border are caught between expecting the worst and carrying on with life as usual. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A family, a village is in mourning. Samira Ayoub and her three granddaughters, Layan, 10; Taleen, 12; and Remas, 14, were killed in an Israeli drone strike on their car Sunday afternoon near the border with Israel. Their uncle, Samir, was in the car in front of them. \"Their mother was screaming,\" he recalls. \"'I want my children. Where are my children?' as she watched her children burning inside the car.\" The Israeli military told CNN the vehicle was a, quote, \"suspected transport\" for terrorists, adding they are looking into claims there were civilians in the vehicle. Clearly, there were only civilians in the vehicle. Every day, the border area is rocked by incoming and outgoing fire, enough to keep the area on edge, not enough yet to set off a full blown war. The ancient city of Tyre lies just 20 kilometers, or around 13 miles, north of the frontier. Pulling in his nets, Deeb says now is not the time to take risks. \"Us fishermen are not going far out to sea,\" he tells me. \"We stay close to shore just in case something happens.\" The normally bustling port in the heart of Tyre is subdued. \"Usually, this place is full of people,\" Mohammed (ph) (INAUDIBLE) fisherman says. \"No one's going out. Everyone is staying home.\" Elias' family has been making fishing boats for generations. He lived through all of Lebanon's wars and doesn't want to see another one. \"Everyone is scared,\" he says. \"Many people have gone elsewhere. Who wants to stay here and be bombed?\" Until or unless that happens, the fishermen mend their nets. Life must go on -- Ben Wedeman, CNN, Tyre, South Lebanon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

After more than a month of conflict, you are looking at the Strip running absolutely everything -- food, water, fuel, basic supplies, medical equipment. Meanwhile, the bombs continue to rain down and Israeli forces are intensifying their assault on Gaza City. The IDF says it is now in the heart of that capital. The Israeli defense minister making a statement just yesterday, I believe, essentially calling the entirety of Gaza City a target, saying the whole place is a base for Hamas and, therefore, Israeli troops, he says, can carry out legitimate attacks. You've seen the evacuees leaving. But when you talk about them heading south, you have to remember that that is not a safe place as well. You have 1.5 million Gazans now, that is three-quarters of the population of the Strip, bombed, besieged, forced out of their homes with no refuge, no safe place to go to. The shelters in the south are absolutely overwhelmed. I will leave you with one last number, Eleni.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza City. They wave white flags of surrender made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocent. \"I am a cancer patient. And I can't find treatment or food or water,\" this woman says. \"We saw with our own eyes last night. The whole ground shook.\" The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the Strip to move southward. Most recently, opening what it called safe corridors for limited windows of time. \"We're running down the streets with nothing, endangered every moment. The bombs won't stop,\" she says. The only way to reach (INAUDIBLE) is by foot or by cart (INAUDIBLE). \"We were forced to flee,\" this man says. \"We have to use these donkey carts because there is no fuel. They cut everything off and forced us out of our homes.\" Israeli troops are now in the heart of Gaza City, as Israel's defense minister apparently declared the entire city, the enclave's largest population center, a legitimate target. YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):  Gaza is the biggest terrorist stronghold that mankind has ever built. This whole city is one big terror base. Underground, they have kilometers of tunnels connected to hospitals and schools. We continue to dismantle this capability. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  But the U.N. calls this exodus forcible displacement and accuses Israel of the collective punishment of some 2 million people. And these routes are dangerous and deadly. This was Salah al-Din street just a few weeks ago. CNN geolocated and authenticated these videos showing the aftermath of explosions that killed evacuees. You can see luggage among the bodies.

That ballot measure in Ohio, enshrining abortion rights into the constitution of what is now a very Republican state, was especially interesting. Even in some districts that were won by Trump last time around, the abortion ballot measure succeeded. So this shows that it is a very powerful issue for Democrats outside of their own coalition. But the paradox is, that while Democrats seem to be doing very well and perhaps are closer to the American public on the issues, President Biden is getting terrible ratings from the public for his presidency, for his global leadership, for his handling of the economy and, perhaps most importantly, over the age -- over his age. He turns 81 later this month. In our poll, only a quarter of Americans said they believed he had the stamina and the capacity necessary to serve as president. More than 50 percent of Americans thought that Trump did. And Trump is 77, as you know. So the big question I think is, one year out from the election, is, are Democrats going to -- and other independent and moderate suburban voters, are they going to stick with Biden because they agree with Democrats mostly on the issues? Or is this going to become a referendum on Biden's ability to serve a second term?",

Biden says he is running at this point and there is no indication that he will change his mind. The White House position is that, if Trump becomes the Republican nominee and we get a repeat of 2020, what you are going to see is that direct comparison between the president and ex-president Donald Trump. Trump has not been that present, apart from his social media rants, in American public life. That comparison has not been that clear. For instance, during his very volatile showing in the court case in New York, the civil fraud trial on Monday, that was not televised. And most Americans did not see that picture of what Trump is really like, again, that we did see every day in the White House. And so the White House basically is arguing and the Biden campaign is that, once that comparison is clear, the polls will tighten and Biden's character will get him over the line. The problem is that, four years ago, Biden was the challenger, Trump was the incumbent. But now Biden is being judged by voters on his own record, his own economic performance.

And I know that the economy is front and center in terms of one of the most important issues. We don't know what the economy is going to be doing next year. There's so much uncertainty around that.

This could hurt the president, I think, among Muslim American voters, who are quite important in one particular swing state, Michigan. But it is also widening the gap between the president and those younger voters, who are already a little bit worried about his age. They find it quite hard to identify with him and the war is exacerbating that. The problem I think is not that a lot of these younger Americans will vote for Donald Trump; it's that they won't show up at the polls. Last time around in about five or six swing states, the election was decided by about 10,000 to 20,000 votes in each of those states.

But the attorney general of New York, Letitia James,she says that Ivanka Trump was involved and has very relevant knowledge about the Trump Organization, putting forward false information about their properties. That is because Ivanka Trump -- and we already know that she is on the stand and she is being questioned about how much knowledge she had whenever the Trump Organization was working on two particular projects. One, the property in Doral, Florida, that they had, whenever she was working on getting financing for that property; the submissions that the Trump Organization made to banks about their values, that is one of the things that they have already been -- the judge has already found them culpable of, that they submitted fraudulent information to get better deals on loans. And then the other property that she was involved with -- and it seems to take a lot of pride in her work there, at least from how she is testifying about it -- was the old Post Office building. So that is a historic building in downtown Washington, D.C., that is owned by the federal government but was leased to the Trump Organization to have a hotel. Essentially during the time period that Donald Trump was the president, just a couple of blocks away in the White House and Ivanka Trump not only worked on some of the pitch to the federal government there to get that property for the Trump Organization, she also apparently benefited from the sale. She earned some profit off of the sale of that property whenever Trump put it up for sale and no longer was holding on to that property. And so she is testifying now following the testimony of her father, Donald Trump, on Monday and then her brothers, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. previously. And all together it's going to be comparing and contrasting how much each of these people knew about exactly what the Trump Organization was doing, what their financial statements were and what they were saying to banks and their own accountants, whether they were making -- whether they individually knew that there were false statements being made so that they could make more money as a business. All of this is going into the attorney general's case to claim damages because they believe that there should be many millions of dollars assessed against the Trump Organization. The judge has already ruled against the Trump Organization and Donald Trump in this case and just has to put a number on things and determine how severe the punishment should be for the Trump Organization for what they did.

      "sentences": "So Tlaib has been critical of Israel since the war broke out. But what led to her censure werestatements using the phrase, \"from the river to the sea,\" which many see as a call for the destruction of Israel and view as a direct anti-Semitic attack. That led to many of her own Democratic colleagues going up in arms, being frustrated, feeling like Tlaib had officially crossed the line for them and leading 22 Democrats to vote to eventually censure her last night. But Tlaib has defended her comments. She is one of three Muslim members of Congress, the only Palestinian member of Congress. She continues to say that she has an important perspective to bring. Take a listen to the emotion that she brought to this on the House floor yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "What you saw there was Tlaib getting emotional as she was trying to speak out on behalf of Palestinians, who are dying as a result of thewar between Israel and Hamas. You saw Tlaib's colleague, congresswoman Ilhan Omar, get up to comfort her. Tlaib was also holding a photograph of her grandmother, who lives in the Palestinian part of the West Bank currently. And what we are seeing as a result of this censure vote is the broader divide in the Democratic Party over Israel. You have a considerable number of Democrats who are extremely pro Israel. They support the president and the White House's approach in the war so far. But then you have an increasingly louder group of progressives, who are critical of the White House's approach, even calling for a cease-fire and more humanitarian aid. So this censure resolution that passed last night, which is the strongest form of punishment that a member can receive from their colleagues in the House, is just the latest example of these tensions playing out in real time.",

She was testifying about her experience on campus. And she was on the verge of tears. She's a young Black woman who is a conservative. She said that oftentimes she is targeted because of her beliefs. So these students here are essentially laying out what life is like on these college and university campuses as tensions rise following that October 7th terror attack on Israel. We are seeing that there have been Israeli students on campus who have been targeted. And now members of Congress are hearing a lot of those anecdotes and hoping that that they can put policy forward. That would enable these schools to better handle the situation. I spoke with the Department of Education Secretary yesterday, who recently sent out letters to all of these schools and universities, essentially reminding them of their legal obligation to protect students from discrimination on campus.",
