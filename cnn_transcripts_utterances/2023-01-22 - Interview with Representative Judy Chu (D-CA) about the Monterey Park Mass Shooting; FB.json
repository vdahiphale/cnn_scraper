Tell me a little bit. I heard you during the press conference trying to reassure people during what is supposed to be the happiest time of the year to tell them it's OK, the threat is over. Tell me about that desire to try to reassure people. REP. JUDY CHU (D-CA): All day long, I heard people who were anxious, who asked whether they should go to the events that are around the community and there are so many Lunar New Year events going on, who wonder whether they should send their kids to school even, and even as much as I said that they should continue doing that, I could feel the fear in their voices. So it is with great relief that we can tell them this shooter is no longer a threat and that they can feel safe and that they can do the things that they would normally do during this Lunar New Year period which is supposed to be the highlight of the year.",

So, Chief Ramsey, this is such an unusual case. I mean, mass shooting perpetrators are usually much younger men.

People he was mad about or maybe even people who worked there at both places, so it -- you know, they're just going to have to basically learn his life better than his mother.

So there are still a lot of looming questions but it's really incredible how law enforcement were able to work together so quickly to find the suspect that ultimately killed himself.And Chief Ramsey, I want to play for our viewers what the sheriff of Los Angeles County said about the actions of bystanders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF ROBERT G. LUNA, LOS ANGELES CITY: I can tell you that the suspect walked in there probably with the intent to kill more people and two brave community members decided they were going to jump into action and disarm him.

So fortunately, you had two people that were alert enough to be able to see the gun before he had a chance to fire and they were brave enough to then take action and actually wrestle the gun away from him.So that's something that, again, I mean, people need to understand, if something like that occurs, you have to take action.

How important is it, Shan, the proof of intentionality in determining possible charges in these cases?

None of which we see at the moment from the public reporting but the intent is really important. Whether there is intentional mishandling.Now it's important to distinguish how far back the case is going to go in terms of looking at perhaps documents he had in the Senate or in the vice presidency. There have been other instances of people moving offices like Alberto Gonzalez when he moved from the White House Counsel Office to DOJ had taken documents as well, and that was taken a look at there. In fact, his included handwritten documents much like the Biden situation. But that intent is really important and I do want to question a little bit this idea of what else could the White House have done at this point. Very difficult situation. With an active criminal investigation as you pointed out, they need to be very careful of, quote, \"trying to get ahead of this\" on the communications front because you could end up influencing witnesses. You could end up giving information that later comes back as inconsistent with what the FBI finds when they do the searches. And also the idea that you can just kind of let the FBI go in and take care of all this. Not that easy for the FBI. They don't know where to search.

So I'm trying to be, you know, a non-partisan person approaching this. And, you know, in terms of the actual documents themselves, you know, senators are going to go in to meetings. They're going to take notes. It could be about something that is very, very old and is no longer classified.

So it's being very much guided from the information they've been given by the Biden camp and that will continue to be the instance.

Tell us what it was like for you to hear about this story. For you, this wasn't just another mass shooting in America. It happened in a place you hold deeply in your heart. BIANCA MABUTE-LOUIE, DAUGHTER OF CHINESE IMMIGRANTS, ASIAN-AMERICAN ADVOCATE: It was a lot to hear about it this morning. I mean, the ballroom where it happened, my dad and I were trying to figure out, is that where my mom goes for dance lessons on weekends? You know, it's incredibly close to -- I mean, it is my home. Monterey Park was the first home and city that my parents relocated to when they first immigrated from Hong Kong and there's a lot there in terms of just my own family history as well as my work as a researcher and sociologist looking at the implications of how we understand race by looking at sites like Monterey Park as an ethnoburb.",

What you want people to know about it.MABUTE-LOUIE: So I think the best way to understand Monterey Park is actually to share a story about my late grandmother. So she immigrated to California from Hong Kong in her 70s. She at the time was -- didn't have a partner. She didn't speak any English. She didn't really know many people. She didn't have a car. So if you know Southern California, it's very difficult to get around without a car, and yet, she had this thriving social life and she never learned English. She did have a driver's license but we never trusted her to actually drive. But she had this thriving social life where she had neighbors and friends to play mahjong with on weekends. She had a church community that spoke Cantonese, her native language. She was able to walk to grocery stores to get her native foods. And her story and her thriving later in life was possible because Monterey Park and its surrounding areas, San Gabriel Valley, was an ethnoburb where, again, like I said in the tweet, Asian immigrants are able to build this ecosystem to take care of and protect each other. Where our thriving and our survival comes not from assimilating or integrating necessarily into white institutions but from again building our own social networks, our own businesses, community centers, places of worship, places for recreational activities like ballroom studios, and if you drive around today, a lot of signage in Monterey Park in San Gabriel Valley is Chinese and Vietnamese, which was actually fought for because, as that area was developing as an ethnoburb, long-time white residents who had been there pushed for an English only ordinance banning all these signs they were seeing popping up in Asian languages but ultimately, they lost and it continues to be this place where, you know, again my grandparents never spoke English and yet have this thriving life in the States because of ethnoburb.",

Hamlin in the box with his family during the game, showing heart hands on the jumbotron, which had become a symbol of spreading love. But when it came to the game the Bills looked emotionally exhausted, spiritually spent. The psychological roller coaster of the last three weeks seemingly siphoning their internal tank and that manifested in the physical defense, missing tackles, leaving receivers wide open. The Bengals and quarterback Joe Burrow plowing through the snow. And the Bills offense couldn't get clicking. Josh Allen trying to throw their way into a comeback in the snow, just was not happening.

The producer price index, the key inflation metric that measures prices paid for goods and services by businesses, it rose 6.2 percent December compared to a year earlier.On a monthly basis those wholesale prices actually fell, the biggest one-month drop since April 2020. It's a sign the Fed's aggressive rate hikes may finally be bringing price pressures under control for now. The job market is also showing signs of resilience. First-time claims for unemployment insurance fell unexpectedly to just 190,000. The lowest figure in 15 weeks. Where there are layoffs, in tech. Google's parent company, Alphabet, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Amazon are among the tech giants who have recently announced job cuts. Up next this week fourth quarter GDP numbers, jobless claims, fresh housing data and the PCE price index. That's the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation -- Pamela.",

She was honored there by fans, famous musicians and of course her family.Here's Lisa Marie's mother, Priscilla, sharing a very special poem written by her granddaughter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRISCILLA PRESLEY, LISA MARIE PRESLEY'S MOTHER: I'm going to read something that my granddaughter wrote for all of you. And this says it all. The old soul. I have no idea how to put my mother into words. Truth is there are too many. Lisa Marie Presley was an icon, a role model, a superhero to many people all over the world. But mama was my icon, my role model, my superhero in much more ways than one. Even now I can't get across everything there is to be understood or known about her. But as she always said, I'll do my best. The old soul. This is a poem. \"The old soul. In 1968 she entered our world. Born tired, fragile, yet strong. She was delicate but was filled with life. She always knew she wouldn't be here too long. Childhood passes by with a glimpse of her green eye. She then grew a family of her own. Then came her second child, leaving her with suspicion. Could this be the angel that takes me home? Time of course flew by. It was time for a tragedy. She knew it was close to the end. Survivor's guilt some would say but a broken heart was the doing of her death. Now she is home where she always belonged, but my heart is missing her love. She knew that I loved her. I fear I'll never touch her but also is always with me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
