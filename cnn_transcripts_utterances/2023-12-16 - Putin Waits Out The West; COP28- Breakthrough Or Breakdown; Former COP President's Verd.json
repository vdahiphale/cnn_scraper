It is a very heavy toll. But perhaps what is even more significant is that despite all this, Russian President Vladimir Putin seems more emboldened and more upbeat. With Republicans in Congress holding Ukraine support for ransom over border politics at home, President Biden has warned that Putin is watching and waiting. Quite a prediction.

And he is already, as we speak, sending out feelers, to try to gauge whether the United States and European countries are ready to capitulate, give up Ukraine, and actually push forward on negotiations.

Russia will maintain a major military force, it will replenish its depleted stocks, and of course, you know, Putin thinks that he has an unlimited supply of man power, when he's pulling people out of jails, and you know, out of remote areas of Russia.

That is beside the point. He doesn't care about the fact that he has had to distort his whole economy to a war economy, for now, the Russian economy is adapted, and is doing reasonably well. Over the long term, this is very detrimental to Putin, but he is not thinking about the long term. He thinks over the long term, he will win. And right now, this is the tipping point where the United States and Ukraine and Europe and everybody loses and he turns everything to his advantage. Right now, that's what he is thinking. And so what does that do to all of us in the long term? I think that that actually, you know, shows that the west is incapable of sticking to its ground, and there will be a deterrent effect after this. And I want to explain that in a moment. Putin will be emboldened. It doesn't mean he's necessarily going to send tanks into the Baltic States tomorrow. It's just that he will now know that the United States and West, and NATO as well, have no sticking power. He will turn around and say we defeated NATO. Not because NATO was directly involved in Ukraine. But because NATO member countries have been involved in supporting Ukraine. He always says, and he said before, when he threatened she delivers on the West, promises much to partners and never delivers. And it will have a chilling effect of every ally of the United States and the West, Japan, South Korea. I mean remember, North Korea was also involved in supporting Putin here. So it will be a win for North Korea and Iran and it will bleed over into every other arena that we're concerned about at this moment. This will not solve a problem. It will just create a host of other problems. And American and Western leadership will be greatly diminished by this.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's very worrying because again, this is a short to medium term perspective, and because Zygar is absolutely right. I mean one of the effects of sanctions and sanctioning Russian business people and oligarchs has been to make them bring all of their capital, you know, from outside in Europe and back into Russia, or to basically put it into the Middle East, U.A.E., you know, for example, and as Putin would probably say, like the old crypt goes over the longer term, we're all dead. He doesn't care about that.He cares about the short to medium term, his own election next year in 2024, which seems like a pretty sure thing to be president again until at least 2036. So that is what he is playing for. And so Mikhail Zygar is right and many others are to call the alarm here. The only way that Putin changes his mind is when he feels pressure from a very large number of actors and that's not what he feels right now. There is no pressure coming from the Middle East. He's just been in recent weeks in the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia. He doesn't feel any pressure from China. He's not feeling any pressure from other players in the world system to end this war. In fact all the pressure is on the United States and on Europe, not on Russia at all. Putin doesn't get any scrutiny rather from his own press. He is basically scot-free right now. And that should be something that people should be contemplating. Every time that we step out there, in search of a critical way, about American players, irrespective of our parties and position, we're handing again another opening to Vladimir Putin to mess about in our domestic politics. We have Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, messing about in our domestic politics as well. America has now become a playground for other interests in ways that we have not seen for a very long time in our political history. This should be a real concern for people, thinking about how vulnerable and how fragile U.S. politics and the U.S. political system has become to outside interference.",

And we're really getting -- seeing the United States being put in the spotlight by Russia, by China, obviously North Korea, Iran and many other countries, as really being the cause of all of this turmoil. The United States is getting blamed for what is happening in Israel and Gaza, just as much as it is in Ukraine. And there's now a push by Russia and other countries to isolate the United States. The United States, I would suggest right now, is on the back foot here. And Putin is obviously going to take every advantage of this. And so will China. This looks like a world where three major fires -- two, you know, fully combustible in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and one that is still, you know, still simmering and smoldering -- simmering fire but smoldering, looking kind of like it also might be ignited in the Indo-Pacific region as well.

Her skeletal frame rises slightly, an action causing pain and an enormous amount of difficulty. \"Don't worry. You'll be fine,\" says her brother kissing her hand. \"We are with you always.\" Her oldest siblings who asked not to be identified for security reasons smuggled her in from neighboring Afghanistan five months ago Following a series of events that would irrevocably change the course of their lives. \"We don't try to force her to remember what happened,\" he says. \"But once I asked her and she replied crying that she was tired and had given up all hope. But Azo did not always feel this way. Seen here in pink, dancing on cell phone footage, the teenager was happy, studious and had big dreams to one day become a doctor. [11:39:51] COREN: But that all changed in August, 2021 when the Taliban re-took control of Afghanistan, after the U.S. withdrawal, following a 20-year war. And one of the first edicts the Taliban enforced was a ban on female secondary education. She would say, \"I have to be removed from this place,\" explains her sister. \"I don't want to be here. There is no education.\" Over the following months, her mood darkened but nothing that alarmed her family until one day in July, this year. \"She came into the room, and I saw her eyes were abnormal,\" she says, \"I asked her what had happened, and she said she drunk acid. I didn't believe her, so I put my fingers in her mouth and she vomited up blood.\" Azo's sister says she had drunk battery acid in their home in an attempted suicide, a trend that is spiking among teenage girls across Afghanistan, according to health professionals and human rights groups. An Afghan doctor who spoke to us anonymously fearing retribution from the Taliban tells CNN he's seen a 50 percent rise in the number of mental health cases among girls at his clinic who have considered suicide in the past two years. Of these cases, at least 10 percent have taken their own lives, drinking chemicals, overdose on pain medications, even consuming rat poison. He related this is the direct result of the education ban and other draconian restrictions that have been placed on girls. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I try to give them hope, that education will start again. But they don't see any good future for anyone in this country.

So in a desperate attempt to save her life, her family decided to smuggle her into Pakistan.Azo has since had three operations at a private hospital in Karachi as doctors try to repair her severely-damaged esophagus and stomach. But so far, it's not working. Weighing a mere 25 kilograms, or 55 pounds, azo is slowly wasting away. She's fed a nutritional drink, and separately juice four times a day by a tube in her stomach but she is not gaining weight, which may jeopardize her next operation, scheduled in a matter of weeks. Adding to the family's worries is Pakistan's recent decision to expel Afghans living illegally in their country. Her siblings fear, if they're forced to return to Afghanistan, Azo will die. \"I don't cry in front of her but when I kiss her at night while she's sleeping, I will cry,\" he says. I'm so worried for her future, her treatment and if she will be able to survive.\" A daily anguish for these siblings, doing everything they can with what little means they have, to keep their sister alive.
