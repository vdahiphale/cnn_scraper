We want to make sure this is an agreement worthy of the American people. REP.

The American people deserve to know that the Social Security payments will be there, the Veterans Hospital will remain open, and that economic progress will be made, and we're going to continue to make it.

President Biden talked about the need for bringing back revenue raisers, like closing tax loopholes, for example, back into the negotiations. Now, that's something that the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, has made very clear that he is not going to consider. And it's also clear that the White House and House Republicans still have yet to agree on that top line spending number. House Republicans still pushing for spending cuts, while the White House says that they will accept a freeze on spending at this current year's levels for the next two years. But what we are also starting to see is that the financial markets are taking note of the potential, the increased potential for the first-ever default in U.S. government history. I spoke on Thursday with the Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo and here's what he said when I asked him whether Americans should be worried about the potential for default. WALLY ADEYEMO, U.S. DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY: I think we should all be worried that Congress has not taken the action they need to do which is raising the debt limit. Not doing so would be a catastrophe for the economy that would have an impact across not only the United States but across the global economy.",

Now, Ukraine's northern neighbor has been Moscow's closest ally since the war began last February.

The U.S. government and opposition leaders in Belarus denounced the move. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: We strongly condemn the arrangement. It's the latest example of irresponsible behavior that we have seen from Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine over a year ago. As we have made clear, the use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons in this conflict would be met with severe consequences. But in response to this report, I will just add we have seen no reason to adjust our strategic nuclear posture or any indications that Russia has preparing to use a nuclear weapon. (END VIDEO CLIP) NEWTON: Ukraine says Russia has launched a barrage of drone and missile strikes that lasted for seven hours overnight. It says the attacks involved dozens of drones and missiles going after targets right across the country. They included the capital, Kyiv, as well as the city of Dnipro and the Kharkiv region. One person was wounded in Dnipro while a number of homes and businesses were also damaged. In the meantime, Russian installed officials are blaming Ukraine for a missile strike in the occupied city of Berdyansk are calling it a massive attack, but there's been no word on casualties. The officials also suggested without evidence that Ukraine may have used the long range storm shadow missile recently supplied by Britain. Now, that happened after U.S. intelligence assessed that a Ukrainian group may be behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month and after a cross-border raid by Russians opposed to the Kremlin who said they used some U.S. military vehicles. Now, they allege they did not receive those vehicles from Ukraine, but the U.S. says there's a line it needs to draw for Kyiv. Listen.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These calm waters are home to a secret Russia doesn't want you to know. Experts say Iran is quietly sending weapons on ships like this one across the Caspian Sea to replenish arms for Moscow's war on Ukraine. [03:20:04] Concealing movement at sea is considered nefarious and potentially a violation of international law. But in the Caspian Sea, there's a growing number of gaps in vessels tracking data known as AIS, with a more than 50 percent increase in ships hiding their movement between August and September of 2022 according to maritime trafficking data. Most of the vessels going dark are Iranian or Russian flagged tankers. The timing is suspicious too, this practice picking up last summer, just as White House officials revealed that Russia had purchased hundreds of drones from Iran. So, why would these ships want to hide their movements? Maritime security analyst Martin Kelly tells us it is likely because of what these vessels are carrying.",

      "sentences": "There's a correlation between Russia requesting drones from Iran, dark port cause in the Caspian Sea and an increase in dark AIS activity and that to me was a key indicator of these three aspects combined that something was going on, probably the export of Iranian drones to Russia.ABDELAZIZ (on-camera): This heat map from Lloyd's List shows where most of those gaps in AIS are concentrated, mostly near Iran's Amirabad port and Russia's Astrakhan port, where ships appear to be turning off their data on approach and going dark for extended periods of time. Now, using data like this and expert analysis, CNN was able to identify eight vessels that exhibited suspicious behavior in the Caspian Sea. This is one such vessel. It's a Russian flag tanker that was seen in early January, leaving Iran's Amirabad port, making its way across the Caspian Sea to Russia's Astrakhan port. Now, we cannot independently verify what this tanker was carrying, but experts tell us the shipment was likely linked to the arms trade. (voice-over): And there are signs that Tehran could be airmailing arms too. The U.S. and Ukraine both accused Tehran of sending supplies to Russia by plane. CNN analyzed the tracking data of four Iranian cargo planes flagged by the U.S. Commerce Department for potentially carrying drone shipments. Collectively, the aircraft made at least 85 trips to Moscow airports between May 2022 and March 2023. Iran has admitted that it sold a small number of drones to Russia. But it says the sale was a few months prior to the war in Ukraine. CNN has reached out to Iran and Russia for comment, but has yet to receive a response. But given the much larger volume cargo ships can carry, the Caspian Sea Corridor is likely the primary conduit. And experts say it is the new frontier for weapons trade between Moscow and Tehran, tucked away from Western interference. It provides an easy avenue for sanctions evasion, expert Anissa Tabrizi says. ANISEH BASSIRI TABRIZI, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, RUSI: I think the perception in Moscow is that Tehran can teach a lot to Moscow about how to go and how to still have a significant economy, even when sanctions are imposed. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): And there is very little the U.S. and its allies can do to stop it. And more could be on the way. Intelligence officials warned in November, Iran plans to send ballistic missiles, ammunition and more sophisticated drones to Moscow.

There's going to be a loss of investor confidence should that occur, as you mentioned. There's going to be an increase in borrowing costs, decline of value U.S. dollar, obviously, because of volatility, consumers are going to have to prepare that things are going to get more expensive. And especially those who have -- we're talking about the debt ceiling. Those who actually in the U.S. have debt, they would have to re-look at how to knock that down because things would be more expensive.

South African police say they found him living the good life in wine country near Cape Town. But for more than 20 years, his mugshot was plastered on top of the list of the most wanted perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, and even among the names that define pure evil. Prosecutors say Kayishema stands out. SERGE BRAMMERTZ, CHIEF PROSECUTOR, U.N. INTERNATIONAL RESIDUAL MECHANISM FOR CRIMINAL TRIBUNALS: He was a chief of police, and his responsibility was, in fact, to protect civilians, and he did exactly the opposite. MCKENZIE (voice-over): For more than 90 days, nearly 30 years ago now, more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutu Rwandans were murdered during the genocide. Investigators say Kayishema was not just a mastermind, but was also a participant, herding fleeing Tutsis, women, children and the elderly, into the Nyangay Catholic Church.

We're all veterans who were willing to die together just a few years ago. Then we can come together, roll up our sleeves and move the country forward. TAPPER (voice-over): Retired Lieutenant General and Michigan Republican Congressman Jack Bergman is one of only three Vietnam veterans left serving in the House. REP.
