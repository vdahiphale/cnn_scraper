But for Israelis Monday, there were celebrations as two hostages were reunited with family. This is only the second successful hostage rescue by the IDF bringing high praise from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

I'm proud of you of the Shin Bet, the IDF, you work together like an oiled machine.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The major military operation in Rafah should not proceed without a credible plan, a credible plan for ensuring the safety and support of more than 1 million people sheltering there. Many people there have been displaced, displaced multiple times, fleeing the violence to the north, and now they're packed into Rafah, exposed and vulnerable they need to be protected.

And as we move forward in anticipation for the potential war effort, our goals are to create a plan that evacuate civilians out of harm's way to differentiate them and distinguish them between civilians and Hamas. What we -- what -- if we can learn anything from the special operations that Jeremy Diamond went through and reported on just moments ago, is that hostages are being held in Rafah.

We've proven time and time again, that we can evacuate mass amounts of people out of harm's way. We have done so. So we need to be able to understand that where there is a will there's a way. And indeed it won't be a simple task. But let's go back just a few months at the beginning of the war. For over three weeks, we were calling on evacuation in the northern Gaza Strip, to get people out of harm's way as we intended to mobilize. And when we refined our operations in the south in the areas of Khan Younis, so it was specific neighborhoods that we mobilize to and from there evacuated so that it can be done.

Many posting upbeat videos on social media of their military training in Russia, where they're meant to be prepared for the hardships of the Ukraine war.

But we know in addition to the legal arguments, the strategy here is really delay, try to use any thing they possibly can to get this trial pushed until after the 2024 presidential race. And here they're asking the Supreme Court to pause that appeals court ruling while they exercise some of their options. They said they'd like to go to the Supreme Court formally and ask for an appeal, they might go back down to the appeals court, seek a full panel review down there anything they can do to push this back a few days, a few weeks, in the hopes that Jack Smith will not be able to bring this case before the presidential contest, because if former President Trump is reelected, he through his attorney general could fire Jack Smith and make this case as well as the Mar-a-Lago classified documents prosecution go away. Now, what happens next? Well, the Supreme Court could do pretty much anything they want. They have a lot of options here. But it's widely expected that the Chief Justice will set out a schedule, allowing both sides to weigh in the Special Counsel, expected to weigh in pretty quickly because they're trying to move this along. But legal experts sources in and around the Trump legal team say they would be surprised if the Supreme Court were to actually take up this case. They're already contemplating a historic case, covering ballot eligibility and whether Trump can appear on the ballot. They say they'd be surprised if they took up this case, too. This is also expected not to be as strong for the former president not as likely to succeed at the High Court. So, as is the monitor for 2024, all eyes on the Supreme Court, not just for how they handle this, but for how quickly they weigh in and move this along. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's a question of what we get out of it, or in fact, what he gets out of it rather than that we can come accomplish together. So I don't think this is just a question about who spends how much. I think it's fundamentally about a question about how do we work together, and Europeans and allies around the world are going to see the election of Donald Trump as the end of a time when they can rely on the United States, when they can believe in the United States, and when the United States is credible.

First a warning, some of the images in her report are graphic and difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yet another distraught Palestinian mother, her hands and face bloodied, her injured daughter limp, carried out of the car. Around them, more casualties arrive badly wounded. Some of the youngest in a state of shock. The horror that they have faced will be hard to move past. \"We were at home when the airstrikes began\", this young girl says. \"I told my mother that I wanted to use the bathroom. Then suddenly all the walls of the bathroom and all the water containers above us collapsed on me. This was the scene overnight in the terrifying series of airstrikes by the Israeli military on a city where some 1.5 million people are now concentrated. The target said to be Hamas, part of an operation to secure the release of two Israeli hostages. But as dawn breaks on the southern border city, it's clear that the aftermath is yet again, one of sheer tragedy. Bullet holes ripped through the thin plastic of this tent. Inside, the bodies of displaced civilians killed while they were sleeping. \"We were asleep and then suddenly heard the sound of missiles falling around us,\" Mousa (ph) says. \"We could hear the gunfire, the destruction.\" According to the Palestine Red Crescent, at least 100 people were killed overnight but that figure is expected to rise with many still believed to be buried beneath the rubble. At least a dozen residential buildings are said to have been targeted, according to local officials. \"We're civilians. We're not part of a resistance. We haven't taken up arms,\" this man says. \"Look around you, everybody here worked on the land. We're civilians, not fighters.\" Eyewitnesses tell CNN that is really helicopters fired machine guns around the border area, a foreboding warning of what could lie ahead for this city with Israel now threatening to launch a ground offensive on Rafah. \"We were first displays to Khan Yunis where we had many difficult nights\", Nafa (ph) says. \"Then we came to the Egyptian border to Rafah. We can't be displaced anymore.\" The Israeli military has been directed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prepare for a mass evacuation of civilians from Rafah, drawing criticism from many in the international community. The U.N.'s human rights chief warned on Monday that any ground operation could lead to, quote, \"further atrocity crimes by Israel\" with nowhere safe for civilians to flee to.

LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Now, all of this coming as there has been mounting frustration as the war enters its fifth month. President Biden, we are learning, has told advisers that he is frustrated that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not heeding his advice enough when it comes to de-escalating the military operation in Gaza and doing more to alleviate the humanitarian crisis there. We also know that the tension has been intensifying as Israel has been talking about preparing to make a ground incursion into Rafah. We heard the president saying on Monday that civilians there must be protected but other U.S. officials have made clear that they are very skeptical about the idea of evacuating some 1.3 million people that are in Rafah. They said they simply have nowhere to go. So this is expected to be a continuing point of tension, so long as Israel continues to talk about preparations to make a ground incursion into Rafah. We also know that as far as the hostage rescue operation that led to the successful release of two hostages, U.S. officials are concerned about reports of some hundred Palestinians that were killed as a result of that military operation. This is just one more sign of the very high civilian death toll and the humanitarian crisis that the Biden administration continues to speak out against and this will continue to be an area to look at going forward, particularly as the hostage negotiations between all the parties involved continue to move ahead.

And with the pace and intensity of the bombing campaign, many of the places where that support for civilians could have been established has been damaged or destroyed. So there just isn't that much space left in Gaza for that kind of major humanitarian operation to take place. The only place left where such aid could be delivered is Rafah. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
