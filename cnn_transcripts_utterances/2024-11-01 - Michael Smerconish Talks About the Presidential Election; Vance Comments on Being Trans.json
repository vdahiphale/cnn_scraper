And as much as we can try to figure out what they're collectively thinking, my gosh, the number of times that they've surprised us in recent election cycles.But look, Michael, I'm so glad you raised the question of how or whether the polls are capturing accurately what the electorate is going to be, because you rightly point out that mistakes were made in recent previous years. The pollsters have tried to compensate for understanding that there are more sort of hidden Trump voters, right? There is this question, though, Liz Cheney and other female politicians have been out saying there is a secret female vote, right, that there is - are women out there who are not telling their husbands, they're not telling their families, they're not telling the pollsters that they don't like Donald Trump, and that that may make one of those scenarios where Harris wins by a little or by a lot more likely. I want to show you a little bit of how Charlie Kirk and Jesse Waters, two figures on the right, have been talking about this possibility, and get your take. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLIE KIRK, CO-FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: It is the embodiment of the downfall of the American family.

It's the election.(END VIDEO CLIP) HUNT: If you are anxious about the election, rest assured, you are not the only one. In fact, according to a recent poll, seven in 10 Americans report feeling anxious or frustrated about the 2024 presidential campaign. With less than one week to go before the big day, it is hard not to feel tense living in such a divided country with so much at stake. In a new \"Chasing Life\" podcast episode out today, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta helping us learn how to navigate our polarized world by having difficult but oftentimes necessary conversations. And Doctor Sanjay Gupta joins us now. Sanjay, it's so wonderful to see you. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Thanks for having me.",

      "sentences": "Yes, first of all, those clips make you kind of anxious just watching those, right? I mean, I think everyone is certainly feeling this.Let me - let me start with the good news, which is that our bodies and our brains are incredibly biodynamic. So, as stressed or as anxious as you may feel, you can quickly revert as well. And the key is, you know, develop - developing some strategies. One thing - you know, it's interesting, Kasie, I think that there's - there's some evidence, if you talk to evolutionary biologists and stuff, that in some ways humans are sort of hardwired to be suspicious of one another. It's kind of how we survived in our - in our earliest days. That's what the argument often is. And there's this guy, Peter Coleman. He's a - he's a psychologist, and he runs this thing at the - at Columbia University known as the Difficult Conversations Lab, which I just found so fascinating that a lab like that even exists. But I had a chance, as you mentioned, to talk to Peter for the \"Chasing Life\" podcast. Just - I want you to listen to this, and I want to explain it afterward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. PETER T. COLEMAN, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATION, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: You know, there's some neuroscience research that just looks at, you know, when you see a tweet from somebody on the other side that says something you think is inane and you experience a sense of outrage and a kind of taste for retaliation, that it triggers parts in the brain that, you know, are triggered by narcotics. So these are, you know, addictive substances. (END VIDEO CLIP) GUPTA: So, I - the - the argument that he's essentially making is that there's a lot of outrage out there. There's a lot of polarization. And that in some ways we're sort of addicted to it. And he's talking about a part of the brain, when he was just talking about this, known as the amygdala. It sits there. It's sort of the seat of emotions. When it gets fired up, sometimes people want that to happen over and over again. So they - they seek out outrage. So, there's a clue immediately in terms of how to sort of deal with it. But let me just, again, make a little bit more of an optimistic point that most of our human existence, at least early days, we needed to - to cooperate to survive. That's what's really part of our DNA. It wasn't until we started to claim land and claim things and things like that, that we actually started to develop more polarization. So, overall, the odds are on our side, Kasie, in terms of our evolutionary biology.",
