I want people to understand, what Donald Trump did in that courtroom throughout this trial is not just unusual, it is absolutely bizarre and self-destructive. When you're a trial lawyer, you understand the jury is sitting their feet away. They are watching and evaluating everything you do. You are trained that you have to have a poker face.Even if your most important witness goes south, even if the judge makes a terrible ruling for you, you have to act like you're doing just fine because the jury's watching you. And for Donald Trump to sit there muttering out loud in ways the jury can hear, the judge admonishing him for Trump to get up and stand up and walk out during a jury address by the other side is outrageous. And I assure you the jury held that against him. And if I'm his criminal lawyer, I would tell him, look, that's a civil case. Your penalty for acting out there is going to be financial. But when we get into criminal court, the penalty if you do that is going to be much more severe.",

They're going to reject his immunity claim but pull up the document and hit control F and do the find function on the phrase issue the mandate. What that means is, will they send the case back down to the trial court and essentially unfreeze the trial court? Now, the trial court has been what we call stayed, meaning on pause for about seven weeks now.If the mandate issues, it goes back to the trial court, they can try to reestablish a trial date, maybe in April or May. But if the Court of Appeals does not issue that mandate, the trial court remains frozen and Donald Trump will easily be able to run out the clock by asking for rehearing in the court of appeals, then asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take the case.

A new ABC News Ipsos poll found that if it's between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, 37 percent of voters say they would seriously consider a third party candidate. That number peaks to 51 percent among independent women and moderate women alike. In a three way matchup, the latest Reuters poll shows Trump leading with 36 percent, followed by Biden at 30 and Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 8 percent. Other polls have shown Kennedy higher.Last fall, in key battleground states, he was getting about a quarter of the vote in each of them. Political pollster Mark Penn says that one of the biggest threats to Joe Biden's re-election is a viable third party candidate. Politico quoted democratic strategist Doug Sosnik's memo from last June saying \"Trump can't win without a third party candidate dividing the anti-Trump vote. With the exception of winning Georgia in 2016 with 50.77 percent of the vote, Trump never reached 50 percent in any of the competitive states that determined the outcome of the last two presidential elections.\" So far, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will officially appear on Utah's presidential ballot. On Tuesday, his campaign announced they received enough signatures to also appear on New Hampshire's ballot. If his campaign manages to get on all 50 states, where is he likely to pick up some votes? Joining me now is independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Robert, let's talk policy, then we'll talk politics. I want to start with the border, because December, we've just learned, set a record for border crossings. What will you do about that? ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., (I) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'll do -- you know, there's a bunch of things that need to be done to stop the flow at the border, which we need to do. A nation can't have 7 million immigrants coming in undocumented in a three-year period for long. Number one, we need to restore, we need to complete the infrastructure. We need physical barriers, particularly in the urban areas. And you don't need a wall all the way from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego. But you do need physical barriers in the urban areas where migrants can disappear, illegal migrants can disappear very -- in seconds, literally. In the countryside, in the rural areas, in places like Big Bend National Park, you need to have surveillance, you need to have long range cameras, which we had, but the Biden administration took them down. You need sensors, you need lighting systems, and we need good access road. And then we need personnel who are empowered to actually stop the migration at the border on a regulatory. And then we need other -- we need to put asylum judges on the border to adjudicate the cases immediately. In addition to that, we need to revive the Migrant Protection Act, which the Biden administration disavowed, which allows border agent -- empowers border agents to keep asylum seekers in Mexico while they await their asylum determination.

Both are under attack thanks to how realistic artificial intelligence and deep fakes have become.This week fake sexually provocative poses of Swift, likely generated by A.I., went viral on social media. One image was on X and viewed 47 million times before the account was suspended. In Swift's case, the backlash has resulted in a movement called Protect Taylor Swift. But how will we protect the electoral process? This week a fraudulent robocall purporting to be President Joe Biden went out to between 5,000 and 25,000 New Hampshire voters, urging them not to vote in Tuesday's primary and to -- quote -- \"save\" their vote for the election.

There was back in 2016 when the Internet Research Institute, as it is so-called, the IRS in Russia, was known to be carrying on a disinformation campaign to try to sow chaos and, you know, get people up in arms and persuade them on one issue or another. That was a big deal. All of those -- all of those capabilities are still there, but now with A.I. you don't have to be a deep-pocketed organization like this state actor in Russia. The tools that generative A.I. have now enabled put these capabilities in the hands of just about anyone to be able to put out misleading information that is targeted, personalized, and to do it at scale.",

And so, it is open season for this kind of -- and the ability for all these, you know, whether it is somebody that's just a mischief maker or a Super PAC or a foreign power to put this information out.So, the critical thing that we need to do and come together on as a country, whether it is through media like we are doing right now or through official election offices around the country, is to make sure that the public understands where -- that these things are possible but also where to turn to fact check information. This has to be sort of a whole-of-nation response, not in favor of one candidate or another, in favor of one issue or another, but just where to make sure the information that is coming at you is in fact accurate.
