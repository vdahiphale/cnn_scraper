Is his inner circle, though, even buying that? Plus, setting the record straight. The city of Springfield, Ohio, with a message tonight for Trump after he claimed migrants were eating cats and dogs. A top official for Springfield will be OUTFRONT. And more breaking news tonight, rapidly intensing -- intensifying hurricane with winds over 100 miles an hour, making landfall near New Orleans. The intensity of the storm taking everyone by surprise, very sudden intensification. We're going to take you there live. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, two new polls showing Harris momentum. Let's look at Virginia. This is a wide lead now that the vice president has in the polling, 10-point lead. Two months ago, this very same poll that you're looking at with Harris up 10 had Biden down two. So that's 12-point swing in two months. And let's now look at Wisconsin, which is obviously one of the important seven swing states. This one, you can see Kamala Harris is ahead by four points. We say no clear leader because the margin of error is 4.6. This is all polling coming out obviously the 24 hours after that poll. Kamala Harris, obviously, and former President Trump facing off there. Trump using his old playbook on that stage, saying now that he, quote, won the debate. Now, the showdown that probably if you're watching this, you watched, was seen by more than 57 million people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We won the debate according to every poll. Polls are saying that I was -- I won that by 80, 20, 90 -- Jesse said Trump won that debate. That was -- we won that debate by a lot. I won that, too. I won the debate. We won the debate. I won the debate by a lot. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we do know more than 300,000 people were directed from this specific post to a voter registration site. Now, look, you're talking about a few hundred thousand people. I mean, a lot more than that, but even just on that, you know, they went to the link. I mean, remember, Georgia, 10,770 votes and an Arizona even narrower than that. You get the point.

However, talking to a variety of people, one thing is clear, one of the chief objectives of Donald Trump going into the debate was to slow the rise of Kamala Harris, was to slow her a momentum to raise questions about her candidacy.He did not do that. She is entering the final 55 days of this campaign with wind at her back. But more important, an energized base of supporters that helps on fundraising, on volunteer activities. And more important than ever, one of the biggest currencies of course, in politics is confidence. You saw a confident Kamala Harris on the stage last night. So talking to a variety of Trump advisers, they are wondering if he is in a bit of denial about his actual performance at the debate. I was in the spin room last night when he came in and if you went to debate, you do not come in and explain the debate. So in the coming days, advisors are wondering if he will stay consumed by his debate performance or will shake it off to use the Taylor Swift reference there and move forward. Look at where the candidates are going. This is so key. Harris tomorrow will be in North Carolina, two rallies in Charlotte, in Greensboro. Donald Trump is going to Arizona. North Carolina has emerged now as a critical battleground, and I was talking to a Governor Roy Cooper last night. He believes the answers on health care and abortion could help her win that state. We, of course, shall see. But the debate is now over. We'll see if there's a second one. But one thing we do know, Kamala Harris still has that momentum and Trump is on his heels -- Erin.",

It's not like they're being quiet about what they think. I mean, Trey Gowdy, there was a lot more of that sound bite, almost wanted to play the whole thing, you know?

People sort of aligned with that position. And not only was there a broad recognition that Trump had in their words, missed an opportunity. Look, among this consideration that there are still a lot of Republicans that are quite hopeful that Donald Trump will change, will become more disciplined suddenly, he'll become which seems -- seems crazy to me. But there are Republicans who were still hopeful. So what I am hearing at least today, anecdotally, is that if Republicans want to have any prayer for November, and if Donald Trump continues along that trajectory, they have to redouble and focus their efforts on the Senate because the Senate may be the only place where they have an opportunity to really hold onto power and the federal government, that the Senate map is maybe the only chance because the down-ballot effect of that disastrous debate performance more if those, that kind of momentum continues well really have a consequential effect on who runs the government.",

It's going to be young people. It's going to be the Taylor Swift generation that absolutely matters. The fact that voter registration had a surge, people were looking, hey, how do I get registered and make sure that I can show up is actually a big deal and I'm going to tell you why, because Gen Z is coming online now. We've gotten millions of new voters that are coming online for this election. And there are a lot of boomers who are now offline who have passed away, who are not going to be voting.

I don't believe so because of that robust system, but with a storm surge warning within Lake Pontchartrain, other areas, like outside northern Lake Pontchartrain could definitely experienced this storm surge as the southeast of the winds continue to push up that water into the area.And so we need to watch out for that. But this is also working against the rain that's falling on the interior of Louisiana as well. So both of those kind of work together to help rise -- raise the water as they work against each other. The water has nowhere to go, but up. And so, we need to be on high alert for rapidly rising rivers, bayous, canals, and streets within the greater New Orleans metropolitan. But I think the immediate threat right now is the fact that these winds are going to come in fierce. They're going to knock down trees. It's going to take down power and we know that it's been downgraded to a category one, but it still talking winds that are equivalent to a strong, strong category one hurricane.",
