This is THE GLOBAL BRIEF.Ahead on the show, Russia targets military energy and water infrastructure across Ukraine with a new round of missile attacks. Also ahead, mourners leaving flowers at memorial sites across South Korea to honor the 155 lives lost in a Halloween crowd surge. And Lula da Silva reelected president of Brazil, winning the most votes in the country's history. But can the incoming president rebuild a nation plagued by inequality? Hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine's capital right now have no power and no running water after Russia fired a wave of missiles across the country. Moscow claims it's targeting Ukraine's military facilities, but according to Ukrainian officials, the attacks landed on civilian infrastructure. Ukraine's air force says it was able to destroy 90 percent of missiles Russia fired Monday, but the ones that hit caused even more damage to the country's crippled power facilities. Ukraine's energy companies say it is now running out of equipment to repair them. Well, in the meantime, Turkey, Germany, and other nations are urging Russia to re-join the U.N.-brokered green shipment deal. Moscow has suspended its participation, meaning it will not guarantee safe passage for ships leading Ukraine to the Black Sea. Ukraine is buying to carry on sending 12 grain bearing ships to see on Monday despite the risks. Well, our Nic Robertson joins us now live from the capital. Good to see you, Nic. So, drinking water, power, foreign coverage networks, all damage right now in the capital. And dozens cut off. Just give a sense of how people there are dealing with this?",

But, three weeks in the intervening period, Russian strikes on the energy facilities across the country have meant that the system is incredibly weak. So, even the smallest strike has a major impact.

The U.N. has decided with Turkey, along with the U.N. to create the deal and with Ukraine, to go ahead. There are 12 ships that were in the humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea leaving today, one of those on its way to Ethiopia. We seem to be getting a slightly changing or modifying picture from the Russian government. On Sunday, the Russian government said they were suspending, indefinitely, their engagement in the Black Sea grain deal. We know that the U.N. had told the Russians that they were going to go ahead and let some ships use that corridor through the Black Sea today. It wasn't clear earlier in the day precisely how Russia was responding to that. But the very latest that Vladimir Putin has said is that it's suspended -- Russia's involvement is suspended but not ended. It is not entirely clear what he means by that. And when the not ending happens and when the suspension changes back to working with it again. But it does seem at the moment if the U.N.'s decision to push ahead might be causing Russia to pull back from its suspension. But it is far from clear, that is the uncertainty that is going to drive prices up.",

Authorities are accused of failing to have adequate crowd control measures. An official memorial set up in South Korea, they prayed for the loss of so many lives. South Korean officials said Monday that they are investigating what triggered the fatal crush. We want to bring in CNN international correspondent Will Ripley. He joins us from Seoul. And, Will, this situation is beyond heartbreaking. It is hard to get it around your head, how to get your head around the number -- the sheer number of victims, many of whom are young people.

And the logistics of identifying them, which took well over 24 hours, which is actually lightning speed if you consider how many people you're dealing with, some of them without IDs on them and Halloween costumes. But also, the bigger challenge now is wrapping your head around why South Korea and Seoul did not have a contingency plan or manuals to tell police how to handle a situation where you have a very large crowd without one specific organizer. They usually have more police at protests than they did out here where there were 100,000 people tucking their way into this nightclub district. They were packing the way, particularly into that very narrow alley where we now know that so many people have died. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (voice-over):  Each new video from Saturday's crowd crush only adds to the horror. On Monday, the death toll rose to at least 155.

Police say the popular nightclub district packed with around 100,000 people Saturday night. I told you not to go, says this brother in between waves of grief. His sister died on the sidewalk, just steps away from this growing memorial. A small mountain of flowers and emotional tributes to the mostly young lives lost. Around two thirds of them, women from more than a dozen countries. By Monday evening, all of the victims had been identified. Two American students, both college juniors lie among them. Steven Blesi, a college student from Georgia, celebrating the end of midterm exams. He'd only been in South Korea two months. Anne Gieske, a nursing student from Kentucky, her devastated and heartbroken father called her a bright light, loved by all. This is a weeklong period of national mourning. The streets of Itaewon, usually bustling, deserted. As this memorial grows, obviously the anger and the public anger grows as well. Yes, there's grief, and you can feel it, you can cut through the grief with a knife out here. But, there's so many questions about how this could've possibly happen. Incomprehension turning to outrage, why did the city fail to have any guidelines or manuals for events like this, events without a clear organizer. A city, a nation, heartbroken and demanding answers. (END VIDEOTAPE RIPLEY (on camera):  And this memorial itself has become a gathering place where people are expressing their grief, but also their anger against the lack of preparation. It is remarkable though how this has gone from just a handful of flowers on Saturday and Sunday into now this memorial, which actually stretches all the way around here. There is other flowers down the street. There are police as well, police that many people are wondering, saying rather should have been dispatched to keep those young people safe before they ever got packed into that narrow alley were so many lost their lives.",
