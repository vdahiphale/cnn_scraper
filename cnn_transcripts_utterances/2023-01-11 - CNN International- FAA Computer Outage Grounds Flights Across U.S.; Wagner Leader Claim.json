That system provides critical flight safety information to pilots before they take off.We have checked with airports in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and they all tell us there are no related flight cancelations there. The Federal Aviation Administration says it's working on the problem but there's still no word yet on when service might resume. We're going to go to CNN's Martin Savidge now.

      "sentences": "True, Max, it's one of the busiest, but this morning, it is hardly busy at all. Many passengers still trying to figure out how they're going to get to their destination. So this is clearly going to be one of the most difficult travel days domestically, at least that we have seen in some time. And that's taking into account the meltdown that occurred with Southwest Airlines in the holiday travel.Here's what we know. The NOTAM system. That is a Notice to Air Mission. It's basically a messaging system that is relied on heavily in the aviation industry that gives pilots information they need, essentially, for takeoffs to be made aware of there are any safety problems or any issues that they would have to face for their particular flight. That system apparently has suffered a major disruption. And the FAA is saying -- as a result of that, there can be and will not be any domestic departures in the United States until at least 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. And it's possible it could go beyond that point. Now at last check with FlightAware, we've seen at least 2,500 flights across the nation that had been delayed. But every airline is saying that they're being impacted by this that would include domestic carriers like Delta Airlines, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines. And they are all saying essentially, that they are waiting for the FAA to tell them that there has been a fix. The issue that is trying to be developed here is what has caused this problem. Is it just simply a software issue that's gone awry? Was there some update that went the way they didn't expect it to go, or is it something more than a theory? Could it be that someone tried hacking into the system? Did someone hack in and then now is backing up? So as they work to try to restore this system, they are also trying to determine exactly what caused this critical outage at this particular time. The FAA says they were aware of this late last night and they have been working and have they say partially been able to restore in some areas, but it's clear the major impact is still being felt. We don't know for how long. Max?",

Now Ukraine, meanwhile, denies that Russian forces have seized the small mining town just north of Bakhmut and says battles are ongoing.

So pilots must read this. This is the behind-the-scenes system that's already having a huge trickle down on flight delays and cancelations. Just took FlightAware, has gone up by about 1,000 delays nationwide. Now 3,500 in the U.S. The FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration here in the U.S. has put into place a nationwide ground stop. That means that flights cannot take off until after 9:00 a.m. Eastern time, that's 1,400 Zulu or GMT.
