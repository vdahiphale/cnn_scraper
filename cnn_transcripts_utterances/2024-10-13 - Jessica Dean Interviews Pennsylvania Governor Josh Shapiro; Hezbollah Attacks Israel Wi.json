      "sentences": "You're in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Jessica Dean in New York. We are 23 days from Election Day in America and as both candidates sprint toward the finish, momentum appears to be building for Donald Trump among a key demographic, Hispanic voters. According to new polling, presidential support in this year's race is split 56 percent for Harris and 37 percent for Trump.And while she still leads, that is the tightest margin of difference between Trump and his Democratic opponent in the last three presidential election cycles. And remember, this one going to be decided lightly on the margins, so that's where that matters. Trump is in Arizona today where the New York Times-Siena poll also shows a narrow five-point lead for the former president in that state, while Harris is in North Carolina and is planning a stop in Pennsylvania tomorrow. Of course, two states that continue to be within the margin of error. From there, she'll be joined by running mate Tim Walz for a week-long campaign blitz across crucial blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Michigan. Right now, CNN's poll of polls showing the race is deadlocked in those three key battleground states. Overall, CNN's latest polling shows no clear leader with 50 percent of likely voters supporting Harris and 47 percent for Trump. Joining me now is the Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro. Governor, thanks so much for being here with us. GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Great to be with you, Jess. I know you are in Georgia right now. You're about to get on a bus tour of the Blue Wall states, including your own home state of Pennsylvania. I want to start with this new polling that continues to show an even tighter presidential race than what we were seeing even just a week ago. There are some Democrats being very vocal, others speaking on background, but they're worried about Harris's momentum. They think the race is plateaued. They're concerned voters still don't see how she's different than President Biden. What do you think?",

So it shouldn't shock anyone that the polls are within a point or so or even a dead heat. These are close races, but the stakes are incredibly high. The contrast is clear.And I'll tell you what, I would much rather be us than them. I think we've got momentum. And look, I'm a sports guy. I would much rather have our team on the floor for the final two minutes of the game, standing with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.",

You mentioned just how close the last two presidential elections were. You won in your race in 2022 with the most votes ever for a Pennsylvania statewide candidate. A lot of people look to you as a model for how to win that state.Now you were running against a candidate that was pretty weak, but nonetheless you did quite, quite well, a record amount of votes.

The election results the last couple of times have been really close. Again, a point or less. And so I think what folks need to do is not worry about what those polls show, but just keep working.And what I'm seeing on the ground is real enthusiasm for Kamala Harris. Folks not only pledging to vote for her, or maybe even some have voted for her by mail already. But they're showing up at the local office and taking a shift and going out and knocking on doors in rural areas where maybe Democrats haven't performed as well in the past. They're taking a lawn sign. They're putting it on their lawn. They're hanging it on their barns and they're really giving a permission slip to their friends and their neighbors. That's big and that momentum, that energy is something that's worth a little bit at the end here. And that's why, as I said before, I'd much rather be us than them.",

I interviewed women in Bucks County, of course, for people watching that haven't been there, at key collar county where Democrats have seen a lot of pickup from maybe Republicans who developed a distaste for Trump.And those women, Governor, were saying they were going to vote on that issue alone. Now, that was two years ago. Do you think that that issue remains such a potent driver in this election two years on? SHAPIRO: I do think rights and freedoms are on the ballot, and I think it's very much on people's minds along with other issues, including the economy, certainly. Rights and freedoms are on the line, and Donald Trump has a proven track record of ripping away people's rights and freedoms and a blueprint in this Project 2025 for how to limit people's freedoms even more going forward. Look, Jessica, Laura and I are blessed with four children. Our oldest is our daughter. Our daughter, Sophia, was born into this world with more rights than she has today simply because Donald Trump was president of the United States. He bragged about how he ripped away the freedom for women to just simply be able to make decisions over their own bodies, to start a family on their own timeline and their own terms, to have a full range of medical care across this country. That is something that people have rejected time and time again in elections. We've seen that in Pennsylvania. And I believe it will continue to be a motivating issue, and people will reject the candidate, in this case Donald Trump, who wants to further restrict and limit our freedoms.",

And if again, it may take some time again to get that all done, a couple of questions within this. Just how long do you think it will take to know those results? And secondly, the longer that goes on, the risk for a disinformation campaign for outright lies for conspiracy theories to be spread really gross.

Vance and others along with him. That is incredibly dangerous for our democracy. And it's really disrespectful to the Democratic, Republican and Independent clerks of elections in our 67 counties who are doing this hard work on behalf of their neighbors to fairly and accurately count the vote.Listen, in 2020, we had a free and fair, safe and secure election. Donald Trump and his allies took me to court. I was the attorney general back then, 43 different times to either try and stop certain people from voting and then to try and stop certain votes from being counted. He went 0 and 43. I went 43 and 0. And the will of the people was protected and respected in Pennsylvania. If Donald Trump wants to again spread mis and disinformation, we will meet that. We will share the truth of what is going on, and we will push back against his dangerous rhetoric, and we will push back against him in court, if need be, again. I think in terms of the count, it is important to note that Republican and Democratic clerks of election all across Pennsylvania asked lawmakers in Pennsylvania to allow them to do something many other states do, states led by Republicans and Democrats, called pre-canvass, which is effectively to process the mail-in ballots ahead of time so that on election night you're able to spit out the results quickly. And by the way, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were for that until Donald Trump told Republicans to be against it. Why did he do that? He did that because he wants to create chaos in our system. Now, we were able to make some changes since 2020, which requires our 67 counties, once they begin counting the morning of Election Day, to keep counting, that they can't stop counting. And so that should speed up the process. But unfortunately, we're not gonna get the process done as quickly as we'd like, because Donald Trump stuck his neck out and told Republicans, do not support something that had broad bipartisan support, simply because he wants more chaos in our system. Remember, he's not looking out for everybody else, he's only looking out for himself.",

She wants to be able to have the good things that came from Joe Biden without any of the baggage that comes from Joe Biden. And I think if you look specifically at what most Americans are concerned about, the issues on the southern border, the chaos that has erupted on the global stage after Joe Biden took the oath of office and said they were going to be the return to normalcy administration, I think those are real concerns that Democrats, as much as they want to, point the finger at President Trump.

It has been the stammering of the economy, even if you believe the economy is getting better. It is the fact that we now have rockets being fired from Iran directly into Israel, Yemen on fire, the first war of expansion in Europe since World War II.The fact that, yes, Democrats should be talking about President Trump's rhetoric on Haiti, I think it has been unhelpful, but many of the Haitians that have come to this country are a direct result of one of the largest intelligence failures in modern history, with the president of Haiti being assassinated on the watch of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, with co-conspirators living in Tampa Bay, Florida and Miami, Florida. So, these are all things that have gone wrong on their watch. And in my humble opinion, it would probably have been better for Democrats to say, many things have gone wrong, but we don't believe Donald Trump can do the job.

It's key to our democracy and making sure that everyone participates. And laying question and doubt now into the next election that hasn't even happened yet is -- to say it's unpresidential is an understatement, but it's a complete affront to our Constitution and our democracy. And so, you know, we saw him do this and he still hasn't agreed to the outcome of the 2020 election, but to lay down and have others right now laying doubt into the upcoming election is totally irresponsible and outrageous.
