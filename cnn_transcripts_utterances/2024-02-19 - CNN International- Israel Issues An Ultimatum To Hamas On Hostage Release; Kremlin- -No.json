Just ahead, Israel sets a deadline for the release of hostages before it expands its military operations in Rafah. We are live here in Tel Aviv. Their claims, he went for a walk, fell ill, and collapsed, now the family of Alexey Navalny says they can't even get access to his body. And the Russian flag rises over the fallen Ukrainian town of Avdiivka, a stark reminder of the challenges Kyiv's troops are facing as U.S. aid dries up. Israel is issuing a warning and a deadline to Hamas. War Cabinet Minister, Benny Gantz, says forces will expand military operations into the southern Gaza city of Rafah where displaced Palestinians are taking refuge if Hamas doesn't return the remaining hostages by Ramadan. The holy Muslim month is expected to fall on the second week of March. There is growing international concern that the roughly 1.5 million people sheltering there will have nowhere else to go. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us now from Tel Aviv with the latest developments. Was he speaking for the government? Can we expect this deadline to stand?",

Pre-October 7, Benny Gantz (ph) was the biggest political rival to Prime Minister Netanyahu. So, if he is in the war cabinet and he is saying this, this is something that you can be pretty sure. The Prime Minister has already signaled his absolute intent to continue to what he calls absolute victory. He says that the people of Rafah can go and find safety and shelter further north, though, as we saw over the weekend, families leaving Rafah. They went to central Gaza, found themselves being bombed by Israeli aircraft there.So, there is no particular safe places for people to go to in Gaza right now. The government says it's not going to launch this military operation into Rafah until they've safely evacuated the citizens there, the roughly 1.5 million citizens there. It's not clear what that plan looks like, how they'll actually manage to do it, how they'll provide food and shelter for all those people, even if that's something that they plan to do. But, this is a very clear line being taken by Benny Gantz. He says Hamas has a choice. If they want their citizens in Gaza to enjoy the holy month of Ramadan, which begins 10th or 11th of March, fairly soon, then they need to hand over the hostages. It's a message that the government is trying to impress upon the families of those hostages as well, because a lot of those families have given up believing the government genuinely wants to prioritize them over and above defeating Hamas. So, his message was in part to those families as well, is to Hamas.",

You were just mentioning the south where apparently there have been renewed offensive efforts by the Russians there near the Zaporizhzhia front which is a very long one, which is also the place where the Ukrainians actually conducted their massive counteroffensive that started in the summer of last year, which then obviously fizzled. It looks as though the Russians are now trying to win back some of that territory.However, Max, of course, the big story from the weekend was the Russians managing to take the town of Avdiivka, which actually has been in Ukrainian hands throughout the entire time since 2014, since the Russians and Russian-affiliated militias first entered that area and took parts of eastern Ukraine. So, certainly, something that the Russians are celebrating as a big win. The Ukrainians, for their part, however, are saying that they inflicted massive casualties on the Russians as they were moving forward. The talk is of destroying hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles, and killing thousands, if not, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers the Ukrainians say were in many cases assaulting without any sort of protection. So, it seems as though from the Ukrainian perspective, they have lost this town and obviously is a pretty big loss for them. But, they also said they inflicted massive casualties on the Russians as the Russians were moving forward. So, right now, we have a situation, Max, where the Russians are pressing on several sectors of the eastern front. The Ukrainians, you were just mentioning that the Ukrainians were outgunned. They certainly also are outmanned also on the front lines as well. They say they hope to be able to fight back at some point, but for now, a very difficult situation for the Ukrainian military, Max.",

Of course, this alludes to the fact that the President has said and he says he believes that it is only because of a small faction (ph) of extreme House Republicans that funding for Ukraine is currently stalled.But, even if that is the case, that is certainly the political reality that is sort of haunting President Biden right now that these House Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, is declining to bring up for consideration in the House a national security supplemental package that includes some $60 billion for Ukraine aid.",

It comes amid reports of a Houthi attack on a cargo ship on Sunday that forced the crew to abandon the vessel. The Houthis claim the ship is now in danger of sinking in the Gulf of Aden.

So, the U.S. military saying in a statement that it struck five targets in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen on Saturday, three anti-ship cruise missiles, one drone boat and one underwater drone. The military saying in a statement that this is the first time that they have seen the Houthis use this kind of underwater drone, essentially a submarine drone. Now, they didn't provide us a whole lot of detail here. So, we don't know at this point how the U.S. was able to identify that system, how many of them the Houthis might have, and what specific threat that system might pose to both commercial shipping and military ships in the region.It's certainly an underwater drone, one would presume would be more difficult to detect and destroy. So, this may be a shift in Houthi strategy because they haven't yet been successful in hitting a U.S. Navy ship. But, these strikes on Saturday were just a -- of a piece with a series of U.S. military strikes against the Houthis, which is this Iran-backed group in Yemen that has been carrying out now dozens of attacks since the onset of the conflict in Gaza in October in what it says is retaliation -- or sorry -- solidarity with the Palestinian cause there. And so, the U.S. -- the attacks -- the strikes on Saturday in fact followed another round of strikes by the U.S. on Friday, also destroying two anti-ship cruise missiles or an anti-ship cruise missile and a surface drone, a drone ship as well. So, the big question is, will the accumulation of these U.S. retaliatory strikes against the Houthis have the effect that the U.S. is hoping, which is deterring additional attacks? Right now, Houthi attacks continue at the same pace that they have been for months, and the leaders saying that they have no intention of stopping their attacks on commercial shipping until the Israelis are out of Gaza.",

They need to have guarantees of safety where they end up seeking refuge, and then they need to be guaranteed their right to return home and ability to return home once hostilities have ended.
