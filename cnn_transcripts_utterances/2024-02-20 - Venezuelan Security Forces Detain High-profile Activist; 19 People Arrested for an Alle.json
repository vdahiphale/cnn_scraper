      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to our viewers joining us from around the world, and everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Anna Coren, live from Hong Kong.Just ahead: Just days after his death, Alexey Navalny's widow vows to continue his fight. Outmanned, outgunned with Russian troops on the advance. Ukraine could be in one of its most precarious positions since the war began. And human rights activists sound the alarm after new arrest by the Maduro government. Ahead, concerns that a new era of repression is emerging in Venezuela. For three days now, the mother of the now dead Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, says she has tried to retrieve her son's body from a hospital morgue, only to be refused each time. Navalny's spokesperson says officials went 14 days for a chemical examination to determine cause of death, sparking accusations of a Kremlin cover up. Now, we should know, she didn't provide evidence for her claims. Navalny's widow has vowed to take up her husband's cause and will fight for a happy beautiful Russia. The 47-year-old opposition leader died suddenly on Friday in an Arctic penal colony, seemingly in good spirits one day, earlier, in a video court appearance. More now from CNN CHIEF Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance reporting from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Despite the risks, Russians are publicly grieving at Alexey Navalny's death. In Moscow, a steady stream of mourners laying flowers for the late opposition leader. Across Russia, rights activists say hundreds have been detained for just this. My hero has died, this man told us. I grew up watching and learning from him. So, it feels like a personal loss, he says. This woman tells us, she desperately wants Russia to change. But now we're at a dead end, she says. With sorrow, grief, and pain. You feel that pain more than Navalny's own family. And his widow, Yulia, here meeting outraged European leaders, is vowing to expose what she says are her husband's killers, and to assume his opposition mantle. YULIA NAVALNAYA, WIFE OF ALEXEY NAVALNY (through translator): I will continue Alexey Navalny's work. I will keep fighting for our country and I encourage you to stand by my side. To share not only grief and the endless pain that has enveloped us and does not let go. I'm asking you to share my rage, anger, hatred for those who dared to kill our future. CHANCE (voice over): Meanwhile, the Russian president, expected to be reelected next month, has yet to mention the unexplained death of his fiercest critic. But the Kremlin refusing to comment, while it says investigations are underway. Even recovering Navalny's remains in Russia is proving painstaking. His elderly mother, Lyudmila, has traveled nearly 2,000 miles to the remote Arctic region where he died in prison, has been told, according to Navalny's spokeswoman, that postmortem tests in the body won't be released for at least another two weeks. Plenty of times, say Navalny supporters deeply suspicious of the Kremlin, for the real cause of this sudden tragic death to be hidden. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Borrell indicated that Russian prison officials tied to Navalny's death, could face arrest -- could face asset freezes and travel bans.

And at the same time, we will continue watching how the war is, it about two years that Putin launched this war against Ukraine. And it doesn't look they're being ready to stop it, by the contrary. So, in both fronts, in the political one, and the military one, you have to continue our support to Ukraine, and to the Russian people who want to be living in freedom.

So, I will just in a second, what Garry Kasparov, the chess champion, and a leading Russian opposition activist has said that the best way to punish Putin, including for the death of Navalny is by actually getting this aid package approved in Congress and for the Europeans to ratchet up their production of weapons to send to Ukraine.

That see Vladimir Putin and his coterie as sort of like-minded souls and would like to have something similar to what Vladimir Putin has in Russia. In the United States. Tucker Carlson has recently said that, you know, well, politicians kill. I mean, this is just the reality of life. This is quite sickening to see to, you know, a party of Ronald Reagan saying these things. My hope, and the Ukrainians hope is that, you know, reason will prevail. There is still a majority in the U.S. Congress supporting Ukraine, but they just simply don't have -- we don't have the time to wait for this. We're already seeing how Russia is trying to capitalize on the capture of Avdiivka, and to, you know, push elsewhere. You know, this is a very critical moment.

It's, you know, we see that Putin is trying to capitalize on the momentum. He's got his election, or I would just call it recoronation in the middle of March, March 17.And his military commanders are trying their hardest, their damnest, to present him with some significant victories. What let's also not exaggerate what happened in Avdiivka. This is the second or the second such victory in the last year after Bakhmut. This is the city the Russians have essentially been fighting to capture for the last 10 years. Once again, the world's second largest army tried to get a city of about pre-war population of 30,000. Ukrainians would not only be able to hold their defense lines, but recapture all their territory if the West only stopped prevaricating, hesitating, stop caring about Vladimir Putin's red lines, and give Ukraine what it needs.",

Well, we were just talking about Avdiivka and Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited troops near Kupiansk on Monday to boost morale after a devastating defeat in that eastern town. Zelenskyy thanks to the soldiers for their service and told them \"I am confident in you.\" But he also issued a plea for help amid a shortage of supplies and funding. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Right now, the situation is extremely difficult in several parts of the front line, where Russian troops have amassed maximum reserves. They are taking advantage of the delays in aid to Ukraine, and these are very tangible issues. There is a deficit of artillery, there is a need for frontline air defense, and for a longer range of our weapons. Well, Ukraine is watching for the Kremlin's next move after Russian troops took control of Avdiivka, over the weekend. Ukraine had defended the strategic town for 10 years, as Peter said before pulling out. Well, joining us now from London is CNN's Clare Sebastian. Clare, the fall of this town, Ukraine's eastern front, especially in that Donetsk region now appears quite vulnerable with this renewed Russian momentum. What towns villages are now most at risk?",

But Russia is now on the attack, not just in this region, really emboldened really taking advantage of this moment, where Western weapons supplies to Ukraine have been waning, largely because of the stalling in the U.S. Congress of new funding. There's two other major hotspots right now, up in the north, in Kharkiv region, where we saw President Zelenskyy visiting, trying to boost the morale of troops there, and quite significantly, down in the south in the Zaporizhzhia region, where Russia is essentially attacking in the area, where Ukraine was able to take a small amount of territory, a very small amount in what is largely believed to have been their field counter offensive last year. Take a look at this video. This comes from the Ukrainian command in the West. They have posted a video showing the intensity of the fighting in that Zaporizhzhia region. They said it was a difficult night. This video came out just in the last hour or so, but they are managing to repel, they say the Russian attacks. Now, this is the moment that we're at: Russia is the one attacking Ukraine is digging in, trying to defend, trying to hold on while it waits for more Western weapons supplies. And it's not new territory, it should be noted as well, Russia, both in the north and the south, attacking in areas that Ukraine has previously recaptured, in counter offensive. So, you see the nature of this war, this back and forth in terms of territory changing hands here, Anna.",

It was designed to save the lives of soldiers that are going to come back and hit harder.But the reality is, and this is a video of one of a group of soldiers from Ukraine 110th Separate Mechanized Brigade, who were injured and had to be left behind. He is seen here talking to his sister. You can see her emotion in that video. He said, both his legs were broken, he had shrapnel in his back. There was nothing he could do. Now, they -- that group of soldiers and other one spoke to his wife, they had expected to be captured by Russians. There was even a suggestion that the 100th Brigade had spoken to the Russian side, tried to negotiate, that they will be captured and then eventually exchanged in a prisoner swap. But a video posted by a Russian military blogger just a day later showed their bodies later identified by families. The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office has now opened an investigation into that. So, a snapshot really of the reality on the ground.

Security Council, Russia, for example, who could very easily veto that as well. And they may not be alone in doing so. But what the U.S. is proposing is a temporary ceasefire as soon as is practically -- as practicable in its words. And the reason that he's proposing this along with the release of all the 100 Israeli hostages who were kidnapped as part of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October the 7th. The reason it is saying this is because it wants to forestall an Israeli ground operation in Rafah, which it is warning could lead to additional displacement of Palestinians and have implications for peace and security in the region. If that displacement leads to Palestinians spilling over the border into Egypt. Egypt has already said that potentially Palestinians going over into Egypt, as a result of an Israeli operation could jeopardize the decades old peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. So, the U.S. very concerned about that. And what we also had, interestingly, on Monday was comments by Benny Gantz, who is a member of the war Cabinet. He's a former chief of the general staff, a former defense minister, saying that for the first time during a direct line between this potential Rafah operation and the hostage situation, saying that if all hostages are not released in time for Ramadan on March the 10th, then, that ground operation, Anna, will proceed.",

But Russia has been really instrumental for Venezuela, as Venezuela has sought to basically circumvent U.S. sanctions, especially those related to the energy sector where Russia is also very prevalent. At the same time, Russia sees the relationship as one of political relevance in the sense that it sees Venezuela as -- having good relationship with Venezuela is a way of making a point to the U.S. of basically, I am also very present to your neighborhood. And at the same time, Venezuela has become really instrumental in multilateral firms like United Nations, basically supporting all the lines and positions of Russia. So, I think there's a balance here. There was the hope that, with the U.S.-Venezuela agreement last year, Venezuela would basically diminish it its relationship with Moscow.
