Set the bar.All right, with us now, May Mailman, former White House associate counsel under Donald Trump, and Joe Trippi, Democratic strategist and senior adviser to The Lincoln Project. I want to put some faces up so people can see, so far, what Donald Trump's announcements for who he wants in his cabinet and his administration looks like. You can see that those are the folks that Donald Trump has named so far. And by and large, there are some exceptions. Pretty white, pretty male. By Politico's count, only five women, so far, and one person of color compared to what Joe Biden's were four years ago. And granted, this was by the end. By January, Biden had 11 women and 11 people of color. We may have a screen for that also. But May, what about that? Look, I mean, Donald Trump likes to claim that this victory for a Republican had more participation for people with color than a lot of Republicans have ever had. So why not put a few in the cabinet or more women for that matter? MAY MAILMAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ASSOCIATE COUNSEL UNDER DONALD TRUMP (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. I guess I'm surprised we're even talking about this because the American people voted precisely against this -- about dividing us and labeling us on the basis of our race and our sex. And instead, we just want the government and the economy to work for us. We are less interested in what somebody looks like and what their sex is, and we are far more interested in whether they are going to execute the president's agenda and whether they are going to unleash American business. Whether they're going to weaponize the Department of Justice against people who don't agree with them politically. Against businesses that don't agree with them politically. And so this is the thing. If a woman were to be put in a spot because she is a woman, she would never be respected. If we are going to celebrate things on the basis of diversity, then you can't gain the respect that you want and you deserve. If the president puts someone somewhere it is because he trusts them. He thinks that they are going to do a great job. And that -- for Linda McMahon, that is empowering. For Kristi Noem, that is empowering. And that is what people want. That's what people voted for.",

They spoke to someone named Brian Kozlowski, a 40-year-old lawyer in Orlando, who said, \"It's an actual fulfillment of a politician dispensing with the norms. The number one thing to me, and a lot of Trump voters, is getting rid of the swamp.

That is a feeling that there is a class -- there is an elitist, multiple-degreed class that is sitting there operating more than two million government employees, and what are we getting for it?And so I think that is why people are so excited about DOGE -- government efficiency. It's not about creating chaos; it's creating streamlined efficiencies. Creating a government that works for the people. And yes, that is disruptive, but it's disruptive in the right direction. It's disruptive in the sense that we don't -- nobody elected these bureaucrats. Nobody elected the halls of these -- well, nobody goes to work anymore. But nobody elected the empty halls of the USDA.
