And it's the complicated issues of Ukraine as well which they really don't want to do. I mean it is a - it's a complex situation. I mean there's a world here where somehow the Congress winds up doing Ukraine and not the border, and the people who are arguing against this deal, without having seen the text, are going to have a lot of explaining to do at that point. So, my advice to the Republicans, take it all. Take the win. You've got Joe Biden on his knees.

He continues with, \"I am leave with love, peace, and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.\" Poppy, we're also getting a clearer understanding of the timeline of events here from witnesses and from a statement from the attorney general. From the moment that the nitrogen gas started to flow, up until his death, that took about 28 minutes. Witnesses say that Smith appeared conscious for several minutes. He struggled in his gurney that he was strapped down to for around two minutes. And then his breathing slowed down. CNN was the first to speak with his spiritual adviser, Reverend Jeff Hood, who was in that execution chamber. And he was shaken and emotional based on what he saw. He called it absolute torture. He said that the mask was strapped so tightly on Smith's face that there were indentations. He said that it was not painless as state officials would argue -- had argued that it would be, and that Smith was struggling against the gurney, struggling against the mask, gasping, and his face turned colors. Now, the state has touted this as a success. Governor Kay Ivey says that the execution was lawfully carried out. Poppy. HARLOW: And what is the - his victim's family saying, before we go, Isabel?",
