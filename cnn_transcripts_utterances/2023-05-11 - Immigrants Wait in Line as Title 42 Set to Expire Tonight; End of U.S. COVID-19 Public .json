When it comes to testing and treatments and vaccines, some of those things that have been covered as part of the emergency will now have to be paid either out of the pocket or by your insurance, and depending what kind of insurance you have, you can find that out. Testing and all that, you know, you could get free tests for the last couple of years, you know, same thing with treatments. Vaccines, those are still going to be available in large part, Sara, because the government bought so many vaccines and a lot of people still haven't used them.

We don't believe she is alive, but we're asking if anyone can tell us where her remains are, we will give them $250,000.Joran van der Sloot heard about that. And so, he contacted someone close to the family and said, look, I will tell you exactly what happened. I will lead you to the body in Aruba, but I want the $250,000 cash. A deal was struck, he agreed to $25,000 cash down payment. And so, an associate with the family went to Aruba and he said that she died because they were together, he wanted to leave, she didn't want him to leave. And so, he threw her to the ground, her head hit a rock, and she died. He secreted (ph) the body, hid it, his father buried it, he took a car and said that's where the body's buried. He later sent an e-mail saying, I lied. None of that is true. I'm not telling you the truth about Natalee. He then took that $25,000 cash that had been wired to him, he went to Peru, believed he gambled with that money, met Stephany Flores, and I was there in Peru for all of those legal proceedings, and within hours Stephany Flores was dead in her apartment. He was charged and convicted of murder. While the U.S. charges for extortion and wire fraud -- and while I was in Peru, Peruvian authorities said, we promise that after he serves a number of years, based on our treaty and based on justice, we will send him to the United States, and that is what is beginning right now.",

On May 7, 2021, two friends of Trevor Mullinax called police, asking them to, basically, do a wellness check. Saying, they just wanted to make sure their buddy was OK. They warned police that he may have a knife in his truck and was concerned and worried, potentially, suicidal about an outstanding arrest warrant. They again, though, reiterated this is just a wellness check. This video you're about to see is extremely difficult to watch and to hear. It is what happened when the police arrived on scene.
