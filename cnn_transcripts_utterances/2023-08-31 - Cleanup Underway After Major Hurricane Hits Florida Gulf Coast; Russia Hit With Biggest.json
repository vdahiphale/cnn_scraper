And good morning, Omar.Yes, the latest update from the National Hurricane Center still has the winds at 60 miles per hour, but they are gusting up around 70 miles per hour. The forward movement still pretty quick at about 21 miles per hour. We still have quite a significant amount of people without power right now. Overall, the bulk of them are across Georgia and Florida, but even through the Carolinas, if you add all of it together, you are looking at roughly 300,000 people. They are still looking at very heavy rain as the system begins to make its way over the Atlantic. And again areas of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina still dealing with some of the showers and thunderstorms. No active warnings at the moment, but we have had several tornado warnings and severe thunderstorm warnings overnight and still possible for the morning hours today. Flooding is certainly the most widespread concern. You've got several flash flood warnings here across portions of North Carolina and it is no surprise when you look at how much rain has fallen in just really the last 24 hours, this huge swathe of orange and red color, you are talking 4 to 6 inches. But you will notice here, this red and even the purple color right near the North and South Carolina border, you are talking at least 10 inches of rain has fallen and remember, some of these areas are still dealing with additional rain this morning. Hampton, South Carolina, portions of Florida, Georgia, and even North Carolina, all picking up some pretty significant amounts of rainfall in just the last 24 hours. The forecast does show continued rainfall through the morning across North Carolina and Virginia before finally starting to see the bulk of that rain begin to exit later on today, and especially once we get through the evening hours. Overall, some of these areas still expecting perhaps an additional two, maybe even as much four or five inches of rain, Omar, on top of what they have already had. So again, you are talking significant amounts of water which is why the flash flooding will still be a primary concern for today.",

As you mentioned, just this morning yet another attempted drone attack according to local authorities targeting Moscow, the capital in Russia.Of course, as you mentioned there, another three drones reportedly shot down in the Russian region of Bryansk. Now, Russian authorities say their air defenses have been successful in thwarting these attacks, and this comes just a day after the largest drone assault we've seen on Russian territory since the beginning of the war. Now, of course, it is important to note that Ukrainian authorities typically do not acknowledge or admit responsibility for such attacks. In fact, we've heard from an adviser to the presidential office saying that Ukraine adheres to its strict orders not to use such weapons supplied by its partners against Russian territory. But we have seen a sharp increase in these drone attacks. This is becoming a key element in the war between Russia and Ukraine. Of course, we saw multiple regions targeted on Wednesday by these drone attacks, causing some infrastructural damage. And four military aircrafts sustained damage as a result of these drone attacks. And several airports in Russia forced to temporarily close. So this is having an impact and we've heard in the past from Ukrainian authorities, again, while not directly claiming responsibility for such drone attacks, they have said that they will continue to see an increase in the scale and range of such attacks, so long as Russian troops remain on Ukrainian land and in Ukrainian waters. And, of course, we've heard from an adviser to the president who has said that the war is increasingly moving toward Russian territory. This is becoming a key factor within the war and, of course, as drone become use ever more by the Ukrainian authorities, we could potentially see further attacks against Russian territory.",

Here's part of his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CEDRIC RICHMOND, BIDEN CAMPAIGN CO-CHAIRMAN:  While they talk about age, we'll talk about the things that Americans are talking about and that's kitchen table issues.

And if the alternative is Donald Trump, a lot of the Democrats won't necessarily turn on him just because of his age. That being said, if Republicans were to nominate a younger candidate which again does not seem to be the case right now, that could really kind of change, you know, the math here when it comes to the more moderate voter or independent voter who might think that younger -- you know, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, could do a better job than Biden is if it comes down to that.",

So this is a good moment for his campaign to kind of take on that and say, you know, this is real, that is happening and so maybe that is a message that he can use.

And just before this military coup, he had been announced the win for a third time of a seven-year term. Now, these military men who've taken over say that election has been voided and they shut down the country's borders and dissolved all institutions because they think that election was a sham election.
