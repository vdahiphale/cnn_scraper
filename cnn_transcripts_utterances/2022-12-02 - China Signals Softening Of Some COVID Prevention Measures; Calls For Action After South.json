      "sentences": "They've had an impact, definitely. The same protests, if they had occurred three months ago, would not have had this impact.That's because Xi Jinping did not get through the party Congress and had not yet secured his third term, hadn't yet packed the senior leadership in the Chinese Communist Party with his proteges and loyalists. So he is in a stronger position now to back away from a policy he has personally been very strongly identified with. But to be clear, these demonstrations were not organized by some opposition group or by students mobilizing across the country. This was spontaneous anger with extremely challenging conditions on top of poor implementation. As you saw with the horrible apartment fire that killed over 10 Chinese and the firemen couldn't put it out because of the quarantine environment because they were locked out. So, yes, I think that the Chinese government is backing down a little bit. They still have serious concerns about what happens if their hospitals are overwhelmed. The most recent and best studies the Chinese government has done implies, if they just let it run, with American-type policies or European-type policies, they would end up with one to five million Chinese dead. So they're not out of the woods yet. But they are going to make it easier for the average Chinese to live their lives.",

This is very different from what we are seeing in Iran where their demonstrations and the supreme leader says we won't listen to the people at all or Russia, where their demonstrations, people get arrested and they just proceed with intensifying the war in Ukraine.The Chinese government definitely uses a stick when they see people demonstrating. The police visit the people, and they will either be taken off the streets or told, if you do this one more time, and we're watching you, we know where your phone is, we have surveillance on your face, on your body, you will be arrested. So you're not going to see these demonstrations again next week, irrespective of how angry people still are. But it's meaningful that the Chinese government also shows they will respond. And Xi Jinping won't stand up and say mea culpa. He's going to blame local-level overzealous officials for poor implementation of his policy. And there may be some officials in some of these cities who end up having to fall on their swords as a consequence. But it is meaningful that popular pressure in China has an impact.",

This is one of the first studies to look at the physical changes in the brain that the stress and anxiety created. What does it show? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. First, a lot of people, this is going to sound family. The symptoms that the teenagers have had over the past few years. I have three teenagers at home. We have lived with this, as a lot of people have. The symptoms of anxiety and depression have been going up even before the pandemic but were then accelerated significantly. This is a study that looked at that first year of the pandemic. What they found is exactly what you're saying, is that there were definitive changes in the brain. I'm going to show you this here in a second. But the study was going on even before the pandemic started. They were scanning adolescent brains every couple of years. When the pandemic happened, they continued the study to figure out, we have scans before the pandemic, in the pandemic, what happened? They found that the cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain, sort of like the bark on a tree, thinned. Got thinner. That is something you typically see with aging. Also, if you look inside the brain, near the brain stem, this area, which is responsible for your ability to regulate your emotions, for example, that also aged more quickly. So there was these definitive areas that changed out of proportion to what you might expect during that same period of time. Our brains age, clearly. All of our brains age as we age. But it was that accelerated aging they were seeing in that year of 2020 that got the attention of researchers.",

But also internalized problems typically mean, you know, things that are -- sadness, low self-esteem, difficulty regulating emotions as opposed to externalizing symptoMs, violence, aggression, rule-breaking behavior. They didn't see a change in those externalizing symptoms as much as these internalizing symptoms. Two things to point out. One is we don't know, is this a trajectory now or is this something that comes and will return to a normal state? I should also point out, in addition to the stress and anxiety of the pandemic and people being more isolated, there was the virus itself. And about 10 percent of the people in the study in 2020 had been infected with COVID. And we know COVID has an impact on the brain as well. So in some people, at least, it could be a combination of both those things.",

In 2020, when I was part of the primary process with Elizabeth Warren's campaign, we saw that voters left without confidence in the first standing.

The Iowa caucus, I'm going to be very honest, in 2020, it was not the most, you know, positive experience for a lot of candidates. And that tends to happen.And I'm on TV talking about this a lot. But a lot of us come out of the Iowa caucus and have a conversation in media. A lot of pundits and news, anchors, a lot of journalists, we have this conversation about what voters may or may not want. And so by the time a candidate gets to a primary three or four weeks later down the road, the media has kind of already made the case for who the nominee should be. And that might influence voters. So if we shake things up a bit, have more diverse states go earlier, maybe we'll have the voters setting the tone and the narrative instead of people like myself or the journalists, us, making the case of who will be the nominee based on those early predictions from a state who doesn't have much say in a general election.",
