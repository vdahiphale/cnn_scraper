Civilians say Israeli forces roll through with bulldozers and trucks, tearing up streets and damaging vital infrastructure. And this is the devastation that many woke up to this morning in the Jenin refugee camp. After 24 hours of Israeli attacks, it says we're meant to destroy terrorist facilities and weapons. Palestinian militants have been fighting back with stones and guns, and Palestinian officials say, at least, 10 people have been killed, and almost 100 injured. This is the second Israeli raid into Jenin in little more than two weeks, and is much more intense. The first left five Palestinians dead. CNN's Hadas Gold has been following this story and has more now from Jerusalem.

All of them infrastructure targets it says. And it says it continues to confiscate weapons and to destroy weapons production facilities. And this operation is ongoing. Now, we've seen some more than 3,000 people according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, leaving Jenin refugee camp. We saw some of those image -- images there before. Israel also noting that it says that it is coordinating with the Palestinian Authority to try to get water and electricity restored to the camp. At the same time, it says that the devastation you see of the roads there with the bulldozers tearing up the streets was in order to remove improvised explosive devices, which it says were in the streets there. So, this operation continues. The death toll, as you say is 10, so far. Israel says that at least nine of those were militants and the injured, according to the Palestinians is around about 100, with 20 of them seriously injured. Now, the Palestinian Authority, we've heard the condemnation there from Mahmoud Abbas, the Jordanians, Egyptians, and the Emiratis have also condemned this incursion. The United States, for its part has reiterated its support for Israel's right to defend itself while highlighting the need to avoid civilian casualties. But, of course, the danger is that as this operation continues, that there is more possibility for it to escalate further. And the IDF saying that it could go on for a few hours, or perhaps another day, there is no specific endpoint in sight. But this operation does continue.

She appealed for calm on Sunday, urging people to stay home. Now, that may be part of the answer as to why the violence has dropped off. But also, some of the shocking scenes that we saw on the night from Saturday to Sunday when a burning car was rammed into the house of a local mayor in suburban Paris, when his wife and two young children were inside. A peaceful protest in L'Hay-les-Roses, that suburb where it took place, led by the mayor, appealing for calm, is saying that at this stage, a line had been crossed. Still, French authorities taking no chances. They will remain on the streets of France since Monday night, the 45,000 police men and women that had patrolled the streets over the weekend as well.

If you look at it, in sheer -- as a sheer of population, but nonetheless, there is the use of force each year, and which leads to death at the hands of the police. So, there are rules that govern that, and those rules have been loosened over the years. So, there will be questions about whether those rules ought to be tightened again. It's a question -- that's a question that the French can look at, independent of whether or not minority populations are in disproportionately targeted. So, I think that those conversations are certainly going to be had, as well as, you know, the more underlying causes. Why do people feel so angry in these neighborhoods? What is it about France?

He brought in a change, which was going to ask or does ask the French to work two years longer in life before they get their pension. Now, those pension riots, which were very violent, you remember the images from the beginning of this year, they had nothing to do with the neighbor -- these neighborhoods, the housing projects on the outside of French cities. This was a much more -- this was a white demographic that was more impacted by pension reform. So, I think, you know, there's a problem of unrest in France that he's got to grapple with. France is a place with a history of unrest. So, you know, there is a kind of iconography of unrest, which does, I think, you know, come into play. But it's also a question of Macron's political authority. He runs a minority government. Don't forget, he was reelected as president last year, but he didn't get him a majority in parliament. And he has two very strong blocks at the extremes on the far left and on the far right, which are both capitalizing on these riots. So, it's going to be difficult for him to find the right tone, and then to find the right policies to try to restore his authority at this moment. But, you know, he's come back from these things before. So, I think it will take time, but he'll probably manage it.",

Vladimir Putin is scheduled to address the summit about 90 minutes from now, in what will be his first appearance on the global stage since the Wagner mutiny. Experts believe the Russian president will use the forum to project an image of power and reassure Moscow's partners that he remains firmly in control. And CNN is covering every angle of this story.

It comes, like you said, just weeks after the insurrection that we've seen by the Wagner Group, and also after a highly successful meeting between the U.S. President Biden and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was recently in Washington, D.C. on his first state visit. That was keenly watched by two countries, Russia, as well as China. Now, we do know that all the members of the SCO group have not openly come out and condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine or even condemned it in the U.N. resolution until now. India has always said that there has to be a peaceful resolution that the both -- that both countries have to achieve. So, at this point, India's going to be walking on a very tight rope. It has to balance its ties with the east and the west -- with Russia, as well as with the U.S. Now, we all know that the U.S. sees India as a counterweight to China, in the region. But India also needs Russia, which we all have always been very, very aware of clearly because of the oil that it's -- that gets from Russia, as well as, the weapons. More than 50 percent of the imports of weapons for India happens from Russia.

And as we have seen in recent weeks, China is looking beyond its borders, and it's beyond his comfort zones to try to get some help.So, it has to be very careful about the image it projects during this meeting. So far, China has not condemned Russia for its role in the war in Ukraine. And as we heard from one analysts, Russia or China does not want to do anything that would certainly make itself an even bigger target of NATO. Yet, it is part of this organization which my colleagues have all rightly said is seen as this block against the West. This is a visit though that is getting a lot of attention starting to get a lot of attention in mainland China. I want to just read you a portion of a commentary that was from Xinhua, which is the leading state news agency in China. And in it, it says, \"Today's human society is undergoing accelerating changes unseen in a century. Regional conflicts are raging, the cold war mentality and group politics are resurfacing, and so are unilateralism and hegemonism. Economic global challenges are -- economic globalization that is it. Accelerated headwinds, a more turbulent and intertwined world is calling for a closer SCO community.\" So, how will that be done?

There's a border skirmish going on to border controversy between India and China that's growing evermore ever, ever worse and it's -- and its effect on Chinese Indian relations.
