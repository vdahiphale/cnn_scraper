More than 100 people are feared dead after a landslide, buried people while they slept in the middle of the night. The community has been scrambling to reach victims and survivors.Debris is said to be six to eight meters deep and covers an area the size of three to four football fields. One official says around 60 homes have been destroyed. Search and rescue teams are working to secure the area but the village's remoteness and debris blocking the area's main highway or hampering those efforts. Joining us now is the national director for World Vision Papua New Guinea, Chris Jensen. Thank you so much for being here with us. So first off, what more are we learning about how many may have been killed, missing, affected?",

So we are seeing weather patterns shift and change. To what extent this impacts this event, time will tell once the assessments have been done.

Now this is the eighth lawsuit filed against the rapper since November CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister has the story.And we just want to warn you, this report does contain some graphic details that some viewers may find disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The legal fallout continues for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, just a week after CNN uncovered this disturbing video of the music mogul, throwing then girlfriend Cassie Ventura to the ground, then kicking and dragging her. On Thursday, April Lampros filed a civil law lawsuit accusing Combs of sexual assault when she was a fashion student in New York in the '90s and shared with him her dreams of working in the fashion industry. Then Mr. Combs love-bombed her, the suit alleges, using flowers and cards like this one and inviting her to his first Father's Day celebration. But Combs' kind gestures became more aggressive, the suit alleges, leading to a total of four separate sexual assaults, the first an alleged rape in 1995, leaving Lampros nude, sore and confused. She claims that Combs used his power in the industry to regain her trust. But then in a New York City parking garage, forced Lampros to perform oral sex. \"As Ms. Lampros' eyes filled with tears, she could see the parking garage attendant witnessing this horrific assault,\" the suit claims. Lampros says she was caught in an abusive relationship and tried to end it after several years. But after running into Combs at an event, he pursued her. And in late 2000 at her apartment, Combs violently grabbed her and forced himself onto her, kissing and touching her against her will. This came, the suit notes, while Combs was in a public relationship with Jennifer Lopez. Combs developed this mobster persona, the suit claims, at one point violently yanking her down to her knees and pulling her hair. The alleged abuse similar to this, when Combs was caught on hotel surveillance in 2016, kicking and dragging Cassie Ventura, then throwing a vase at her. SEAN \"DIDDY\" COOMBS,\" MUSIC MOGUL: I mean, I hit rock bottom. WAGMEISTER (voice-over): The latest suit filed by Lampros is the seventh civil lawsuit against Combs alleging sexual assault. Many of the cases once fell outside the statute of limitations. But in the case of that shocking video from Los Angeles, the district attorney's office says criminal charges won't be filed. The video shows assault, not rape. But with those federal raids on diddy's homes in March, legal analysts say the civil claims, much like in a case against Harvey Weinstein, pertain to criminal charges in the future.",
