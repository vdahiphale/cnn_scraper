CNN's Natasha Chen is on the ground for us in Monterey Park with more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  On Sunday evening on lunar new year, when this community was supposed to be celebrating, law enforcement gave a press conference confirming that a man they had cornered in a white van in Torrance, California, was, in fact, the shooter of this Monterey Park scene, just a couple of blocks away from us. Where on Saturday night, he opened fire, police said, killing ten people and almost 24 hours later, still seven people are in the hospital. Now, we understand that the ages of the victims range in the 50s, 60s and beyond. The coroner's office began to take away remains on Sunday afternoon, and they're still in the process of identifying the people who died. Now, it took about 12 hours for police to find this person in Torrance, about 30 miles southwest of Monterey Park. This after police say that he had gone from this dance hall in Monterey Park to a different one in Alhambra, a city north of where we are. That's where law enforcement says that person matching the same suspect description went in armed, and that a couple of people actually wrestled with him, tackled him and they was able -- they were able to recover the weapon that he had. And that's how police were able to also recover that weapon and begin to trace who this person might be. Now, this community is still reeling and stunned after this mass shooting happened just after the first day of the city of Monterey Park's huge lunar new year festival that had more than 100,000 people on these streets. And many of the people speaking at the press conference, local leaders, were at those festivities just a couple of hours before this tragedy. They have reassured the community that they are now safe, that the person that police say died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound when police cornered him in Torrance, that person is no longer with us, as they put it, and that there's no longer a threat to the community. And this is indeed a huge blow to the predominantly Asian community in Monterey Park here, again, about to celebrate the lunar new year, supposedly a time for joy, for health and prosperity. Instead, having to mourn the loss of their neighbors and loved ones. Natasha Chen, CNN, Monterey Park, California. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, sources told us that he had been mulling the decision since that November midterm election. And we, of course, know how grueling being chief of staff and all that it comes with is.So Ron Klain made that decision. Now, there is no end date for him exactly announced yet, though. Sources tell us that he's looking at somewhere after State of the Union that's slated for February 7th. Now Zients has been picked by President Biden to come in. We know that he really chaired that COVID recovery response for him, but of course, he comes at a time when Biden is facing real political head winds. Just to name a few, the Republican investigations into facets of his administration, the special investigation by the DOJ into his handling of classified documents, of course, now that he is overseeing a divided government, we have to take a look at how his domestic agenda may be stymied by those house Republicans and of course, that 2024 expected re-election run that he is expected to amount in the next few weeks. So, of course, a lot of things that Zients will have on his plate when he comes in as chief of staff -- not even to mention just the big shoes of Ron Klain's that he will have to fill as Ron Klain has been one of the more visible chiefs of staff we can remember in the last few administrations as well as he's well liked in the building. He's often working until late hours, and of course, tweets a lot. Folks say that we will not see that as much from Zients, if at all. But of course, Zients, even though, he hasn't been in the Biden orbit like Klain for those last decades, he is well liked within the administration. He hooked up with him during the transition, helped during that period, and also ran that COVID response. And he finds that folks who work for him become very loyal under his tenure. And now, he will have to not only help Biden work the divided government, but he's also seen as a chief of staff, which is one of the reasons why Biden picked him as someone who can implement those large policies that President Biden and the White House were able to shepherd through Congress over the last year. But of course, he will have his work cut out for him when President Biden has really kind of a tumultuous next few months while in office.",

Now, it really is still very much unclear whether or not, that is the German policy to allow Poland to send those tanks if they want to or whether or not she might have gotten ahead of herself saying that.One of the things we do know though, Christine, is that the Poles have absolutely been ripping into the Germans. In fact, the Polish Prime Minister saying that Poland will not allow Ukraine to bleed to death essentially, while the Germans are looking on. Now, this despite the fact that Germany definitely has sent a lot more modern weapons to Ukraine than Poland has. In fact, Germany is probably in third place right now if you look at for instance air defense capabilities, infantry fighting vehicles, but also those multiple rocket launching systems that also the U.S. has sent, which have been so effective on the battlefield. Nevertheless, main battle tanks are right now the main thing that the Ukrainians say they absolutely need to make advances, but also to defend against the Russians as well. The Germans are saying, as of right now, that they have not gotten an official request yet from the Poles to allow those tanks to be exported to Ukraine. So that's something that's still in the works. The Germans have also been saying that they want the U.S. to give Ukraine M1 Abrams tanks if the Germans are going to give the Leopards to Ukraine. The U.S. says -- said it will not give the Abrams so far. So, there is still a lot to be sorted out there, even though it seems as though some incremental headway might be made, one of the interesting things that we learned, Christine, we spoke to some top level Ukrainian officials over the weekend. They say they need around 3 to 400 western-made battle tanks to really turn the tide here, Christine --",

Huu Can Tran shot and killed himself in a white cargo van, hours after opening fire at a dance studio, killing ten people and wounding several others. The L.A. County Sheriff's department obtained a search warrant for the shooter's home in a senior community in Hemet, California.Let's bring in CNN law enforcement analyst, Jonathan Wackrow, so nice to see you this morning for such a terrible reason. What do you think, Jonathan, investigators are looking for at the gunman's home as they try to -- try to determine what the motive is here?   JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST:  Well, you bring up that next phase, right? If you think about this investigation and the incident as a whole, the arc of the incident is really transitioning into that investigative phase to answer, you know, motive, why? Why did this, you know, 72-year-old man walk into essentially what was a pillar of the community, it's not just a dance studio, it was really a part of the community where people, you know, went for enjoyment. You know, what type of signal was that? So law enforcement right now is trying to go through and answer that question why? The challenge that they face right now, Christine, is that the shooter, the attacker is dead through a self-inflicted wound, so they don't have the opportunity to interview him. So what can they do? So absent of a clear motive as stated by the shooter, what they can do is, they can actually take this from a threat perspective. And I think if they look back at other investigations, targeted acts of violence like this are typically in response to some type of grievance. So that's what they're going to focus in on. They're going to interview friends. They're going to interview family members. They're going to understand everything about this person's life to figure out what triggered this individual to walk into this dance studio and create, you know, and create such havoc and cause such trauma --",

Eighty thousand last week, we were out there with them in the pouring rain. And then on Saturday, more than 100,000 not just in Tel Aviv, but tens of thousands more in cities all around Israel.And they're not just protesting against this new right-wing government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, but specifically, against these proposed judicial reforms that were unveiled just a few weeks ago. And as you noted, among them is the possibility that the parliament which would essentially mean whatever party is in power would be able to overturn Supreme Court rulings. Now, there are other reforms in this package, including allowing politicians to have more of a say in what judges are appointed, but it's these specific reforms that got these protesters out on the streets. Now, I should note, Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies say that these reforms are a long-time coming, that they're needed. They claim that the Supreme Court is overreaching in some of its rulings, but the opponents, these protests including former Prime Minister Yair Lapid and the president of the Supreme Court say that these reforms will destroy the independence of the judiciary, and the firing of that right-wing minister that you mentioned, Aryeh Deri, that plays into this. Because the Supreme Court is the one that forced Benjamin Netanyahu's hand to fire this minister because of his previous criminal convictions. But Netanyahu has vowed to bring him back, and one of the few venues opened to bring this person back would be to   amend the basic law of this, which is essentially Israel's constitution, that would allow the government to prevent the Supreme Court from interfering in ministerial appointments. So, you can just see how the firing of this minister and this ongoing raging debate are all going to really just come to a head here in the coming weeks. Christine?",

The World Health Organization has said on the record, criticized China, for under- reporting the death toll. But now, here you have this official who is trying to argue that the peak of the infections is past.   And we just don't know because we have seen overwhelmed hospitals in the more developed cities in the east of the country. The big question is, you've got the biggest holiday of the Chinese calendar, which is the lunar new year, this has described pre-pandemic times as the world's largest annual human migration. It's when billions of people move around to go see their families. And Chinese have not been able to do this for the last three years because of restrictions due to COVID. Now, they can move. And now, we're getting these estimates of huge numbers of people on the road, in planes, on trains as you mentioned. Estimates that by the end of this 40-day spring festivals, more than 2 billion passenger travel units would have taken place.
