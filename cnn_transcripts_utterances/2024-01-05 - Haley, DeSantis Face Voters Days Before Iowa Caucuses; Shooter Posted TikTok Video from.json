The victim alleges that the former -- that former President Clinton pressured \"Vanity Fair\" not to run a story on Epstein.The pages also shed new light on how Epstein's victims were recruited and what happened to them. CNN's Jean Casarez joins us now. And Jean, we're talking about 900 pages here, so there's a lot to go through. What new details have come up?",

      "sentences": "Well, they came out last night combing through them. And, you know, this all stems from a 2015 civil suit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Ghislaine Maxwell.And Virginia Giuffre had wanted her story to come out. She wanted a book. And so she became very close with a reporter out of Britain. And this reporter was encouraging her to go to the \"Vanity Fair\" magazine to have them do an article on it. And here is what, in a newly undisclosed e-mail from 2011, here's what Virginia Giuffre says. She says, \"Considering that B. Clinton walked into V.F.\" -- \"Vanity Fair\" -- \"and threatened them not to write sex trafficking articles about his good friend J.E.\" -- Jeffrey Epstein, so she didn't want to do it. Now, we last night contacted Graydon Carter. He is \"Vanity Fair's\" editor from 1992 through 2017. He said categorically, this did not happen. We also went to Bill Clinton's representative. He refused to comment on this but once again reiterated it's been nearly 20 years since Bill Clinton has ever spoken to or acknowledged Jeffrey Epstein. Now further, in all of these pages that were released, there was a lead investigator from a case in the mid-2000s. His name was Joseph Recarey. And a deposition of his was released. He was specifically asked about the method of the recruiting and the massages and the girls, and then he was finally asked a question, so how many would you say girls were recruited for Jeffrey Epstein? His response, \"I would say, approximately 30. Thirty, 33.\" And then he was asked, \"And at the end of that massage, if that victim brought other friends, she would get paid for the recruitment of those friends?\" \"Correct,\" he answered. And then the attorney asked him, \"So did you determine that massage was actually a code word for something else?\" And he said, \"When they went to perform his massage, it was for sexual gratification.\" And finally, there was one victim that was recruited between 15 and 17 for massages. And unsealed documents now, she says, you know, massages, OK. She said, I had no idea it was sexual gratification. And once I got there, I was looped in, and that's what it was all about.",

      "sentences": "Yes, summarizes it best, with a roar or a whimper, that's really it. But any way you slice it, this will be an impactful storm for the entire Eastern Seaboard.But in terms of snowfall, what -- snowfall, in terms of what everybody wants to know, this will be a Southern interior New England snow thump, with potentially 6 to 12 inches. You'll notice that Boston is the only major East Coast city within this winter storm watch. New York, Philadelphia, all the way to Baltimore and the D.C. area, not included. So this is the storm responsible. It's just about to pick up some moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Let's time it out for you. If you're located in D.C., we'll start to see that rain/snow mix mid-morning on Saturday. And then the precipitation moves into Philly and New York City, we think right along the coastline, East of I-95. This will be a mainly rain event. Maybe a wet snow for New York City, up to an inch possible, ending that snow drought. But it will then transition to mainly rain overnight and maybe a few flurries behind it. An all-snow event for Boston, certainly from the interior towards Worcester. And then it's all said and done by Sunday evening into Monday morning. This is very telling from the weather prediction center. They have a marginal risk of excessive rain. Notice this extends all the way to Providence, New York, and Philadelphia. They're picking up on that signal or that hint that this could be a major rainmaker, at least for the coastline. So here's that I-95 corridor. That sharp cutoff point. It's a matter of miles. New York City, yes, we could end the snow drought, but not likely. You can see the rain anticipated across Long Island, New Jersey, all the way to the Delmarva Peninsula. I don't want to be the bearer of bad news and crash anybody's hopes, but yes, this is looking more like a rain event along the immediate coastline, with snow the further West you travel inland.",
