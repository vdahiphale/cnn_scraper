M.J., strong pushback today by Biden and his campaign. What more are you hearing from sources? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Boris, the Biden campaign is telecasting in every which way that the president is not going anywhere. You played the sound of the Biden campaign chair saying he is absolutely staying in the race. The Biden campaign also sent out a memo earlier saying not only is he the presumptive nominee, but it said there is no plan for an alternative nominee. CNN also reported last night that senior-most West Wing aides have had no discussions either amongst themselves or with the president himself about plans for him to drop out. And just moments ago, we got a statement from the president himself. This is a part of what he wrote. He said: \"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda, while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America, one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone. The stakes are high and the choice is clear. Together, we will win.\" The campaign is basically saying that it has been emboldened by the end of the Republican National Convention and particularly President Donald Trump's speech last night. They said it was clear that that speech was all about him. He didn't present an agenda or a clear vision for the country and certainly was not a speech, the campaign is saying, meant to bring more people into his tent. But, Boris, I think it's just important to note right now the campaign can say all they want that the president is staying in, but Democrats are continuing to remain incredibly concerned about the prospects of President Biden continuing to campaign. We are seeing, as you mentioned earlier, Democrats by the day continuing to publicly call on the president to drop out. We have reported that there are many in the upper ranks of the White House and the campaign that privately believe that the president should drop out, not to mention donors who are freaked out and are not writing checks anymore. Meanwhile, the president himself physically cannot get out on the campaign trail because he is isolating after testing positive for COVID. So, at this moment in time, we cannot overstate just how much unease there is right now inside the Democratic Party.",

And if I could add something to that, you heard just a moment ago directly from the president about the record he's got to run on, which is outstanding, and the vision for the future was just to build on that. But for the people who are just saying, we want to get out, we want him out, and they're passing the torch, one of the challenges I have is that they're not talking about who you would pass it to. And part of that means there's going to be this big scramble at the convention, which I think would send a terrible message to the public that the party's in disarray. And on top of that, if it's not Kamala Harris, I think you have got a huge challenge about two things. One is African-American voters feeling that she's been disrespected. But, secondly, you have got the financial piece of it. We're talking about donors, but Biden/Harris campaign has, I think, last 90-plus-million dollars in the account. Nobody else can get that if they're not named Biden or Harris.",

And then the last part of it is the organization. They built a strong national office structure for grassroots campaign, which I think is going to be pivotal this year. That doesn't pass off to somebody else either. They'd have to pay fair market value for the office space, the contracts, the leases. All of that stuff would have to be addressed. And you're asking somebody to come in and do that in like 60 to 70 days. Most of the names I have seen other than Biden and Harris have no national name recognition.

This is what we're hearing from people at the White House and inside of the Biden campaign. And I think that is something that may give a lot of Democrats pause here. There was a memo from a respected Democratic polling firm that says Democrats who argue, who make the case that Biden is fit for office are in danger of being seen as dishonest, that it is going to hurt them electorally.

For the voters we're trying to reach out to, swing voters, persuadable voters, African-American, not constant voters, but irregular voters, that's not the message that they want to hear. Some -- the big-dollar folks are telling we want somebody else. And the 14 million people that cast votes for Joe Biden already, I don't know that they want to hear that their votes are going to be preempted because big-moneyed interests have a different view. But to back up to a moment, to what you were saying a moment ago, there's momentum out there, but it's not necessarily coming from the voters. There's a lot of momentum from donors, media and the like that keep focusing on this issue. And I'm not saying it's unfair.",

The Project 2025 piece, which people are just starting to get a sense of -- for example, they want to eliminate the Department of Education. I think that's going to have an impact on voters. And when you listen to some of the things that you heard this week with respect to Trump and Vance, particularly on abortion rights, for example, I think that's going to be problematic. If we can get to the point where we can get back to actually campaigning, give the president and then the surrogates a chance to speak about what we want to do for the future of America, especially with respect to pocketbook issues, I think he can get the numbers closed and we can win this race.
