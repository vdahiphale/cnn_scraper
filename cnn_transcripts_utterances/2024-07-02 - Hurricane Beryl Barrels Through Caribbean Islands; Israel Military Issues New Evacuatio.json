Allright, it is a phrase we have heard time and time again from climate scientists. This is the new normal. And if that's the case, I want to show you a frightening snapshot in real time of what that new reality looks like. The strongest storm ever to form in the Atlantic this time of year is barreling its way through the Caribbean right now -- Hurricane Beryl, which has already turned deadly, is expected to hit Jamaica on Wednesday after carving a path of destruction through Granada and Barbados. Meantime, in California, the thermometer is spiking well above the triple digit Fahrenheit mark, heightening the dangers of wildfires. Some areas of the state could reach more than 46 degrees Celsius this week. U.S. President Joe Biden, who has called the climate crisis an existential threat to the world, is set to visit the Emergency Operations Center in Washington, D.C., for a briefing on the extreme weather at any moment, and he will deliver remarks afterwards. We'll bring you those remarks live. And we have reporters standing by to cover all of these stories about extreme weather. We've got Patrick Oppmann, who has more on Hurricane Beryl. We've got Elisa Raffa covering the record-breaking heat we're seeing in part of the western part of the United States this week. And CNN's chief climate correspondent Bill Weir is standing by for us in New York to give us the big picture, the global picture. Patrick, I want to start with you. Let's just talk about the level of destruction we're seeing in Barbados right now. We saw huge amounts of powerful winds, power lines ripped and fallen, and also the fact that, you know, roofs being ripped off buildings. Just give us -- just set the scene for us in terms of what we're seeing in Barbados right now.",

And, of course, people have lost their roofs. Their electricity is out. They are without water. Other islands where the eye actually made impact are completely flattened. So, of course, the impacts of climate change are not felt equally. And for people living in the low-lying islands of the Caribbean, it's devastating to have a storm come along like this so early in the season and to develop so quickly. I think that's what really caught people off guard, didn't have time to prepare, because on Saturday this was a tropical storm, and then by Sunday it was already a major hurricane. So, when you are in a low-lying island like this, you are limited to how you can prepare, how well you can prepare, and simply it is just too strong for many people to get through a storm like this unscathed.",

And so, the possibility for damage in Jamaica, where there are, of course, mountains, so you have mudslides and you can have people's homes get washed off the side of a hill or a mountain, the possibility for even greater destruction is even more pronounced there. And so, people are using the hours they have remaining before a Hurricane Beryl strikes, a very powerful Category 5 storm at this moment, and they do not have much time left to get prepared.",

Over half of it goes into Republican states, 30 percent to swing states. The blue states that are going to probably vote for Joe Biden get only 20 percent of that. And now, they're starting to see big battery factories in South Carolina, big infrastructure projects out west in these red states, as well. So, there's hope that that has enough momentum that it will be really hard to roll that back. President Trump is vowing to undo everything, pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accords, which would be devastating to other nations who are looking for American leadership and help technologically on this. But the Supreme Court decision yesterday, Zain, the Chevron -- or this week, the Chevron deference, which basically gives judges, federally appointed judges, more power than experts, scientists and who are out, who spend their lives protecting air and water or public safety. With this new Supreme Court ruling now gives it to judges. Donald Trump appointed over 220 judges. One in four are folks who think the way he does about this.

What started out as anti-tax demonstrations last month has really now morphed into nationwide calls for government accountability. Protesters are demanding President Ruto's resignation despite the fact that he did actually end up withdrawing the controversial finance bill. (END VIDEO CLIP) CNN's Larry Madowo was in the capital on the deadliest day of the protests last week and we want to warn you that his report here does contain very graphic images, which some people may indeed find hard to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A prayer for the dead. The family of Ibrahim Kamau say the final goodbyes. His body being taken for burial. He was only 19. His mother tells us Ibrahim had just graduated from high school and was hoping to go to college. Ibrahim was shot twice in the neck at a protest in Nairobi. EDITH WANJIKU KAMAU, SON KILLED IN PROTESTS (through translator):  I didn't go that day because I didn't have child care but we always went together and came back because the protests were peaceful. The first thing I want is justice for Ibrahim and all the kids who died because they all had dreams. MADOWO (voice-over):  Protests broke out across Kenya last month against a proposed finance bill largely driven by young people organizing on social media. But the deadliest day was June 25th when protesters stormed Parliament in Nairobi. Human rights groups accused police of shooting dozens of unarmed protesters, including some who were fleeing. No one has accepted or denied responsibility for the killings. Our crew filmed the shocking scene. Like here, left of your screen, a man running away is shot in the back with a tear gas canister at close range. These protesters standing over a man who's apparently dead. Police fire a non-lethal round directly at them. Nairobi's police chief seen here commanded the operation. His officers clearly contravening their own rules for the use of force. CNN analyzed the deadliest two hours when most of the protesters are believed to have been killed. Keep an eye on the man in white overalls waving his arms earlier in the day. Twenty-five-year-old Erickson Chalamutisia was supposed to be at the butcher's shop where he worked, his mother said, but ended up here. CNN's camera captured him dancing until shots ring out. Police advance towards the protesters. More shots and people run away. Amid the chaos, we spot Erickson again. He is lifeless on the sidewalk. Around him, other protesters are also on the ground. As the smoke lifts, one man has been shot in the head. People rush to help, but police keep firing at them. A bag is thrown in the air as the smoke grenade goes off, but that protester escapes.

An oversight body is investigating police conduct during the protests, but many here don't believe they'll ever see justice. (END VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (on-camera):  CNN has reached out to the Kenya police and the Ministry of Interior to ask about the conduct of officers on Tuesday at that protest outside Parliament, but we have not received a response. President William Ruto said in a T.V. interview on Sunday that the police did their best under the circumstances, and he maintains that some criminal elements infiltrated peaceful protests. And that has not gone down well with so many legitimate protesters who say they're not criminals. That young man you saw who was shot in the head in that piece, David Chege, he was not a criminal. He was a Sunday school teacher. He served in church. The young man, Ian Kaya, who was shot in the back but survived, he said he does not regret going out there because it's his right. And I asked him what does he want the world to know. He says Ruto must go. And that's the same sentiment we heard today on the streets. People were back on the streets of Nairobi and across the country, third straight week of protests, and many of them no longer care about that finance bill which was withdrawn. For them, it's about the legitimacy of President William Ruto. And one of the reasons why they're so angry, Zain, is that 39 people have been killed in these protests so far. But we might never know the exact number. The police are not keeping a count. They're not reporting any of these numbers. And even though a court has blocked them from using tear gas or water cannon or live bullets against protesters, we saw today they were violating those rules again, Zane.",

While the U.S. Supreme Court may be slowing down efforts to hold Donald Trumpresponsible for efforts to overturn the 2020 election, the regular citizens accused of helping Trump are increasingly finding themselves in trouble. Just a short time ago, Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani was disbarred by the state of New York. The court punished Giuliani for not acting in good faith in his legal filings related to the 2020 election. The New York Supreme Court made the ruling against Giuliani, taking away his license to practice law. Donald Trump's lawyers are celebrating their big win in the U.S. Supreme Court by saying his presidential immunity should impact all the legal cases against him, even the trial where Trump was already found guilty. Trump's legal team sent a letter to the judge in the hush money trial, saying that Trump's 34 felony convictions should be thrown out. They say some of the testimony and evidence in the case is now tainted by Trump's immunity. Trump is due to be sentenced next week, but just a short time ago, prosecutors said they would not object to a delay to allow Trump's lawyers to pursue their immunity claim. Let's bring in CNN's national security reporter, Zachary Cohen, with more on this.

And it's already paying dividends for him. You know, this openness to a delaying of the sentencing by Manhattan D.A., Alvin Bragg, actually would push the sentencing date till after the Republican National Convention. He was set to be sentenced before that convention, where he will be officially named the Republican nominee for president. But now, sentencing will happen almost certainly after the convention is held. And look, Donald Trump plans to apply the same sort of attack to his other criminal cases, as well. We know down in Florida, the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, Trump's legal team plans to argue that he had those classified documents at his resort as part of his official duties. That is what the Supreme Court ruled that he cannot be prosecuted for, that he has immunity from prosecution for. We'll have to see if that argument holds any weight. But down in Georgia, we know that that case has been on hold. But if Fani Willis, the district attorney, is able to survive this disqualification push, the same question about presidential immunity will have to be addressed there, as well. Trump's lawyers have filed a similar motion arguing that he should have absolute immunity in that case, so the judge may have to grapple with the same questions that we're seeing plague the D.C. federal case. And then, of course, you have the case in D.C. And that case is now going to go back to the trial court judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan. But proceedings in that trial or in that case may not start back up for another month. We might not see any sort of evidentiary hearing or any sort of proceeding that might, you know, give us some clarity around these questions of what is an official act and what is an unofficial act that can be prosecuted.

Representative, thank you so much for being with us. I do want to start by talking about Congressman Mike Quigley's remarks today on CNN where he just simply said, listen, we have to be honest with ourselves, it wasn't just a horrible night and Biden really has to think carefully about his next steps because this doesn't just affect the presidency. It affects a lot of down ballot races, as well, for Democrats. The thing about the way Congressman Mike Quigley broached this issue is he was very respectful, okay? He was very respectful. He was extremely deferential towards the president but he was honest, right? There were no attempts at gaslighting. He spoke from his heart. What do you make of Congressman Quigley's remarks and do you agree with him? Does he have a point here? REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA):  Well, he certainly made it clear that he was concerned about the president's performance and frankly, all across this nation, anybody that was watching is concerned. However, we ought to keep in that Trump was worse -- far worse. Trump didn't answer the questions. He didn't respond in any way, shape, or form to the substance of the issues and he lied, I don't know, 30 or 40 times in the process. What happened here is that Biden's performance overshadowed, in a negative way, Trump's terrible performance. Now, with regard to Mr. Quigley's concerns about the House and the Senate, I think he's absolutely got it wrong. If there is concern that Trump becomes the president, there will be a very strong movement throughout the nation, both Democrats and Republicans, to put a halt or to put some sort of a brake on Trump and that means the House and the Senate. It may very well turn out that the Senate and the House best argument and a powerful argument that we could put forward is we can't let Trump have both Houses or one or the other House. So, I think we've got something going for us here in a negative, unfortunate way. However, I want to go back to what I said a moment ago and that's Trump's performance was horrible not only in his inability to answer or unwillingness and inability to answer the question but also in his continued propensity to attack and to lie.",

And I'm quite sure that that stuff is going to be positive. On the other hand, he has an opponent. Now, take a look at his opponent. Right now, all the focus is on Biden. The focus will come back to Trump. He is a certified liar. He is a manipulator. He is a person who cannot be trusted in the Oval Office. We've seen that in these four years. It was chaos and we should expect that again. He is a felon. He has broken the law and found guilty of 34 counts of felon -- felony counts. Now, the Supreme Court may slow things down. But the fact of the matter is he has been indicted on multiple occasions of breaking the law. That's the opponent. He -- is Biden up to the task? He certainly has been every day with the exception of the debate. Every day he has performed remarkably well as president. Take a look at the legislation that has been passed. Even with this Congress being controlled by the Democrats, we got the job done. The Democrats did with Biden's leadership. So, let's be very, very clear here. This is not just about Joe Biden's performance in a debate. It's also about Donald Trump's performance in that debate and his historic performance in the campaigns where he is a serial liar, where he could never even begin to live up the Boy Scout oath and law. So, it's going to be an interesting campaign to be sure. But I am quite confident that Biden will perform very well in the days ahead.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I don't think that's going to happen. I think that Biden, as he did the day after the debate, showed the entireworld, at least those who cared to listen and pay attention, that he's perfectly capable. He had a bad debate. And you've had a cold. I've had a cold. I know that performing as I am now, and you are, when you have a bad cold, it's just plain tough. And the debate preparation, he was probably over prepared. However, he showed the next day that he could stand before an audience and deliver a very powerful message. And I suspect that he'll be able to continue to do that. So, what about those of us? There are 435 members of Congress, all of us up for election. All of us have a different district. And whether you're a Democrat or Republican, you will structure your campaign to fit that district. And you'll see people, perhaps Mr. Quigley or others, who will modify their message, perhaps even not supporting Biden, to fit their district. And that's understandable. We are representatives. And so, each of the 435 districts are remarkably different. So, I wouldn't give a great deal of concern to one or another, or maybe a large majority of both Democrats and Republicans modifying their election message to deal with not only the issues that will come about in the next 140 days, as well as Trump and Biden.",

Then there is clear air turbulence. The most mysterious, that is the turbulence associated with none of those telltales. Usually, it's bumpy patches at high altitudes that is more frequent in the wintertime. Remember that Brazil is in the southern hemisphere and it is winter there right now. The big takeaway for passengers here is always keep your seatbelt buckled. I know it's hard to do on a 12-hour flight like this one. So, when you're up and walking around, going to the bathroom, stretching your legs, you have to treat it like a bit of a risk. We're going into a huge period for international travel right now. But remember, the National Transportation Safety Board says turbulence is the number one cause of injuries on commercial flights. The good news is the data says U.S. airlines have become pretty good at avoiding it and passengers are following the rules. The latest data from the FAA says only 17 people suffered serious injuries from turbulence on U.S. flights in 2022. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
