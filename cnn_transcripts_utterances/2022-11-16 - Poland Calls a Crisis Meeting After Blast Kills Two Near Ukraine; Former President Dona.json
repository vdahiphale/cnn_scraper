I'm Kim Brunhuber live from CNN Center in Atlanta.We're following two big stories this hour. World leaders hold an emergency meeting after a missile described as being Russian made falls inside of NATO territory, and Donald Trump announces his third run for the White House claiming he's the candidate who can bring people together. A missile that hit Poland Tuesday left two people dead and as raising fears that Russia's war on Ukraine could spill over into NATO territory. Now it's not clear where the missile was fired from and why it fell on Poland but officials say it was Russian made. Poland has raised its military alert status and summoned the Russian ambassador for an explanation. It's also considering whether to invoke NATO's Article 4 which would trigger talks with the Alliance's decision making body. Now that missile fell in a village about six and a half kilometers or four miles west of Poland's border with Ukraine. It's also set off a storm of diplomatic activity. In the coming hours, NATO will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels and G7 and NATO leaders met on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia. Afterward, President Joe Biden struck a cautious tone. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I'm going to make sure we figure out exactly what happened. It's unlikely in the minds of the trajectory that it was fired from Russia, but we'll see. (END VIDEO CLIP))",

Donald Trump announced his candidacy Tuesday night in Florida, promising to defeat Joe Biden and the quote, radical Democrats with his America first agenda.The former president vowed to bring down inflation, make the U.S. energy independent and secure the border with Mexico. Now if he wins, Trump would be the first U.S. president elected to non-consecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in 1892. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The decline of America is being forced upon us by Biden and the radical left lunatics running our government right into the ground. This decline is not a fate, we must accept. When given the choice boldly, clearly and directly, I believe the American people will overwhelmingly reject the left's platform of national ruin.

And here's Daniel Dale with what he found.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DANIEL DALE, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Former President Trump started his campaign for the presidency in 2024 just as he ended his presidency in 2021 with a whole lot of inaccuracy to be generous or dishonesty, if you're feeling less generous. Trump claimed, for example, that he had completed the wall on the border with Mexico, one of his signature policies, that's not even close to true. In fact, there were still about 280 miles or 450 kilometers not completed when he left office. Trump was complaining about the criminal investigation into how he had taken presidential documents to his home. And he said, Well, look, Obama did it too. He said Obama took lots of things with him. That is also not true. Obama simply did not do so. And this claim was publicly debunked by the U.S. National Archives when Trump first made the claim in August. Trump said he was the first president to get any revenue from tariffs on China. In fact, such tariffs generated billions per year before Trump, he falsely downplayed the issue of climate change, grossly understating the amount of sea level rise that experts expect. And as usual, he made false claims even when the facts were in his favor. For example, U.S. officials have concluded that about $7 billion worth of military equipment that had been given to the Afghan government was left behind upon the chaotic U.S. withdrawal. So Trump could have accurately complained about that. Instead, he said it was $85 billion left behind. So exaggeration after exaggeration, false claim after false claim. Daniel Dale, CNN, Washington.

The problem is, he doesn't have widespread support among the party, and certainly doesn't have widespread support among a general electorate, which he would face in a national election.And one thing that stood out with me and what he said is, obviously, his efforts to make America great again, but he also said we need to go far fast. The problem is he has gone far and he failed. He lost The White House, he lost the House and the Senate. And Republicans had tremendous losses, this cycle in large part due to canvass that he nominated, and their insistence to relitigate 2020 and election deniers and conspiracy theories. And look, I applaud his objectives when he talked about it in his speech to reduce inflation and secure the border and gain energy independence. That's what we need to do. But I think there are plenty of other positive Republicans that can do just the same and also win a general election at the same time.",

He has -- we have lost many people because of his rhetoric and his focus on his past grievances instead of voter's future promises.

But on top of that, you also have this massive swing with Roe that everybody discounted because they weren't looking at this as a long term issue, which I think that you know, 51 percent of the American population, women absolutely view it as a long term issue.

He can be helpful in parts of rural Georgia to encourage people that may not feel the need to get out and vote encourage them to get out and vote. And I've spoken with the Walker campaign, they're happy to take help from anyone who can turn out voters but they're going to rely more on people like Ron DeSantis and Glen Youngkin, and people that are proven Republican leaders that have a positive vision for the future as opposed to someone who has a successful record of electoral losses like Donald Trump.",

In the House, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy is poised to retake the speakership in January, assuming his party gains enough seats to control the chamber. The GOP conference in the house chose McCarthy by a simple majority, despite a challenge from Arizona congressman Andy Biggs. It was always a long shot that Biggs could take the reins from McCarthy. The fact that he did get some votes shows how unhappy congressional Republicans are with the outcome from last week's midterms. Now, we already know Republicans won't retake control of the Senate. That's prompted Florida Senator Rick Scott to challenge Mitch McConnell for the minority leader position. Senate Republicans are expected to vote on leadership, sometime Wednesday. Now, we are still two years away from the next presidential election, but we already have our first candidate. Donald Trump said he's running for president in 2024 and if he's successful, he will become the first president to win non consecutive terms since Grover Cleveland in 1892. Trump says Joe Biden and the Democrats have ruined the country with crime and inflation out of control. And he's promising to put America first and, quote, \"make America glorious again\". Well, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis used to be one of Donald Trump's most prominent allies. But in recent months, the relationship has gone from warm to cool to down right icy. And with the 2024 presidential election looming on the horizon, well, things could take an ugly turn as many expect DeSantis to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination. Sunlen Serfaty reports.

Two minutes and 41 seconds on the clock, and we are about to see something that's never been seen before.The most powerful rocket ever built is about to lift off from the Kennedy Space Center bound for the moon. And Kim, you know, this comes after so much stress for NASA. This rocket had to be rolled back because of Hurricane Ian. Then it got hit by Hurricane Nicole, a category one hurricane while this rocket was at the pad just five days ago. And now, here we are, there was a very clean countdown during the beginning of fueling. But then, at the end, we run into key issues. Another hydrogen leak, they had to send out a team called the red crew, two people, three people to actually go up to the launchpad while the rocket was fully fueled. Basically a sitting bomb and they had to tighten some bolts, they fixed it, got the hydrogen leak fixed, and then there was a problem with, believe it or, not an Internet connector with the U.S. Space Force -- the reins, the flight safety termination system, absolutely critical for this launch. They have fixed it just in time and now, Kim, look at the clock, a minute and 30 seconds left and what we are about to see, if all goes according to plan and inside mission control they have just given all systems go for launch. So unless something just absolutely crazy happens this thing is about to light and lift off and it's going to head for the moon. It is going to go on a 26-day mission. It's going to circle the moon and then land back splash, down sometime around mid December in the pacific ocean. And if all goes well, that paves the way to return American astronauts to the moon for the first time since the Apollo program. And put the very first woman and the first person of color ever on the lunar surface. So, there is so much at stake here tonight, Kim. You also have to think about the geopolitical implications, the U.S., and NASA now in a space race, according to the NASA administrator who I just interviewed earlier tonight. He is confident that this team is ready to go. They have been preparing, literally, for more than a decade since the retirement of the space shuttle program, for this moment. And so Kim, I am just going to pipe down for a minute because I think we should all just kind of take a deep breath and get goose bumps together as we watch the final 15 seconds of this countdown. Let's listen in. [LIVE EVENT]",

Of course, over the 30 year lives of the space shuttle program, we've had our share of hydrogen problems, liquid oxygen leaks.But you know, we've been able to surmount that for the shuttle program. Part of what you're seeing now is a new vehicle that has many components that are either directly from or derived from the space shuttle program. But we've got also people that have are dealing with this for the first time. So there have been quite a gap between the end of the shuttle program and this launch tonight. But you can see that the teams are coming up to speed and they're able to now deal with the same problems that we had with the shuttle program. And so I'm confident that these folks will be able to continue to get it done.",

      "sentences": "Sure. Well Kim, you know, this is -- yes, it's the first test flight of this rocket. And so there's a few things that they're looking at. One of them, does it actually work? So, far so good. All systems nominal as the rocket has now passed max q. That is the moment when the rocket is under the most stress during launch. So, so far it has passed that test but there are many more in store.One of the other big things that they're going to be looking at, is you know, is the Orion capsule which sits on top of this rocket, is it safe to actually put people inside. And so one of the biggest things that they're looking for, is on the way back to earth, how is that heat shield? How does that heat shield perform as the capsule re-enters the earth's atmosphere and hits those incredibly high temperatures. But Kim, can I just say, for all of you watching this, it is something else to see this thing. And, actually feel it lift off in person here. I mean it was so loud, you felt the vibrations shake your chest. I mean this is more powerful than the Saturn 5 rocket which took all the Apollo astronauts to the moon, the most powerful rocket in operation right now. And just huge cheers from all the media. There's tons of astronauts gathered over here watching this thing go. Many of them know that they could be named to this Artemis 2 crew. And I spoke with NASA administrator, Bill Nelson earlier this morning and he said that if Artemis 1, if this mission is a success, then they're going to name the all-important crew of Artemis 2 likely in just a few months. So a lot of very excited astronauts here because, I mean just think about this, Kim. They have not had a NASA-made rocket for them to fly on since the space shuttle which retired way back in 2011, it's been more than a decade. And so up until now they've been totally reliant upon SpaceX rockets or Russian Soyuz rockets to get them up into space. This is the first time that they are seeing a new rocket, one of their own rockets, that they may get to fly very soon. [01:54:48]",

      "sentences": "Sure. Well, this is a very different test flight. It's much longer than the other lunar program test flights, so this is around 25 days. We're going to see the spacecraft, the Orion spacecraft enter into a different kind of an orbit around the moon. It's going to be much farther than some of the previous missions.And, as it was pointed out, one of the big crucial test is going to be the heat shield when we come back from the lower orbit, we are coming back at a speed of about 17,500 miles an hour. Coming back from the moon, it's going to be more around 25,000 miles an hour. So heat shields are going to be under much higher load, much higher temperature, previous tests have shown that this should work out. But of, course there's nothing like the real thing. And so hopefully all will go well and the spacecraft will perform well and also come back intact.",
