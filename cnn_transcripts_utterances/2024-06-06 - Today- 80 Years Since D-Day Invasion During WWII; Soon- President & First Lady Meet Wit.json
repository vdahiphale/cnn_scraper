President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden in Normandy at this hour to meet with the precious few remaining veterans who took part in the largest amphibious military operation in history. The president is going to speak later on next hour. That's coming up very soon. June 6, 1944 was perhaps the most consequential day of the Second World War, beginning around midnight, the D-Day invasion code named Operation Overlord, saw more than 150,000 troops when the U.S., the UK, Canada, and other Allied countries arrive on five stretches of the coastline of Normandy, France. D-Day and the months that followed helped the Allies secure stronghold on the French coast and eventually lead to the end of Hitler's reign over Europe. But it did come at a very high cost. U.S. forces suffered substantial losses at Omaha Beach, some 2,500 American troops died on D-Day. In all, nearly 4,500 Allied troops its confirmed dead. As the years passed, the number of men who survived D-Day is shrinking. The few that remained making the journey to the shores of northern France this week to pay their respects. And joining me now from Normandy, France, is Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has traveled there to mark this occasion. Mr. Jeffries, Leader Jeffries, thank you very much for being with us this morning. Let's just start with your reflections, especially as you see what is left likely to be for these men, the last major commemoration of this day. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Well, it's a serious, it's a solemn, it's a very sober day, and it's been an honor to have the opportunity to shake hands with and talk with some of the folks who -- the heroic folks who participated in D-Day, or were part of the struggle during World War II, which was really a struggle between freedom and fascism, and it was a great cost and great sacrifice and many lives were lost. And we honor and uplift them today and always, and sort of recommit to freedom and democracy and the principles that they fought so valiantly for, to make sure that we can keep them alive.",

There is a ground war raging now in Eastern Europe, and there is a presidential campaign that very well reelect a man who has questioned NATO, which is really the security foundation that these men at D-Day fought and died to build, to make it possible for the peace that followed the wake of World War II.What does this anniversary mean in those contexts?",

It's a government of the people, by the people and for the people, and we have to fight to make sure that we can keep that going, moving forward, over the next couple of months and beyond. The fight against fascism was waged by our brave American heroes joined by their partners from Great Britain and Canada 80 years ago today, which began the liberation fight at the highest level against Nazi Germany, Hitler, and fascism.And certainly, I think nobody ever wants to go back to where we were on those very, very dark days in world history and again, I think we can draw strength from that resilience, from their struggle, certainly reverence for their sacrifice and make sure we can keep this great American democracy thing going, always and forever.",

It takes all of us to lean in, to show up, to speak up, to stand up for what we know is right for classic American values, and that shouldn't be a partisan thing, not a Democratic thing, or an independent thing, or a Republican thing. It's an American thing, democracy in the United States.And I'm confident that, you know, based on what we've seen over the last 248 years now, that the American people will pull together in ways that are consistent with the founding principles of this great country.",

During Jim Crow, more Black people were not just conservatives, but more Black people voted conservatively.You obviously responded to him. He responded to you last night right here on CNN, and he pushed back. He said: Nobody ever made nostalgia. That wasn't the point.

We call them, here are greatest generation and we face a, an uncertain future with Putin having invaded Ukraine, you know, a ground war in Europe.

And he was actually speaking about that yesterday, talking about how this idea that the U.S. has allowed Ukraine to use its weapons to fire into Russian territory. Putin suggesting that could be seen as direct conflict with the way West. He may respond with using nuclear weapons, and also, we may respond actually -- other suggestion was that by arming Western adversaries. So, you start thinking about Iran being supplied with Russian weaponry. So, it's escalating again. It feels like it's escalating and he's the only words at this point. But in the words of one veteran I spoke to earlier today, he cant believe world leaders are going back to war, having seen what happened on D-Day.",
