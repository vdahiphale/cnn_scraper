The reason why is that Joe Biden is really struggling among this group. All right, this is the Biden versus Trump margin. Among those 18 to 29-year-olds, back in 2020, Joe Biden won this group overwhelmingly, look at this, by a 24 point margin. Now look at that margin. It's down to just 2 points. It's one of the worst performances that Joe Biden has in the polls right now relative to what he had back in 2020. And Taylor Swift was very popular amongst that group.",
