      "sentences": "Excellent show, Katelyn. Thank you very much.And to our viewers, good evening. I'm Wolf Blitzer here in Washington. We want to welcome you to CNN Primetime. There's breaking news we're following right now. A Texas woman has been charged with threatening in a voicemail to kill the federal judge overseeing the criminal case against former President Donald Trump over his attempts to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The suspect allegedly called the chambers of Federal Judge Tanya Chutkan on August 5th and left a voicemail message threatening to, quote, kill anyone who went after former President Trump. We'll have more on this story's breaking news. That's coming up in just a few moments. And it comes as we are on the verge right now of a truly unprecedented calendar collision leading to a presidential campaign like nothing we've ever seen before. The 45th president of the United States facing courtroom dates in the coming weeks and months here in Washington D.C., in South Florida, in New York, and in Georgia, all while he's running for a second term. Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis says she wants to arraign Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants the week of September 5th. And she wants to start his trial on March 4th, 2024, the day before Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen states hold their presidential primary elections, that as lawyers for the former president are in ongoing negotiations with the D.A. over details of his surrender before the August 25th deadline. Meanwhile, his advisers believe he's not planning to debate on August 23rd. That's next week. Asa Hutchinson, one of Trump's Republican rivals, is standing by live. He will weigh in. And the death toll has risen now to at least 110 in the Maui wildfires as searchers are still digging through the ruins of once thriving communities. Hawaii's Governor Josh Green told me this earlier tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JOSH GREEN (D-HI): 38 percent of the territory has been covered by the rescue team. So, they're really accelerating now. As you mentioned earlier, we're adding 225 additional people to go and do search and rescue, and another 20 dogs taking up to 40 dogs. So, much more territory will be covered quickly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Then she goes on to make additional threats. She also made threats to kill Congressman Sheila Jackson Lee, all Democrats in Washington and members of the LGBTQ community. There's obviously a lot of threats like this that periodically make their way to elected officials, judges. Of course, we saw the very serious assassination attempt of a Supreme Court justice in the last few months. So, the FBI, the Justice Department, takes every one of these seriously. You never know which one of these things could turn out to be true. In this case, this woman, her name is Abigail Jo Shry, she told the investigators from DHS that she had no plans to travel to Washington, that she was making these threats verbally. And so it appears that this one was a much more limited case. But, obviously, all of these things are very concerning whenever the authorities come across them.",

Interestingly, even Sheriff Labat, the Fulton County sheriff, has said he's gotten threats and racist comments. So, this arrest against an African-American judge sitting in the U.S. District Court in DC saying, if Donald Trump is not re-elected in 2024, we're going to kill you. The idea that this call was tracked to an individual, an arrest was made, a federal charge is being held. Bail has been denied. She's going to be sitting there for 30 days before even a detention hearing is a signal that the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Protective Service, the U.S. Marshals, the FBI, are going to take these cases seriously and track these threats back to people and put a price on it.",

That is the day of the Iowa GOP caucuses. Even if all of that started when it did, when it's schedule to start, and even if it were all done by the end of February, which is virtually impossible, here comes March. The Georgia election subversion trial is currently aiming at March 4th. The very next day is Super Tuesday, a day when 15 states plus American Samoa will dish out the largest set of delegates in the entire race to determine who the nominee should be. And then it goes on from there to March, when the hush money trial gets started, May 20th or 27th when the classified documents case is theoretically going to be started. And, again, even if all of that worked, and even if you got to July 15 and 18th when the GOP convention arrives, yes, a lot of people here may be excited about Donald Trump being their candidate, but he will be a candidate who will have a whole nation listening to months of sworn testimony about what he did that many are going to say would not make him a good candidate or a good president again.

And according to the sheriff, they're going to treat this like any other case, at least that's what he's saying right now. And so the possibility exists, Wolf, that this might be the first time we actually see a mug shot from the former president. They've taken one, you know, in New York, but New York law doesn't allow the release of it. The feds did not take a mug shot. He is one of the most recognizable people on the planet. So, they didn't think it was necessary. Georgia, they say they're going to do their normal process.And so, you know, Trump being Trump, he's already said, and his campaign have said, that they would use this to sort of fundraise, to raise more money for his campaign. They find this to be something that would be good for him. They believe, at least. So, that is part of the process. One of the things that we know is going on, or Alayna Treene was talking to sources around Trump, and they're trying to negotiate a surrender next week. But then, there's also the date on September 5th, which is when Fani Willis is sketched out for him to be arraigned. And so we have a sort of a bifurcated process in Georgia.

And I'm surprised that she pursued that. But the fact is that he's morally responsible for what happened on January 6. You've got multiple cases now that's going to determine whether he's criminally responsible. And I'm looking at it, though, as a candidate.

Despite the severe damage, no casualties were reported. One Ukrainian official accused Moscow of specifically targeting food supplies.Since Russia pulled out of the Ukraine grain deal last month, small ports such as Reni have become vital for Ukrainian grain exports. I want to bring in CNN Military analyst, retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. General Clark, thanks so much for joining us. Talk to us a little bit about this latest Russian strike against Ukraine. What does it signal to you?",

First of all, there's Ukraine taking away the earnings and the substance for Ukraine's farmers. It's an attack on Europe because Ukraine has to get that grain out through Europe, and there are issues trying to get that grain through Poland and Hungary. It's an attack on sanctions because Russia says it's the sanctions that we put on that are keeping them from exporting their grain and they're not going to let that ship channel open until we relieve sanctions.And they think that by hurting the global south, by keeping food away from East Africa and South Asia, somehow these nations are going to blame the United States and our sanctions on Russia for this. So, all of these are in play. And if you look at that explosion, Wolf, that's also a signal to Romania. That's an effort to sort of horizontally escalate the combat. BLITZER: Yeah --",

Now, I know we're leading in giving the support to Ukraine militarily, but we're not leading politically. It was the East European nations like Poland and Estonia that wanted Ukraine to be brought into NATO. It's the United States and maybe Germany. United States may be hiding behind Germany saying, not so fast, not so fast.So, the Russians see this. They read our newspapers, they know us very well. And they understand this administration is concerned not to provoke Putin. We're playing by Putin's rules on this. They're afraid to provoke him. And so, the more they can stir things up and horizontally escalate by putting Wagner in Belarus, by having Belarus move troops up to the border with Lithuania and so forth, the more pressure they put on NATO. And that's all part of the game plan here. We've got to, well, if we've got to take a greater risk, we've got to move a little bit faster in this incremental approach of assisting Ukraine. Time's not on Ukraine's side in this. We need to give them the support they need as rapidly as possible and get them through those Russian defenses and back into the Sea of Azov and threats to Crimea. And the sooner we do it, the less chance of escalation there is. And in this, I guess I disagree with some inside the administration who are worried about escalation. They want to slow things down. I think the risk is, as this drags out, you have a greater risk of escalation horizontally to other countries in the region, and that's what this strike on Remi and other ports along that Danube estuary, that's what that says to me. That's the risk of horizontal escalation.",

There were a lot of different dimensions to it, but what we do have now for sure is a greater tension between Belarus, Poland, Lithuania and Kaliningrad, that other appendage of Russia that's separated geographically through the Suwalki Gap.

Oher claims he was never adopted but tricked into a conservatorship while the Tuohy family kept all the proceeds from a blockbuster film about his life. Let's discuss what's going on with CNN Sports Analyst Christine Brennan and Conservatorship Attorney Lisa McCarley.Lisa, the lawsuit alleges in part that Oher, quote, \"discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023 when he learned that the conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact provided him with no familial relationship with the Tuohys\", end quote.

He made it as far as we can understand well over $20 million in salary as an NFL football player.That doesn't seem to be a part of this, but the fact that he had, as these attorneys are saying, he had his agent, he was able to be in charge of his career, it does beg the question about the issue of how much control the Tuohys had if, in fact, Michael Oher was able to go ahead and have his professional career and have the agent or have the money that he was making there. There are so many questions here and it goes back really, Wolf, to the movie where there were concerns about the NCAA looking -- they looked into violations of what was going on with Michael Oher and the family getting him to Ole Miss, their university.
