We have deep sea experts standing by.We'll also be taking a closer look at the five people onboard whose families and friends are now grieving. We'll be joined by guests who knew several of the passengers and understood their love of exploration and adventure. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, the Coast Guard says it is continuing its investigation of the submersible and its implosion. The discovery of debris confirming everyone's worst fears, that the underwater expedition to see the ruins of the Titanic had a disastrous end. Our correspondents are at key locations covering the story from every angle. First, I want to go to Miguel Marquez who's in Newfoundland. Miguel, the debris field was found just off the coast of Canada where you are just 1,600 feet from the Titanic's wreckage.",

ALFRED MCLAREN (RET.), U.S. NAVY:  Well, Alex, I'm heartsick for the people onboard and what they suffered but also for their families. And I'm angry as hell because this thing should have never happened. You know, for the last several years, anybody that's asked me, I advised them not to make a dive on that. The technology was too risky. They were trying to use the carbon fabric for the pressure hull and trying to make that with the titanium. And most of us that are professionals and have been in the field for a long time, in my total time just under water divorced from the outside atmosphere 5.75 years at least as a nuclear submarine captain and officer and then deep sea submersible pilot just five years ago. And that mating, trying to mate them and getting that seal, and somebody who just talked previously was absolutely right. Repeated dives, flexing, you're going to work that loose.

And what that does is once it's brought back to the surface, the data can be downloaded. The imagery is looked at, and people can pretty quickly find objects on the bottom that look promising, things like straight lines, right angles that are manmade, not found in nature, pretty quickly would grab your attention.And once you have targets of interest, then you're more likely to put down a remotely operated vehicle, which is sort of like a giant minivan-looking device held by an umbilical that transmits data in real-time back to the surface with video cameras and gripper arms. So, the people on the mothership that deploy that, can then verify the images that they saw in the sonar imagery and decide whether or not it is or is not what they're looking for and potentially use grippers to attach lifting straps and connect those to a lifting line and bring them to the surface.",

And so President Biden making the choice that he is going to give all these honors to the Indian prime minister despite that, putting the strategic interest of the United States, whether with relations to China or the U.S.'s economic interests above those human rights concerns.

The Indian prime minister, for his part, he really seized on those remarks, insisting the DNA is in the country's veins. And he also claimed there is no space for discrimination. But the fact the Indian prime minister took questions at a news conference, that in and of itself was very significant. Modi has not taken questions in his nine years as prime minister at a news conference, but that was the result of a heavy back and forth between the White House and Indian officials who I'm told initially balked at the idea of Modi taking questions in that format.",

Obviously, India is a big piece of this administration's strategic new foreign policy when it comes to trying to get countries on side while they essentially confront China. And then we moved onto the U.S., and I said, you know, what is the world meant to think about an indicted former president running for office, and he talked about all, you know, democratic institutions around the world including the U.S. really needing to be strengthened.

But the fact that we have a former president who is having to answer to charges brought by prosecutors does uphold the basic notion that nobody's above the law. And the allegations will now be sorted out through a court process.And I think I'm more concerned when it comes to the United States with the fact that not just one particular individual is being accused of undermining existing laws but that more broadly we've seen whether it's through the gerrymandering of districts, whether it's trying to silence critics through changes in legislative process, whether it's attempts to intimidate the press. A strand of anti-democratic sentiment that we've seen in the United States, it's something that is right now most prominent in the Republican Party. But I don't think it's something that is unique to one party. I think there is a less tolerance for ideas that don't suit us, and sort of the habits of a free and open exchange of ideas and the idea that we all agree to the rules of the game. And even if the outcomes aren't always the ones we like, we still abide by those rules. I think that's weakened since I left office, and we're going to need to strengthen them again.

That information, according to the Navy official, was immediately passed on to the on scene commander is ended help inform the range of the search and helped them narrow down where they were actually looking for the submersible itself.Crucially, though, and the reason the search did not end right there is that the sound, according to the officials, was not definitive. They could not say for sure it was an implosion or an explosion. Because of that, the mission itself and the multinational effort that we saw play out over the last few days remained a search and rescue mission instead of transitioning to a recovery mission, which would mean they were looking to recovery essentially those who had perished in this. Because the sound was not definitive, they could not come to that conclusion and we saw it remain a search and rescue effort. Crucially, the Navy also played a part in interpreting the other sounds that were picked up on, for example, the banging we heard about a few days ago. Officials say it was likely either natural light or noises coming off the ships and vessels that were responding to the search. But, Alex, a crucial piece of information, the acoustics of the implosion or explosion, even if they did not know what it was were picked up shortly after it happened on Sunday.",

It is used because sound or acoustic signatures travel very well and very far underwater. So, if you have something happen, you could use this series of sensors to get a better idea of exactly where it is. This could be used to try to detect the movement of submarines. As an example of how long the Navy has had either this system orsomething like it, a similar system of acoustic sensors underwater was used back in the late 60s and 70s to pick up on a Soviet submarine that had imploded in much the same fashion in the Pacific. Ultimately, the Soviets were searching in an incorrect location. The U.S. Navy was able to use a system like this one to figure out where that implosion happened by zeroing in on that location.",

They were required to do that under the rules of discovery.One thing that caught our eye is the fact that they said they had interviews, plural. And, of course, we previously reported on the recording of an interview that Trump was doing with some folks that were working on his former chief of staff Mark Meadows' autobiography where he is heard of complaining about General Mark Milley, and also appears to suggest that he has classified documents. We were not aware of any other interviews. So, we did some digging on what are these other interviews. We learned that the former president's own lawyers handed over around half a dozen additional interviews. They were subpoenaed earlier this year for any materials that referenced General Mark Milley. So, we've learned that many of the recordings that Trump team handed over our interviews with authors or journalists where Trump mentions Mark Milley but does not refer to any classified documents. And I think it's important to remind people that during the discovery process, prosecutors have to have over everything they have collected, not just what is going to be potentially incriminating or used in trial. Now, we know they have at least one other source providing them audio recordings that they have been evidence but our sources tell us that none of these additional interviews or recordings rise to the level of significance that the original Bedminster meeting in July 2021, that was -- of course, we broke that story and it's in the indictment of that reporting.",

They would wait to begin the discovery process. We know the special counsel has said publicly he wants to push for a speedy trial which translates to a trial before the election. The former president, though, has every reason to want to push this until after the elections. So, that's going to be a key tension here.",
