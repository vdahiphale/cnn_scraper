There are now mass evacuations, nuclear fears and plenty of blame as Russia and Ukraine each point fingers at the other.Plus, trouble for Trump as one lane of the special counsel investigation near its end. Jack Smith himself attended a meeting with Trump's legal team and a new plot and a bizarre plot twist. CNN has learned a decision to drain a swimming pool at Mar-a-Lago led to a flood of suspicion from prosecutors. And Chris Christie makes his 2024 entrance. The former New Jersey governor is also a Trump friend turned Trump critic who sees himself as the best Republican hope of derailing the former presidents come back bit. We begin the hour though, with a major battlefield development in Ukraine. Russian occupied southern Ukraine to be precise where a major dam was destroyed overnight. The collapse of the Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, prompting evacuations and prompting fears of large-scale devastation. New video shows the surging waters leading to massive flooding and fears now of potential environmental disaster. You can see water creeping into Harrison city, more than 800 people in the region have been forced from their home. The flooding dangerously close to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, but official stressing there is no immediate risk in that area. The Ukrainian President Zelenskyy held an emergency meeting with top officials to address this crisis. Let's begin with CNN's Scott McLean. Scott, Russia and Ukraine each blaming each other for this serious destruction. A new CNN analysis does though find the dam was damaged before, days before suffering what appears to be a major structural collapse. What else do we know?",

Scott McLean, kicking us off. Scott, appreciate it very much. We'll bring the conversation back to Washington now and several new developments in the investigations of Donald Trump.Now, including word, a federal grand jury in Florida will hear evidence -- hear evidence this week in the special counsel's classified documents' case. Word of the Florida grand jury comes on the heels of some fascinating new exclusive CNN reporting. We are told prosecutors turned suspicious about Mar-a-Lago flooding incidents. Sources tell CNN at least one witness as an asked about an incident where an employee drain the resorts pool, flooding a computer server room that contain surveillance video logs, the handling of the surveillance videos, and anything Donald Trump and his employees might have done to obstruct investigations. We know have been a special focus of the Special Counsel Jack Smith and his investigative team. Smith, we are told, interestingly, was in the room yesterday, when Trump lawyers visited the Justice Department. Joining me now to share their insights, CNN's Paula Reid, CNN's Kristen Holmes, and the former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams. Let's start with this bizarre. You have, it's a resort. Donald Trump lives at a resort that has a swimming pool for its guests. So, the pool is drained, waters flood into this server room and prosecutors get suspicious because they've had reason to be suspicious about moving documents and the same maintenance worker who drained the pool was part of another incident.",

It flooded this area where surveillance footage was captured at this point. There's no indication that this was intentional, it does not appear that the surveillance footage was damage.But this surveillance video has been a key piece of evidence in this investigation, because there have been requests subpoenas for the surveillance footage, as investigators look at questions of whether there has been efforts to move potentially even hide boxes of documents. And we know before the grand jury witnesses, including the head of security for the Trump organization that would be in charge of monitoring the security cameras had been asked whether the investigators have all the security footage. Are there any gaps? Have there been any efforts to withhold or prevent investigators from getting all of this? So again, it's one of a series of incidents that all speak to possible obstruction.",

This is routine, you drain a pool, you clean a pool, that's what happens.On the other hand, fill, I say more on this. They have just seen before, you know, that beat with the surveillance footage, while nada is that the guy's name Trump bodies, Trump's body guy who we know is involved in moving boxes once with the same maintenance worker who drains the pool. So, is it we better look under every rock here because we're suspicious of these people? Or do they look at this incident and actually think they have something?",

And when you look at all of these moving pieces, and as you said, well not at the body man of Trump, who is his valet at the White House. He came to work for him after he left the White House as well as this maintenance worker were seen on surveillance tapes, moving boxes in and out of that storage room. We know that to be a fact, we've ported that extensively.Now you're hearing another story about potentially this maintenance worker flooding this area where the surveillance footage was kept. Obviously, that's going to raise a lot of red flags. But again, the big question here is, as you said, just red flags or if they actually believe there's something more.",

I mean, we know clearly, they've made an intentional choice to do most of this investigation in D.C., use a grand jury in D.C., but they knew they were going to face venue challenges. Meaning that if you bring criminal charges, there has to be a connection to that crime in the area of charging.Right now, if you want to pursue, for example, an obstruction case, you can do that in D.C., you can bring obstruction wherever you investigate. When it comes to the possible mishandling of classified documents, retention of defense secrets, then it's going to be much more difficult to bring it in D.C., because really, your only Nexus is that some of these -- most of these documents came from the White House and they were supposed to go to the archives. So, they've always known that venue is going to be a challenge. And now what we're trying to figure out is, are they coming to the end of the investigation and realizing like, I don't really want to take these venue questions to the Supreme Court, let's take it down to Florida.

The Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is the closest challenger in that pack.Christie, you'll remember was in the crowded field back in 2016. And as you can see, he struggled. In Iowa he ran 10th, winning just shy of 2 percent of caucus goers. He finished sixth the New Hampshire with about 7 percent of the vote. Governor Christie then dropped out. With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's David Chalian, Jackie Kucinich of The Boston Globe, and Tia Mitchell of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. David, The New York Times this morning puts it this way, for Christie winning would be great. Beating Trump would be a close second. He was a Trump friend, that he was a Trump critic.

Christie has answered this when asked about it. I mean, he says, you know, you know, go wake up at the Hilton Garden Inn in Manchester for 50 days in a row if you don't actually want to be president that he's not a hired political assassin here.
