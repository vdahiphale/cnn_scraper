A major new decision just released has critics up in arms.Conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, ordered to liquidate his assets to pay up the $1.5 billion he owes the Sandy Hook families, over a mountain of lies. But he still gets to keep his microphone for now. Plus, a new photo and a new update from Catherine, Princess of Wales, on her battle with cancer. She says she's not out of the woods yet. But will make her first public appearance since her diagnosis, in just a few hours. I'm Jim Acosta, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We have been waiting and waiting, on a slew of major decisions, from the Supreme Court. And one is now in tonight. It's a loss for the gun control movement. A lot more on that in moments. But all eyes have been on the court for months now. And public trust in the justices is at an all-time low. Growing ethics scandals only fueling the scrutiny. Justice Alito blaming his wife for an upside-down flag, a symbol of election denialism, displayed outside his home. Justice Thomas failing to disclose even more luxury trips, paid for by a Texas billionaire. The list goes on. There's also a perception out there that the court may be running out the clock, running it down to the last possible second, on Donald Trump's immunity decision, a decision that we're still waiting on, as clock ticks ever closer to the debate, the conventions, the fall campaign, and the election. Meantime, the possibility that Democrats might lose both the presidency and the Senate, in November, have some voices, on the left, now publicly nudging liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to retire. Doing so would pave the way, for President Biden, to appoint younger justices now, who could remain on the court, for decades to come. Biden says he thinks the next president could appoint more than one justice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's, obviously we spend a lot of time on the road, as you very well know, Jim, and speaking to people that are very entrenched in -- on either side. We were actually visiting that Trump store for a separate story. And then, there was the owner of the Trump store, a Paul (ph) that mentioned his neighbor. And yes, I mean, look, that neither of them, they said that they don't talk politics with each other. But she was nervous, when she heard a store was moving in next door like this. And -- but she said, everything has been OK. Some of the clientele even go pick up some MAGA hats, and then come by to get some crystals, and vice versa.

They're open, and you can just go in and buy this merch. They're not affiliated, for the most part, or any that I know of, with the campaign. So, it's not as if you're making a political donation.
