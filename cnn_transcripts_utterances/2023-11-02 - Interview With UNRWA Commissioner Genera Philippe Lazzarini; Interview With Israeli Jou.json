He speaks with Christiane Amanpour, his first interview since leaving the territory. And as war in the Middle East works to Russia's advantage, how do Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to cultivate Vladimir Putin look now? I ask Israeli politician and peace activist Ksenia Svetlova. Then, welcome news for migrant families separated by the Trump administration. Michel Martin speaks with Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Caitlin Dickerson. Also, we remember Ady Barkan, a heroic fighter for healthcare rights. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. With millions trapped inside Gaza under siege and under fire, the humanitarian situation spirals towards catastrophe. Now, President Biden says he supports a humanitarian pause in hopes of getting aid in and hostages out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  United States are going to continue to drive humanitarian support for innocent people in Gaza who need help, and they do need help. We're going to continue to affirm that Israel has the right to respond. A responsibility defended citizens from terror, and it needs to do so in a manner that was consistent international humanitarian law that prioritizes protection of citizens. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Please give me a loaf of bread. And later on, I was talking to my staffer in Gaza, and they were confirming that. Today, the Gaza Strip is running out of everything, running out of fuel, running out of water, running out of fuel -- food, running out of medicine, and the market is completely depleted. And it's extremely sad to see how much now this population is completely dependent on an international humanitarian community, which is not in a position anymore to deliver at scope what they need. What I see right now is an entire population being moved to the south, which basically has absolutely nothing available. They left -- most of them -- many of them left the north quite with very little things. And they arrive in the south, which is completely overcrowded to twice its population now.

Now, over the last week, we have, through deconfliction (ph) with the Israeli, picked up the remaining fuel, the remaining commercial fuel, which was available in the Gaza Strip, which means in the coming days, we won't be able anymore to supply bakeries, supply hospitals, supply the water station.

Now, all of this prognosis that Russia can actually harm Israel, now it's coming to life. And now, we see it also with this outrageous speech of a Russian representative at the U.N., Vasily Nebenzya, that said today that Israel actually does not have a right to defend itself. Everybody in Israel right now is discussing it and it's very high in the agenda, I believe. But unfortunately, we still don't hear a word from the government, also from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the special relations that Prime Minister Netanyahu was so proud of. He's still being maintained by him. And even when there are pogroms against Jews and the terms of lynches in Dagestan, which is part of Russia, is still -- everybody seems to be just numb, fearing to anger Putin and to provoke him in the -- perhaps in the north, you know, in the Syria.

And you see how all of the leaders of the Hamas, Khaled Mashal, Ismail Haniyeh, Abu Marzook, thank Russia for their support and thank them, you know, for the continuation of this steadfast position on the rights of the Palestinian people. So, I can tell you that even this diplomatic embrace of the Hamas team that visited Moscow just recently, it meant a lot because it inspires many of the Hamas supporters and backers to think that, you know, here is a superpower that supports and refuses to condemn outright the atrocities of the Hamas, and perhaps there is even more to this relationship that we know. But yet, we do not have the details right now. There are no indications so far that any Russian weapon was transferred by a Russian federation to Hamas.

So, the entity that is firing right now on Israeli towns and cities, it's of course Hezbollah. Yes, Israel is very much concerned about the official opening of their second front in the north. Because then, you know, we understand that the capacities of Hezbollah are so much robust (ph) and stronger than those of the Hamas. It's also the rockets -- the precision rockets, and this is why during all of these years, Israel went to such a great length in order to prevent from Iran to help Hezbollah with this precision rocket project. This was, you know, all of the operations in Syria has to do specifically with that. But believe me, for now, they have enough to inflict great damage on Israel and its population. But at the same time everybody knows, you know, that -- everybody -- everything is in the open right now after this slaughter in the Israeli south.

Wounded children rushed to nearby ambulances the latest casualties of Israel's relentless aerial bombardment. This densely populated neighborhood gripped by panic and sheer disbelief, a second Israeli airstrike in less than 24 hours. I lost my whole family, Abdulkarim (ph) says, holding a list of those killed just today. My sister's house was struck with her children inside. My brother's house too, with all of his children. There is no one left except for me and my younger brother. They were innocent. What did they do to deserve this? Israel's Defense Force says it was targeting a Hamas command and control complex in Jabalia. Hamas fighters said to be among those killed, but Jabalia is home to more than 100,000 civilians, according to the U.N. And while the full extent of the civilian death toll remains unclear at this stage, Gaza's civil defense authority has described this latest disaster as a massacre, with more casualties and more fatalities added to the list of hundreds said to have been killed or wounded in Tuesday's airstrike. This situation is beyond belief. Many have been killed, bodies have been left burned and charred by the airstrike, this doctor says. There isn't a hospital in the world that could cope with this kind of situation. We're having to treat patients on the floor and in corridors. The scale of the destruction at Jabalia is difficult to grasp. Many residents are still buried beneath the blackened rubble. Rescue workers and civilians dig side by side, desperate to find survivors. This house had 15 people in it, but we still haven't been able to find any of them, Hasan Ahmed says. We have no equipment. We are digging alone. Northern Gaza continues to come under heavy bombardment. Its residents warned by Israel to evacuate southwards. But airstrikes continue to rain down across both central and southern Gaza too. And for the more than two million Palestinians living under an Israeli blockade, the fear is that there is nowhere safe to turn. Nada Bashir, CNN in Jerusalem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, I'm covering things like the travel ban, like the border wall. But I get a tip pretty early that year that the Homeland Security secretary has been presented with an idea to take migrant children away from their parents as a way to discourage illegal border crossing. So, it's a deterrent strategy, probably the most aggressive one that this country has ever seen. And the idea was simply to send a very, very strong message that this kind of brutal reality would meet any family that tried to cross the border. The idea begins to be debated within the Department of Homeland Security, and then I start to get tips that separations have actually begun, one by one. I start reaching out to the administration and asking them, has the separation policy begun, you know, explaining to them the details of the cases that I was being tipped off to. And I was hearing for about a year that separations hadn't begun. There was a big disconnect. What we know now is that hundreds and hundreds, in fact, over a thousand separations took place in secret before this policy known as zero-tolerance was ever announced publicly, that happened in the summer of 2018, and separations increased even more after that.",

Sometimes no documentation of a separation at all for about a year until the policy became acknowledged publicly, and then the administration started to take some account of the separations. By then, so many had taken place. Hundreds of parents had already been deported without their children. And you had this issue where children were being sent to one federal agency, the Health and Human Services Department. Parents were being sent to any number of federal agencies that were different. Some were in ICE custody, some were in U.S. Marshals custody, some were in the Bureau of Prisons custody, some were released into the United States, and some were deported. The computer systems across these federal agencies did not speak to one another. And depending on where parents ended up, how their cases were handled, how quickly they were deported, some left the country without the U.S. government having any way of locating them again. No address, no phone number. Add to that, that in many cases, we were talking about at this time, asylum seeking families who were fleeing deep, deep poverty in Central America. So, folks who didn't have steady access to the internet, may not have had a phone, may not have had a firm street address. A lot of them, of course, were fleeing violence, fleeing unsafe situations. And so, it's not as if even if they did have an address, they return to the exact same place they left when they saw asylum in the first place. And so, this Biden administration task force has had to try to forensically reconstruct from any information that exists across these government databases, enough information to reunify families, and it's proven an almost impossible task.",

I think your guess is probably a really good one, Michel. I spent a lot of time reporting on the babies that were separated from their parents at this time. I tracked down the youngest separated child who was four months old when he was taken away from his parents. He spent five months in government custody. And another great example of what you just talked about, the language barrier. His family was actually from Romania. So, his dad spent months in ICE custody without an interpreter to explain what his case was. And of course, the baby was nonverbal for the entire time that he was in U.S. custody. So, there were many, many cases of children who were babies and toddlers who were separated. And I think it's a fair guess that it's perhaps those younger children who've had a harder time reconnecting with their parents just simply because they weren't old enough to speak, to memorize phone numbers, to know family members who could be contacted to try to track parents down.",

Any family who is separated is entitled to re-enter the United States if one or both members was deported, to apply for asylum and invoke their separation in their asylum claim to be reunited, of course, and also to seek mental health and medical care that could be paid for in part by the federal government if it's deemed related to the separation itself. Some families will also receive funding and support for legal resources to pursue these asylum claims and some may even be eligible for access to housing. The other huge, huge part of the settlement is that it says family separations are outlawed for eight years. So, of course, a lot of advocates, the ACLU included, would have liked to see a forever ban on family separations. The Biden administration, I'm told, really put their foot down when it came to that issue, did not want to legislate in a federal court settlement. And so, they landed at a compromise of eight years. And so, this is viewed as a great success, you know, with the huge caveat of what we're actually talking about here. We're talking about making amends for thousands of children having been taken away from their parents. We're talking about what medical experts have said unequivocally can cause lifelong damage. And we're also talking about those hundreds of families that have yet to be reunited. Will they be able to get access to these benefits from the settlement is still an open question?",

This was just another attempt that the Trump administration tried to cut off access to the border and to asylum. And then, as you pointed out, there's the continuation of the building of the wall. The Biden administration has said multiple things at once. You know, President Biden campaigned and said, not another foot of wall would be built under his presidency. And yet, we do see more wall being built. Then you had the president saying, well, Congress tied my hands. I didn't want to do it, but I have to. Well, the DHS secretary that he appointed is saying, I support the idea for this wall. So, there's a lot of mixed messaging, but the policies themselves point to greater restrictions and more use of deterrent policies to try to minimize border crossings.",

What I saw in Poland was quite striking. You know, the Polish parliament had passed emergency legislation to give 18 months of legal status to any Ukrainian who'd crossed the border, as well as cash support, access to the health care system. Children were enrolled in schools. And it wasn't just a legal difference. There was also a social and a cultural difference. You know, walking around in Warsaw, Ukrainians were universally referred to as refugees. It was -- they were sort of treated as synonymous. And that's very different, of course, from the way that the Trump administration looked at Central Americans who were seeking fundamentally the same type of status, you know, refugee status in the United States, instead of being referred to as refugees, they were referred to as criminals, as rapists, as we know, as people who were trying to exploit the American immigration system.",

There, I helped a federal judge end the racist policing program of stop and frisk. I co-authored the New York City Paid Sick Days law. I led a national campaign to reform the Federal Reserve so that our economic policies would actually reflect and support the lives of everyday Americans. But as the bills piled up and the need for care intensified, the focus of my work naturally shifted and the lines between my personal life and my career began to blur. Because of the greed of our pro-profit health care system, too many Americans today either go bankrupt or delay much needed care. Our system is beyond repair.
