Pence spent the Fourth of July holiday meeting with voters and even walking in the Urbandale Fourth of July Parade. He's set to make campaign stops today.CNN's Kyung Lah has been following the Pence campaign. She's joining us now. Kyung, he's hitting, what is it, three more counties today, including the one where - including where you are in Sioux City. What did -- from what you've seen and what you're seeing, what does it tell you about his Iowa strategy?",

They want to do what's known in presidential politics here in Iowa, the full Grassley, Chuck Grassley referencing, and trying to get to every single county, every single cafe, try to do that hand-to-hand retail politics in order to get them across the finish line and to make a mark in Iowa.Mike Pence says in his own word that he is known well, but he is not well known. Of course, he's well known as Trump's vice president. And what he wants Iowa caucus goers to think of him is as his own person. So, he's at a breakfast meet and greet today. Yesterday we saw him almost running through a July 4th parade as he tried to shake hands and kiss babies and do what you would expect on the Independence Day. And then he also spoke to a rural community about energy. So, much of that. He's going to be at an ice cream shop. He is trying to get at the ground level. It is something that he's committing himself to, and something that he says his former president, his former running mate, Donald Trump, is just not because he's not here this week. And he was specifically asked about Trump's lack of presence here (INAUDIBLE). (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can't account for what other campaigns decided, but for me it was vitally important to be here where the journey to the White House always begins and to spend two miles, at times jogging uphill, to take our case to the people of Iowa. And I promise you, we're going to keep running that hard all the way to the finish. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That's right, John. And it really comes as a blow to the administration, especially amid concerns about misinformation circulating online. Now, as you mentioned, this was a lawsuit brought by Republican states. It's one of many legal challenges that Republicans have launched against the Biden administration. And in this case, what the ruling does, is it keeps a slew of federal agencies and top officials from communicating with social media companies about taking down, quote, content containing protected free speech.Now, what it doesn't do is it doesn't keep the administration from curbing illegal activity or addressing national security threats, but, of course, this is a top concern for this administration, as it sees the use of - well, all these social media companies and sometimes in a way that can spread misinformation. Now, the White House addressed this in a statement saying, quote, our consistent view remains that social media platforms have a critical responsibility to take account of the efforts their platforms are having on the American people but make independent choices about the information they present. So, there you hear the White House saying it is important for the social media companies to take responsibility for this, but it still affects those federal agencies, just some of them for awareness. The White House press secretary, as well as HHS, CDC, DOJ, FBI. So you can see that just by naming some of those agencies why this would be a concern for the administration moving forward. The Justice Department is reviewing the ruling. So, we'll see what follows in the hours and days to come. But certainly a blow to the admin.",

Japan's state-owned electricity firm says it's simply out of room to store the treated water, which is enough to fill more than 500 Olympic pools. Japan's government and the International Atomic Energy Agency say the radioactive elements still present in the water are at low enough levels not to be harmful, and the water will be released slowly over decades.In Afghanistan, the Taliban have ordered all beauty salons closed by the end of the month. These salons have been one of the last places in the country where women could gather outside their homes. Gyms, parks and most schools have also been closed to women since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. So, the world just set a new record for heat. On Monday the average global temperature was nearly 63 degrees Fahrenheit, which beat out a record set in August of 2016. In the southern U.S., the same temperatures have hovered around 100 degrees. In Mexico, more than 100 people have died in a heat wave there. Even in Antarctica, where it is winter now, there was a new July temperature record.

I have to say, as the car pulled outside at this moment where they pulled outside the cathedral, there was quite a lot of booing and \"not my king.\" I think that was kind of an organized campaign there.It's interesting what you say about Scotland. Scotland, you know, is a separate nation from England, but it's all part of the U.K. This whole event hasn't been led by the palace, it's been led by the Scottish government, which is the national -- which is the Scottish national party, which is pro-independence. But they're not anti- monarchy. It's interesting that they've taken that strategy. But they've absolutely been behind, you know, the pro-independence group is behind this whole event. And it's not a coronation. There are a set of Scottish crown jewels, but they effectively became redundant hundreds of years ago, but they are still very closely held by the Scottish as symbols of their history. They're old -- they are the oldest crown jewels in the entire British collection. And they are there and they are representing Scotland and it will be presented, this crown, which goes back to 1540, will be presented to King Charles. But it won't be put on his head because he's already been crowned king of the United Kingdom in that coronation we covered earlier in the year. So, he's not being crowned king of Scotland, because that title doesn't exist, Sara.",

And what doctors are doing, they're looking specifically at which therapies may be unnecessary for the less aggressive cancers. And one example of this in one study researchers looked at rectal cancer patients and they looked at those who received only chemotherapy before undergoing surgery and compared them with those who received both chemotherapy and radiation.The patients who received only chemo still had among them 80 percent of them were disease-free five years later. You see on the screen here, among those who had both chemo and radiation, 78.6 percent of them were disease-free five years later. So, you see, there are still similar outcomes among those who just had chemo but skipped the radiation aspect. And that's one example of where doctors are seeing, as we prepare treatment plan, where can we kind of scale back on the more aggressive therapies that can lead to life-altering side effects but still see positive outcomes for our patients. That's the takeaway here, Kate.",

And one example, I spoke with an oncologist who treats head and neck cancer patients and she said those patients whose cancer is associated with HPV, those cancers are more curable than those that are not associated with HPV. So, for an HPV-associated cancer patient, they may be eligible to try out the de-escalation approach but not those who have the more aggressive cancer that's not associated with HPV.
