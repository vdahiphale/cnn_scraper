Another was part of a group that attacked Palestinian farmers and Israeli activists with stones and clubs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office disputed the need for sanctions, saying, quote, \"Israel acts against all lawbreakers everywhere, so there's no room for exceptional measures in this regard.

      "sentences": "Kim, it's an unprecedented move by the Biden administration and goes much further than the dozens of visa bans it imposed on some settlers back in December. And what America is saying, I suppose it's trying to achieve two things here, really.One is, send a message to Arab American voters in this critical election year that despite its support for Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, that it is still trying to do its best to be an honest broker in the region, and not least because opinion polls have been showing that Arab Americans have been deserting the Biden camp in their droves. The other thing that I suppose this is designed to achieve is to draw a line in the sand for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to say in the words of Secretary of State Antony Blinken that the Israelis must do more to clamp down on settler violence. Now according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, there have been about 500 Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians since the Hamas-led massacre of October the 7th. When it comes to these four individuals, you've given an outline of some of the things that they are accused of, it's unclear though what the practical impact of these sanctions is going to have. Essentially, they will mean that these four individuals who are Israelis, they don't hold American citizenship and the Biden administration says it won't be imposing sanctions on Israeli settlers who do hold U.S. citizenship. What these sanctions do, effectively, it cuts them off from the American financial system, it imposes travel bans and they won't be able to do business with Americans. But it's unclear if that is going to have any practical impact on these individuals who, some of whom by the way, have already been charged by the Israeli authorities. And so that would lend credence to what Netanyahu was saying, that Israel does take actions against settler violence. I suppose the big problem here though is that two of Netanyahu's coalition partners, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich from the religious Zionism Party and Itamar Ben-Gvir of the Jewish Power Party are both settlers themselves and support the settlers. And I suppose what's happened since they came to power, and especially since October the 7th, is that some settlers have felt emboldened to carry out violence against Palestinians in the Israeli occupied West Bank because they feel that they have a measure of cover in the highest echelons of power. It's also worth noting that these sanctions on these four Israeli settlers are just the first. There are expected to be more to come as the Biden administration tries, as I say, to show that its support for Israel in its war against Hamas doesn't stop it from doing what it sees as taking necessary measures against Israeli settlers for carrying out violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.

      "sentences": "Well, Kim, we've heard from Lloyd Austin, the Secretary of Defense, saying that it is time to take away more of the capability that these groups have to harm U.S. and coalition troops. Now, there's been more than 160 attacks, drone and rocket missile, against U.S. interests in both Iraq and Syria, and there had been a concern that there would be loss of life on the U.S. side.Eventually, now that did happen last weekend, three U.S. personnel were killed on the border between Jordan and Syria and dozens more injured. So what we have heard from the Biden administration is that they are planning a multi-tiered response. So, it does suggest that it's going to be more than just a simple missile strike against those that they believe were behind this attack. The Biden administration has said they believe it's the Islamic resistance in Iraq, which is an Iran-funded and trained and equipped umbrella group. So there are many other groups within this one umbrella group. They believe that they are responsible. So the expectation is that their response could be multifaceted. It could be a number of strikes. It could even go over a number of days. But we're hearing that they will decide when and where to strike back. But what we are also hearing from intelligence sources and those familiar with intelligence on the matter is that they believe Tehran is concerned by what has happened, that they were caught by surprise by the fact that this attack took place. And it really does go to the fact that how much control does Iran have over many of its proxies. There's certainly the expectation that they don't have operational control per se over these particular groups. But certainly, the Biden administration believes that they are not going to significantly change their tactics in the near future. There was a foreign policy essay written by Bill Burns, the CIA director, saying that Iran is very happy with what is happening at the moment, the fact that there are so many of its groups, of its allies, of its proxies that are carrying out attacks against U.S. and coalition forces. But there is also within this intelligence, we understand, a concern from Tehran, believed to be a concern from Tehran, that some of its key allies, like China and India, are being affected, for example, by the Houthi rebels, those groups that are firing missiles and launching attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Now, the sources we spoke to didn't specify exactly what the intelligence was, citing sensitivity, but in the past the U.S. has been able to gather intelligence either through human intel or through eavesdropping on Iranian communication. So that is how the Biden administration is working at this point, assuming that Tehran may have been caught off guard by what has happened, but still planning ahead to some kind of response, which we could see at any moment.

And what Iran has been persistently messaging also since the Gaza war began is that it wasn't involved in October 7th, but certainly it plays a very serious and destabilizing role in the region. So, Iran, if you will, wants to have its cake and eat it too. Its aims are to survive, to preserve the axis of resistance, but also to prevent direct strikes on Iranian territory.",
