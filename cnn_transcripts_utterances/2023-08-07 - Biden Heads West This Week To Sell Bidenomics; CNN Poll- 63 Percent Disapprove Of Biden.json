And then on Thursday, the President and is also going to be in Utah where he's going to focus on the PACT Act which provides veterans benefits for those who were exposed to toxic burn pits and other chemicals. All of those pieces of legislation were passed one year ago this month and so that's where the President is headed. But he's also aiming to try and flip some of his numbers on these key issues, on the economy and on climate change. On both of those issues, Dana, the President is underwater with 63 percent of Americans disapproving of his handling of the economy, 57 percent disapproving of his handling of climate change. And so this is the White House's central task this month. And where they think that they can make some ground is by making Americans more aware of the pieces of legislation that the President has actually passed. Those numbers on climate change, for example, in that very same Washington Post poll, voters say that they have little familiarity with the fact that this is the largest ever investment in climate change in the Inflation Reduction Act. So ultimately, hoping that they can flip those numbers. And on the economic front as well. We know that the numbers are looking better in terms of the economy itself. Inflation is cooling, unemployment remains very, very low. But the White House hopes that over the coming months, as those numbers start to set in with the public both the perception of it but also how Americans are feeling about their personal finances. They hope that they can flip those numbers in time for next year's presidential election. Dana?",
