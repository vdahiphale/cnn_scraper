INSIDE POLITICS, the best reporting from inside the corridors of power starts now. (END VIDEOTAPE) BROWN (on camera):  Good morning and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Manu Raju. Well, this morning, President Biden is set to hit the trail again, taking a defiant stance amid growing calls from members of his own party to drop out of the race. The president's Friday interview with ABC News doing little to calm those nerves. And while most members of his party have not broken with the president publicly, there are signs that could change. The top Democrat in the House, Hakeem Jeffries, is convening senior Democrats this afternoon to talk about the president's future a day before members of Congress return to Washington after their holiday break. And a source tells CNN, Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, plans to gather senators tomorrow to discuss Biden's reelection bid. The White House and campaign team are racing to regain Democrats' shrinking confidence, promising more unscripted appearances. A press conference this week and today, a visit to the battleground state of Pennsylvania. And that is where we start with CNN's Arlette Saenz in Philadelphia. So, Arlette, the president is expected to make two stops in Pennsylvania, right?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Pamela, President Biden is hitting the campaign trail here in battleground Pennsylvania as he's looking to redeem his campaign amid serious doubts within his own party about whether he can continue in this race.Now, the president is well aware of how critical Pennsylvania will be in his path to the White House, and today he will be making at least two stops, starting here in Philadelphia, where he will speak at a church service serving a Black community in the area. The president himself has said that he knows black voters will be key to his reelection in November. And after he speaks at this church service, he will head to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, for a smaller campaign event throughout the day, the campaign says he will be joined by top elected officials here in the state, including the state's governor, Josh Shapiro, the senators John Fetterman and Bob Casey. But all of this comes as the campaign has really been hoping for some type of reset. They were hoping that that ABC News interview would start to ease the concerns, not just of voters, but also officials within their own party who have doubts about Biden remaining in this race. But so far, it seems to have put the anxiety not completely, put the anxiety to rest and the pressure could intensify in the coming days, especially as Democrats are set to return to Washington in the House and Senate. So, President Biden today is trying to make his pitch directly to voters. Yesterday, he spoke with his campaign co-chairs, where one of the co-chairs told me that he sought their honest input and advice about the best path forward in this campaign. The campaign insists that he wants to take his voters and his remaining in this race through November -- Pamela.",

Look, the interview, the ABC News interview, which was a great interview at that point, after the debate, the goal, if the goal is really to calm the anxieties that the Democratic Party is feeling right now about whether or not president Biden can carry out this campaign to victory, one interview performance by president is not going to do that. And there were still answers in that interview where he did come off as meandering and didn't -- and kind of combined multiple answers in one in a way. (CROSSTALK) Not the same performance as the debate, but you still have concern, you know, throughout the Democratic Party. I spoke to a donor yesterday, a prominent donor who was saying, look, unless there's multiple polls that come out, particularly in swing states that show him beating Trump at this point, even that won't calm concerns.

They've all just been talking amongst themselves, and, of course, talking to us.But once they're all in Washington, that's going to be super charged all of these, you know, these letters we've been hearing about group letters that may be organized, group delegations like the one that Senator Warner is reported to be putting together. All of that is going to gain steam and momentum once they're together. And I think we're going to hear a lot more. You know, I was watching the interview and talking to a couple of my Democratic sources while it was going on, and it was that answer in particular where he said, I will feel okay as long as I feel like I've done my best. That was really rocketing around those circles among Democrats who said, that's just not good enough, and the fact that eight days after the debate, this was all they could come up with to showcase the vigor that they claim that the president still has, that was not good enough for a lot of people as well.",

DAVID WEIGEL, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER:  It could, because you're right, it's not credible. And there are Democrats we've talked to them who have this opinion that that Mark Warner has and don't want to come out yet for various reasons. There are progressive Democrats who don't want to be the face of a resistance, saying that Biden needs to go because they don't want to polarize it. There are people who have this opinion who have not spoken out yet, and they are not impressed by the president continuing to hark back to different situations. In 2020, he was winning the election. At this point in this election, he's between the campaign and the outside groups, about $240 million to be losing to Donald Trump. They're in a weaker position than they've been in any election against Donald Trump. This is the context that they're all very aware of. They remember panicking about Hillary. They remember panicking in 2020. But not to this extent because they were winning and because they were told -- all of them were told this debate would be the turning point where people's concerns voters, concerns about his age were going to flip around. They did not have a break glass plan, a recovery plan after the debate. A tell -- teleprompter speech is not it. Radio speech is not it. It was supposed to be the debate and no one could get past that, just a matter of whether they're being open about it yet.",

There are some people on the campaign who, you know, campaign veterans that basically believe, listen, we are still behind. We're just not as behind as some of these other polls. But then the closer you get to the president, the more the sense is, actually, the polls are just wrong.And you've heard Biden sort of articulate, you know, he'll go into polling methodology about how hard it is to get people on the phone. And Joe Biden does not believe his approval rating is in the 30s. Joe Biden does not believe he is significantly behind. And Joe Biden believes that at the end of the day, people are not going to go to that voting booth and vote for Donald Trump, which is adding to this angst among Democrats. I think that was the other beyond what Molly was saying about this alarm at that last answer. The other thing that they were alarmed with was he does not seem to believe the depth of the crisis he is in, and that is frustrating and creating a lot of agita. KANNO-YOUNGS:  This has something to do with who Joe Biden is too, right? I mean, he has always considered himself sort of a chip on your shoulder, a public official who has overcome obstacles, proved people wrong. But now we're in a situation where it seems that's devolved into also dismissing sort of any of the criticism in this current moment, looking at the past and basically saying, well, I overcame hurdles each and every time when I was doubted. So I'm going to go into this situation and if you're questioning me on my age, my ability, my polling, my state in this race, well, the past shows that I can overcome it. But the risk here is what you were just getting at that age and his ability has been a top concern for voters for many years, for multiple years now. And it continues. He's going to get questioned on it in the weeks ahead. If he continues to dismiss it and be defiant, is that actually coming off as being in touch with what voters are feeling at this point? That's going to be a challenge.",

Of course, in the '80s, and that has stuck with him and the sense of I am not going to be pushed out again, right?But the reality is the reality. And you see what's happening in the polls. And as I talked to Democratic sources and you look at the prospect of Kamala Harris, the vice president, being atop the ticket, there is also a lot of questions about how that might go, right?

They see this election as existential as -- as a question of whether they can stop the rise of Trumpian fascism. And a lot of them are taking it seriously, but trying to couch what's the most effective way to do that? You saw two members say that, that they think he's going to lose and they're going to run their own campaigns in Washington and Maine. The rest of the Democrats who have been more quiet are wondering how -- how to say this. I've heard much less I've heard from Bernie Sanders and a few other people, much less of the \"we just have to run with Biden unable to deliver a good debate performance or a good speech, we have to work around this\", much less of that in the last few days. And flashing back to 2019, 2020, when he was winning the nomination, they were overjoyed that Joe Biden was going to lead the ticket.

If there's questions about Biden's mental fitness, why didn't you mention them before 50 million people saw it on the stage. The other thing that I found really striking is that they are every single statement. Really the first half of it is all. Joe Biden is an amazing president. We revere him.

You are getting closer to the convention as well. We've talked a lot about the Democrats that have come out and expressed concern or called for him to step aside, but also you put that next to also the governor's meeting that was at the White House and governors coming out and pledging their support for the president. But you made an important point just now as well. They the playbook, when faced with questions over Joe Biden's age and his ability to carry out the next four years, has essentially been two things. It's been pointing to Donald Trump as the alternative, even though many of the people that are concerned here are also concerned about Donald Trump and the ability of him to beat him. And the other thing in that playbook has been pointing to the past three and a half years of legislative accomplishments, but the issue here is pointing to the past three years doesn't provide reassurance for the next four years for voters.

And now Biden finds himself in a new moment that could define his legacy.And joining us now to discuss the latest developments this weekend is CNN senior political commentator and former senior adviser to President Obama David Axelrod. David, nice to see you. So right after President Biden's interview aired Friday, you posted on X that he is dangerously out of touch. Why do you say that?",

      "sentences": "well, because listening to the interview, he seemed to deny where he is in the race. He and he seems not to grasp what is the big concern that people have.You know, let me just say about the president, Pam, that his whole life, he has overcome tremendous loss and tremendous odds. I mean, you know, his personal loss is well known extraordinary, and horrible. And he fought his way back from that. He's fought his way back from political defeats and against the odds. And so his psyche is that he can beat anybody and any long odds. What he can't beat is Father Time and that's really the concern here. It's not about his record. Every time he's asked about whether you can do the job until he's closer to 90 than 80. He says, well, look at what I did the last four years. That's just not the way it works. He can -- Donald Trump is almost unprecedentedly presidentially a flawed candidate in so many ways and represents, I do believe, as the president says, a real danger to democracy. But the one person that no one can outrun is Father Time. You know, Tom -- tom brady won a Super Bowl three years ago and he's out of football ok. Why? It doesn't detract from his greatness or what he's done. It's just there are certain immutable facts of life and those were painfully obvious on that debate stage. And the president just doesn't seem to come to -- he hasn't come to grips with it. He's not winning this race. He's more likely if you just look at the data and talk to people around the country, political people around the country, it's more likely that he'll lose by a landslide than win narrowly this race. And if the stakes are as large as he says, and I believe they are then he really needs to consider what the right thing to do here is.",

And a lot of people bring up well, Trump is only a few years behind Biden.But when you look at the public perception in the polls 42 percent of those polled said that Trump would be too old for office; 74 percent -- 74 percent said that about Biden. And you have to wonder, we played that clip of when Joe Biden, when he was, you know, then senator, dropped out of the presidential race in 1987 I was speaking to Evan Osnos that Biden biographer recently, he said, you know, he was pushed out of politics then. He's not going to be pushed out of politics again. That is one of the driving factors here of why he's digging in his heels. Is that how you see it as well? What else do you think is at play here with as you -- with what you think is sort of a state of denial.",

And history will be much kinder to him, than voters are being right now. But the question is, what will his reputation be like? What will his legacy be if he persists in this race and loses and loses badly, which is really possible at this point. You know, we elect presidents by the electoral college.

All of that went completely out the window after the debate. And you know, it is political campaigning 101 to stay out of the way when your opponent is self-destructing. Normally, Trump does not follow political advice in that way. But they have done a pretty commendable job of just really staying out of the way, staying out of the spotlight while the news cycle has just been consumed with Biden and with the crisis in the Democratic Party. So they are staying as far from this as possible and sticking to what they have said was their original plan, which was to announce the vice-presidential pick either out or very close to the Republican convention in a week's time.",
