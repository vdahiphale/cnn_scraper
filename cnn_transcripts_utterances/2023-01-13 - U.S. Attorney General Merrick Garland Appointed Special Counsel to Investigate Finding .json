Katelyn, you and I have been talking to our sources about this, trying to get a check, basically, on what's happening in the other special counsel's investigation as we're learning about the new special counsel that was appointed yesterday.

So we know that this Justice Department investigation is continuing on, they're still making moves to try and talk to people that were working with Donald Trump's legal team. We have confirmation this morning that the Justice Department wants to talk to two people that Donald Trump's legal team hired in November to search multiple properties of his, about four properties, and that they had found two classified records in a storage unit in Florida.And so this is the latest step of an investigation that is going on for a year now that we know of, and it is an investigation that differs from the investigation we've been talking about this morning related to Joe Biden because there are questions that the Justice Department has on whether justice is being obstructed here by the Trump team. And also they clearly may not believe all of the records that are classified are asserted to be back in the hands of the federal government. That is something the Justice Department clearly is still trying to make sure that they have everything back. Now, we did speak to one of Donald Trump's attorneys on the Record, Timothy Parlatore. He was telling us that his team is trying to be very cooperative with the Justice Department at this stage. They did searches, they hired their people, they're trying to negotiate now, potentially, to talk to the Justice Department team. And his quote to us on the record was that President Trump did nothing wrong and a proper investigation would have concluded months ago amicably.

As complicated as it is with Trump, it's even more complicated with Biden because, as we saw during the whole Trump term, once you're the president you can't be criminally prosecuted according to Justice Department rules, so he would seem protected there.But just imagine, if you're Merrick Garland and you're a very careful, judicious -- he was a judge -- attorney general, you may have to make a decision at some point, and it's going to be him, not the special counsel, do you bring charges against Donald Trump. You've got to know that he's going to figure into that, factor into that, we've also got a special prosecutor looking at Joe Biden who also had documents.

In 2014, before the couple was married, she told police in Washington D.C. that Brian Walshe \"made a statement over the telephone that he was going to kill her and her friend\". Although he was not named in the public incident report, police say the alleged threat was made by Brian Walshe. He was never charged in part because the victim refused to cooperate in the prosecution. The case was closed, and later, they ended up marrying. Walshe remains behind bars charged with misleading investigators surrounding his wife's suspicious disappearance, her whereabouts and condition unknown. This, as investigators are seeking answers. Major clues could come from the items law enforcement sources say, were found in a trash facility Monday evening, a hacksaw, and apparent bloodstains on cloth materials. Forensic tests are underway. The question now, how long could it take to get the results?",

He claims he last saw her New Year's Day, saying she left home to catch a flight to Washington D.C. But the 39-year-old mother of three wasn't reported missing until January 4th, when her workplace in Washington said, she didn't show up. (on camera) Investigators say surveillance cameras captured Walshe at this Home Depot on January 2nd. This is where prosecutors say, he bought about $450 worth of cleaning supplies, including masks, buckets, and drop cloths. (voiceover) Sources also tell CNN investigators discovered searches on Brian Walshe's internet records, including \"how to dispose of a 115- pound woman's body\" and \"how to dismember a body\".",
