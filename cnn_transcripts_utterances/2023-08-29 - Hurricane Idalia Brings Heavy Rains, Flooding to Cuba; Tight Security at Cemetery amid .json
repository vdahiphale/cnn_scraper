Now a category 1hurricane, it is expected to get very strong very quickly and it is expected to hit Wednesday as a dangerous category 3 storm. We have a lot more from Florida just ahead in this broadcast. Here's a look at what Idalia left behind in Cuba. It was intense even as it skirted the island as a tropical storm. Let's start there. CNN's Patrick Oppmann has been out in the rain in Havana. He's got a good soaking himself. Patrick, good to have you. What was the damage on the western part of the island? Because that is where that storm skirted at its height.",

Even ifCuba didn't feel the full force of Hurricane Idalia, it is still causing plenty of havoc here. The rain continues to pour in. That is going to lead to flooding. It's already led to flooding here in Havana and across western Cuba, where thousands have been evacuated. Hundreds of thousands are without power and certainly to be out and about in the storm is very dangerous right now. To be driving would be foolhardy. The government here told people to stay home. But you look behind me and these are people who have been waiting for weeks, if not months for unemployment, for a visa at the Spanish consulate here in Havana. They're not heeding the warnings and they're waiting in line, themselves getting soaked because they want to be able to go to Spain. And they don't want to give up that appointment. So you are seeing people venturing out. But for many people here, that is just too dangerous. They've gone into evacuation centers. They've gone to stay with family and friends. They have been wise because, even right now, we've seen people get knocked down. We had some of our equipment get knocked down earlier today when it didn't seem like the storm was going to hit us that badly at all. At points when I looked out over the city of Havana, I saw it disappear over a wall of wind and rain. It's pelting rain that continues to come down on us, continues to punish us. When Idalia gets to Florida, it will be so much worse though, Becky.",

Also these metal detectors that anybody who comes through is having to unload their pockets like it was an airport and is being searched. That's not normal in a cemetery here in St. Petersburg. So that's an indication that some kind of big funeral is being planned. But again, a veil of secrecy across the whole situation. What we do know is the Kremlin, who are trying to play this, down have said this morning that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, will not be attending any funeral, saying it is purely a family affair. And again, that talks to the idea that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin officially don't want to get involved in this any more than they absolutely have to. Of course, the Kremlin has dismissed this as absolute lies, allegations that they were somehow involved in the plane crash that killed Prigozhin and nine other people last week. But despite those denials, there is still a lot of suspicion here in Russia, elsewhere around the world as well. There could've been some kind of state involvement. I think that's why the Kremlin are trying to distance themselves as much as possible from the next stage in this process, which is a funeral arrangement. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You are also seeing a Paul Whelan who looks relatively healthy and relatively well. That his brother also pointed out, you can still see the fight in his eyes, that Paul Whelan remains unbowed. It's significant to note, Becky, he is not the only American that the U.S. says is wrongfully detained in Russia. You saw \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich, who is also being held in a Russian prison. The United States, of course, scrambling for the release of both of them.

A lot of it comes from news organizations and, of course, the content is particularly valuable because it's fact driven content. It's not just junk on the internet. It's accurate, there are standards in place. So what ChatGPT has been doing is crawling the internet, absorbing the information, giving it back to users. News organizations, on the other, hand and other media companies like Disney, they're saying, not so fast. If you want our information, if you want access to the archives, you need to pay for, it And so, they've taken moves in the past few weeks to block this bot that was scanning their websites and reading all the content, until ChatGPT's owner, OpenAI effectively comes to the table and pays them to license this content.
