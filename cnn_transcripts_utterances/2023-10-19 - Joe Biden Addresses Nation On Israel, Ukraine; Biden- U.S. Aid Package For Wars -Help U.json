But he is so closely tied to this. When he came here yesterday and sat in on a Cabinet meeting, not just any Cabinet meeting, but a wartime Cabinet meeting that we have never seen a US president do something like that with another government, sit in on their Cabinet meetings, and giving these strong speeches talking about the US support here. And I was thinking with the way that he is -- President Biden has talked about approaching Netanyahu, how we saw this in 2021, when, of course, there was a 21-day infighting, and he has always had this idea that keeping Netanyahu closer helps moderate him to a degree.

And I picked up on the initial words of the president when he said we are at an inflection point, and from someone who spent four decades in uniform, I firmly believe this is one of the most dangerous times in our history. The things he pointed out, first of all, in just summary, others are seeking our help. He tied both Israel's actions and Ukraine's actions to a fight for survival, a fight for protection of their people, a fight for freedom and dignity. And then what he also said was that others are watching, both our friends, our foes, our competitors. And, you know, what he then did, which I found very moving was he tied all of that, not to the money, not to what is expected, and not to the capacity of Americans to help, but he tied it all to what should be our values, our human dignity, our respect for one another, our religious freedoms and our freedoms writ large. Whereas this is an appeal, certainly, and it's a warning that he's going to send packages, as he called it to Congress to find what it really is, I think tying back to that inflection point, is saying, this is a time for action as Ben just said. People in Ukraine, people in Israel are depending on us as that beacon of hope that he described and it is important that we turn the light on and we support them as best as possible because they reflect who we are as a people.",

They are Iran-backed. The question at the time, were they fired at the US destroyer or elsewhere? The US destroyer took them out, took several of them out. We learned later that in fact, those missiles appeared to be headed towards Israel, a chance of opening up another front against Israel, not just from the north, say with Hezbollah, also backed by Iran, but here Houthi rebels to Israel's east. At the same time today, we saw US forces fired on in Syria, and in Iraq, again by what are in effect proxy forces for Iran. And you have two US carrier groups now in the Eastern Mediterranean, so while US forces don't want to be directly involved, they are in this region now supporting Israel, but they're also in the line of fire and they can be vulnerable. Hezbollah has thousands of missiles it can target those ships. The Houthis have many missiles, as we saw today, and you have those Iranian proxy forces in Syria and Iraq that could put US forces based there into danger. That is the issue here that you could have a multi-front war around Israel, you could also whether they want to or not find US troops and sailors in danger if that war expands.",

And that rocket, they say, caused structural damage at the hospital. Sorry, limited damage. But it did kill hundreds of people. Anderson, I want to show everyone where we're talking about. This, of course, is the map of Gaza. This is northern Gaza. The hospital sits right in the middle of northern Gaza. As you know, Israel has told people to leave the north and head to the south. We've also heard this vigorous defense by the Israeli military of what happened in the strike. They accuse Islamic Jihad, as well, of firing that rocket.

Lots and lots of damage. But the experts we've spoken with, Anderson, have looked at this damage. They say that this does not look like an airstrike. This is a new piece of video that CNN obtained exclusively. A crater in the parking lot at the hospital. This appears to be where the projectile struck. As you can see, it's relatively small. And again, these experts say that a crater this size is not what you would see after a missile strike from a jet or from a drone. It could be, they say, from a smaller rocket. I also want to show you these satellite images from before and after the strike. This is from above, of course. This is the hospital. This is the parking lot that we've been looking at before the strike. And this is after the strike. And afterwards, we see this blackened parking lot, the charred vehicles. But there is no evidence of a major crater. And that is very important. There is nothing visible here that points to a crater from an airstrike. Now, Anderson, since those horrific attacks by Hamas back on October 7th, we've seen thousands of Israeli airstrikes all across the Gaza Strip. This is what they usually look like, flattened buildings, huge craters. Now, could Israel have used a smaller munition, perhaps an artillery shell, at the hospital? Experts say that is not outside the realm of possibility, but as we now know, the U.S. and Israel are saying it is unlikely, given what else we've seen and what we know. So, all together, CNN has reviewed dozens of videos that have been posted on social media, aired on live broadcasts, and filmed by a freelance journalist working in Gaza, which show the blast and its aftermath. We have undertaken a thorough analysis of that footage which suggests that the devastating explosion was not the result of an Israeli airstrike. And we have these weapons experts who say that the visual evidence points to the possibility that it was caused by a rocket. Now, importantly, this does not prove the assertions made by Israeli and U.S. intelligence, but it is consistent with their claims that this was an explosion due to a local rocket that misfired.

Yes, the idea has indeed done several tactical incursions into the Gaza Strip, the perimeter close to the border with the purpose of finding parts, bodies and any other piece of information that could help us solve and understand the fate of all Israelis that are currently either dead or missing.And there's still more than 100 Israelis that are unaccounted for. And that activity, together with a lot of other intelligence driven activity, is designed to shed more light on the fate of each and every Israeli. We have 203 confirmed hostages.

Some 400 people who once lived on the kibbutz are dead or missing. And as we mentioned, two more people who lived there were declared dead yesterday. An American Israeli grandmother and her granddaughter. They've been missing since the attack on October 7th. I spent much of the day today at the kibbutz because of security concerns. As I mentioned, it's the first time journalists were allowed to go there. I'm going to have a more extensive and detailed report tomorrow because there's a lot of families I want to tell you about and what we now know about what happened to them there. But I want to show you just a brief glimpse at what I saw today, and some of the video might be hard to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) COOPER (voice-over): Carmela Dan (ph) was 80 years old. Her granddaughter, Noya (ph), just 13. As we saw today in Nir Oz, when Hamas gunmen attacked this kibbutz, few homes, it seems, were left untouched. The destruction is everywhere. Some 400 people once lived here. Now, according to an IDF spokesman, as many as a quarter of them are dead or unaccounted for. There are still three members of the family missing. Carmela's former son in law, Afar Calderon (ph), and two of his children, 16-year-old Sahar (ph) and Erez (ph), who's just 12. This video was posted online after the attack, showing Erez Calderon (ph) being dragged away by gunmen. One of whom appears to have blood on his hand. Today, in Nir Oz, we geolocated where the video was shot. (on-camera): This is the last known location of Erez Calderon (ph). He was 12 years old. He was kidnapped by Hamas gunmen. And he was videotaped as they were dragging him away in this direction. This is the fence to the kibbutz and Gaza is only about 1.5 mile away. You can see an explosion that's just taking place in Gaza off in the distance. So the gunman didn't have far to take him in order to get him back into Gaza. (voice-over): The IDF has not released any information about Erez (ph) or any other missing members of his family. (on-camera): What's clear here is that it wasn't that civilians were just caught in crossfire. It was -- civilians were the targets. I mean, men, women, children were the targets. LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON: Yes. I mean, they came in and they came in to people. It was right after a holiday. It was a holiday weekend. So there was a lot of grandparents that came here to see their children. Children to see their grandparents. Horrifying, Anderson. I'm still in shock. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They are OK with us showing that video of him being taken by gunmen and hope that showing it helps to bring him home or raise awareness of what's going on. We're going to have much more, as I said, from Nir Oz tomorrow.Now an update on a story that we brought to you last week. Maayan Zin, the mother of two girls captured by Hamas, says that her former husband, his new partner, and the partner's teenage son, who were also believed missing, have now been confirmed as killed by Hamas after the attack on their kibbutz. Maayan Zin's two daughters, 15-year-old Dafna and 8-year-old Ella, are still believed to be held hostage. She said she first learned her daughters were missing when her sister sent her a photo of her oldest Dafna sitting on a mattress in Gaza. The image was posted by Hamas. Here's what she told me last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAAYAN ZIN, DAUGHTERS KIDNAPPED BY HAMAS (through translator): They're everything I wanted all my life. This is my existence to be a mother. It's all I wanted. I didn't want be rich. I didn't want to be married. I didn't want anything. I wanted to be a mom. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
