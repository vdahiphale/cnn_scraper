New satellite images from NASA show just how extensive the toxic smog has become over parts of eastern Pakistan. Officials say this season's smog has reached unprecedented levels. It's all thanks to a dangerous combination of coal-fired power plants, traffic burning waste and weather. On Monday, air quality levels in Lahore reached more than four times the level considered hazardous by IQ Air. Officials in Pompeii, Italy will start capping daily visitors to just 20,000.

But now many people here hope and believe that a new Trump presidency could bring those relations back on track.UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translated text): I don't think he can directly stop the war, but I feel he can set ultimatums to both sides, which will definitely bring this conflict closer to an end. PLEITGEN (through translated text): Trump also said he wants to end the war in Ukraine? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translated text): We all want that. We really want the war to end now. The situation is impossible. I hope we get to a mutual understanding. PLEITGEN (voice-over): But what could a so-called mutual understanding look like? This video from Ukraine's military purporting to show Kyiv's forces hitting Russian troops in the Kursk region of Russia, where the Ukrainians say they are now facing off against nearly 50,000 Russian and also North Korean troops. The Ukrainians acknowledge they probably wouldn't be able to sustain their operations without U.S. military aid. Aid Donald Trump has in the past insinuated he might cut altogether in an effort he claims to end the war. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECT: They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done. I'll have that done in 24 hours. Take over, Elijah. PLEITGEN (voice-over): A Ukrainian source now saying Trump was joined by billionaire Elon Musk on a recent phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Musk, who while helping Ukraine by providing Starlink satellite internet, has in the past also criticized military aid for Ukraine, ridiculing Zelenskyy in posts on his platform, X. The Kremlin is vehemently denying Washington Post reporting claiming a Trump-Putin phone call has already happened. Still, Vladimir Putin openly praising the president-elect's stance on Ukraine and on Russia. What was said concerning the desire to restore relations with Russia to help end the Ukrainian crisis, in my opinion, seems to me to be at least worthy of attention, Putin said. The incoming Trump administration certainly has the attention of many in Russia, hoping for improved relations with the U.S. and even possible sanctions relief. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Moscow.

They will continue apace whether or not we act on climate change. So these summits, the COPs, are a unique annual opportunity for the world to come together and make decisions how we will act multilaterally to address this global problem. Behind the scenes, individual countries are also taking action. And the transition to renewable energy systems, which is one of the cornerstones of climate actions, of reducing these greenhouse gas emissions, which create the problems of climate change, are still gathering pace. Renewable energy is becoming cheaper and more effective. So the transition is happening, whether or not world leaders are present at the COP.

Others sing the national anthem. State media even released this viral video, students chanting about their passion. Then came the crackdown. Authorities closed key bike lanes this weekend, citing safety and traffic concerns. Bike-sharing companies issued warnings. Some colleges restricted students from leaving campus. All temporary measures, police say. Authorities insist the situation became unmanageable. Traffic disruptions from abandoned shared bikes, massive youth gatherings, all of it happening in China, an authoritarian state led by a party that itself came to power with the help of mass movements often led by students. From Tiananmen Square in 1989 to the COVID lockdown protests of 2022, large, organized student gatherings rattle the ruling party's nerves, even if participants insist they are not political.
