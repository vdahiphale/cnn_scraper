This hour, a new batch of documents related to convicted dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein has just been released and includes testimony from a former Epstein employee about the famous and influential people who hung around his boss. Plus, she has been the subject of T.V. dramas for years Gypsy Rose Blanchard, who admits she helped in the plot to kill her abusive mother. After eight years behind bars she is fresh out of prison and talking to CNN.And leading this hour, just 10 days away from the Iowa caucuses, Republican presidential hopefuls are blitzing the state trying to sway any undecided caucus goers to break their way. And the next hour Donald Trump is set to hold his first event of the day. Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley both spending the afternoon meeting with voters in the Hawkeye State. CNN's Kristen Holmes and Steve Contorno join me from Iowa. And Kristen, Trump's expected to give a speech at one of his events and in roughly an hour.",

Before I go through them, I just want to caveat that we often get excerpts ahead of Donald Trump's speeches. He does not always stick to script, so I'm going to go over what he is expected to say, but obviously, we cannot completely rely on these excerpts. So, he does attack Joe Biden, he talks about his campaign event, he does not talk about the substance of what he said. He does not talk about Joe Biden's argument that Trump is a threat to democracy, instead, he goes up to where the where the event was located.And he says that the reason why he's essentially talking about this democracy topic is because he doesn't want to talk about the border or inflation or Afghanistan, or all the chaos he has caused throughout the world. Now I do want to point out, this is something that we know that Donald Trump's team is going to be really trying to double down on pointing to how, quote unquote, \"chaotic things are in the world.\" And that's one of their talking points against Joe Biden. This continues on, he says that -- at one point, he says that, again, that he is not the one that is a threat to democracy, but that Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. And here's an interesting part, he turns now to the primary or to the caucuses, saying that our country is dying, and it's no time to waste your vote on another establishment career politician. But most of this is actually still back on Joe Biden and reads very much like a general election speech starting to fit in here like we are already at the start of a general election. Now we also know one thing he's going to touch on today is trying to urge his supporters here not to be complacent because of those poll numbers. They are worried that people will not show up because of those large margins and they want to get a huge turnout on caucus night. Jake.",

And there's a chance that they can turn this around, at least by Super Tuesday on March 5, but maybe even by February 11 or 12 when those ballots in Colorado first go out.So, what's important here are two things, first, the biggest thing here is that the U.S. Supreme Court is going to weigh in and give an answer once and for all whether this 14th -- the Constitution's 14th Amendment Section 3 that bars insurrectionists from ever, you know, holding off, it's again, whether that applies to Donald Trump. But what it did was it did not tell us exactly all the questions they're going to address. It's at least just saying we're taking this case.

So there is a chance that they will never even get to the issue of whether Donald Trump incited an insurrection on January 6. They might not even get to whether Donald Trump is president is covered by this, they have several off ramps that they did not lay out yet. But what the parties will now do, the parties and several, what we call friend of the court, amicus briefs are all going to come in trying to lay out the various options the court can take to settle this once and for all.Now remember, this is something that states have handled variations on their election law. So the justices are going to have to do something that goes beyond kind of the intricacies of what happened in Colorado, and be clear, and they could either do that, frankly, at the kind of gatekeeper stage to say maybe this is what's known as a political question that the judiciary shouldn't even be part of it at all, that this is the kind of thing that belongs in the legislative branches. That is part of the questions that were presented to it in all the filings that came in this week, Jake. But once they get over that hurdle, there are a couple other threshold questions. But what they have to do is either stop it at the early stage so that it is clear whether states have the authority to block a president from the ballot. Or if it's the kind of question that actually cannot ever be resolved and has to be handled legislatively, you know, within those kinds of boundaries, or get to the point where they shut it down once and for all and say that section three of the 14th Amendment would not bar Donald Trump, or it does bar Donald Trump from ballots everywhere.",

      "sentences": "Paula. REIDNow that's notable because that is not something that the Trump team actually asked for. They just wanted this reverse, but there will be an oral argument ahead of that. There is a briefing schedule. There's work that needs to be done between now and February 8 when they'll have this oral argument. I mean, this is moving along pretty quickly, but it's unclear if this is actually going to be resolved related peers that will not likely be resolved for the primaries. The concern there that has been expressed by the parties is that you could have people voting in primaries where they're not sure if their candidate will ultimately be eligible for the general election. But here the Supreme Court is at least granting this request to weigh in on this critical constitutional issue. And as Joan noted, there are a lot of questions before them. One is whether section three of the 14th Amendment applies to presidents. We've seen even courts within the same state disagree about that. The other question is, well, is it self executing? And should the States be executing this? Is their role for Congress? Now, interestingly, the Republican Party of Colorado also asked if political parties have a First Amendment right that should be considered here. Now, it's unclear exactly which questions they will or will not answer, but there is likely going to be a lot of pressure to try to decide this narrowly, to try to avoid the question of whether Trump engage in an insurrection and instead focus on the constitutional issues. And possibly this question of, well, who has the authority to execute section three of the 14th Amendment? But this is just one of the big moments in 2024 where all eyes are on the Supreme Court to make a critical decision that could have an impact on the election. We also expect in the next few weeks, they'll also be asked to weigh in on the question of immunity for former President Trump in the election subversion case. So, again, the Supreme Court is going to have an enormous role in this election year.",

We believe Donald Trump masterminded a lot of what went on, he's guilty of promoting the insurrection. He caused great harm to the reputation of this country, and threatened the lives of people who worked in the United States Capitol on that day. He has to be held accountable for those activities. He promoted it. No one, even a president or former president of the United States is above the law. And that makes Donald Trump one of those individuals to be held accountable.",

And we will live back that decision.Now, from the work of our Committee, we made certain recommendations about Donald Trump's conduct on that day and leading up to that day that we feel very comfortable with. New York, the District of Columbia will be addressed and things that are committed, uncovered. But we were not a prosecutorial body. We were basically looking into the facts and circumstances of January 6th. So here we are close to a three-year anniversary. And the wheels of justice are moving. And so I would say the work of our Committee has a lot to do with what's happening in those different venues around the country.

They don't deserve the right to promote patriotism in this country.So Jake, I'm convinced that in the end, people will speak.
