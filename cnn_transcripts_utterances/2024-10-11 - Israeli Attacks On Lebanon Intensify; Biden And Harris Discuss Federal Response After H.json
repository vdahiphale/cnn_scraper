Well, let's turn to Gaza because no food has enterednorthern Gaza since October the 1st, putting 1 million people at risk of starvation according to the World Food Program. We're also learning that two of central Gaza's main bakeries shut down days ago, not having enough flour as well as fuel to make bread. All this as a hospital director warns some medical facilities expect to run out of fuel in the next 24 hours. The Israeli military launched a new ground operation in the area on Sunday after seeing what it says are signs of Hamas rebuilding. Experts at the United Nations accuse Israel of committing war crimes over its attacks on the healthcare system in Gaza over the past year. I want to bring in our Nic Robertson who joins us from Tel Aviv in Israel. And Nic, let me start then on what we heard from the World Food Program report of hunger, that no food has entered Gaza, northern Gaza since October the 1st. Give us a sense of what aid is going in, what the IDF about -- saying about the aid, why isn't going in, and what this means about where are we on this ground operation?",

      "sentences": "The ground operation continues. The IDF says it continues to allow food to pass through theprincipal checkpoints that come into Gaza, and that would be specifically Kerem Shalom. The situation in northern Gaza is desperate humanitarian situation as the U.N. describes it. There is absolute shortage of food and -- you know, hunger is rampant, is the term that they use, and that famine isn't far away. I think if you -- they give an example, the U.N. gives an example of how many food trucks were getting into the north. It was about 700 food trucks in August. That was down to 400 food trucks in September. And nothing, absolutely nothing has gone in to northern Gaza in terms of humanitarian aid since the 1st of October, that's what the U.N. is saying at the moment. And this actually comports very closely with what we were hearing from U.S. officials just a couple of days ago, who have said and told us their Israeli counterparts that they must stick and adhere to the international norms of humanitarian law. Which means you must allow food and water and fuel, and the other humanitarian necessities to get through. And that's what we're hearing from those three healthcare facilities you're talking about in the north of Gaza, which treats so many people that are regularly getting shot, shelled, blown up, injured, that they are running out of fuel too -- that so bad that the doctors there say that they won't be able to keep the ICU areas going, that they won't be able to keep the life-support medicine going. And therefore, people needing that right now, who can't get out of the hospitals and can't get out of the way, even though they've been given evacuation orders because it's not safe, they say, to leave those areas because the military offensive is so close to them that these people needing life support when the fuel runs out. Sadly, doctors say so will their lives. So, it is a very desperate situation, and those bakers you were talking about, they're not even in the north, they're in central Gaza, and this really speaks, I think, to the fact that these shortages are writ-larger across Gaza than they were previously. And I think some people will be struck by the timing of this, that it's been from the 1st of October, that humanitarian groups haven't been able to get their aid into northern Gaza. The 1st of October is also the day that the ground operations, the IDF ground operations began at the border with Lebanon in the north. It is as if part of Gaza now is being really throttled back and restricted even in a way that it wasn't suffering earlier in the year.",

Rivers, reservoirs have overflowed and passed their banks, leading to this widespread flash flooding that is deeply impactful to this community. You can see just how high the water is reaching. We've seen mail boxes, underwater mail boxes with mails still in there. People essentially trapped on little islands inside of their homes. So, what we've been seeing as a Hillsborough County sheriff's office going out here in boats like this or airboats or even amphibious vehicles called SHERPs and getting people out. And we saw that for ourselves, a couple that we were following along with as they went inside of their home, filled up trash bags with all of their belongings, and -- you know, went back on the airboat and back onto dry land. They are all going to a shelter, but the question becomes is where are they going to continue to sleep? What happens a week out from here, a month out from here? Luckily, that couple had flooding insurance, but rebuilding here is going to take a while, and unfortunately, the threat is not over. Hillsborough County Sheriff, Chad Chronister, he's telling people, hey, take this thing seriously, if you're out by the river, leave this area because this is not yet over. And we know from our Derek Van Dam, our meteorologist, that the river has not yet crested. That's expected to happen here at midnight, crossing to 25.5 feet. That is not the record. That record is about 28 feet, but still that's a major flood stage and clearly, extremely devastating for the community, for people who live here by the river, Isa.",

That moment where we all suddenly found it very hard to communicate, to stepoutside out doors, that sense of claustrophobia. Afterwards I suddenly found it very hard to talk to my friends, people I've known and love for years. And I think it's planted the seed writing something about loneliness and also the outdoors and Spring, something that was hopeful and optimistic but wasn't said in this city, was said in this countryside which I absolutely love. Michael is a geography teacher who spends as much time as possible outdoors. He's recently separated from his wife. He can't bear being in the old family home. Marnie, on the other hand, is -- lives in London. She's a copy editor. She works by herself, lives by herself, is perfectly happy by herself, and has fallen into a kind of a trap I suppose of solitude. And they're both brought together on this long weekend's hiking in the Lake District. Michael's intention is to walk all the way across the country on the coast to coast path, a very famous hiking path. Marnie just wants to be there for as short a time as possible. But a bond forms between them and they continue to walk and talk. And it's a love story set on that long hike all the way across England.",

And once Idecided to write about this long hike, the question was well, which hike? And the coast-to-coast has this terrific sort of symbolism. It's all the way from the west coast of Cumbria right across the Pennines, to the east coast of Yorkshire. You go down to the sea at Robin Hood's Bay and you -- you've carried a stone clear across the country. You throw the stone in the water and there's an element of pilgrimage I guess to it. So, this seemed like a lovely setting for this walk. And when I did the walk myself over about 10 days, I found myself kind of Imagining the characters in very specific situations and trying to work out what the rain, what the beauty of the landscape, what the terrible pub would mean to them at that particular time. So, the novel was very much devised on location. And that work is an extraordinary walk. It's not all beautiful but what I particularly loved about it is it has three acts if you like. It has the beauty of the Lake District at the beginning, a much gentler landscape in the middle with the Yorkshire Dales, and then finally a rather beautiful but harsh landscape with the North Yorkshire Moors. And that seemed to fit the structure of the novel too.",
