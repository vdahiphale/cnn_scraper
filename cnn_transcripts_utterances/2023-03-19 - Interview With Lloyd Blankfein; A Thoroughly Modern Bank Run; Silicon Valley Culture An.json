I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, panic in the markets as the banks need rescuing again. I'll ask one of the people who was at the center of the storm the last time around, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, about whether the system is stable. And is your bank account safe? Also, how did it come to this? Did we learn the wrong lessons the last time? I'll talk to Gillian Tett of the \"Financial Times.\" Then, don't mess with the French people's retirement plans. That is the lesson from weeks of strikes and protests then chaos in parliament as the government pushed through their policy anyway, which brought the outrage right back to the streets. We'll tell you what you need to know. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Instead, it left them with the power acting in concert with the FDIC and the Treasury to -- if they find a systemic emergency, to guarantee the deposits of entity by entity, bank by bank.I think what we heard from the Fed that in this moment, this fragile moment, they are implying that they will regard any event or any run on a bank as systemic and the implication is they will use that authority that they have but they can't announce that in advance and they can't declare it. But they've come as close as they possibly can to do it. But they in fact don't have the power to issue a blanket guarantee. But I -- you know, I would be -- I think you're able to rely on it but there is a tail risk in that lack of absolute certainty.",

That is the whole bunch of these tech companies, where the CFOs should have been managing their accounts properly left huge amounts of money in uninsured deposits. Roku had $500 million sitting essentially in cash in an account.Presumably there are other regional banks that made the same mistakes that SVB made that are now going to get backstopped by the Fed. Is it fair to say that the government has helped a lot of people who in the normal course of capitalism made mistakes and should have been wiped out?",

      "sentences": "Well, I don't think there's anything on the table to guarantee banks per se and their income and their solvency. We're talking about -- we're talking about depositors here. But, look, there is going to be a lot of wide policy debates are going to flow from this. Clearly if we don't do this, look, the biggest banks, the few biggest banks have very, very high capital standards and liquidity standards and stress tests.And the regional banks, even large regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank have a much lower level of regulatory scrutiny and therefore kind of safety. Let's be honest. And if you just left it like this, the lesson that people may walk away with is that their banks, their money is only safer, maybe only safer with the largest banks and so they're exercising their discretion in moving those things. The end of this game might be more consolidation which was never an objective of the system. Big policy debates, you ask about the future of banking. Is it a virtue that America has well over 4,000 banks? Most big countries have a few big banks with branches that operate throughout the company. We have branches that are dedicated to regions, that focus on particular industries, Silicon Valley Bank is an example. It may be the oil patch. Particular groups like some community banks and loan associations and connected to unions. We also have the fastest growing large economy in the world and I'm not sure that that is not a reason. Our credit system for the largest economy is in the communities and in the industries and in the, you know, various sectors and that is probably a good thing. I wouldn't necessarily want to experiment and withdraw that. But if we give -- if we incentivize people to only go to the biggest banks, then the sector will consolidate beyond what people think is an attractive thing.",

It's highly likely it seems to me that this -- all these bank crises are going to do some version of that. So should the Fed stop raising interest rates?",

I personally -- I personally think it would be OK to stop here. To your direct question about with respect to the current situation and the effect on the economy, it is a certainty that this situation will cause -- will act in a way that's similar to a rate rise in some ways.Banks will have to -- you know, because of the tension, because of the pressure an uncertainty, banks will husband their equity. They'll do less lending on the deposits they have and so already there's going to be less credit, less credit means less growth.

The reason, some argue social media caused some of the panic that resulted in history's largest bank run.My next guest has written about the curse of virality that has underpinned this modern crisis. Gillian Tett is U.S. editor-at-large for the \"Financial Times.\" Gillian, welcome. And I want to ask you to put your hat on as an anthropologist not just a financial wizard because you are PhD in anthropology and you've written about the, you know, the sort of, the way this stuff works sometimes culturally because so much of what happened here was triggered by social media and by the kind of virality or the speed with which a communication happens today. Is that at the heart -- at particularly the speed of this bank run?",

So, for example, you could make it difficult for people to pull out money quickly in digital means. You could have a cooling off period. You could basically say that people who post, you know, scary messages on the internet as many people did beginning of last week, you could say that could be prosecuted for, you know, creating panic.But frankly speaking, I'm not sure that is going to work. Because in an age where we're free too order whatever pizza we want on our phones at any time, we don't want to have a situation where we can't take our money out of the bank because that is seen as a sort of curtailment of freedoms. And it is very hard to say what is or is not, you know, fear-mongering messages because one could argue that some people felt they had a public interest to warn the public about the dangers in the banks by putting things on social media rather than just keeping that knowledge into the hands of a tiny elite. So, I would argue that the only way you're really going to counter this world of cyber flash mobs which can destroy credibility and credit, in the Latin sense meaning trust, is to make sure the banks are actually trustworthy.",

And each of them will be voted on separately. They need to have a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament. So, it is not a majority of people present but an absolute majority of seats in parliament, in the national assembly.That technically is perfectly possible. If all of the opposition parties were to combine and were to vote in favor. I think what we're likely to see, however, is that you will see the extremes, to see Marine Le Pen's party on a nationalist, populist hard right will vote in favor, and the left wing alliance will also vote in favor. But the key to this vote is the Republicans, the central right Republicans Party. They are being told by their leader not to vote in favor but some of them are rebelling and want to vote this government down. So, it could come down to the votes of 20, 25 Republicans, whether or not they decide to try and bring the government down. I think that they won't.

Since then, life expectancy has gone up about 10 years. Meanwhile, as I said, the ratio of workers paying into this fund has gone down dramatically. I think about 30 percent.So, the math clearly seems to suggest that you need some adjustment. Every other European country or at least every other major European country has made these adjustments. Germany's retirement age is 67, not even 64 which is what Macron is proposing. Are the French just sort of blind to this and feel France is unique?",

You know, reform I think is in his DNA. That is what makes him president really. He feels he can do things to try and change France, reform France in ways that haven't before.But, you know, you only have to look back in history. You'll remember it was under Jacques Chirac in 1995 when they tried to reform pensions and at the end brought down that government and there were -- the parliament was dissolved. So, it is something that touches the very heart of what the French believe in. And it is I think Macron felt or feels still that he can do what past presidents haven't been able to.
