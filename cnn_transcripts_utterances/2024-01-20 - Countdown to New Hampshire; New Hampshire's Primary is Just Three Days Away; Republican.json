I'm Kim Brunhuber.Ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" Republican presidential candidates are in New Hampshire this weekend ahead of Tuesday's primary. What a new poll says about taking on Joe Biden there, and how one candidate is reacting to a pretty big snub when it comes to an endorsement. Meanwhile, the Israeli prime minister seeks to explain his position on the two-state solution with Palestinians, the White House. A lot of live report from the region. And missing out on the American dream, how one generation sees a very different economic landscape than what the indicators say. New Hampshire's primary is just three days away and Republican contenders are campaigning furiously during the final weekend before the votes are cast. Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are all taking aim at each other, but also beginning to focus on the man each candidate hopes to face in November, President Joe Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And with your vote four days from now, we're going to win another historic victory in the great state of New Hampshire. And then we're going to defeat crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of our country. And we're going to make America great again. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a question of what does that portend for November and how the Republican base is going to be energized or not energized. We know the Democrats probably wouldn't be energized with Biden in the absence of a Trump nomination. I think that they would have trouble with turnout. But I think we also know that if Trump's the candidate, I think you're going to see big time uptick in Democrat enthusiasm. And I think it's going to give him an advantage. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And if you look at those head-to-head polls, look at any of them, there's numerous. You look at the head-to-head polls, Trump and Biden on a good day are even. He might be up by two points. It's margin of error. It's going to be a nail biter of an election. We're going to end up holding our breath again. I'm in every one of those same general election polls, and I beat Biden by 17 points. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Friday for the annual March for Life event. It's the second one since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections in 2022. Participants who gathered at the National Mall say they're now looking to states to pass abortion bans. At least 14 states with Republican majorities have banned the procedure, with little to no exceptions. More than a dozen states plan to hold their own marches in the coming weeks. President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are downplaying apparent differences over the possibility of a future Palestinian State. The two leaders spoke on Friday for the first time in nearly a month. A person familiar with the conversation tells CNN, Netanyahu explained that the public comments he made a day earlier, in which he appeared not for the first time, to reject the idea of a Palestinian State, weren't meant to foreclose that outcome in any form. The White House says the president reiterated his support for an eventual Palestinian State once the war between Israel and Hamas is over. Biden says he believes Netanyahu would agree to a two-state solution, \"given the right one.\" CNN's Scott McLean joins me now live from Istanbul with the latest. So, Scott, that conversation between Netanyahu and Biden. Take us through what was said and how you think that rift might impact the war.",

So, of all of the things on that call, at least according to the American readout, the need for humanitarian aid, the American push to -- for the Israelis to sort of transition this war into a lower intensity phase, the two- state solution was very last on that readout. And perhaps that's because it is the least realistic thing of happening anytime in the foreseeable future.And this shouldn't come as a surprise. As you pointed out already, Kim, that Prime Minister Netanyahu has signaled this before, and President Biden is well aware of it. Even last month, he said that Israel is not interested in the two-state solution because, at least in part, Netanyahu is beholden to his far-right government in Israel, and Netanyahu had said that he wouldn't make the same mistakes of the Oslo Accord, the closest that Israel has come to a lasting peace in recent memory. And so. the White House thinking on this has been sort of to brush it on the -- off to the side say that look, Netanyahu has made this kind of statements before and then come back to a more moderate position, and at least according to a person familiar with that call, he did as well yesterday saying that his comments on Thursday were not meant to close the door entirely on the possibility of a two-state solution. And in fact. that he found the possibility of a demilitarized Palestinian State backed, given security guarantees from abroad is something that he found intriguing. This is something that's been pushed by the Egyptian president before, and also something that it appears President Biden is interested in as well. Listen.

Netanyahu's popularity in Israel is sinking to new lows. There are calls for fresh elections in Israel.

That's coming up. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [04:15:00] BRUNHUBER: Ukraine says Russian troops are suffering heavy losses in fighting near the eastern city of Donetsk. But some Ukrainian soldiers tell our Fred Pleitgen and they're not sure how long they can hold out. We just want to warn you, this report contains graphic video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT (VOICE-OVER): It's a site Ukrainian troops in Avdiivka see all too often, a massive Russian armored assault force coming right at them. The Russian infantry moves with virtually no cover. The Ukrainians call these meat assaults because the Russian troops have virtually no chance of survival as Ukrainian drones hunt them down. They assault with a large number of personnel, the head of the drone unit that filmed the videos tells me. Assault after assault, nonstop. If we kill 40 to 70 of them with drones in a day, the next day they renew their forces and continue to attack. It's been going on for several months, as Russian President Vladimir Putin seems hell bent on taking Avdiivka. Russian vehicles under artillery fire as they get close to Ukrainian positions. The ground littered with dead and dying Russian soldiers trying to overwhelm the Ukrainian defenses here. The Ukrainians say they're holding back most of the assaults, but are outgunned and outmanned. We need more people, more military, more equipment. We need more ammunition, more drones, he says. Unfortunately, we don't have the amount needed to win. We need a lot. And the Russians not facing the same shortages are dropping massive amounts of ordnance on the Ukrainians, everything from artillery to heavy guided aerial bombs. One of the key defense points, a massive coke plant at the edge of town. And that's where these guys are setting up their defenses. Under constant fire, elite snipers from Ukraine's Omega Special Forces. Here they have the cover to hit advancing Russian soldiers. Their anger visible in the hoodies they wear for our interview. With the weapons we have, at distances up to 1,300 meters, the effectiveness of our work is 90 percent, he says. For that kind of precision, they need to keep their weapons in pristine condition all the time, they say. Here At the beginning, it seemed the Russians could encircle Avdiivka very quickly, he says. But as we see, Avdiivka has been ours for three months and we're holding on. Holding Avdiivka for now, even as assault after assault eats away at Ukrainian defenses. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, near Avdiivka, Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER: Belarus has adopted a new military doctrine that would serve as the country's first step towards deploying nuclear weapons across the country. On Friday, the country's defense minister said the nuclear option \"is considered as important measure for preventative deterrence from potential adversaries,\" adding that it demonstrates Belarus \"does not treat any nation as its enemy, regardless of the actions of the governments of these nations.\" The doctrine is still awaiting final approval from the all-Belarusian People's Assembly, which will be held in April, according to Russian state media. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania say they're going to build new defensive installations on the borders with Russia and Belarus. Estonia says the agreement between the countries includes a network of bunkers, support points and distribution lines. At the end of this month, NATO will hold the group's largest military exercise since the Cold War. All member nations and Sweden will participate. The chair of NATO's military committee says the organization has no choice but to prepare for a possible war with Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

His attorneys issued a brief statement after Friday's indictment was announced, indicating, \"We look forward to our day in court.\" Baldwin had been previously charged with involuntary manslaughter, the lead prosecutor at the time describing for CNN a culture of alleged negligence on the movie set. MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, NEW MEXICO FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set. That there were live rounds on set. They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those or at least they weren't checking them consistently. And then, they somehow got loaded into a gun, handed off to Alec Baldwin. He didn't check it. He didn't do any of the things that he was supposed to do to make sure that he was safe or that anyone around him was safe.
