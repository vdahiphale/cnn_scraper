Security Council is now expected to vote in the coming hours on a resolution calling for a suspension of hostilities in Gaza. This follows a delay amid negotiations to finalize that resolution, which aims to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza. The militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad has released a video of two Israeli hostages. The footage shows the two men speaking in front of a camera. We have decided not to air it because they're likely speaking under duress. In the video they asked the Israeli government to do quote everything necessary to secure their release. They say their lives in Gaza are extremely dangerous. Islamic Jihad released the video a day after Hamas released similar footage showing three elderly Israelis in captivity.

The Americans are giving Israel several more weeks at least maybe four, maybe six it's the timeline or the window is not exactly clear. But the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces does talk about requiring another four to six weeks to be able to continue and get done what it needs to in terms of hopefully reaching more of Hamas' central bases, more of the Hamas leadership taking out some more of its key assets that will take time.

And tragically, they were misidentified and they were shot and killed by those soldiers. So the families are definitely and I would say legitimately so very concerned.On the one hand, the government allowed to some extent for the failures of October 7th to take place and for Hamas to take their loved ones hostage. And at the same time, the operation on the ground is not yet bringing them home. And we see how close they are, right? They were just a few dozen meters away. And unfortunately, it ended with a tragic conclusion. So, if you -- the families of the hostages want to see the government do more. They don't necessarily believe that it's just the ground offensive on its own that is going to see their loved ones returned safely. They want a deal and that is what this pressure is about. That's why they met with the Prime Minister last night is all aimed at getting him to give the green light for a new deal with the Qatari mediation to somehow in some diplomatic way bring their loved ones back to them.",

What we've seen so far is that the especially on the container side, the owners and operators have been very vocal to redirect their volume outside of Suez Canal and south of the Cape of Africa.The main effect this has on shipping is of course, adding the sailing distance of that extra voyage and depending a bit on where the cargo is coming from, and where they're headed to. You can say the average distance added from that voyage could be between 30 to maybe 50, 60, or even up towards 100 percent added distance from this. So of course, that takes a long time. The main the main cost component when it comes to moving this this cargo, the further away around Africa is naturally fuel costs in the first point. And if you start to account for that, for a typical container headed from the Far East into Europe, for instance, you quickly get to around maybe five, six to eight, 9 percent of added cost just purely from the fuel side of things. And then you get the secondary effects here, which ties have a lot of capacity in the shipping fleet and therefore tightens the shipping markets, and that in itself would drive -- would drive an increase in freight rates and therefore costs for the for the end consumer .",

But for a typical container, which perhaps is the most, the most interesting to look at in terms of costs for the end consumer. We're seeing somewhere between probably six and 8 percent direct costs on fuel. And then because of the insecurity of how this will happen, and how available freight will be, we've already started to see the freight rates and box rates for this type of transit to increase quite a bit.Over the weekend, we had the far eastern Mediterranean rates of roughly 20 percent. And that is set to continue as long as there is a risk to disruption here, which I think is the main driver from the logistics provider side. Now, that's on the container side. I think it's also very interesting to mention that, of course, there are other types of cargo that pass through the canal. For the time being, it has been the containers that have been leaving the move outside of Suez, but you've also had some of the main tanker companies and also the energy tech companies saying that they want to redirect their ships outside of the Suez Canal. And that, of course, has a direct impact on the cost of oil or oil products and the security of such into, for instance, Europe. And that in itself could also add additional costs to this and just comparing to the average cost of crude oil today. We see that the direct implications on the current freight markets would maybe be two to $3 added cost I think about lowering (ph) the cost into Europe.",

They even acknowledged a right in the top of their opinion, the magnitude and the weight of the questions that they are analyzing here.And here this Court found that former President Trump should be disqualified from being on the ballot in that state because they say not only did he engage in an insurrection, that they believe that the 14th Amendment which bars certain officials from holding office, if they engage in an insurrection applies, even to presidents. Now, a lower court or oversaw a trial in this case the lower court found that Trump engaged in an insurrection but he said presidents are not specifically mentioned in that Section 3 of the 14th amendment. [01:20:10] So they said it didn't apply. But here the Supreme Court, looking instead at the intent behind this amendment, looking at the overall objective of what they were trying to do, when they were working on the language of this specific section. Now, the issue there is that the Trump campaign, the Trump team, they've made it clear, they're going to appeal this to the Supreme Court. This decision will likely be on pause until the Supreme Court weighs in one way or another. But this decision, which is largely based on intent, and larger objective, is likely headed to a Supreme Court that is dominated right now by originalist, textualist judges who pride themselves on looking at the specific literal words in the constitution. So it may not be the most favorable environment for this Supreme Court of Colorado decision. But again, it's unclear if the Supreme Court will take this up, they likely will want to resolve this issue, because otherwise, you're going to have this hanging over all 50 states and undecided and if the Supreme Court weighs in, that decision would be binding across the country. But the Trump team says they're going to appeal swiftly and as soon as they do, this decision is on hold until the Supreme Court rules one way or another. Paul Reid, CNN, Washington.

But is everyone with a gun and fatigues a soldier? The West Bank is under Israeli military occupation. It's also believed to be home to almost three-quarters of a million settlers, Israeli civilians living in the occupied territories. Settlers consider this part of their biblical homeland and are expanding into the Palestinian territories, even though the U.N. Security Council considers their presence illegal. Yet settlers are integral to Israel's security plan in the occupied territory. As Israel Defense Force reservists and settlement security squads responding, the IDF says, to security threats in settlements, towns, and villages. Palestinians told CNN they consider armed settlers a greater threat than ever before. Their remit from the IDF is blurring the lines as settlers encroach on Palestinian land. Like here, in the Palestinian village of Towannee (ph), where there is a settlement at the top of the hill. In this video, you see men in military fatigues. The IDF equips both civilian settlers security squads and soldiers in the region, as you can see here. It's almost impossible to differentiate. They point their rifles at residents and then they shoot, according to eyewitnesses. CNN shared the images we gather in the West Bank with a senior IDF official who was unable to tell us who here is in the IDF and who is not. We asked how then are Palestinians expected to differentiate? The official told CNN there have been cases of reservists who did not act in accordance with army standards, adding there is no place in the IDF for such behavior. Every case that breaches army standards will be investigated. Palestinians, the officials said should contact their local brigade. But Palestinian rights activist and local resident Basel Adra (ph) says settlers in military fatigues are forcing Palestinians off their land.",

Epstein was indicted in 2019, accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. He died by suicide while awaiting trial.CNN's Jean Casarez has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This order is borne out of the civil suit that was filed by Virginia Giuffre that according to legal documents was settled in 2017 but names have continued to remain redacted until this point. So what names are we now going to learn? Well, according to the order, and let's show everybody, first of all alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein. Now, the court says the reason they are going to be public now is because they already have been public. People have done interviews, there had been testimony by some of these alleged victims, some documents have had these names in them. Also, alleged associates of Epstein's that once again gone public already, testified in the trial, detectives, assistant state attorneys, their names have been redacted in some documents. A public figure, who according to the court order, is one of many names in Epstein's address book. That will become public. Journalists whose names have been redacted will become public. An individual who allegedly recruited young women to give Epstein massages will be released. An individual whose role has been widely reported in the media, the court order says that they have been prosecuted overseas for sex trafficking. That name will be released. But the overall theme is that these people have already been named in documents or named in the trial. So there is an availing of to the public already. Who will not become public? Victims of Jeffrey Epstein's who were minors, who have remained private, who have not come forward at all, they will maintain their privacy rights. According to the order, there is a number of days that all of the John and Jane Does will be allowed to appeal this if they want. Following that, if no one appeals it, then everything will get an order and in early 2024 these names will be public, along with the documents that previously had all those names redacted.
