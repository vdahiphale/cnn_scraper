In a little over 24 hours, results will begin pouring in with huge implications for the direction of the country and the future of the Biden agenda.Also tonight, two election exclusives. CNN sits down with Republican leader Kevin McCarthy to preview his plans if -- if the GOP wins the House. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi opens up to Anderson Cooper in her first interview since the brutal hammer attack on her husband Paul. CNN reporters and correspondents are on the campaign trail covering the key races in the major battleground states -- the House and Senate and governor's mansions across the country as well. All are at stake. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. First let's go to CNN's Kate Bolduan. She's standing by for us in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania. That's just outside Philadelphia. Kate, control of the senate could come down to Pennsylvania. Both Mehmet Oz and John Fetterman are spending these final hours getting out their closing messages. What's the latest? KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, Wolf. Three hours from now Mehmet Oz will be here with supporters for his final rally of campaigning, his final moment to campaign, his final rally with supporters before election day. For both candidates in what has now become the most expensive Senate race in the country, their closing arguments, they have been consistent in their messaging really for weeks now. For John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor, he says to voters that he has been and is here to fight for Pennsylvania voters as he has been for years, accusing Mehmet Oz of essentially being a snake oil salesman saying that Mehmet Oz is only here in order to use Pennsylvanians for his personal gain. Mehmet Oz, though, his closing message is he is the candidate of change in this race, speaking to the frustration that voters have with regard to inflation, as well as crime, and he has been accusing John Fetterman of being too radical and too extreme, words he uses over and over again, for Pennsylvania. Oz saying that he rejects extremism on both sides. And we'll be seeing that more tonight. Wolf?",

Barack Obama was here four days earlier. As far as Laxalt goes, he is the former attorney general here in the state. His late grandfather was a U.S. senator, Paul Laxalt, here in Nevada. And Adam Laxalt joined a lawsuit in 2020 to challenge the 2020 election results. That lawsuit failed. Barack Obama, candidate to Joe Biden who is now the president of the United States, got 33,000 more votes than Donald Trump. And that's the situation here in Nevada.

Reliably blue territory.It's kind of a path we've seen the president follow over the course of the last several weeks, going to places that he and his aides feel like he can help most boost enthusiasm, but also places where he can deliver a very clear message about the stakes of the moment, the stakes from an agenda perspective, the stakes as he's framed it over the course of the last week, from a democracy perspective. Now, advisers say expect him to loop all of those issues into one, really kind of knit it together as part of his closing message. In fact, just a few hours ago he was speaking to donors at a finance event and he made clear of the stakes not just about those bigger picture issues, but for their agenda as it moves forward, saying that there's so much more we can do if only they can hang on to the House and the Senate.

And generally speaking, they are not very happy with incumbent leadership, especially when one party has full control over government. So, Herschel Walker, as flawed as he may be as a candidate in a competitive purple state like Georgia, he is going to do about as well as any generic Republican will do in that state, which puts him in a very competitive race with the Democrat.

It really should have been built in the summer or a little bit before that and then hammered throughout.But instead, they were focused on abortion. They saw that as a real opening. And you know, they read the data like everyone else, right? We have to keep in mind part of the reason we pay such close attention to polls is because we know that the campaigns make decisions based on the polling data that they're seeing and Democrats, you know, try to take what advantage they could on the issues that play to their strengths.

The reality of the situation is that Americans are upset because when they go to the store things are expensive.And, frankly, there's really not a whole lot that Democrats could have messaged their way out of that very real problem for Americans. That's why this has been so hard. Not because they haven't been trying to find a message, but because just the sheer reality of the situation, the magnitude of the scale of the problem of inflation and costs, it's too difficult to have a problem to simply just have a slogan and it gets you out of it.",

For other people, it's immigration or it might be voting rights. These are -- it's a sign of a party that is not simply coalescingaround one obvious message. So, you hear Democrats saying this should be called the cost-of-living election which is how Pete Buttigieg has been talking about it. But this is also an issue of real consequence for Joe Biden. He cares about democracy not only as a political leader but as the person who history will be looking to, to say how did you handle a moment when United States was on a brink of serious challenges.

Now, we will see what she ultimately decides to do. The Democrats in Congress are certainly preparing for a post-Pelosi world.

We haven't really been talking about that very much because she as leader has been such a strong leader that it hasn't been a major source of headlines.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): On the outskirts of Kyiv, the bridge into Irpin in the Bucha district was a lifesaver for those who managed to flee the early Russian advance. In the seven months since these scenes, the horrors of what those troops left behind have been fully exposed. Mykhailyna, the Deputy Mayor of the Bucha region is taking us to meet residents who are rebuilding. But throughout this heavily destroyed residential area, it's a race against winter. As temperatures start to plunge and blackouts continue, money is tight, but spirits are high. At the very least they need to replace glass in the windows and patch up holes the size of tank and artillery rounds. Tetyana shows us pictures of her apartment small bedroom destroyed in March, rebuild now. Her story is hair raising and miraculous, hunkering down in the basement for 10 days under Russian occupation. This is the picture of the Russian tanks arriving just 15 minutes after she fled. When we left, they were shooting at us from behind, she tells me. Now I realized what kind of a second birthday I got. What kind of a gift because those people who left right after us were shot. As this city tries to put the pieces back together again, there's another more sensitive, perhaps even more difficult kind of rebuilding underway. The U.N. Children's Fund UNICEF has placed pop up tents full of warmth, light and care. All these children have been traumatized, and some have been forced to witness unspeakable horrors.
