Those issues were immigration, crime, and inflation. You are going to continue to hear Trump's team hammer that Harris is part of the Biden administration, meaning Harris is part of those policies. They have seen the polling that shows that Donald Trump is stronger on those issues. They want to beat Harris the same way they were trying to beat President Joe Biden. The big question, of course, remains whether or not that is going to be possible. There's obviously a lot more enthusiasm around Kamala Harris than what we saw around President Joe Biden. Now, we have seen a very confident JD Vance out there today talking about Harris hitting her hard, saying that it's time for Donald Trump to be back in office. But obviously, this is very different from what we heard in that \"Washington Post\" exclusive audio that they obtained from a donor event in which JD Vance was much more skeptical saying, that it was a sucker punch when Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Adding on top of that there were more liabilities with Joe Biden than there were with Harris and mentioning age specifically.

So, we are already entering into this contest, struggling with a key demographic group that Republicans, once upon a time did mathematically very well with.

More than 100,000 Lebanese have been forced to leave their homes in the south. If Hezbollah engages in something that will provoke a massive Israeli response, the number of people affected will be far greater. And there might be pushback from Lebanese who do not support Hezbollah. And there are many of them. So they have to calibrate their response. There will be a response. The question is just how large it will be. Anderson?",

      "sentences": "We're sort of on the edge of the abyss. As I said, both sides really don't want a full scale war. I think the Israelis, after 10 months of war in Gaza, perhaps don't have the appetite for that, even though there is intense political pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to bring quiet to Israel's northern border. And at the same time, there are many restraints on Hezbollah.But the problem is that in a situation like this, where both sides want to push to a certain extent, send a message, but not go too far. The problem is one of them might make a mistake. For instance, the strike that killed the 12 children in the Golan Heights on Saturday, it's widely believed that was a mistake by Hezbollah. That was not their intended target. So mistakes happen and mistakes can oftentimes, despite the sort of the intentions of the warring parties. Any wrong move, any mistake could really unleash the kind of regional war, because let's not forget, Iran backs Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, the militias in Syria and Iraq. And if push comes to shove, they will all become involved in this -- in a war between Hezbollah and Israel, and then all bets are off. So we're at a very dangerous moment. And I think in the next few days, we'll see if it's just going to be a flare up or something much, much worse. Anderson?",
