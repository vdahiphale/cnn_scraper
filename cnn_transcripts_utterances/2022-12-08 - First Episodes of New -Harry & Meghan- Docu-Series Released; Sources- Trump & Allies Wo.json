In fact, there was conspiracy working against them and that was between the palace or elements in the palace and the media.So when they wanted to answer back to many of the much of the misinformation as they call it in the British media, the palace would often say, let's just leave, it let's not pursue this. And, male members of the family would also say that the other -- their partners, their wives have been through similar things. So, therefore, you just need to grin and bear it effectively. These were ideas that Meghan and Harry refused to accept, and Harry would point out to those members of the family that they are something different here. It is the matter of the wife's race, and this was coming up in media coverage. And they felt that the palace should be doing more to protect them, and they weren't protecting them enough. This is part of the documentary, a part that stood out to me.",

She even references the \"Princess Diaries\" saying there is no school where someone tells you to cross your legs like this, or expect this at a walk about. She says she Googled the British national anthem. Is that the case? And why isn't there a support system to help people adjust to being a royal?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is what she says, no education, no one helping, her and particularly as an American who did not necessarily understand the British royal system, she says it was particularly difficult. This is really a pointed comment, she did not understand what the royal walk about what was, you didn't know what it was.They certainly know this has been the case before. It was expected in the royal family that Diana would know what to do because she come from an aristocratic background, her family had been involved with the royal family, but it's very different being a member of the royal family to working as a court for the royal family. Diana didn't have much guidance. Kate obviously had a very long relationship with William, so there's lots to see. But certainly one thing we do know about Meghan is that some people who were sent to tell her what to do, including Lady Susan Hussey. Recently, there's been racism row of what Lady Susan Hussey said to the charity balls at Camilla's reception. So if there was anyone sent to help Meghan, they would clearly not someone who could help her. I think this really suggests a very outdated institution. If women and people you marry are not into their complicated role, everyone is watching for you to fail. There could be mistakes made at any moment. If no one is actually saying this is how to do, we give a hand, over perhaps that is needed and there's urgently how he has talked about modernization, that this would be a key her for modernization for royal family gets this guidance.",

I feel like whether it was inadvertent or intentional, the docuseries is acting to some extent like a bit of an expose of an institution that is quite opaque and arcane to a lot of people, to anyone that is not in it. [05How damaging do you think it is going to be in terms of how people perceive the monarchy, especially as there are increasing tensions as it sits sometimes on comfortably in the egalitarian modern society.",

They are exposing all of that and saying actually this quite mundane and it's not perfect, and being a princess is not what it's all crack to be.So, I think it's done some damage to the brand to that extent. And also, the idea they didn't fully embrace Meghan who is biracial, and that was one of the issues here when they say they did not take her race into account enough, that is a criticism of the system, and not diverse enough. So, these are criticisms are being laid before and Kate was referencing some of that. Harry also making the point that they struggled a bit with the idea of this American actress coming in, and he actually thinks members of the family believed it wouldn't last, this relationship. He talks about how he connected with Meghan in a way through his mother, they are very similar people, experienced very similar treatment in the British media, that was something that he wouldn't accept, he did not want to see that happening all over again with his wife as happened to his mother. This is a moment from the documentary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So these sort of systems, he does not believe should be broken, and that is effectively what pulled him out. That press pact is one thing that has also a large part of the rest of the media, which has completely you know running wild as it were and do come up with lots of speculative stories which they're frustrated with as well.So, which part of the media are they talking about? And actually, I think there is something more from the palace which would say this conspiracy theory does not exist, it is just a ruling system where we have one camera instead of 30, and media outlets need to share the footage.",

      "sentences": "Well, what Harry said, yes, he said there is an extension of the PR arm of the palace, and he did not go into much more detail there. But we do know from some of the trainers that he is later going to say that it was not just a media attacks on him, there were also leaks and plants coming from it seems within the royal household.So he's going to talk about relationships between possibly members of the royal family, and journalists outside so clearly he very much feels as if there was an agenda out to get him and it is interesting if he says it's an extension of the PR arm of the royal family, he's suggesting that the PR arm did not want good PR for Harry and Meghan, because that is the inference he's making there, and the PR arm was saying some is good, some not so good. So, certainly, but I do think that there is an important role from the palace. Here my personal feeling is, we saw this huge amount of criticism of Meghan and Harry for some many reasons, I think some of that could have been stopped by the palace. Some of that could have been -- remember there was Harry and Meghan had bought cottage $2.4 million of taxpayers' money, spent on, that was what happened with all royals. They all get a property, crown money spent on it, never was criticized before. The $2.4 million was all over the place, headlines. I think the palace could have put out a statement saying this is usual practice for royals. We are happy with the 2.4 million. It does not need this coverage. But they didn't. The coverage just did run wild, you know, it continued and certainly I think we will have over the next coming days, I think we will have a lot of -- I don't think falloff from the you family, but lots of sources who will make what they think clear, lots of journalists who will have -- will say points. So I think this is just the beginning, this is the opening, there will be lots more comments coming from the media, those who will disagree with, us and of course next week we have three more episodes, and it seems to me as if those three episodes will be the ones in which Harry makes it clear how stories are planted against him.",

They had hoped that Walker would win, of course Walker being Trump's handpicked candidate in that Georgia election. And would breathe new light into what has been a lackluster launch of his 2024 campaign.They also hoped that a win would and these calls for new GOP leadership, after so many of Trump's candidates in the midterms failed. Now what they're seeing is quite the opposite. They are concerned that this loss is going to lead to more people, more demand for people to challenge former president Donald Trump when it comes to 2024. Remember, this loss of walker's coming off a very bad week for the former president. And we are told that he has been stewing at his Mar-a-Lago resort. He is calling allies. He is calling advisers, he is upset about his campaign success so far. He is upset about those verdicts in New York, and he remains upset about Herschel Walker. Now there is a reason for this. We are hearing from a number of people who are former Trump supporters who are saying, it is time to move on. I want to reach one quote here, and this is from someone close to Trump. This is what they, said they said, Donald's got this problems right now, and they are so numerous that I don't think he can win. I want to back a winner. There are a lot of friends of mine who don't want Trump at the top of the ticket, because they feel like it's a killer. That is a pretty strong statement here from somebody who has backed Donald Trump and even spoken to him recently. This is somebody close to the former president. One thing to keep in mind, though, is even with all of this, we talked to advisers, we talked to Republicans who do not support Trump, but say they are wary of him because they say they have been down this road before, and they believe there is still a portion of the base who does not really care about any of this and only cares about supporting Donald Trump. So that is something, of course, that is yet to be seen, but certainly seems like a pivotal moment, a moment which the former president has the most politically vulnerable he has been in years.

It is now more than three and a half weeks since those four students were murdered. Around six and a half thousand tips they have received so far, they are asking for more information, particularly regarding the last movements of two of the victims, Ethan Chapin and Xana Kernodle, who we believe we're at a frat house in the four or five hours leading up to them going home where they were killed. Police are asking for any little -- any little piece of information, however trivial it might seem, call it in, because that might help investigators put together a clear picture of what happened that evening.
