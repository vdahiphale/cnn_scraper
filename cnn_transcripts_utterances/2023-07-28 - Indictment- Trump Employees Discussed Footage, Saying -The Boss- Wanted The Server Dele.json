Just after that, investigators say De Oliveira brought the club's I.T. expert into a private room, and this was their conversation. According to what is written in this superseding indictment, De Oliveira told the I.T. expert their conversation should remain between the two of them. He asked how long that server kept footage, and the I.T. expert said he thought it was around 45 days. De Oliveira then said, quote, the boss wants the server deleted. When the I.T. expert pushed back, De Oliveira reiterated the boss wants it gone, and then asked, what are we going to do?Let's go to our colleague, CNN political correspondent Sara Murray. Timing here, Sara, is everything, right?",

You know, as you pointed out, Donald Trump is facing two counts related to this alleged scheme to delight the surveillance information, and we now have Carlos De Oliveira added as a defendant.But let's look at the timeline. May 11th is when the Trump team gets this subpoena for any documents with classified markings. It's 45 days before we really get into the meat of this sort of scheme to try to delete this surveillance footage. But throughout May you can see these boxes getting moved out of the storage room. In the indictment, it says on May 22nd one box is moved out. On May 24th, three boxes are moved out. On May 30th, 50 boxes are moved. And June 1st, 11 boxes are moved. This is happening by Trump employees who are talking to Trump throughout. On June 2nd, 30 boxes get moved back into this storage room by Walt Nauta, a Trump employee, as well as Carlos De Oliveira. That is the same day that a Trump attorney is going to come search that storage room for any documents with classified markings to try to satisfy the demands of the subpoena. On June 3rd, the government comes to pick up those responsive documents. They notice that there are these security cameras around there. And then on June 24th the grand jury issues a subpoena to the Trump team for the surveillance footage from those security cameras. So let's dive into what was going on, on June 24, a little bit. So again, this is the day that Trump's team gets this subpoena for these security -- this new security footage. At 1:25 Trump's attorney talks to Donald Trump about the subpoena. At 3:45 Walt Nauta, again, this Trump employee, is informed that Donald Trump wants to see him. Less than two hours after that, Walt Nauta, who we know is traveling with Donald Trump all the time, changes his travel plans to go to Palm Beach. Instead of traveling with Donald Trump, he is very cagey about this situation. When you read the indictment, he is sending shushing emojis to people. So it's June 27 where we really get into some of the meat about this alleged plot to delete the surveillance footage. That's when Carlos De Oliveira is told the footage lasts about 45 days, and he tells another Trump employee that the boss wants the footage deleted. So when you look over this timeline, guys, you can see why there were a variety of activities going on, moving boxes out of storage room that never make their way back in ahead of the attorney searching the storage room that people might have been a little concerned of being caught on camera. [08:05:08] HARLOW:  Sara, thank you for that, because it helps us really understand the timeline. And count 32 in this superseding indictment is about that document that got so much attention, the Iran potential attack plan. Prosecutors say they have it.",

As we look at this new superseding indictment, as Sara just went through that very important timeline there, what struck me is what allegedly happened with Walt Nauta shifting these travel plans abruptly, going down to Mar-a-Lago to talk to folks down there. In your role when you worked for the former president, is this something you would have been dispatched to do? MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY:  Oh, there is no doubt about it. This is so part of the Trump playbook that when I heard it on television it didn't surprise me at all. Everybody running around, you've got to take care of the boss, do what the boss says. You may remember, Erica, I had said on this program a long time ago when the indictments first started coming out that this is not -- this is not unusual for Donald Trump to want to get rid of documentation, to delete stuff. And the real question that we have to ask is, what documents does he have? What documents did he show to people? You know, is this his id, is it his ego? Was it in order to be able to show off with letters like from Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un? And the answer to that is, no. And I stated that I believe that there's more nefarious reasons that Donald is keeping these documents. And I'm shocked and I'm appalled that there is still people that are supporting him when you must understand that he is placing our national security in complete chaos simply for his own personal benefit.",

It's really hard to break away from Donald Trump and sort of come clean and find yourself on the other side, because there's a penalty, right? Michael Cohen was attacked, Michael Cohen lost a lot of money, Michael Cohen, went to jail. Donald Trump hasn't as of this point. And I think Donald Trump, perhaps made the calculation that it's going to be much harder for these guys who are maintenance workers at my staff, they're not going to have the means they're not going to have the motive.

This is where the caucuses will be in Jan -- on January 15th.So, it's going to give us a good idea of where this race is headed. And there was a new Fox Business Poll over the weekend. It shows former President Donald Trump with 46 percent out ahead of everybody here in Iowa. Then, Ron DeSantis at 16, Tim Scott at 11 and then kind of everyone else. So, that really sets the stage for tonight to give you an idea of how much these other candidates aside from Donald Trump want to break through with these voters. We've been following along with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, over the last day as he set out on a bus tour across rural Iowa, that's continuing today before this dinner. That comes after he had this reset of his campaign where he laid off roughly about a third of his staff citing budget concerns. His campaign officials admitting to some missteps in terms of messaging and fundraising. And they're really trying to get back and focused here in Iowa. We heard from him, this message of electability. And really the only time he was talking about his chief rival Trump, is when he was asked about him by a member of the media and he said, look, I won in Florida by 20, Trump only won there by three. He's really making this case that he is someone who can win in 2024 in a general election by winning over independent voters. He talks about what he did in Florida. In the meantime, the other candidates in this race are looking to see kind of how DeSantis is reset might affect them, might obtained a memo from the super PAC supporting former Vice President Mike Pence, who's had trouble getting traction in this race. They're really looking at what's going on with DeSantis is perhaps an opportunity for Pence, to be more aggressive, to maybe scoop up some of those voters that they believe DeSantis could be losing. But again, this is very fluid right now. We are some six months out, a little less than six months out, Poppy and Erica. But with former President Trump's so far ahead, it's going to take a big moment for these candidates to break through and anytime they get together like this. They hope this is that moment. And look, all eyes are going to be on the former President with all the news that we've heard in the last 24 hours. As you mentioned, Poppy, it's going to be the first time we're seeing him in person tonight. Since all of that, and it really just sucks up so much oxygen in that room, Poppy and Erica.",

I should know Asa, Hutchinson, Will Hurd and Chris Christie, of course, are. But the main players and I mean, I've advised many political candidates, the idea that you wouldn't take your chief opponent being indicted and run with it and say, they can't win a general this is radioactive, he's going to lose to Joe Biden, but they're not.So, I'm curious to see if there's going to be a change in the tone. If you're someone like Mike Pence, who has kind of struggled to get traction. And who did really differentiate himself on January 6, this could be a moment to say, I take National Security seriously. This is beyond the pale. We need to move a different direction. Any of those characters kind of need to, there's not some, it's not like rolling out a policy proposal is going to break through and they're going to somehow overtake Donald Trump. HONIG: It's interesting, and sometimes a little awkward to watch some of the candidates try to walk that tightrope on the issue of these ongoing indictments. I mean, there is the -- Chris Christie, who's unabashedly critical. But Mike Pence, for example, whenever he's asked his stock response is, Donald Trump was wrong. I did not have the authority to throw up votes. Right, but that's not really the issue. I mean, that no one disputes that. But what's Donald Trump wrong with all the stuff he did for weeks leading up to January 6. Was he wrong to tweet about Mike Pence while the riot was going on? And so, there's this delicate dance, I can't quite do the political calculus, but from a legal perspective, I'm thinking boy, they're really tried to thread a needle here.",

But, you know, it's deeply offensive. What DeSantis is saying.Take, I don't know, child sexual predation and trafficking, which is something that the right wing is concerned about. What if I got here and said, well, you know, maybe your piano teacher molested you, but you learn how to play the piano. Maybe your football coach molested you'd be learned how to throw a football. Would that be acceptable? I think people would be shocked to hear somebody say something that's stupid and tone deaf and horrible. But that's What DeSantis is doing, and I think it should be disqualifying the party of Lincoln. The party of Lincoln should not have somebody apologizing for slavery anywhere near them.",
