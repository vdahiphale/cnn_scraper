Prosecutors allege that Trump instructed two of his employees, Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, to delete security camera footage of Mar-a-Lago that showed top secret documents being moved around. Page 29 of the superseding indictment out tonight reads -- quote -- \"De Oliveira then insisted to Trump Employee 4 that 'the boss' wanted the server deleted and asked, 'what are we going to do?'\" And you'll remember that audio tape that CNN obtained that captured Donald Trump apparently showing secret documents to a group of people who did not have security clearances. We now know that the special counsel knows exactly what was on that secret document. Just to remind you, here is how Donald Trump described it then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (voice-over): These are bad sick people, but -- UNKNOWN (voice-over):  That was your coup, you know, against you. That -- TRUMP (voice-over):  Well, it started right at the -- UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Like when Milley is talking about, oh, you were going to try to do a coup. No, they were trying to do that before you even were sworn in. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  That's right. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Trying to overthrow your election. TRUMP (voice-over):  Well, with Milley, uh, let me see that, I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack Iran. (PAPERS SHUFFLING) TRUMP (voice-over):  Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came up. Look. (PAPERS SHUFFLING) This was him. They presented me this -- this is off the record -- but they presented me this. This was him. This was the Defense Department and him. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Wow. TRUMP (voice-over):  We looked at some. This was him. This wasn't done by me, this was him. All sorts of stuff-pages long, look. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Hmm. TRUMP (voice-over):  Wait a minute, let's see here. (PAPERS SHUFFLING) UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Oh my gosh. (LAUGHTER) UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Yeah. TRUMP (voice-over):  I just found -- isn't that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Uh-hmm. TRUMP (voice-over):  Except it is like, highly confidential.",

UNKNOWN (voice-over):  You did. TRUMP (voice-over):  This was done by the military and given to me. Uh, I think we can probably, right?

I mean, it's so -- look, her and I, and you probably almost didn't believe me, but now you believe me. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  No, I believed you. TRUMP (voice-over):  It's incredible, right? UNKNOWN (voice-over):  No, they never met a war they didn't want. TRUMP (voice-over):  Hey, bring some, uh, bring some Cokes in please. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But today's indictment included one additional one, making it 32. We now know that document relates to the Iran attack plan that was mentioned in that recording.

And one of the most remarkable things is after the FBI searched Mar-a- Lago, and there's text messages that prosecutors have clearly obtained that they say shows that President Trump himself, these two Mar-a-Lago employees were talking about how Trump himself is the one who wanted the surveillance video ultimately deleted.

Okay, then at 1.25 p.m., Trump's attorney speaks with Trump about this subpoena.Then two hours later, 3:44, Walt Nauta informed -- it was informed that Trump wants to see him. And then two hours later, Walt Nauta changes his own travel plans and goes to Palm Beach, and he meets with de Oliveira, who's the head of maintenance, and they contact the IT director.

So, you see a chain there. But you also see something else. As Elliot knows far better than I do, a prosecution can hang on a witness or can hang on a tape. But a good prosecution is elemental, which is apparently, if they attempted to delete it as it's written in the indictment, it suggests that they didn't succeed, which could mean two things. One, that they deleted it, so they thought, and the FBI was able to recover it from the bottom of those servers and bring it back. That has happened in many cases where they recover information that people believe they deleted. Either way, the indictment describes going down the tunnel, de Oliveira and Walt Nauta with flashlights towards the storage room, pointing out the cameras. This is highly suggestive that they have all those videotapes. In the original indictment, there's references to videotapes of boxes being moved. So when you string all that together, the change of travel plans, going down the tunnel with the flashlights, talking to the IT people, asking for deletions, and when he says, I don't know how to do that and I don't have the right to do it in technical speak, in IT world speak, that means probably I don't think I have the administrative rights on the system to delete the entire server, I'm going the next level up to talk to the head of security.

In a statement, doctors say -- quote -- \"that they are hopeful for his continued progress and are encouraged by his response.\"Earlier today, LeBron James tweeted about his son saying, in part, I want to thank the countless people sending my family love and prayers. We feel you, and I'm so grateful. Everyone is doing great. Let's bring in CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner. Dr. Reiner, always great to see you. But it is alarming to hear doctors say that Bronny James had recently, like a couple of months ago, had a cardiac screening and an EKG, and they both came back with normal results. So, why do you think this happened to him?",

The specific cardiac screening that Bronny James had a few months ago, including echocardiogram, which is really designed to identify the most common cause of cardiac arrest in athletes, which is called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the heart muscle, but that only accounts for 40% of the cardiac arrest in young athletes like Bronny. So, there's still a big basket of potential causes, including primary cardiac arrhythmias, things like long QT syndrome, and much of that still has yet to be teased out.",

So, it's hard to know. Right now, I think the best news for Bronny James is that he was resuscitated very quickly. He left the hospital in really rocket fast time, three days --",

There are implantable heart rhythm monitors that can detect in real time. that can be performed. There are implantable heart rhythm monitors that can detect in real time whether he is having any abnormalities.Many people like Bronny, who survived an out of hospital cardiac arrest, will have an implantable defibrillator placed. Now, we don't know whether that happened. Leaving the hospital in three days, I doubt he was fitted with one of those, and it would be super hard to play in the NBA with an implanted defibrillator. But the details will be sorted out in the coming weeks about what happened to him and then what to do going forward.",
