Can they -- can they -- can they get out?So I blame UCLA on this. I blame the thugs last night. But as I've been saying the last couple of weeks, let's not lose our minds over the heat of the debate between Israel and the war, and just remember we know how to do this. Peaceful protests are part of our culture. They're part of university and college culture. And my warning to the colleges and universities in the weeks ahead is this saying prepare to protect, prepare to de-escalate because this -- to me, this is a sign of failure. This is -- we're already at failure. And now, as I've been saying, as a mother of college students and a national security analyst, my only hope or my -- the -- what I'm judging now is can we -- can they de-escalate without any students getting harmed.",

This is where communication is key. What does the LAPD -- what are they saying? What are they saying to the students? Where is academic leadership? Why are they just handing this over to police officers. Like, this is -- you know, this is not ideal from the perspective of the community that exists there and the community that has been peaceful for the last week until others came in to escalate it. So, hopefully, we'll hear from, sort of, leadership that can communicate across these different stakeholders.

And what they have said is that ultimately, these are decisions that are up to law enforcement, up to the college campuses and the leadership there to decide how to handle these protests.But, really, what this two-week-long episode has shown is that President Biden is really trying to strike a very careful balancing act as you have seen this growing frustration over his handling of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The president last weighed in on these college protests on April 22, a time where he decried antisemitism but also said that there are people who do not understand the concerns of the Palestinians at this time. For the most part, they have relied on written statements and comments from spokespeople here at the White House. What the White House has tried to do is acknowledge the right of Americans and these young people to protest peacefully while also saying there should not be -- BOLDUAN:  I'm sorry, I'm just going to interrupt because we're going to go back to UCLA right now as there's -- as things are -- things are changing on the ground there.
