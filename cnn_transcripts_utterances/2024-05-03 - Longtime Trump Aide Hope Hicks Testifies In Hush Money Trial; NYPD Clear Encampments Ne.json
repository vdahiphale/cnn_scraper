      "sentences": "Yes, and Hope Hicks has been really painting this vivid picture of that chaos, of that scramble with theTrump campaign after the tape was released, and how also Trump interacted. She detailed, you know, first of all, how she got this request from a \"Washington Post\" reporter who first asked for a comment. And then talking about how Donald Trump was actually in debate prep at the time, he was along with top advisors like Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, and she described how they really huddled trying to determine how to respond. It was ultimately Trump who issued a video statement admitting eventually that it was him on that tape and then, you know, chalking it up to locker room talk. Hope Hicks, she really talked about how intense the media coverage was surrounding all of this. You know, the tapes released on that day actually upended all other news coverage for several days, which included a hurricane in the southeast United States. In addition to the Access Hollywood tape, Hope Hicks has also been describing other stories that surfaced around that time about other women's allegations against Trump. She talked about Karen McDougal's story when it was revealed by the \"Wall Street Journal\" days before the election, and then the urgent scrambled to respond to that. So, she has a lot to say because she was right with Trump through all of this. She started with Trump in January 2015 as his press secretary, and she described how she was on the plane morning through night with him for hours-on-end. So, she will be back on the stand for more direct testimony shortly. And prosecutors, they're likely going to try to get to any knowledge that she might have as to how closely Trump was involved in this payout to Stormy Daniels. You know, it's unclear, Hope Hicks will have any information, she's already said as to one specific question for prosecutors about an August 2015 meeting between David Pecker and Michael Cohen when it had previously been said, Erica, that Hope Hicks had walked into that meeting briefly. She said, you know, I don't recall. So, prosecutors are probably going to continue. They've touched a little bit on Stormy Daniels so far, but it seems like they're going to be moving into that pretty heavily once we come back from the break here.",

He wanted to know what they knew. He wanted to know what was in the article, what was the source? That's when he says that he wants more information and context. That's what he's talking about. And that was part of the panic that was in his mind at the time in his need to do something. In which case, apparently, according to testimony that I looked at, it seems that he needed to make a phone call to Mr. Pecker and Hope Hicks was in the room for that telephone call.

You mentioned those numbers, Isa, those are important, and well over 2,000 people who have already been arrested at U.S. colleges or universities. And it's also becoming clear that there is a segment of those people who have been detained by authorities that don't necessarily have any affiliation with the universities on which they are detained. In fact, we learned today from Columbia University that about 13 people who were detained earlier this week inside of that Hamilton Hall actually were not affiliated to Columbia. And then these pictures that you showed our viewers a few moments ago, these will also be added to that rising tally. There were two very active scenes earlier this morning here in Manhattan, Isa, one of them, these pictures that you're seeing at the New School, and then also in lower Manhattan at New York University, where we now know according to authorities that roughly 13 people were detained. The problem there according to campus officials was that there were these encampment that was actually spread out over the sidewalk, rating an issue there for people on campus, so as a result, just yesterday, NYU officials reaching out to the NYPD, just as Columbia did, asking for assistance, and the result was again, 13 people there and about 43 people at the New School. Then there are also some of these situations that come up fairly opposite. For example, just across the river in New Jersey at Rutgers University, officials there announcing that they actually reached an agreement between these student-protesters that were staging an encampment. And also officials at Rutgers agreeing to take in at least ten displaced young Palestinians to continue their studies at Rutgers. Rutgers also agreeing to review a relationship that it has with the university and the West Bank. So, there seems to be at least some common ground, now, it is important to point out that roughly 7,000 members of the student body at Rutgers are Arab or Muslim descent. So, it certainly was incumbent on the university to try to find some of that middle ground, so, it is certainly at least hopeful that we will begin to see more of these universities try to see at least some common ground. However, there are others that have resulted in clashes where at least in multiple arrests as those continue to add up. And we should point out, as we get closer and closer to -- well, likely be the first commencement ceremonies at some of these universities.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SASKYA VANDOOME, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER (on camera):  The campus protests here in France have been taking place for about two weeks now, and today, in front of the Ponti(ph) or in the center of Paris, you had students from many universities, from the Sorbonne, you had students also from trade unions. You had political parties and you have students from Sciences Po. Now Sciences Po is a very prestigious university, and just this morning that university was evacuated by riot police after the students staged a sit-in late Thursday evening. Now, the students were then removed from the hole this morning by police and they then came here. Now, what did the students want? They have said that they want French universities to sever ties with universities in Israel. They have said that they want French universities to condemn Israel. And finally, they say that they won't be able to protest peacefully on campus. Now, we've spoken to some of the protesters here and they have said that they felt inspired by what's happening in the U.S. Take a listen.",

Writing for the \"Financial Times\" this week, Edward Luce says this, \"America is in knots over the foolishness or worse of its campus protesters.\" But it is adults who are making the biggest dancers of themselves. The role of grown-ups facing street unrest is to keep the peace without sacrificing rights. And these include free speech and physical safety. The task requires principle consistency. In practice, he writes, \"adults from all walks, Republicans, Democrats, the media and university administrations are exhibiting traits of hysteria and dogmatism they deplore in the young. It should come as no surprise that the protests are getting angrier.\" And Edward Luce joins me now from Washington. Edward, welcome to the show. And I think it's fair to say we have seen quite spirited and at times heated protests from students across campuses in the United States. You say that -- we showed a little bit of your -- of what you've written. It's the adults and not the students who had the problem. Just explain what you mean. EDWARD LUCE, U.S. NATIONAL EDITOR &amp; COLUMNIST, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Well, thank you for having me on and for citing my column that adults really -- the share of blame goes pretty widely. Both political parties, university administrations, of course, and members of my profession. What's needed when there are protests of this type, which are entirely understandable in the circumstances is a reiteration of those two things that President Biden said yesterday, that we will protect the right to free speech, the dissent, and we will also uphold physical safety -- the public safety. In principle, those are very easy ones to understand, and both of them are enshrined in the rights every American has. In practice, they be making a really big mess of it. They heavy-handedness of a lot of the police actions and not just in New York and Los Angeles, but in many states, campuses across the country has inflamed the protests.

The others, they live in Gaza, so when a bomb falls from the sky, you know, out of hours, they're killed. But it still means they are a journalist who has been killed in a conflict zone.
