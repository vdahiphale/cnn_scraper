And suddenly, one morning in March, she was feeling dizzy. She was having convulsions. She actually had a seizure, went to the hospital, in and out of the hospital three times. She was on death's door, and the office manager of the dental practice realized that they had gotten a shipment of a potassium cyanide, and they didn't use that in the dental practice.So, she told the partner, the dental partner, he went to police in the hospital and told them about it. And a homicide investigation was begun. And once she passed, of course, they executed many search warrants. They found that he was researching undetectable poisons on his computer. But he started to ask all the inmates to help him because they were all getting out and he wanted them to distribute notes around the house and in the truck to make it look like she committed suicide in her own handwriting, wanted women to step forward and say they were having an affair with him and she and Angela got upset and was going to frame her husband with this potassium cyanide. So, this is -- these are all the allegations must be proven, but this will go to trial. But at this point, everything has stayed for the moment. And of course, James Craig has pleaded not guilty.",

The things they don't have yet, a Joe Dimaggio jersey that is -- was given to him by the baseball great, art, the title of his car. So, he gave them the Mercedes, they don't have the title yet. And then, cash that they were supposed to wired him because they're seizing his assets. The judge has said it's happening. And he's getting warnings from the judge over and over again court. I was there the last time, this time our reporter Lauren del Vall was witnessing Giuliani in court. And he's complaining. He's sitting with his arms crossed. He's speaking to the judge out of turn saying, everything I have is tied up. I don't have a car. I don't have a credit card. I don't have cash. I can't get my bank account. I can't pay my bills. And then, the judge says, you can't just talk out of turn. If you want to testify about your financial state, you can. And then, Giuliani said in court yesterday, somebody has to tell the truth.
