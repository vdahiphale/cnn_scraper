Let us remember that for two weeks he has been like the singer Shaggy, it wasn't me. It wasn't my check. I don't know who this woman is. And now all of a sudden, that story changes. So the one thing that is confirmed throughout all of this is that Herschel Walker is a liar. There are people who are okay with that, because as long as he is a Republican liar and the liar has an arm behind his name, that's all they need in order to vote for him.

Look, Herschel Walker is a flawed candidate, but people in Georgia are looking at this now as a binary choice between the policies that he will implement moving forward and Washington versus the policies that Raphael Warnock will implement moving forward. And they're looking at what policies will help them in the future, not what Herschel Walker may have done a decade ago and they're looking at his emphasis on fighting crime, working on reducing the inflation, helping the economy and also supporting our military.

First and foremost, the website to apply for student loan forgiveness or loan cancellation, if you qualify is now officially open and launched. Over the weekend, as you guys noted, there was a beta launch kind of a soft launch process. It was online, it was taken offline. The reason why is, look, guys, you don't need to think back far back to recognize the websites and the government and big programs have been problematic for Democrats in the past, many of whom now serve in this administration, including the president who was vice president at the time when the Obamacare website launched. The fact that 8 million people were able to move through the beta process, according to the president, without any glitch is certainly a good sign for an administration that behind the scenes for several weeks has been pressing hard to reach this moment. Keep in mind, up to 40 million individual borrowers could qualify according to administration officials for the student loan forgiveness. That website is now launched. The other element the President was asked about, obviously, is ongoing litigation. We've seen lawsuits from Republican attorneys general of several red states, other lawsuits as well. Those will be moving forward and obviously create some uncertainty here. But one thing we do know this program is now launched, 10s of millions of people qualify. The website appears to be working through the beta launch system, we'll see how this goes, obviously with just a couple of weeks as well to the midterms, guys.",
