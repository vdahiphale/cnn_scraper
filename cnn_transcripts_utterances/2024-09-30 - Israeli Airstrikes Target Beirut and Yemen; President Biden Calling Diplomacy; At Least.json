The Israeli military says it targeted Hezbollah strongholds there. Meanwhile, in Beirut, people are on edge after the first Israeli airstrikes overnight within the city limits. You can see the damage in this video from an attack near the city's Kola Bridge, a major intersection.CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. Now this follows an intense barrage of strikes in Lebanon that began about a week ago. Lebanon's health ministry says that the attacks on Sunday alone killed more than 100 people and wounded more than 350 others. Israel confirms that it also carried out air strikes more than 2,000 kilometers away in Yemen on Sunday. Video shot after a strike on a power station shows an inferno with emergency crews on the scene. Houthi-run television says at least four people were killed there and 45 others wounded. Israel's defense minister says the strikes in Yemen show that for Israel, quote, \"no place is too far.\" Well, CNN's Paula Hancocks is live in Abu Dhabi with more on all of this.

And they managed to have a fragile truce that lasted for 17 years. Now, admittedly in the short term, we can expect to see some change with Hezbollah. Yes.
