      "sentences": "Hi there Fredericka. And this is something that happened in the late evening hours of tonight. And we're getting the first video in of what appears to be the scene of what where all this took place, which is in Tel Aviv on one of the main promenades there near the sea.And the latest that we have from the Israeli authorities. And of course, right now, this is still very fresh. They're sort of trying to still piece together what exactly happened there. But they appeared initially to be talking about two separate incidents. Where they were speaking about a ramming incident and also a shooting incident. It appears as though possibly that is referring to the same incident, but sort of different parts of it. It appears as though there was a driver who ran several people on that promenade. We are now hearing that a 30-year-old man was killed in that ramming and several people have been taken to hospitals in the area. Some of them in light conditions, some of them in moderate conditions. There were -- there was talk of some severely injured people in that what the Israelis called attack as well. But the Israelis are saying at this point in time is that the person who was at the wheel of the car that rammed those people and which later overturned that that person has been, quote, neutralized. Now it's not exactly clear what that means. But it certainly seems as though at least for now the danger in that area the Israelis believe it appears to be over at least the immediate danger. Nevertheless of course, right now there are a lot of first responders who are on the scene. There's a lot of police on the scene there as well, not only trying to make sense of what's going on. But certainly, of course, also trying to make sure that that area is secured as well. Obviously, Fredricka, all of this coming at a time of very, very high tensions. As we did have those Israeli strikes throughout the course of the last night in Gaza and in south Lebanon, on an attack today that happened in the West Bank, killing two British Israeli women whose car the Israelis say it was shot at and then crashed. The mother of those two women severely injured in that incident as well. So, as you can see, a very tense atmosphere. Were at the same time the Israelis and all the others who have been involved in what's been going on here in the past couple of days are trying to stop this from boiling over and becoming something even worse -- Fredricka.",

      "sentences": "Yes well, House Republicans are struggling to pass even simple messaging bills. Which does not bode well for their ability to handle must pass items like raising the debt ceiling or funding the government. They did narrowly pass a parent's bill of rights that was something that was the signature piece of legislation, but it only passed because of 10 Democratic absences and very intense whipping effort behind the scenes.And Republicans are still struggling to deliver another key promise, including securing the border and delivering a balanced budget. Now, part of the reason for their struggles is their thin majority. They can only lose for Republicans on any given partisan vote. There's also some natural growing pains that come along with being in the new majority. A lot of these members have never served in the majority before. But there is another factor at play here. And that is that Kevin McCarthy made a number of promises in order to win the speakership that has really complicated his ability to govern. That includes a more open amendment process on the House floor. And while lawmakers have welcomed that addition to the legislative process, they also admit it's been a little messy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LISA MCLAIN (R-MI): I think we're holding tight to our commitment to America. And I know it looks a little bit dicey, and it doesn't look real fluid. But remember, we spent the last, you know, two years complaining that we had this top-down authoritative government, right, leadership. And now you're seeing the opposite. Where there is a lot of debate on the floor. You know, you have amendments that we can put on the floor. That's democracy, and I think that's a positive thing. Not real pretty all the time, but I think it's positive. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's really a fascinating case and quite outrageous in a lot of ways. Because Richard Glossip was never actually accused of killing the individual victim, Barry Van Treese. It was always established that 19-year-old -- then 19-year-old Justin Sneed committed the murder. It's just that he claimed, and he did so in a deal that got him off death row and just into life in prison. He claimed that it was a murder for hire, and he blamed Richard Glossip.Now, in addition to accusations that the defense did not get all the information that they were entitled to from the prosecution, it's become very clear that Justin Sneed has had some fights with his conscience over the years. And CNN has had a look at some of the letters that he has written to his attorney, including saying things like, quote, there are a lot of things right now that are eating at me, some things I need to clean up. His attorney appears to suggest that he keep quiet. That the only reason he's not on death row is because of his testimony. And another chance, he said, do I have the choice of recanting my testimony at any time during my life? [15:50:04] So, these are some of the details. And it's also just a reminder of the fact that Richard Glossip has almost been executed three different times. He's avoided that fate. But it's a reminder that the justice system is only as infallible as the people who are part of it. And, of course, executing somebody is really some -- a statement and an action by the state that cannot be reversed in any way. Who WHITFIELD: All right, we'll be watching. Thanks so much, Jake.",

And in these motions -- which were filed earlier, but just became public yesterday -- Fox is moving to limit references to the Capitol attack. I'll read to you what they actually said in their motion.They said: Any reference to the Capitol attack will only unfairly prejudice the jury against Fox, inflame passions, prevent a fair trial and taint any resulting verdict. They're also seeking to limit references to the threats that Dominion staffers faced in the wake of the 2020 election. They call those threats excusable, but they say that it could inflame passions again for the jury. Dominion obviously is objecting to these requests from Fox and they've come out, and they said that the Capitol attack is central. They call it central to their case. And they also said about the threats that Dominion staffers faced. They pointed this out, they said -- It also became incredibly difficult for Dominion to retain and win business because would be customers themselves are inundated with death threats, harassment and protests related to Dominion. Trying to stay there that it's not only our staffers that were threatened after the election, but our customers were potentially threatened because they were in business with us. And so, they want to include these arguments. And I'll just say it too, Fox is trying to say that their emotions are just aimed at bringing this to the core of the case.

Because it's going to be such an uncomfortable trial for them.They're going to have their biggest stars Sean Hannity, Tucker, Carlson and others on the stand. And you're also going to have Rupert Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive, Suzanne Scott. All of these people will be forced to take the witness stand and talk about what they knew about election lies. We know they didn't believe them because of these private text messages that have come out. And why they allowed them to go -- be broadcast on Fox's air.
