      "sentences": "Today, on \"Inside Politics,\" Donald Trump goes to swing states, Michigan and Wisconsin, where he'll stoke immigration politics, thousands of miles from the southern border, as Democrats zero in on the not so swing state of Florida. Thanks to big news on abortion there last night, which the Biden campaign is scrambling to capitalize on.Plus, a judge's words. The judge presiding over a Manhattan hush money trial tells Donald Trump what he cannot say. But Juan Merchan's own words about the former President might say a whole lot more. And RFK junior does Donald Trump's bidding. An independent presidential candidate says Joe Biden is a, quote, \"Genuine threat to democracy,\" putting what he calls social media censorship on par with Trump's efforts to stay in office even though he lost, which, of course, culminated in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and \"Inside Politics.\" Up first, a Midwest mission for Donald Trump. The presumptive Republican nominee goes to battleground states for the first time in almost a month, both Michigan and Wisconsin. The plans there is to spotlight immigration, the so-called migrant crime his team views as key to push on vulnerabilities by and for Joe Biden. What we don't know today is also important. Is there a Trump plan to confront abortion politics head on after a Florida court put the issue front and center there? And is there a plan to keep Trump from breaking a newly expanded gag order limiting what he can say about those involved in the Manhattan hush money trial that starts in just weeks? We start our coverage in Michigan with CNN's Alayna Treene. Alayna?",

      "sentences": "Well, good morning, Dana. And you're absolutely right. I think a key question today is how Donald Trump may respond to that expanded gag order from the judge.But look, I can tell you from my conversations with the Trump campaign, they don't expect him to cross the line. They know that there are repercussions if Donald Trump were to go beyond the latest gag order imposed on him yesterday, which includes not attacking the judge's family, which he has done before, and not attacking the family of the Manhattan district attorney. And so we'll see if he tries to toe that line today as he did this morning when railing against the judge who had imposed that gag order. But look, I do just want to bring your attention to what he's trying to do here today in both Michigan and in Wisconsin. It's really the first time we've seen Donald Trump in a matter of weeks. He only held two campaign events since his big super Tuesday win. And so this is him really kicking off his general election campaign in earnest. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has really seen a surge in political activity. And he's recently visited Wisconsin and Michigan as well. And I think that just underscores, Dana, how critical these two battleground states are, both for Trump and for Biden. We know that Donald Trump won these states in 2016, but lost them in 2020 to Joe Biden. And so he's really trying to make some ground here. Now, as for the overall themes that we can expect from the former President today, they plan to focus on the issues that helped propel him to victory in 2016, and that's immigration and crime. And as part of that crime push, he's actually invited the family of a woman named Ruby Garcia to his Michigan event. Ruby Garcia was recently killed here in Michigan by an undocumented immigrant. And police authorities say that it was a domestic dispute. Listen to how Donald Trump raised it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (via telephone): We have a new form of crime. You know, we have violent crime and we have crime and we have different -- we have now a thing called migrant crime. I'd love to have our family there. If they'd like to be there. It would be my honor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's keep talking about this important trip and the more broad 2024 discussion with my panel of great reporters, CNN's MJ Lee, CNN's Eva McKend, and Leigh Ann Caldwell of the Washington Post. Hi, everyone.Let's start where Alayna left off and just more specifically look at the map to sort of set the scene for our discussion of where Donald Trump and Joe Biden have each been since Super Tuesday last month. Trump was in Georgia and Ohio. Michigan and Wisconsin today. Joe Biden, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, North Carolina. Now, MJ, as we look at those, we should underscore that the sort of feverish pace that the Biden campaign has been engaged in is very much part of his strategy to show that he is energetic and he can and will do that. But beyond that, the idea that Trump has been, you know, certainly been very much out there on his social media platform. He's been in at least two courtrooms and not very much in these battleground states. He is very intent, as Alayna said, on pushing the issue of immigration, which he's been doing since he came down that escalator in 2015.",

And I think this all feeds into sort of a, I would say, just like a good vibe from the Biden campaign right now. And certainly relative to what we were hearing from the Biden campaign even a couple of months ago.You know, we've talked a lot about how there was such a sigh of relief after State of the Union, displaying the kind of Joe Biden that they really wanted to. The fundraising numbers, particularly compared to the Biden -- the Trump campaign has been incredibly strong. The fact that they're able to put him out there, the President himself and all the surrogates, and really crisscross these states at a moment when Trump really has been nowhere on the campaign trail. He's been mostly stuck in courtrooms dealing with so many of these legal issues. All of that has the Biden campaign, again, relatively speaking, feeling good compared to a number of months ago. And it is a moment where they are trying to capitalize on everything possible. And I think that is why we are starting to see, talk about Florida. It's not necessarily that they very much seriously think the state is in play. They may or they may not, but it is more about sort of showing that strength at a moment when they think Trump is down.",

The fact that Trump -- I just want to sort of hone in on this for a second. The fact that Trump is going to be pushing what you just heard him talking. He's trying to call it an epidemic.It's, you know, there are certainly some high profile examples of some violence. He's calling it migrant crime. I call it high profile, because in many ways, conservative media is trying to focus on a couple of really horrible events and make it as if it's perhaps more broad -- not perhaps make it sound like it is more broad than it is. Fact. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Dana, the playbook is largely going to remain the same. He wants to continue to demonize immigrants. He wants to continue to try to argue to Americans, these brown folks, they are the real reasons for your problems. The issue, though, when I speak to voters, is that, by and large, this is not where the anxieties lie. So voters will often address the economy, stagnant wages, high grocery prices, buying a home, as all real concerns. But because he is using this playbook, again, of punching down on immigrants, we'll have to see if how this plays. This election will be a test of the strength of that argument.",

And Gretchen Whitmer got 50, over -- almost 55 percent, the secretary of state on down. They -- all the Democrats won. They overturned the State House. And of course, the actual question of a right to abortion was almost 57 percent. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yeah. So that's always been the question. And if these voters, these ballot initiatives, and when abortion is directly on the ballot for voters, if that also translates to democratic votes, and it has in the midterm elections, it did in 2023 elections as well. And so now with this driving force in Florida, where you're going to have women who are now going to be directly impacted in just a month with a six week abortion ban, that's going to make it very real for them. Also coupled with the fact that they're going to be able to directly vote on the issue of abortion in the ballot in November, Democrats now say and hope that perhaps Florida is in play. We know that Joe Biden didn't really contest it in 2020. Democrats spent no money there in 2022. In the midterms, perhaps now it will be a state. But it's a very expensive state. But regardless, Democrats think that it's a very -- it's going to once again be a motivating factor.",

And now we have this ad that first opens with Donald Trump taking credit for what has happened in the country in terms of reproductive rights, and then it goes to, President Biden speaking directly to camera and saying, I am the candidate and the person who is trying to reverse that. So it does seem like they're clearly trying to go about this, and there's going to be multiple iterations and there are multiple angles that they're trying to use to get at this issue.",

Now we know that we certainly enjoy First Amendment protections, and we also know that there's a political campaign. And in light of that, certainly, you want to be able to campaign and to state your peace, particularly if you're the presumptive nominee for your party.At the same time, there's an integrity of the court proceeding that needs to be protected. Whenever you're trying to prevent someone from speaking, it's called a prior restraint, and courts frown upon that. However, remember this, Dana, that courts frown upon that. However, remember this, Dana, that everyone's individual liberties end where someone else's liberties begin. What does that mean? It means you can't yell fire in a theater. Why? Because others could be endangered. You can't defame someone. You can, but get ready for the legal consequence with respect to the payment of monetary damages. You can tell the president that. And so words have consequences. Words can inflame. And when you are charged as a judges with protecting the integrity of a legal system, you don't want witnesses intimidated, you don't want witnesses to feel fear and threatened. How's that going to impact their testimony? Will they agree to testify? Will they agree to testify truthfully? Will they be endangered by an angry mob? All of those are significant. And in light of that, while it is rare, of course, you don't want to impair someone's freedom to speak. It's not rare in a circumstance where other people could be impacted so gravely and dangerously. So I think it was the right call on the judge's part. Whether or not it's actually obeyed by Trump, followed by him, that's an open question.",
