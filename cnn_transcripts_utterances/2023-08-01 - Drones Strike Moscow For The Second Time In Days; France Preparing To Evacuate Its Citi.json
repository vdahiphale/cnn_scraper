We'll take a look at Ukraine's response. France is preparing to fly its citizens out of Niger as last week's coup divide the international community. In this hour, I will speak to the U.S. Department of State, that will happen in about five, ten minutes from now. Also President Trump and Joe Biden -- President Biden, are neck-and-neck in the polls. We'll look at whether a third indictment for the former president could shift the race. Ukrainian presidential adviser is warning that Moscow should expect more drone attacks, saying Russia is getting used to full-fledged war. For the second time in three days, a drone hit this high-rise building in the heart of Moscow's business district. It houses some government offices including the Ministry of Economic Development. Russia is calling it a terrorist attack. It says measures are being taken, but gave no details. Now, joined by our former CNN Moscow Bureau chief Jill Dougherty, currently Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University in Washington. If you look at the response of Moscow, do they seem rattled, annoyed, irritated or worried?",

But certainly, if you look at thebombings that Russia carried out after that attack over the weekend, I think there is fury in Moscow. And I think there is concern, because after all, what Putin is trying to do with the Russian people, and especially, you know, the well off, the rich people, the elite who live in Moscow, is to say everything is normal. The war is going, you know, according to plan, et cetera. And this is pretty frightening, I would think, for people in Moscow who -- and don't forget, Richard, as I'm sure you're well aware, you know, that is the symbol of Putin's -- you know, let's say capitalism. Putin's style of capitalism. Those high rises are really kind of skyscrapers, and that's what's been hit.",

The fact that they were able to target something in Moscow from -- we don't know exactly the distance, but that's militarily significant. And then, do they want to carry out destruction in Moscow?

Is it that these are their last lines of defense? Well, no. They think there's far more fighting to be done. \"I hope that when we get through the last line of defense\", he says, \"then they start to run.

So, they've -- part of these evacuation flights started about midday, French time today. There had been about 600 French that have applied to get on the flights, they're not obligating anybody to leave, there's about 1,200 French in the country.

And you know, having been to Haiti, they have a compound, right, that has some sort of security. Was it someone who understood that the security maybe wasn't at the level that it should be? Because to be taken within the walls of your own faith-based charity is, again, something else that has been very difficult to try and ascertain exactly who had knowledge of this.
