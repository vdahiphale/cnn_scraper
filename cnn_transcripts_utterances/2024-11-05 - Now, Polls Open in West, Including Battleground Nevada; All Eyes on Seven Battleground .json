      "sentences": "Hey, I'm Anderson Cooper in New York. Welcome to CNN's special coverage, Election Day in America.Right now, polls opening in several western states, including California and Battleground Nevada. Americans are entering their final hours of casting in-person votes in a race that is simply too close to call. A polarized nation will finally make its choice, either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. They each spend their final full day of campaigning in all important swing states, pitching their competing visions of America. Control of Congress is also up for grabs today. Democrats hope to flip the House. Republicans want to capture the Senate. And with so much at stake, the FBI has established an around the clock command post for election related threats. Investigators say there's been a slight increase in threats this election year. Our correspondents are fanned out across the country and in the all important battleground states that could decide the presidential race. There's a lot to get to throughout this hour. The single most important battleground may be Pennsylvania with its 19 electoral votes, and as Danny Freeman is in Lancaster County. So, what are you seeing there?",

It's a little town just a little bit southwest of the city of Lancaster. We're at a polling place here, which is interesting. Actually, it's in the middle of two polling places. There's one here at a funeral home, and then there's one where we are here at the municipal building.I'll take you a little bit inside just to give you a flavor of what we're seeing here today. The judge election says that we can be only about ten feet away from the polling plates itself. But we can see you have both parties right here, the Democrats and the Republicans. And then, of course, behind us is where folks are voting. Now, this particular spot is interesting, Anderson, because Lancaster County, this is a traditionally red area. Former President Donald Trump won it both in 2016 and 2020. It's the biggest traditionally red county here in Pennsylvania. But Democrats, they're trying to compete here. And if they can get their margins up, that could give us an idea of just how close the commonwealth will be. At this particular polling site earlier this morning, there was a line, according to the head of the polling site, really around this corner right here. They've gotten to almost 300 ballots cast today. They have 1,100 ballots ready to go at this polling site. And, again, the judge elections here, the one who runs the polling place, says that, so far, turnout is looking good. So, we'll be monitor here, talking to voters as well. Oh, do we have one voter that we can speak with real quickly? Hey, how you doing ma'am?",

It's trended Democratic since 1992. So, you can look at that tonight, even though Pennsylvania is not going to finish counting early, we know that from history, you look at that county tonight, you're going to see which way it goes and that can tell you something about whether it's going to be a good night for Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump.But, you know, there are so many large questions, I think, out there that need to be answered tonight, not only in Pennsylvania, but in all these other states. And I think the question to me is, did Kamala Harris succeed in distancing herself from Joe Biden enough? You know, 70 percent of the country thinks it's on the wrong track.

You know, the president obviously is in such a different position than what he expected the position he would be in even a couple of months ago. Just to sum up, I mean, this has been such an extraordinary and unlikely campaign in so many ways. The president, of course, after that CNN debate where he had such a poor performance that really shocked so many across the party ended up having to drop out, and that is the reason why we now have a Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump race. The president, for the most part, actually, in the last couple of weeks, has taken a back seat. We've seen a number of times where he has misspoken or had these political gaffes, which is exactly what Democrats had feared all along. And it's clear that as the vice president is trying to forge this path forward and create a campaign and a candidacy that is completely her own, there has been a little bit of distancing. You know, we heard the vice president go from saying, you know, I can't think of anything I would actually do differently, then the president has over the last three and a half years to saying my administration is going to be completely different from that of the president. So, this has been a balancing act, obviously, for the vice president. And I think again it's been stark, the ways in which we have seen the president not have a prominent role in this campaign. He has not been out there campaigning aggressively alongside the vice president, and that's not been a coincidence at all.",

And I know you said this earlier, but we are waiting for Donald Trump to arrive at the polling station this morning, where he is going to be casting his ballot.Now, we both know there's going to be probably a lot of reporters around him. I think a big question is whether or not he's going to talk to them, you know, answer questions. We'll see what happens, but stay tuned for that. It's going to happen at some point this hour. But I do want to get into some the vibe in Trump world this morning. And one thing I am consistently hearing in my conversations with his top advisers is that, really, in these final hours, it all comes down to one thing, and that is turnout. Now, I know that seems obvious. Turnout is, of course, always important on Election Day, but they argue it is even more of a concern now given how tight this race is. And they recognize it could be a coin flip. And so they're really closely watching a lot of the data coming in, a lot of the early data that they've already seen, and trying to read the tea leaves as much as they can even though, of course, and we have to say this, we don't know and they don't know anything that is going to happen today. Polls are hours away from closing, but that is how they are spending their day. Now, one key thing about that turnout that I'm told is that there's a couple of things that they found some spots of encouragement for, but also some signs of potential weakness. One thing we know is that the Trump campaign has had a massive problem in courting women. And we've seen from the early voting data that women have outpaced men so far in the election and in early voting. So, that's one key thing I know that they're looking for regarding turnout. But they're also, and they tell me this, that they are encouraged by the number of male Democrats. They believe that the turnout among male Democrats is not as high as they had anticipated, arguing that is a sign of encouragement as well. But, again, they are currently with Donald Trump. They're looking at what's going on, and they're preparing for tonight for their election party and potentially having Donald Trump come out and speak to that crowd. Anderson?",

Obviously, you've seen Republicans have done better in the pre-election day vote, whether it's through mail or in person. So, really, that Election Day vote is going to be really critical.Do Republicans have the same margins of victory? Are we performing at the same levels in terms of turnout and the like that we have in past elections? So far, I mean, not every state is reporting on an hourly basis. I can tell you here in Florida, we see very strong numbers for Republicans. It's not a state a lot of people are focused on anymore. We're not considered a swing state anymore. We're going to be looking for that and in other places as well. But, you know, you go into this feeling like we are going into Election Day in a much stronger position than we were in 2020. In terms of the number of votes from our side that are already in, obviously, we've got to see what happens on Election Day.

Now, you have to turn that frustration into a vote and into policy changes that actually make life better for working men in our country.And, look, it is a population of voters. That's not -- you know, they don't follow, we aren't political junkies. These are people that every single day are trying to get ahead in life. And you have to turn that frustration into a vote, that they come out and take political action so they put people in office that actually care about what they're facing and will put people forward policies and things that help people like that. So, not only do I think it's a smart play politically, I think it's essential for the future of our country that that issue be confronted and that that issue be solved.

That support has to turn into votes, and that's what we will be watching for today and what we're hopeful of.",
