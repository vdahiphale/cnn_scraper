Beyond outrageous, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacts on CNN to a potential arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. And Donald Trump decides not to testify as the defense rests in his hush money trial. And blocking an icon, a Japanese town overrun with tourists blocks the view of Mount Fuji. All that and much more, coming up. But first one person killed and more than 70 others injured after a Singapore Airlines plane hit severe turbulence. The Boeing 777 was going from London to Singapore and made an emergency landing in Bangkok. The plane was carrying more than 200 passengers. Most of those came from Australia, the U.K., and Singapore. Hours ago, most of the passengers who were on that flight departed Bangkok for Singapore, on a different plane. Our Ivan Watson joins us now live from Bangkok with the latest. Good to have you there for us, Ivan. So, we know this 73-year-old man, this passenger on board lost his life. What more can you tell us about those who were injured?",

But also, the profile of the actual turbulence. The actual -- the amount of -- look, here's the plane going along. And as it comes in to hit the turbulence, so it starts to go up and down. And it's not just the amount it goes up and down, but it's the ferocity with which those movements take place. If you think about it, a plane comes into land, normally, losing thousands of feet every minute. That doesn't seem to have any effect. But if you get these very sharp ups and downs -- and you can see this if you look at the rate of altitude, which way we actually know was experienced by, according to Flightradar24, the number or the amount of feet that the plane was moving was only 50, 100, 150, 250 feet at a time. It would go up 200 feet, it would go down 100 feet, it would go up 50 feet, and that's what you see here and here and here. They go -- the plane's going up, oops, I beg your pardon, and of course it's coming straight back down again. But what that doesn't show, of course, is the rate at which that's happening. And when you take those numbers, you realize -- I'll show you again what I mean here, when you take these numbers, this is about 600 feet per minute. This is about 1,200 feet down per minute.

SCANNELL (voice-over): On Monday, the prosecution rested its case, having called 20 witnesses over 19 days, totaling over 50 hours of testimony. Meanwhile, Trump's team called just two witnesses with about two hours of testimony. The majority of that time came from former adviser to Trump's ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, Robert Costello. The defense hoped to use Costello to attack Cohen's credibility, but Costello ended up angering the judge on Monday, leading the judge to clear the courtroom to address his decorum.",

So, that sometimes is established on our flight plans. In addition, there are databased devices on board that can also determine that, notwithstanding the fact of whether radar would tell you about it.

So, even though it hasn't completely deterred tourists from going to this one specific spot, hopefully, they now start observing those traffic rules and regulations to help ease locals and observe their daily life.

Actress Danielle Riley Keough filing a lawsuit to stop the foreclosure sale scheduled this week, alleging the company behind it is fraudulent and has no rights to the Memphis property. Our Dianne Gallagher takes a closer look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDEN: Graceland is American history. It is the second most visited home in the United States behind only the White House. But a Wednesday morning hearing in a Tennessee chancery court could determine in part if that iconic Memphis property stays in Elvis Presley's family. Now, his granddaughter, actress Riley Keough, is suing to stop a scheduled foreclosure sale of the home. She now owns the property after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died last year. In her lawsuit, Keough states that Naussany Investments &amp; Private Lending LLC presented documents that claimed her mother had borrowed $3.8 million from the company, and she had used the deed of trust for Graceland as security, a collateral for that loan. Well, the firm claims that Lisa Marie defaulted on that loan and therefore, Graceland is now their property. But Keough says none of that is true and her lawsuit questions on whether this is even a real company. The lawsuit reads, \"These documents are fraudulent. Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments.\" But the court documents go even further, identifying a Florida notary whose name is on the paperwork that was presented. But that notary says she never met Lisa Marie Presley, nor did she notarize any documents for her. Now, CNN has tried to reach out to Naussany Investments. We sent an e-mail to the account associated with the company and got an out of office reply stating they would be back next week. We tried the phone number associated in the court documents and that was not working. According to the lawsuit, it's a Missouri based company, but there are no records of a company matching that name with the secretary of state's office. And when we searched nationwide, we couldn't find that anywhere. Now, we did receive a statement from Graceland DBA, Elvis Presley Enterprises, that told CNN, \"Elvis Presley Enterprises can confirm that these claims are fraudulent. There is no foreclosure sale. Simply put, the counter lawsuit has been filed is to stop the fraud.\" Now, there is a temporary restraining order that was granted back on May 15th that prevents Naussany Investments from conducting any non-judicial sale of the property. They have to have this hearing on the injunction first. But that foreclosure sale, well it was scheduled for Thursday. Now, back in 2020, Lisa Marie Presley told Rolling Stone that Graceland was worth between $400 and $500 million. But look, this is more than just Americana here. The Presley family uses Graceland as a burial ground. Elvis Presley, Lisa Marie, Elvis' parents, and Lisa Marie's son are all buried on the property. Dianne Gallagher, CNN, back to you.

You know, it's interesting, I spoke to Laurie Santos, who's this professor of happiness at Yale, teaches this really popular course there. And she says it's a pretty misunderstood emotion. Number one, people define happiness in different ways. It's worth having that conversation with your loved ones to see how they define it. But also, this idea that humans didn't necessarily evolve to use happiness as a trait. I mean, we needed traits that would help us survive, and happiness wasn't necessarily one of them. So, you got to work at happiness was sort of her point. It doesn't necessarily come naturally. There was another thing that I thought was sort of interesting. It wasn't necessarily a misconception, but sort of a revelation. If you look at what they call the happiness U-curve, Lynda, and I think this is good news, at least for people that are around my age. I'm in my mid-50s now. But if you look at the U-curve, what you find is that it starts off, you know, when you're in your -- if we can put that up, there's your teenage years and it's pretty high at that point. But then around 49 years old is when you have your lowest point of that curve. But after that, going into your 50s and later in life, your happiness continues to go up, at least according to these curves and self- reported satisfaction. People often think of older age as being a time when you're not as happy, you're dealing with illness and things like that, and that may be the case. But happiness seems to be retained and even continues to increase later in life.",

But for me, I was sort of thinking, OK, there's happiness, there's satisfaction, there's complacency, and you can kind of create a Venn diagram, and maybe these overlap to some extent, but they're distinct as well. Do you need a certain amount of dissatisfaction to be happy? Anyways, I talked to Laurie Santos about that concept specifically. And here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. GUPTA: I think there are times when I wouldn't have necessarily rated myself as being happy, but I was also highly productive during those times.
