      "sentences": "Well, Christina, good morning. So, the concern really going into this storm is some of the debris that's been left over by Hurricane Helene, another good -- great deal of concern for the folks here in southwest Florida is the six- to ten- foot storm surge that we are going to see with this hurricane. Now, just two years ago, here in Fort Myers, Florida in Lee County, this part of the state of Florida was devastated by Hurricane Ian.And so, some of the preps (ph) that we've been seeing have been taking into account the storm surge from that hurricane and the concern that it might replicate again. To give you a sense of where that storm surge was just two years ago, Hurricane Ian brought the water probably about to this mark here. And so, that was about four to five feet. And so, the concern now is that that is probably going to be a little bit more north of that, considering the strength of this hurricane. Now, for the folks that live to the north of where we are, here in Fort Myers, Florida, the evacuations there and the preparations got underway in earnest yesterday. Traffic cameras from all across the western coast of Florida showed just the growing number of people taking to their cars, trying to get more inland, trying to get away from the coast. These folks are trying to get up to northern Florida. They're trying to get into central Florida. Some folks are even trying to make the journey across the state of Florida over onto the East Coast, which is home to the city of Miami, as well as Fort Lauderdale. In fact, on our drive west, yesterday, coming from the south Florida area, we could see the line of cars that crosses the Everglades and that line really did not let up from coast-to-coast there, and then the folks trying to get up further north. As I said, Christina, the concern with this storm, aside from all of the rain and the storm surge for parts of Florida, is that debris. I was just in the Tampa area last week, doing a story on some of the damage that was left behind by her Hurricane Helene and you could tell, understandably so that not enough time had passed from that hurricane for emergency crews to get all of that debris out. And so, once this storm makes landfall at the winds that we are looking at, the concern is all of that debris becomes incredibly dangerous not only for the folks who decided to stay in their homes, but of course for emergency workers, as well as rescue teams that might want to try to get to some of these folks once the storm passes through. Again, the preparations well underway here in Fort Myers, Florida and to the north of where we are, in Sarasota County, Manatee County, Pinellas, and Hillsborough County. The uncertainty right now is exactly where that storm is going to make landfall, but make no mistake about it, the damage is going to be significant and the storm surge is most likely going to be life-threatening.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Christina, we are just getting our 8The winds have fluctuated since its peak yesterday, but we do anticipate this storm to continue to strengthen, perhaps back to a Category 5. As it enters the open waters here of the Gulf of Mexico, there is a loop current here, so very warm waters that come out of the Caribbean and into the Gulf of Mexico. So that's going to add some fuel to this as well. In terms of timing, the landfall on the West Coast of the state of Florida will be sometime overnight Wednesday into the early morning hours of Thursday. That's the most likely. And also something interesting to note with this 8:00 a.m. update, they've extended the hurricane warnings from coast to coast. We are talking about the West Coast, the Gulf of Mexico of Florida, all the way to the Atlantic Coast as well. So that's just saying something. The wind field will actually double in size from now to the time it makes landfall in Florida. And that means the impacts will be realized over a much larger area than how come pack the storm is actually right now. We have major hurricane winds well inland, away from the coast, but hurricane-force gusts sometime overnight on Wednesday into Thursday morning will be realized again from coast to coast. And with this storm surge potential, maximum storm surge height, depending on that exact right quadrant of the storm, where it makes landfall, ten to 15 feet. That is over my head, double my height. That is unsurvivable using the words from National Hurricane Center. The flood threat is real here. We could get several months of rain falling from the sky. There was this precursor events of rain. It's already been falling from the skies, but now the main event comes in on Wednesday and Thursday, a rare high risk of excessive rain and flash flooding exists on Wednesday. Christina?",

Let's start with Gaza, as you say, 56 people confirmed to have been killed in the past 24 hours. At least ten of them were at the Jabalia Refugee Camp. Now, this is in the north of the Gaza Strip. It is an area that back on Sunday, the IDF said they were encircling and going to carry out a significant operation because they believed that Hamas was trying to regroup and rebuild in that area. It is one of the very first areas that the IDF launched its war against Hamas in the early days after October 7 and they have been back in there frequently, and they are still going into that area, home to one of the biggest refugee camps in Gaza itself. Hamas also saying that they are clashing with enemy forces in that area. We also know down a bit further south in central Gaza, in al- Barajneh (ph) Refugee Camp, at least 30 have been killed in a strike there. We have asked the IDF for details. We are waiting to see what the how good was in that particular strike.But you also mentioned the evacuation orders. Most of Gaza Strip is under an evacuation order at this point, the whole of north of Gaza and much of the south, the IDF saying that people should go to what they call the humanitarian zone of al-Mawasi. But there have been airstrikes on those barriers as well, so people are understandably reticent to pick up and move to those areas again. Now, a quick look at what Israel is saying it is doing in Lebanon as well. They say that they have been carrying out airstrikes in southern Lebanon, also in the southern suburbs. They claim that they've killed the commander of Hezbollah's headquarters, Suhail Hussein Husseini. CNN cannot independently verify this or confirm that his level was of commander. We are waiting to hear from Hezbollah on that, but Israel says that they killed him in a strike in Beirut. We also know that Hezbollah has been firing rockets the other way. The Israeli military just confirming that more than 100 hits Haifa, the city in the north, and also parts of the Galilee in just one hour. So, they say two buildings were impacted, but the majority of those rockets were intercepted. Christina?",

The Harris-Walz campaign continued its media blitz, a string of interviews taking place this week as the Democratic ticket races to reach voters. Kamala Harris is coming off a \"60 Minutes\" interview on Monday where she faced tough questions on her immigration policy.Meanwhile Donald Trump is switching gears and focusing on \"Making American Healthy Again\" in a virtual town hall with Robert Kennedy Jr. On Monday, he again had extreme views about immigrants who've come to the USA, falsely claiming Harris had allowed 13,000 murders into the country. And the reason they were murderers was \"bad genes.\" Well, a lot to unpack here. We have Alayna Treene and Priscilla Alvarez standing by for us, both in Washington. Alayna, I want to begin with you first because look, as we know by now, these comments from Donald Trump are a familiar playbook, an attempt once again, I guess to stoke fears about immigration in the run-up to the U.S. elections.

We know that as he looks ahead to the November 5th election now, just 28 days away, this is the top issue for Donald Trump's campaign.And the way that he is framing it and the rhetoric that he is using while dehumanizing, while a lot of it not true, they believe is helping their campaign. Now, I do want you to listen to exactly what he said and then I'll break it down for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She is no clue.

And so, when polls are barely moving and a lot of voters are still saying they are trying to get to know the vice president, this is what the campaign is doing, it is putting her out on multiple media outlets to try to amplify their message and also increase her exposure. So just look at this week, yesterday, there was a \"60 Minutes\" interview. Today, she is going to be on a program here in New York called \"The View.\" Later, she'll join \"The Howard Stern Show\", that's radio. And then, she'll be on \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert, all of that in New York.And then later this week, she has a town hall with Univision. So, she is certainly on a blitz to try to get their message out. Now, today, the campaign is using her appearance on \"The View\" to outline and introduce one of her proposals. This is specific to the long-term care of senior citizens. It is especially targeting what is called the sandwich generation, those Americans who are both taking care of children and their aging parent's. The idea here is to provide some assistance to those families. Now, a senior campaign official says that the way that this would be paid for would be by expanding Medicare drug price negotiations and increasing drug discounts from manufacturers. But we will hear more of those details when the vice president appears on that show later this morning. So, there is a mix here of trying to share her message with more audiences, reach them where they are, for example, in her \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast on Sunday. That is a podcast that reaches millions of people, particularly women. So that is where she talked about reproductive rights. Today on \"The View\", she will be focusing on health care and the long-term care of senior citizens. So, they are trying to use these media appearances to try to cater to each of these audiences. \"Howard Stern Show\" that she will also be joining, that is a mostly male audience and that is particularly an area that her campaign is trying to make inroads in. So, this is very indicative of the final few weeks of an election and something that the campaign is hunkering down on as they try to move those polls further.",

But remember, a lot of these areas have just dealt with a previous hurricane, Hurricane Helene. And so, part of what President Biden I think, will say today is that there are efforts to clear the debris from that storm need to ramp up as they prepare for these very high winds for the next storm. The other thing that I think will be important to hear from President Biden is pushing back on some of these disinformation that's been swirling about the hurricane recovery efforts, that has been a source of very deep concern inside the White House. Their worry is that people will hear things, including from Former President Trump, about the federal response that aren't true, and that will dissuade them from applying for the help that they're entitled for.
