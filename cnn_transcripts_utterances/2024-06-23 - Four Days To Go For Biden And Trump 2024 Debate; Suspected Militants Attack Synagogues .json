All right, welcome, everyone. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Omar Jimenez in Washington. Tonight, we are for counting down to CNN's presidential debate now just four days away. That is the live countdown clock. The first major showdown between incumbent president Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump since 2020, and the earliest general election debate in U.S. history. Now the two candidates are preparing in very different ways. Trump taking a less conventional approach, meeting with potential running mates and hitting the campaign trail, where he's again been mocking the man he'll be facing off against. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S PRESIDENT &amp; CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Right now Crooked Joe has gone to a log cabin to study, prepare. No, he didn't do it. He's sleeping now because they want to get him good and strong. So a little before debate time, he gets a shot in the (EXPLETIVE DELETED). I say he'll come out all jacked up, right? All jacked up.

      "sentences": "Yes, I think it's clear that the Biden team really views this debate as a critical moment. They are ramping up the stakes and in fact, we just got this memo from the campaign this morning that kind of lays out their strategy and I think if it boils down to one thing, it's really trying to make clear this contrast between Biden and Trump. They really don't think that a lot of Americans are paying any attention to this election, but they think that this could be the moment that they start tuning in and they really want to crystallize that differences.They say put a magnifying glass on the choice that people have in front of them in November. And so that is why President Biden is spending so much time at Camp David. It's almost a week and it is providing obviously an opening for Trump to make fun of him a little bit. But they think it's worth it. They think that this is going to be an essential time for President Biden to really hone in on what he plans to talk about. And it was interesting in this memo, you know, we were talking yesterday that Ron Klain, who is leading this debate prep has these debate rules that he wrote probably a decade ago. One of them is coming up with three things that you must say in this debate. And I think it's clear from this memo what those three things are. One is talking about abortion and talking about Trump's record on abortion, and really trying to lay at his feet the overturning of Roe versus Wade. That's something they think will galvanize Democrats. They think it's really important heading into the debate. The other is talking about his attacks on democracy. Obviously this has been an underpinning of the entire Biden campaign, but they really do want to drive home the threats that they see Trump posing to democracy, the threats of political violence. They think that's an important contrast point. And the last one is the economic agenda. Obviously this is a lot of voters' top issues. They really do want to make the point that they think that Trump's plans would benefit the wealthy. But there are obviously risks in that because Biden in many ways so vulnerable on the economy, a lot of people are still dissatisfied with their economic conditions. So those are the three things that I think Biden is almost certainly hammering away out there at Camp David this weekend, really making sure he has crystallized what he wants to say and says it very crisply so that point gets across.",

So we'll see how that actually plays in when the debate actually comes.Kevin Liptak, appreciate it. Obviously a lot have to talk about here. That's why we've got some of the best. Let's discuss with our political panels, senior staff editor at \"New York Times Opinion,\" David Swerdlick, and national political report at the \"Washington Examiner,\" Salena Zito. All right, good to see you both. Look, Trump and his team are trying to spin Biden's debate prep as another sign that he's unfit for office, that he's locked away out in the mountains. And I want to play a little clip from GOP congressman and possible Trump VP contender Byron Donalds this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): He has to be in Camp David for seven, eight days to prepare himself to be in a 90-minute debate with Donald Trump. That does not bode well for a man who says he wants four more years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These are two very different men who approached politics in a very, very different way.And I think David was really right. I think Biden's big weakness right now is his narrative on the economy and the inflation. I think it's also his biggest weakness in talking with voters is not expressing I'm going to take you to a better place that Americans love sort of aspirational qualities in a leader. They want to be part of something bigger than themselves. And I think the onus is on Biden to make that argument, and I think that's where he needs to focus.",

Everybody knows about the conviction.Biden has to tell that positive story and say, look, unemployment is at 4 percent, the stock market is 8,000 points above where it was when I took office.

We don't have an election across the country in a national election, we have 50 statewide elections. And it's in those swing states, he can't afford to lose more than in most scenarios probably two of the states he won last time. And that's where the focus has to be, not on, oh, he's up or down in a national poll.Now, I do disagree with Salena slightly. My old friend Salena slightly on which demographic is most important. You've got to look at those persuadable voters between the 45 yard lines and to me, those voters especially are white women with college degrees in the suburbs.

State media says officials are blaming what they call, quote, \"adherence of an international terrorist organization\" in what they're calling coordinated attacks in the south of Russia.Now so far it's not clear how many people have been killed or injured. Earlier today, a priest was killed inside a church and a synagogue set on fire after gunmen attacked, according to police. You see and hear some of the video that we've brought in there. Separately, officials say gunmen fired on a police traffic post and a synagogue there was also targeted. CNN's Clare Sebastian is tracking the latest from London. Clare, what more are police able to confirm at this point? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, as you say, Omar, they believe that these attacks which happened really at around the same time in two cities that some 80 or so miles apart, Derbent and then Makhachkala, further to the north, both of them along the Caspian Sea, coast of Dagestan, that they are now being investigated as terror attacks. We don't know the death and injury tolls for sure at this point. Initial reports suggested that they were mostly law enforcement officers. There's, as you say, one priest, according to the Dagestan Monitoring Commission, was killed in Derbent. Gruesome details emerging that he was apparently had his throat slit by attackers. Security guards, also according to some reports, appeared to have been among the injured or killed. But this news is still sort of coming out. You can see from those night shots that those scenes of violence continued pretty late into the evening. What I can tell you is that Dagestan is a pretty turbulent region, has seen sporadic violence over the years that borders Chechnya. And this is a predominantly Muslim region. So clearly, there's a lot of focus on the targets of these attacks which mainly seemed to have been synagogues and churches in these two separate cities of course -- Omar.",

On Friday the justices in an 8-to-1 decision upheld a federal law making it a crime for domestic abusers to own guns, rejecting the argument that the law violated the Second Amendment. But the justices also struck down a federal ban on bump stocks used to make some guns fire more rapidly.Now the ban came under former president Donald Trump after a mass shooter opened fire on an outdoor music festival in Las Vegas, killing 60 and wounding hundreds. Joining us now is the director for the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, Steven Dettelbach, to talk about a whole range of topics in regards to firearms. Thanks for being here, Director. I want to start with the Supreme Court because few gun-related decisions over recent weeks, I know that DOJ was supportive of the Supreme Court's decisions to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. But when the court ruled against the ban on bump stocks, the ATF put out a statement saying, quote, \"As the 2017 massacre of nearly 60 people at a concert in Las Vegas made clear weapons equipped with bump stocks posed an unacceptable level of risk to public safety.\" As we know, bump stock attachments were found on the weapons used there.

So we know we can still lose, but we know what to do to drive it down and just at the time when we are having some success, it is not the time to back-off. It is not the time to pat ourselves on the back or for high fives. It is time to double and triple down on this strategy. And we saw a $50 million cut in our actual real dollar budget, and if you look at all the different other costs, it is even effectively even larger, and that has led to us having to cancel new agent classes and not be able to give Crime Gun Intelligence to local homicide and gang squads.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:48:51] JIMENEZ:       Tomorrow marks two years since the Supreme Court struck down Roe versus Wade. In conjunction with the anniversary, the Biden campaign is set to hold more than 50 events ranging from roundtables to rallies in a number of battleground in states. Women's March will also host dozens of strikes across the country. The hope is to draw attention to the high stakes on the 2024 presidential election and the fight for reproductive freedoms. So joining me now is Rachel O'Leary Carmona. She is the executive director of Women's March. Thanks for being here. I know you're going to be on the ground at the strike in Oklahoma City, but can you tell us more about what is planned? RACHEL O'LEARY CARMONA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WOMEN'S MARCH: Yes. There are hundreds of strikes and rallies all across the city where the call is to stay home, build community, build power with people who care about women's rights, care about reproductive freedom, and care deeply about the outcome in November 2024.",

CARMONA: I mean, the decision was absolute significant, but for a couple of different reasons. One, we are absolutely glad that mifepristone is still available, but two, that case never should have seen the inside of any court much less than the Supreme Court. And so it is important for us to understand that justices and judges certainly, the judge that heard that case was Matthew Kacsmaryk, which is from Amarillo where I live and that case was meritless from science, from legal precedent, you know, in every possible way, which the Supreme Court agreed with and tossed it. And so what we need to understand is that our rights are not only being stripped away by the decisions of these court cases, but also which court cases are being heard. So we are not going to give any flowers for the fact that a stopped clock or what was right twice a day, but rather, we understand this for what it is, an attack on our democracy, on our rights just coming from a different venue.",
