The goal is to hash out a deal before the U.S. runs out of money and potentially sinks into a historic default, which could be about three weeks away now.Ahead of the meeting, the White House laid out a list of measures with a clear message: Don't even think about cutting these. CNN's Lauren Fox is covering this for us from the capital. Lauren, how are House Republicans reacting to these red lines from the president's team?",

      "sentences": "Well, at this point, these are really closely held negotiations, Brianna. And a lot of Republicans have been arguing for the last several days that they are not going to negotiate in a public forum what they want to see is a negotiation play out with their leaders, Speaker McCarthy.And like you noted, there are red lines that are starting to be drawn. The White House for one does not want to repeal parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. That is a signature piece of legislation for the president, but something that House Republicans debt ceiling proposal took specific aim at. There are some areas, however, where they may be able to negotiate. Some of those include permitting reform, something that both Republicans and Democrats have wanted to see, although they do come at this by different standards. You are starting to see potential negotiation around something like maybe a work requirement. But one of the areas that they are probably going to have to focus the most closely on is spending. And that is because House Republicans bill did reduce spending. And you've heard repeatedly from House Republicans that they are not going to accept a clean debt ceiling bill. And said what they want to see is spending cuts accompanying those. What level those cuts are at, how specific those cuts are, that is all part of this negotiation. But I should note that the staff that's been meeting over the last several days, they're trying to figure out what are the terms of this negotiation. What could a framework look like? They are not nearly close to a deal. They are not nearly close to releasing anything. This is honestly just a conversation around what the contours of a negotiation looks like. So that tomorrow's meeting between leadership from Capitol Hill and the president can be more productive than Tuesday's -- Brianna?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, all states would be hurt because this would just be a complete debacle. But we are learning more about the regional impact here.Moody's Analytics put out a report estimating the potential job loss if there's a prolonged breach of the debt ceiling. And they say that there could be half a million jobs lost in Florida and in Texas each. California could lose more than 800,000 jobs. And you can see hundreds of thousands of jobs disappearing from New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania. And really this is a sampling. No state would be spared here. It shows, I think, the enormous stakes during this negotiation and the importance of getting a deal done. Which is why it was startling to hear former President Trump last night dismissing a default, dismissing the ramifications as, quote, \"maybe nothing.\" He said it could be perhaps a bad week or a bad day. That is really the opposite of what we're hearing from experts. Today, I asked the top federal consumer financial watchdog, Rohit Chopra, he leads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I asked about Trump's comments. And he didn't want to comment directly but he made it clear he has the opposite view. He said there would be borrowing cost spikes. There likely would be job loss. He said, quote, \"A lot of things we assume are part of our financial fabric would get ripped away. Every family should be concerned.\"",

But as you were saying, this has been an ongoing battle between the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who is investigating the Afghanistan withdrawal during the Biden administration, and the State Department. Who says that they don't want to turn over this cable because they don't essentially want those diplomats who signed onto this cable -- expressing concern about the lack of preparation at the State Department for the withdraw from Afghanistan -- they don't want those diplomats dragged into what is turning into essentially a political fight here. But the House feels -- Chairman McCall, feels he really does need that cable. He really needs to see what diplomats were saying, what they were warning the department to do that they weren't doing. So we're continuing to track this. Of course, it is pretty high stakes right now because the chairman has said that he is going to hold the secretary of state in contempt of Congress, which is pretty critical. And a very real threat from the chairman if the State Department doesn't actually comply. We're watching to see what happens. But indications from the State Department is that they are still standing clear, that they don't want to provide the actual cable. They have provided briefings. But the chairman is saying those briefings haven't been substantive enough.",

It helps with those connections between brain cells.And during sleep, your brain goes through a process where built-up toxins are cleared away. So we see this connection between sleep and benefits to the brain. In this particular study, researchers looked at MRI images from 140 study participants. These participants had sleep apnea. And the researchers found that those with more severe sleep apnea showed more damage to the white matter in their brains. That's in comparison with those who had more mild sleep apnea. And this also kind of shows how having more disruptions to your sleep caused by sleep apnea can aim the brain. Because white matter is very important for brain function, for brain health. We know that it's found in deeper tissues of the brain. That really shows that connection again between brain health and sleep -- Brianna?",
