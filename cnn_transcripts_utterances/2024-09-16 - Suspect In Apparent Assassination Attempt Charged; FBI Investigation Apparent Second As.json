We'll bring you the latest on the investigation and breaking details from the suspect's first court appearance, which happened moments ago.Plus, J. D. Vance is still defending baseless and racist conspiracies about Haitian immigrants eating pets. The VP candidate told, may he's willing to quote, create stories for media attention. And courting the teamsters. Kamala Harris has a high stakes' meeting today with leadership of a union that usually backs Democrats, but its president spoke at the Republican convention this summer. So, who will get their coveted endorsement, if anyone? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We do start with the breaking news. The suspect in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump was just charged in court. 58- year-old Ryan Routh was arrested yesterday after fleeing the scene at Trump's golf resort in West Palm Beach, Florida. The former president was about to putt on the fifth hole when gunshots rang out. Those shots were from secret service agents who spotted a rifle barrel, peeking through the fence and opened fire on a suspect hiding in the bushes. Trump was about 300 to 500 yards away. The suspect had an AK-47 style rifle with a scope, making a couple of 100 yards, not far at all. A witness on the scene told police, they saw someone run from those bushes and flee in a black Nissan, which helped officials find an ultimately detained Routh. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe is on the ground in Florida today, and sources tell CNN he's expected to meet with Donald Trump. I want to get straight to CNN's Paula Reid, who is outside the courthouse. Paula, what just happened in court?",

      "sentences": "So, Dana, the court just unsealed the charging documents in this case, and these reveal the details from investigators, the ones that prosecutors used to present probable cause to support the charges that Ryan Wesley Routh is now facing.Now, just moments ago, he was in this court in front of a judge for his initial appearance in this case. Now there are no cameras in federal court, of course, but our colleagues inside report that he was shackled both his arms and his legs. He was wearing dark prison scrubs, and he said, yes, a few times, nodded his head to the judge. But this was the first time that he actually learned the charges that he is currently facing two counts. One, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and also receipt of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. We do expect that additional charges will be filed in this case. This investigation is barely 24 hours old. But the charges if they are added, they may not be what people expect. At least one state level prosecutor said, it may be difficult to charge him with a crime in relation to Trump because of the distance between him and the former president on the golf course. They might be more successful if they charge him with some sort of crime related to pointing his gun at the secret service officer. Now, the next time he will be in court will be a week from now for detention hearing. And Dana, we expect there, the prosecutors will continue to argue that Routh should remain detained ahead of a possible trial. They argue that not only is he a flight risk, they also say, he is, of course, a danger to the community. And then on September 30, he will be arraigned, where he'll have an opportunity to again hear these charges that have been filed against him and enter a plea of not guilty, or potentially even guilty.

      "sentences": "So, we've got two things going here. One, we just learned from Paula, which is we've got holding charges is what the Feds would kind of describe these as. And they're good charges, if you're a prosecutor. The possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, that's a charge where people often can get sentenced to five years in prison, and you can go up from there the possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.And that's key, because if you're the person providing a gun to a convicted felon, not only is he committing a crime by having it, you're committing a crime by knowingly transmitting that to him. So that serial number was probably scratched off to protect the person who supplied it. So, there may be another person in this case, but that will get him held. The detention memo will list all of the reasons they think he's a danger that he was there in the bushes with a rifle as the president was approaching, fled from secret service agents. But this gives them time, and the time is to the heart of your question, to go through those phones, go through those tablets, go through the social media, go through whatever papers they find where he was staying, whatever he had in the car, to show if they can establish that, that he was there, that he was there because of the former president that he was planning to take some kind of action, and don't forget the GoPro. So, there's that GoPro on the fence. We don't know what's inside there yet, but that might reveal things he said, might reveal what he was recording and pointing at might reveal whether he was transmitting it to somewhere else. So, this is basically the charge that they're going to use to keep them in, investigation is just starting for the rest.",

Kristen, I want to go to you now about what you're hearing from team Trump about this, and obviously the social media post allowed him to do what he did in real time when he actually was apparently hit 65 days ago or so in Butler County. He said, fight, fight, fight on his social media platform. He's going to meet later today with the acting secret service director.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Dana. So, we are told that this afternoon there is an expected meeting between the acting secret service director and Donald Trump in Florida. Unclear if that's going to be at Mar-a-Lago or at a separate venue.But I will tell you from talking to law enforcement sources and sources at the campaign who have been briefed by various secret service agents. Mar-a-Lago right now is considered a quote, hard location, meaning that it is one of the safest places that Donald Trump could be, so he has been holed up there since yesterday. Now what comes out of that meeting? We will wait and try to find out from our sources. Right now, I am told by the campaign that nothing is expected to change. He has a full week. He has an event at Mar-a-Lago tonight. It is a virtual event that he's going to continue to do. Tomorrow, he's expected to be in Flint, Michigan and Uniondale, New York on Wednesday, back in D.C. on Thursday. All of those events as of this moment are still on. Sources saying that the show must go on. He's going to continue to campaign. But of course, there are a lot of questions as to what exactly comes out of this meeting with the acting director in terms of security protocol. They had already ramped up security to an enormous extent. He had an entirely new addition of secret service agents to his entourage, people who are on the golf course with the people who are traveling with him, as well as an uptick in local law enforcement presence. Both here, in West Palm Beach, also when he is on the road at these various campaign events. So, what could they be doing differently? One of the biggest concerns that I have heard from the campaign and questions they have is how exactly the suspect was tracking where Trump was going to be. Was it a coincidence? Was he following Trump? Was he watching his movements? Because that golf game that he had on Sunday was a last-minute addition to his schedule. Some of his closest advisers didn't even know he was in Palm Beach. So, a lot of questions right now swirling what exactly happened and how this happened.",

      "sentences": "Well, a few. First on your first question on the OTRs. An Off The Record appearance by a president or a former president isn't scheduled, no advance notice. And, you know, when I was with the New York City Police Department, working with the secret service, every time the president came to town.When we did an OTR together, we didn't even have a visible president presence in advance of that. That would kind of tip people off to ask, well, what's going on or who's coming? We tried to keep this as invisible as possible. The problem with this case here, as Kristen will tell you is, Donald Trump is a creature of habit, and you know, he often goes golfing, and he often goes golfing on Sunday, and he often goes golfing on Sunday at his own club. So, as they go backwards through this suspect, they'll be looking for. Is there a Starbucks across the street that he's been seen at in the last three Sundays, waiting for the motorcade to come in? Has he been doing reconnaissance around there? To the second part of your question about his background, what jumps out? His criminal record goes back to 1997. But what we see is minor things, no big crimes. And then there's the event in 2002 where he allegedly is in a car stop. He has a gun in his hand. The officer backs off. He takes off in the car. There's a chase. He ends up in a roofing company, which he runs into, and he's barricaded there for three hours. And then when he's arrested, he's also charged with having a machine gun. So, we get a picture of a guy with interest in foreign fighters, interest in foreign conflicts, who's looking at different politicians, including the former president on social media, and has affinity for guns. So, he is -- he has a background that lends itself to this case.",
