Let's take a look. Donald Trump is the projected winner of the Republican primary, in the State of Texas. 161 delegates at stake, CNN is projecting Donald Trump will win Texas. In the State of Maine, 20 delegates at stake. CNN projecting Donald Trump will win the Republican primary, in the State of Maine. And in the State of Arkansas, 40 delegates at stake. CNN projecting that Donald Trump will be the winner, of the Republican primary, in the State of Arkansas. We have a couple projections, on the Democratic side as well. CNN can project that Joe Biden will win the Texas Democratic primary, 244 delegates at stake. Incumbent President Joe Biden will be the winner of the Texas Democratic primary. In Arkansas, CNN can project that Joe Biden, the incumbent president, will be the winner of the Arkansas Democratic primary, with 31 delegates at stake. Let's bring you a key race alert, right now. In Colorado, and Minnesota, CNN is projecting it's too early to call, in the Colorado Republican primary, in the race between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. 37 delegates at stake in Colorado, too early to call. In Minnesota, 39 delegates at stake, CNN also saying too early to call, in the Republican primary in Minnesota, between Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. Let's look at some of the actual votes coming in, right now, if we can. In Vermont, 17 delegates at stake, Donald Trump still eking out a win there, right now, 49.3 percent of the vote, 50,382 votes. That's 776 votes more than Nikki Haley, who has 46.9 percent of the vote. That's with an estimated 45 percent of the estimated vote in. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 40 delegates at stake, Donald Trump still with a commanding lead, 57.4 percent. That was just updated, 57.5 percent of the vote, 24,592 votes. It's almost 8,000 votes more than Nikki Haley, who has 39 percent of the vote. That just ticked back down, 38.7 percent of the vote, for Nikki Haley. Donald Trump doing well in Massachusetts, although it's only an estimated 7 percent of the vote in, only 7 percent estimated vote in. In Alabama, 50 delegates at stake. Donald Trump with a commanding lead, 84.1 percent of the vote, 12,178 votes. That's more than 10,000 votes more than Nikki Haley, who has 12.2 percent of the votes, 12.2. That is with an only estimated 2 percent of the vote in, still very early in the vote count, in Alabama. David Chalian, where are we in delegates, right now? Because while all this counting is going on, we are awarding delegates.",

      "sentences": "Yes, as you're making these projections, and we see the votes coming in, we're able to do so, Jake.Take a look here in the State of Texas. You said it's the second largest prize of the night. It is. A 161 delegates at stake. Donald Trump getting 114 of those 161 delegates. We still have 47 unallocated, as we wait for more votes to come in, and quite frankly, the Texas Republican convention process, later in the calendar, which will dictate where some of these delegates go. So, where does that leave us for delegates tonight, on Super Tuesday? Donald Trump so far getting 302 of the 865 delegates, at stake, tonight. Nikki Haley picking up three delegates in the Commonwealth of Virginia, so she gets above that zero-mark. But look at that divide. This is Donald Trump dominating the evening. And where is he, in the battle for delegates overall? You need 1,215 delegates, to become the Republican nominee, up there in the right- hand corner. Donald Trump is now at 578, nearing the halfway mark. 46, for Hayley. It's not even the same universe of competitiveness. In fact, let's look at what is the percentage that Donald Trump has won to date. He has won 90.9 percent of the delegates awarded to date. Nikki Haley has only won 7.2 percent. 91 to 7, is the score of delegates so far, when you break it down by percentages. [21:05:00] What does that mean Donald Trump needs? Well, he is on track. He only needs 35.5 percent of the remaining delegates, that number highlighted in green, in order to secure the nomination. Nikki Haley's need number is 65.2 percent. So, he needs a little over a third of the remaining delegates available, to secure the nomination. She needs two-thirds of them, Jake.",

But this wasn't just about winning. It was about winning enough delegates, to secure the nomination, as early as next week.Now, they acknowledged to me that it is a narrow path. Nikki Haley would only have to win about 86 delegates, to stop Donald Trump, from becoming the nominee, next week. Now, as you said, it's a pretty striking number, it's much wider path, however, for March 19th. So obviously, we'll wait and see how this plays out. Now, as the campaign has already shifted their attention, to the general election, I am told by sources, close to the former President that he is still privately complaining, about the fact that Nikki Haley remains in the race. Now, the reason for that is two-fold. One, he has told people that it is stopping Republicans, from coalescing behind him. But two, is when you look at those high-dollar donors. There is a several high-dollar donors, who backed DeSantis that moved to Nikki Haley. Trump's campaign wants that money. Now, I am told moving forward they are going to start building out their teams, in places like Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, those critical battleground states. But Jake, to do that, they need money. And there is something else that is holding up money, for them, with Nikki Haley, staying in the race. And that's the money coming from the RNC. Once he becomes the presumptive nominee, he can start tapping into those resources, those strategies, those operations that are on the ground. So, this is all part of why they have come really increasingly irritated that she hasn't dropped out of the race, because they want to use those funds. But again, they were expecting a good night, tonight. The question is just how good of a night are they going to have?",

He's seeking reelection for a third term, a one-time presidential candidate, a one-time Donald Trump rival, now he boasts about being one of the most MAGA-aligned lawmakers in all of Congress. Let's get you a key race alert now, on the Democratic side. There, Congressman Colin Allred has a substantial lead right now. He's leading by about 162,000 votes. He's a former Tennessee Titans linebacker, actually a former Obama administration official, at Housing and Urban Development. Importantly, in this race, he is 11 points, percentage points, above 50 percent. That is the benchmark that he has to cross, the threshold he has to cross, to avoid a runoff, later in the spring. Only 34 percent of the vote in, about a third of the vote in, right now, in Texas. But Congressman Colin Allred is in a pretty good spot, right now, Jake.",

If you notice, though, that's 95 percent of the estimated vote in Denver County. Blue area, come November, this will be a blue area, come November. But so if you're looking for where else could she get votes, if you see up there now? Yes, this is Jefferson County, the Denver suburbs, these used to be purple or even Republican, if you go back to when I started doing this a long time ago, Republican areas, they become very reliably blue, right now, come November.

On the Democratic side, CNN can project that in Colorado's Democratic primary, incumbent President Joe Biden will be the winner of that state's 72 delegates, 72 delegates, CNN projecting that Joe Biden will be the winner of the Colorado Democratic primary. Let's bring you a key race alert, and get you up to date on some of the votes still coming in, in some of the states that we have not called in.

That's 1,300 more than Nikki Haley, who has 18.8 percent of the vote. Again, that's only an estimated 1 percent of the vote in from Minnesota. The polls just closed at 9 PM Eastern. In Vermont, which we've been watching seesaw all night, Donald Trump still has a lead, 49.6 percent of the vote.

We haven't heard much from the Haley campaign at all in recent hours.But what I can tell you, from my conversations, with campaign officials, before the night began, is that they were looking at two things, specifically. First of all, they were looking at some congressional districts, where they felt like they could do well. Like, you look at Texas, right? There's congressional districts 2 and 12, where Fort Worth is located, where Houston is located. Those are places that Nikki Haley just had campaign rallies, yesterday. They feel like they could potentially pick up those districts that would give them a few delegates, in Texas. Of course, they're not expecting to win the state. But it could give them some delegates. There's also other congressional districts and other states that she has visited, where they're looking to, right now. The other thing that they have been looking at are two states specifically, where they feel like Nikki Haley could have a solid showing. Those states are Utah and Vermont. Of course, we've been tracking Vermont really closely. It's neck-and-neck between Trump and Haley right now. And this all comes as Haley and her campaign have publicly been very weary to talk about what their specific goals, heading in tonight actually were. Nikki Haley just told you yesterday, Jake, that she was hoping for a competitive night. She said that they had goals, numbers that they were looking to. But she didn't reveal what any of those numbers actually are. So, we'll just have to watch and see particularly when those congressional districts that they're watching the results there come in.

They knew they were going to do well tonight. They even just made it they might win every single state. But it was winning by enough delegates, so that next week, he can become the presumptive nominee. Now obviously, we'll have to wait until every vote is cast, every vote is counted, and that those numbers are finalized. But they are feeling very good about his pathway to the Republican nomination, as soon as next week. They are telling me that they have pivoted to the general election. But there are some things that they need to actually be the presumptive nominee to get. Now, some of that is just donors and fundraising. But another part of that is the access to the Republican National Committee, the RNC, and their fundraising, their donors, their infrastructure. Remember, they have kept a very lean team, up until now. They want to tap into those resources. And hopefully, they believe, to them, hopefully that they -- will happen next week, at the earliest. So that is what they are contemplating, right now, expect him to be very victorious, to take a victory lap. But I do want to note one other thing, Jake here. It's not just politically speaking that they are feeling very optimistic.

But here,the excitement is beginning to build, as we get closer to the end of the polling hours. This is the tally room that people have just started moving in there, getting ready to tally up this vote. And where we are Jake, in Orange County, is actually a fascinating little county. Between 1936 and 2012, Orange County voted Republican in every single presidential election. Then, in 2016, they went Hillary Clinton. In 2020, they went Joe Biden. Ronald Reagan once said of Orange County, back in 1988, he said this is where good Republicans go to -- go before they die. A few of those people have died that Reagan was talking about, and the demographic has really changed, in this country -- in this county. The diversity is it's far more diverse. So, it's really, it's not a red county anymore. It's a purple county. It is just as Los Angeles, suburban, affluent, educated. So, it's going to be interesting to see how Donald Trump does here. 2016 primary, he got 76 percent of the vote in Orange County. John Kasich came in at very distant second, on about 11 percent. It's going to be interesting to see what votes Haley picks up here, and might give us an indication of that sort of suburban educated issue that Donald Trump might have. Now, the other issue right here, this is one of the key districts for the House that the Democrats want to take. It is currently held by a Republican, serving her first term. But Joe Biden took this district, last time around. So this is one of the districts that the Democrats are really focusing on, the House race, to try to win back control. So, we're going to wait. Polls close about an hour or so. We'll see what happens. Jake.",

And Donald Trump is going to pick up the Minnesota Republican primary vote, this evening. On the Democratic side, on the Minnesota Democratic primary, CNN can project that incumbent President Joe Biden will be the winner of that state's 75 delegates, the Minnesota Democratic primary. Let's bring you a key race alert now. Let's look at the actual votes, as they put them on the board. In Vermont, which has been neck-and- neck, all night, Donald Trump still in the lead, for that state's 17 delegates. 48.3 percent of the vote, that's 23,721 votes, 147 votes more than Nikki Haley. This is her strongest state yet in the Super Tuesday contest. But she's still pulling up the rear, 48 percent of the vote. That's with an estimated 70 percent of the vote in. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with 40 delegates at stake, Donald Trump has 61.4 percent of the vote, very dominant, 86,387 votes. That's 36,807 more than Nikki Haley, who has 35.2 percent of the vote. That's about a quarter of the vote is in there, about 23 percent of the estimated vote, in Massachusetts.
