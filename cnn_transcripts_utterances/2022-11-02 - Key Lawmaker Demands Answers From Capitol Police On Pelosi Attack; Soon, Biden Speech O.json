We have excerpts from his speech renewing his warnings about efforts to undermine elections with only six days left between now and the midterm elections.And the Federal Reserve unleashes another big interest rate hike, the fourth in a row, further ramping up its fight against inflation. We'll break down this historic move and how it could affect you and your family. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, the U.S. Capitol police say an internal security review is now underway amid growing and very serious questions about how the break-in at the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's California home could have happened let alone the brutal attack on her husband. I spoke just a little while ago with the San Francisco district attorney about the threat posed by the suspect and why she insisted he should be held without bail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in this letter, what she's doing is two things. She wants to know what were the policies and procedures that were in place when that attack occurred here at the Pelosi residence. She wants to know whether they were latched up with local law enforcement in order to ensure that members of Congress are protected, not just in Washington, but also in their district.She was also asking what they are going to be doing moving forward after this attack. We got a statement from the Capitol police after she sent that letter. They say that they will be fast track many of the recommendations that were suggested after the January 6th insurrection. We know that Congress had allocated additional money to the U.S. Capitol police. They were working to ensure that the Capitol itself was protected. But, obviously, in the wake of this brutal attack, they will now be, as they say, fast tracking a lot of the recommendations. The Capitol police also confirming CNN's reporting that the security cameras inside or outside the Pelosi residence were not being monitored in real-time at the time of the attack. Of course, the House speaker wasn't here. The U.S. Capitol saying in that statement that they have over 1,800 cameras that they are monitoring in Washington and around the country, that these cameras were not being monitored in real-time. Of course, the big question, Wolf, will that change moving forward? They don't have the personnel to be sitting in front of 1,800 cameras at any given time but can they leverage technology, motion sensors and the like to ensure that if an intruder comes to the house of a member of Congress, they are detected, they are alerted so that police can respond before tragedy happens, Wolf.",

He's a member of the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. I want to begin with this new letter from Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. She is demanding answers from the Capitol police chief. Do you echo her demands, her concerns? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT):  Well, Wolf, and thanks for having me, it's obviously important that we do a review of what happened and ask ourselves the question of was everything done to prevent this kind of thing. I understand that there may have been cameras that were unmonitored. And as a member of Congress, I will tell you that each and every one of us should be interested in making sure that our security is as good as it can get so that we don't ever have to live through what we've all just lived through with this brutal attack on an 82-year-old man. But, Wolf, what really worries is not so much a question of cameras being monitored or not. What worries me much more is the response of some people to this. It's a dehumanized character-free response that says that there is something other than pure empathy and an unconditional condemnation of violence that is somehow appropriate. Somebody makes a little joke, the son of the former president puts up a quip on social media, people draw political conclusions that suit their preexisting narratives. If leaders don't respond with two things and two things only, empathy and a clear and unconditional condemnation of violence, this will get a lot worse.

That adds up to 75 because three of these are new districts created after the census, right? But, look, you can tell just by looking at those numbers. Democrats are on defense in more of these districts from coast to coast, the blue districts. How is the president's approval rating factor in? Let's just start right there. Not only, Wolf, is his approval rating going down, as you noted, his disapproval is going up. That gives Republican momentum. A Democrat will tell you every time the president goes down a little bit, it makes one of those blue districts more difficult to win. Also in our poll, look at this, choice for Congress. Just a month ago -- excuse me, pardon my back just a second. Let's stretch this out. Just a month ago, we had Democrats at a very slight edge. Who are you going to vote for when you cast your ballots for House? Now, look at this, Republicans with a lead as head into Election Day of four points, outside the margin of error, Republican momentum. hy? the country, Wolf, is in a funk. Two and a half years of COVID plus now the punishing of inflation, the Fed raising interest rates just again today. 72 percent of likely voters say things in the country are going badly.

They also thought maybe if we win in the suburbs here, here and here, we could even pick up one or two. That's what they thought in July and early September. But, Wolf, here's where we ending the campaign when you look at the top issues right now. Abortion has faded. A majority of Americans, 51 percent say the economy and inflation is the top issue, dwarfing abortion or election integrity. The president will talk a little bit about that tonight.

NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  It's powerful and strong language from a president who wanted to run for president because he saw it as a battle for the soul of the nation. So, I think you'll hear similar themes tonight. It's also similar to a speech he gave in September, where he talked about democracy inequality being under assault. He'll essentially say tonight that democracy inequality are on the ballot. Now, the folks I talk to at the White House don't necessarily think this is a campaign play. If you saw some of the numbers there, election integrity isn't like a driving force in terms of people going to the ballot. But it's certainly something that is important to this president.

He's going to say tonight, this is no ordinary year. In a sense, what he's asking of Americans is to say, I know you are hurting economically because of inflation. I know you are thinking you are divided and in many ways distressed, but this is about something bigger because if we don't make choices to put people in office who fundamentally accept the notion of defeat, then, in fact, we are risking democracy itself.

CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, essentially, Wolf, they're re-emphasizing a position that they have held as recently as 2020, whereby they say that they would only ever use a nuclear weapon defensively, and that there are very strict parameters for the use of any nuclear weapon. This is coming from Russia's foreign ministry today. It is no accident in terms of the timing. That reporting coming out earlier from intelligence officials saying it appears that Russia's military leaders may have had discussions about the possible of potential use of tactical nukes on the battlefield in Ukraine. I should hasten to add, though, there was no suggestion that they had agreed that they intended to use those nuclear tactical nukes on the ground, but this essentially a statement of intent from the Russians that they do not plan to do that, except to defensively.
