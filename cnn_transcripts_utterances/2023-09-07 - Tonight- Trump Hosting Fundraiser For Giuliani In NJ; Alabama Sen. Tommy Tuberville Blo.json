Plus, Mayor Eric Adams going off on the issue that he says will quote, \"Destroy New York City,\" the migrant crisis. Tens of thousands of migrant children are now starting school, here, in the Big Apple, as the Mayor says there is no end in sight to that massive problem. And Elon Musk secretly ordered satellites turned off, the same ones that are powering Ukraine's internet, I should note. It disrupted a planned sneak attack, on Russian forces. But he told an author that Starlink was quote, meant for \"Netflix and chill,\" not war. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, in Washington, another Trump defender is paying the price, for loyalty, to the 45th President. His former adviser, Peter Navarro, has been found guilty, of contempt of Congress, after he defied a subpoena that was tied to the January 6th congressional committee's investigation. While in Georgia, the election interference case, there, Trump has notified the judge that he may try to do what several of his co- defendants are already attempting, move the case to a federal court, and potentially a more favorable venue. And in Bedminster, New Jersey, tonight, Trump is headlining an event, for his co-defendant, Rudy Giuliani, in an effort, to pay down his mounting legal bills. It'd only cost you $100,000 a plate, to get in the door. We know that Giuliani has millions of dollars in unpaid legal bills. That's according to new CNN reporting, tonight. He's hoping to raise at least a million dollars. My next guest is an attorney, who is representing Rudy Giuliani, in the State of Georgia. Brian Tevis, welcome back to THE SOURCE. Thank you, Brian, for being here. Can you confirm that he is trying to raise about a million dollars, tonight, and how much ultimately that your client does need to raise?",

It's merely what the State intends to prove later. But they have rules, on how they have to do that. They have to give you enough information to defend the case. A RICO indictment is a party to a crime on steroids, so to speak. Georgia's party to a crime is also already very liberal. When you pile racketeering, on top of that, the State can bring in all sorts of extra information, and be very general, in the allegations.

And I certainly don't want to make excuses, for the 50-plus percent of Republicans that still answer a poll question that the election was rigged, because it wasn't. It isn't.

The policy that Senator Tuberville is complaining about, is a military policy that says, if a woman servicemember is posted, in an area, where abortion is now illegal, after Dobbs, and decides to terminate a pregnancy, the military will pay for her, to travel, to a place, where she can terminate the pregnancy, at her own costs, but they'll allow her travel, pay for travel expenses. Kaitlan, we do this, for women, in the federal prison system. If they're impregnated, and need to terminate a pregnancy, we pay for their travel. We do it for women Peace Corps volunteers. If they live in countries, where they can't terminate a pregnancy, legally, we will pay for them, to travel to the United States, so they can make their own health care decisions.

That is according to a new excerpt, from Walter Isaacson's biography, \"Elon Musk,\" part of it that has been obtained exclusively by CNN. And in it, Isaacson says that Ukrainian submarine drones were fitted, with explosives, lost connectivity, and washed ashore, harmlessly, as they approached the Russian fleet. Joining me now, CNN National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand. I mean, Natasha, the details in here are pretty astonishing.

So essentially, what this biography says is that Elon Musk was driven by a fear, that Russia would respond to this kind of attack, on Sevastapol, on Crimea, with nuclear weapons, and that it would result, essentially, in a mini Pearl Harbor, according to the quote that he gave to Walter Isaacson.Now, of course, Russian officials have used this kind of rhetoric before, right? They frequently threatened that they're going to use nuclear weapons, and that they're going to escalate in that sense. And of course, the Ukrainians have since repeatedly attacked Russian naval fleets, outside of Crimea, without any such response. But Elon Musk apparently really took this to heart. And he believed, according to this biography, that this would result in absolute disaster. So, he ordered his engineers, to, at the moment that Ukraine was going to attack these Russian vessels, turn off the Starlink's satellite communication systems, so that they essentially could not carry out this attack. But this biography also offers a really interesting window, into how Musk views Starlink's role, writ large, when it comes to wars. And, according to this biography, he is apparently very ambivalent about it. He said, quote, \"How am I in this war? Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people can watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes.\" Now, according to this excerpt, the Ukrainian officials, of course, begged him, to turn the system back on, because it is so critical, for them, to communicate on the battlefield. And he apparently had conversations, with National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, to kind of ease Washington's anxiety, about just how much control, he appeared to have, over Ukraine's battlefield communication systems. So really, what this shows is just how influential, and how powerful, Elon Musk, one very unpredictable billionaire, has become, when it comes to the U.S. and Ukraine's ability, to continue to prosecute this war, Kaitlan.",
