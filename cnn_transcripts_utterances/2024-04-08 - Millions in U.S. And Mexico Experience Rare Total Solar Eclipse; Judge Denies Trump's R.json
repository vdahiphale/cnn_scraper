She did say yes. So, it's interesting. I was talking to Neil deGrasse Tyson the other day, and he said it is very -- it's worthwhile noting what happens to animals, to the animal kingdom during an eclipse.

We're very close to the solar maximum now, and that means that all kinds of charged particles get kicked off the sun and head in our direction. And in the past, this has caused serious problems with communication here on Earth, satellites, GPS, you name it, the last time that happened 11 years ago. Now, think about how many more gadgets we are now relying on 11 years later. So, understanding the corona, which is the source of these particles, is a really important thing.

You know, when we start to think about all the kinds of things that we know how to do these days in science, you know, the prediction of the eclipse started a long time ago, and we are building up on all of that knowledge in the past.

That's where the pool of jurors will be selected from, and saying that the majority of them thought that Trump was biased. While the prosecutors opposed that argument, they said that Trump was making this argument far too late, just one week before the trial is set to begin. They also said the place for the judge and the jury to be decided if this jury could be fair would be in voir dire. That's when the Judge carefully polls and questions all of the jurors, and there's participation from Trump's lawyers and from the prosecutors. And they also said about publicity. They said this case is not limited to just Manhattan and New York City. It's an international story. One of the attorneys for the prosecution, Steven Wu, said to the judge the mere fact that jurors know about this case is not an indication of bias. This is the defendant coming into this argument with unclean hands, because publicity, in large part, is his own making. Now, Trump's lawyers are also asking an appeals court to reverse the gag order that was put in place blocking Trump from making comments about the Judge, his daughter, other family members, prosecutors, the prosecutors themselves, but the judge and Alvin Bragg, the D.A., are still free for Trump to speak of.

By my count, it's his ninth delay tactic, Wolf, because he's very nervous about facing a jury on these allegations of election interference. But it wasn't going work because Donald Trump himself is responsible for so much of the pretrial publicity.The judge also released a very detailed juror questionnaire today, where jurors are going to be asked about dozens of potential sources of knowledge about the case.

They almost never work. And here, the gag order that has been put in place follows that that's been approved by other courts, by Judge Engoron, in the civil fraud case against Trump, by the D.C. Circuit in the 2020 election interference case. It accords with First Amendment principles, and we've seen the threat that Trump's words can constitute most dramatically, as alleged by Jack Smith, on January 6th. The appellate court is very unlikely to strike down that gag order. Couldn't tweak it like the D.C. Circuit did, but they're not going to strike it down.",

Now, this gave an opening to Democrats who could tie him to unpopular abortion policies as well as attack him over an issue that has really plagued Republicans for the last two years.And speaking to senior advisers to Donald Trump, they felt like he needed to get out there and redefine his stance. He was hearing from people on conservative social -- social conservatives who were trying to get him to back this national ban, but also from more moderate conservatives who were very concerned over the idea that he might hurt his chances with independent voters, particularly when it came to abortion. So, what we ended up hearing from him today was really what we had heard from him almost two years ago, that he was proud of overturning Roe v. Wade, but also that he believed that all decisions on reproductive rights should be handled by the states. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land, in this case, the law of the state.

This will be the campaign stance, of course, something we'll wait and see. But interesting, Wolf, he also was getting attacked from his own side, from the right. In particular, his former vice president, Mike Pence, who posted this on Twitter, he said, social conservatives -- excuse me. He said, President Trump's retreat on the right to life is a slap in the face to millions of pro-life Americans who voted for him in 2016 and 2020. Again, this is an issue that has not only plagued Republicans, but Donald Trump as well. He would have rather not talked about this at all. He doesn't believe he's a political winner.

This is about women's lives and women being able to make our own decisions. Now, on the electoral portion of this, Wolf, to your question, sure, again, Donald Trump, like anybody else, is looking at what has happened every single time people have gone to the polls and this has been on the ballot. And what's happened? Republicans have lost. And voters won't -- they don't buy that 15 weeks or 16 weeks is a limit. It's a ban. They understand it's a ban and they see how it's unfolding in their own lives. And so I think the main thing for Trump is voters just are no, they can't trust him on this issue.
