CNN's Rosa Flores following this for us from Houston. Dianne Gallagher is in South Carolina, where three of the missing people grew up. These are close friends we're told, Dianne. What more do we know about them? I know you've been speaking with the families. DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, Erica, these four families of these Americans who were abducted just absolutely terrified right now by what has happened. Two of those families have identified the four Americans as Latavia \"Tay\" Washington McGee, Shaeed Woodard, Zindell Brown, and their friend Eric. Now, as you said, they are a tight-knit group of friends. Three of the four actually grew up here in the Lake City, South Carolina, area. We're told they traveled down to Mexico together because one of those friends, Tay McGee, was set to have a medical procedure there. Her mother says that on Friday morning she never showed up for her doctor's appointment. And then on Sunday, the FBI told her that her daughter had been abducted and was in danger. She says the FBI said, if your daughter calls, you need to call us right away. Now, McGee's aunt says that she actually saw a video on Sunday where she recognized her niece being kidnapped. She said she recognized her blond hair. She also recognized the clothes she was wearing from a Facebook Live that they had done there on the trip down. Now, look, the sister of Zindell Brown, one of those Americans who was kidnapped, said that she had a bad feeling. She talked to her brother while he was on the trip down. She had a bad feeling. She told him about it. His mother, meanwhile, is simply clinging to her faith and holding out hope. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZALAYNA GRANT, KIDNAPPING VICTIM ZINDELL BROWN'S SISTER: I felt a little uneasy because I told him I had a dream, you know, I said, so I'm just checking on you. That's what I told him Thursday. And then, like I said, Friday morning I texted and I didn't get anything. CHRISTINA HICKSON, KIDNAPPING VICTIM ZINDELL BROWN'S MOTHER: The waiting is the worst part. It has its advantages and disadvantages. But, however, no news is good news. That's the way I'm staying with it. No news is good news. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, so, joining us now to discuss, CNN senior law enforcement analyst, former FBI deputy director, Andy McCabe. Thanks for coming on today. I wonder, in your experience here, and so investigators believe, as Rosa was saying, that these Americans were mistaken for drug smugglers. Now, a group that took them, groups like this, in your experience, are they willing to negotiate under these circumstances? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, Jim, I think these circumstances are fairly unique. You know, these - these - we're talking about highly organized, structured -- organized criminal enterprises. These aren't kind of -- this isn't random crime on the streets committed by a stranger. And so they don't typically, you know, snatch people that they're - that they're not looking for. So, this is - this is a bit of a one-off, right? I should say, this is exactly why it is so important for the FBI to maintain their foreign offices, which they refer to as leget (ph) offices. They have in Mexico City the largest legal attache (ph) FBI office in the embassy there of any place else in the world and they enjoy very productive contacts with their law enforcement and intelligence colleagues across Mexico. This is why you try to maintain those relationships in the most positive and productive way possible, even in a place like Mexico where that can be very challenging because of the drug trade, because of the organized crime activity, which also invariably leads to corruption. Despite those challenges, you want an active present FBI presence in those countries for moments like this.",

FBI agents and DEA agents conduct a lot of investigative activity in Mexico and they develop informants in these organizations. I can guarantee you that they are working those networks right now to try to identify the group, the subgroup, the street crew, whoever it is, affiliated with one of these cartels that's been involved in this activity, and that's where the investigation really digs in and you start trying to locate those individuals.",

And Zuckerberg, at the time, had said that 2023 would be the year of efficiency.So, that means rolling back a lot of these jobs that had been added in the go-go days of the last couple of years for tech. And that's been the story in tech and in so many different companies. They really grew with no restriction and no breaks over the past two, two and a half years. And now, as they head into 2023, and the economy is changing a little bit, they are - they are course correcting, if you will. So you're seeing some layoffs across the board there. Broadly, though, more broadly, outside of tech and a little bit in banking and some in media, the job market does remain pretty strong. The trend seems to be that bosses want to keep their employees. They're afraid of laying off workers in general because they're having such a hard time finding workers.",

I'll be listening very closely to what he says, guys, about the job market, with a big jobs report on Friday. Remember last month it was a blockbuster. Those higher interest rates have not been cooling the job market yet.

And these activists here, they really take exception with what police say are outside agitators that came in here to cause the events that we saw happen this weekend. The fact, though, is, of those 23, just two of them are from Georgia. And we're here on the edge where many of those individuals are now calling this home, this forest home. They're camping out here in opposition to this proposed police and fire training facility. And you can see around me some of their items, makeshift -- or a tent, rather, left behind. They've got a camp site here. And they even have a free store where we've seen individuals come this morning to get new changes of clothes. We talked to some of the activists this morning and some of them are upset. It's really a robust coalition of activists. Some of them are upset by what they perceive as the militarization of police. They think that cop city is further going to militarize police, not just in Atlanta, but beyond. And they are also environmental activists who say that this 85-acre proposed facility will have a detrimental impact on the environment. The bottom line, though, and what is clear is that this has sort of become a ground zero for activists across the country to come in here and confront police and, at the very least, air grievances against police, as what we saw happen here in on Sunday, where some of those protesters started to throw large rocks, bricks, fireworks, even Molotov cocktails at police. In fact, we -- I believe we're showing you new video, aerial video, of when those agitators or those protesters turned into agitators. Tensions here have only ratcheted up since January. That's when a climate activist named Manuel Teran was shot and killed by police. Now police state Teran opened fire on them first and they returned fire, killing Teran, but that's really only fueled the tensions between these activists and the police. In fact, earlier this morning, they took exception with our presence here and started throwing canned goods at our cars and started throwing rocks at us. They really have, you know, different sort of perspectives here and they say that it is not just one group here, but really a coalition of people that have come here to protest. They did say that they're having a press conference later today, so it really just sort of matters when you catch them when they want the media here. This morning they didn't want us here and they made that known to us. One thing is, though, very clear here is that the tension here, as I mentioned, is ratcheting up with the fate of this proposed facility still hanging in the balance. Erica. Jim.",
