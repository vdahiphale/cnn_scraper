Here -- here's my assessment of Alina Habba's performance as a lawyer.The good news issues clearly passionate and believes in her client and her cause, and she's fairly effective at communicating it in one simple message. The downside is she doesn't know what she's doing in the courtroom. I mean, plain and simple. If you look at that transcript, she can't even do things that you learn in evidence class in law school, move exhibits into evidence, not violate the rules of hearsay. And the other thing is -- and look, maybe this is an impossible task. She had zero client control and allow killing her client -- again, I don't know who can control this client, but allowing her client to be muttering audibly in front of the jury to walk out during the other sides closing argument. That is just inexcusable. And I think that's reflected in the huge verdict that they got hit with.",
