      "sentences": "Today at Inside Politics, Kevin McCarthy hits the wall. The speaker suffers another humiliation on the House floor. Republicans can't agree to move forward on a defense bill and will remain nowhere close to solving a shutdown riddle.Plus, life or death politics. Ukraine's president tries to convince a coalition of the unwilling to pay billions more in bullets. Whatever Washington decides will be felt on the battlefield thousands of miles away. And the media type makes his exit. Rupert Murdoch announces, he will step aside and hand off the family business to his son. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, a rerun, Kevin McCarthy wanted to avoid at all costs and could not, paralysis right now gripping the House floor. Republicans just tried and failed to pass a rule to start the debate on the defense funding bill. The development left the speaker visibly frustrated and openly venting that his members and are telling him, one thing than voting another way. That the House cannot even start debate is telling, both of how little control McCarthy currently has over hardliners and how concession after concession has entered the House speaker very little progress. Let's get straight up to Capitol Hill with CNN's Melanie Zanona. So, Mel, break down what happened here and what went wrong for the speaker?",

      "sentences": "Yes. This was an embarrassing defeat for Kevin McCarthy and the leadership team. This is the second time that a procedural vote on a defense bill has failed on the House floor this week alone. That's something you rarely see in Congress. And now is happened twice for this House Republican conference.But heading in today's leadership was confident. They had had this leadership meeting last night with all of the rest of the conference. It was two hours long. They worked out their differences. They thought they finally had a path forward on these spending bills. So, it was a huge surprise when this vote went down on the floor. And in fact, there was two members who had voted yes, on the procedural vote earlier this week that ended up voting no, today. So, the math problems are only growing. But I think the big picture here is that the House is paralyzed. There is no path forward on spending, let alone trying to solve this government shutdown problem. They are trying to put this bill on the floor on Saturday, that would just be a Republican only funding plan bill, but it doesn't look like they have the votes for that either. I asked one of the members who helped negotiate that deal, whether they're going to still try to push forward that that and he said, I don't know, they sounded really defeated and really deflated. And at some point, Kevin McCarthy is going to have a decision to make. He has been trying to work within his ranks, trying to give conservatives, every concession they want it to get them on board. It has not been enough, when will he -- will or will he, at some point work with Democrats? That is the big question in Washington right now. But there's a lot of concern about what that could do for Kevin McCarthy's speakership. And then you also have members like Matt Gaetz, were threatening his own colleagues who are going to try to team up with Democrats. Let's take a listen what he told me a little bit ago? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): There will not be sufficient Republican votes for a continuing resolution. Now, if we've got some of these moderate Republicans who want to go and join up with the Democrats, they will be signing their own political death warrant and they will be handing their it to their executioner. (END VIDEO CLIP) And Gaetz also told me that he would personally go to New York to campaign against some of his own Republican colleagues. Republicans who are the majority makers, who can help them keep power in the house. So, frustrations at an all-time high and the House just paralyzed right now, Manu?",

The issue that they get collapse right now was a year-long bill to fund the Pentagon, typically Republicans all vote in lockstep for that bill, typically they also vote for the rule. That is the first procedural vote that has to happen. Typically, the majority party votes for it.This time, in what has been -- now been a common practice among these hardliners, they are voting against moving forward on the rule. The process is leveraged to try to extract concessions, leaving McCarthy in a bit of a jam. Quite a jam and how much trouble did the speaker isn't right now? AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: First of all, I love that you're still reporting this out, while you're sitting in that chair, you cannot stop. I was more intrigued by the fact that McCarthy said some people just want to burn it all down. Like he's shocked, like he hasn't been around since 2012, 2014, 2018. So, I don't know what the performance of shock is supposed to do. But clearly, he is trying to figure out how to lead by exerting a kind of public pressure. And I'm wondering if it's working, it's likely.",

That nevermind, we are 10 days or less than 10 days away from having to pass a vote to fund the government. They're trying to do that just a month-long stopgap measure to keep the government open for a month with a whole bunch of measures that have been demanded among the right flank of their party.They don't have the votes to get that on the House at the moment, let alone getting in the Senate to the president's desk.

On the other hand, let's not forget, she had a lot of difficulty with that Build Back Better bill. And there were several weeks where they were going on and off the floor, trying to find the votes for that and didn't. And eventually they passed something, and it didn't pass, you know, the history.I will say, you know, I'm mostly being contrarian here, not making a prediction. Look, the pattern we have seen from Kevin McCarthy is repeatedly wiggling his way out of these jams, right? He gets into jam, things look as bad as they can possibly be, he sort of lets his members fight it out in public. And at some point, he kind of says to them, all right, you're the inmates, you run this asylum. Do you have a better idea? And it's that realization that they don't have a better idea that sort of causes everyone to either and he also has an unlimited appetite and ability to just eat crap, right, to be humiliated, and to have these, you know, cable segments where people say, well, he doesn't know how to do his job.

Where in the House of Representatives, you had Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader walking with him into the meeting. You did not have House Speaker Kevin McCarthy publicly photographed with him. There were some pictures taken inside the room that our colleague Annie Grayer got a hold of.But it just shows you that he clearly did not want to be seen publicly with the president of Ukraine. Given the fact that so many hardliners in his conference have been openly mocking support for Ukraine. You had Matt Gaetz, posting a picture of the speaker from last year, with the colors of the Ukrainian flag and the Ukraine flag pin on, say, how does this make you feel on Twitter? Meanwhile, in the United States Senate, you had Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer, both flanking the Ukrainian president as they entered their all-Senate meeting. And that is another distinction here, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy did not hold another joint session of Congress. Despite the fact that CNN has reporting that he was asked to hold one. When we press McCarthy about why he elected not to do that. He said there just isn't enough time, given the fact that they are dealing with government funding. After that meeting, McCarthy made clear, his mind really has not been changed. He made no commitments to get that $24 billion in Ukraine supplemental funding on the floor by the end of the calendar year, despite being pressed by me and other colleagues repeatedly about whether or not he would make that commitment. So clear, that while this was a very important meeting for Zelenskyy, given the fact that McCarthy has the power to decide whether this would come to the floor or not. It was clear that McCarthy is still weighing his options as he is trying to hold off a rebellion from his right flank. Manu?",

I think, you know, just as with the government funding, you still have a majority of Republican members who are behind McCarthy, who are behind McConnell, who want to send a message of, you know, politics stopping at the water's edge. But you hear McCarthy trying to triangulate this issue by saying, oh, you know, we want more conditions, or we have these quibbles with it, not wanting to take that outright position.
