The groundbreaking film, \"Good luck to you, Leo Grande\", she joins me to talkabout a woman's sexual pleasure and about finally feeling at home in her body, both on film and in life. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. As 2022 comes to a close, we remember the most significant weather events of the year. From the unprecedented flooding in Pakistan to Hurricane Ian in the United States. That monstrous storm barreled down on Florida's West Coast in late September. Leaving more than 100 people dead in its wake. Even now, three months later, communities are still wrestling with the damage and rebuilding. For many, Ian brought back vivid memories of another catastrophic hurricane, Katrina. Some 17 years later, the City of New Orleans and indeed, the country, is still grappling with what happened there, during and after the storm. Star writer, John Ridley, famous for \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"Black Panther\" comics, took a close look at one hospital and the doctors and caregivers who were forced to make unimaginable decisions in the chaos. The Apple Plus series is called \"Five Days at Memorial\". Here's a clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But when you're on set and you're trying to replicate a real human tragedy, and you realize everything that goes into replicating what happens safely, and that's just an approximation of what people went through, what they dealt with, what they continue to deal with. You know, this many years later, there are many parts of New Orleans that have never recovered. And I think that's what's humbling when you're involved in a controlled circumstance, trying to replicate history. And it is difficult, it is challenging. But it is a fraction of a fraction of what people had to endure and continue to endure. And we have to be realistic, it's only going to become more challenging as these extreme weather circumstances become more and more of the norm.",

It was a Pulitzer prize-winning article that she made into a book which is one of the most incredible pieces of reporting that I've ever read. But when Carlton approached me with the original article, I sent it to my father. My father is a doctor, he no longer practices, but he served in the United States Air Force. He's honestly, probably, the most admiral person that I've ever met, other than my mother. But I asked him what he thought of the article. What he thought of the circumstances. And by the way, I should explain a little bit about the circumstances. So, give me just a moment for people who don't know. This is about a hospital post-Katrina. When the levees fell, it was surrounded by water. It was cut off. They had no power. In sweltering heat. The doctors had none of the electronics that we take for granted that become part of life-saving in caregiving. They had no communication with the outside world. So, for five days these doctors had no idea what was going on. What was going to happen to them. When rescue would come. No food, no water, none of the basic necessities of life, let alone the ability to care for long-term critical care patients. And there were post this event, when help finally arrived 40 bodies that were found at the hospital with questions, as you saw on the clip, about what happened. And were these deaths part of the natural course of events or were they hastened because doctors didn't know when help would come at all. And were -- was it better to put these patients, so to speak, out of their suffering as opposed to let them suffer for who knows how long. All of that information in this article I sent to my father, and I asked him what he would have done. And what I expected was a very demonstrative answer in terms of what was right, what was wrong, what he would've done under the circumstances. And his response to me was, just thank God I wasn't there and I didn't have to make those decisions.",

But at the same time, we really wanted to make this a very human story about doctors making critical decisions. About patients who rely on a system and what happens when that system fails. To me, I've been around a lot of stories that are both timely and timeless in the sense that it's happening now, but it's also going to happen again in the future. For me, as a storyteller, in some ways, I feel very humbled to be able to tell stories in these spaces. But I have to be honest, there are a lot of times where it's very tiring telling stories that it's not about looking at something in the past and saying, wow. Look at the ways we've grown.

And a lot of times in television, there are what we call procedurals where there is a crime committed, the police, the lawyers, the system, they try to root out the evil after 42 minutes, which is your broadcasts television run time. Good prevails. Evil is vanquished. A moral is presented to the audience and things are wrapped up. And I understand that kind of storytelling. We looked for that as an audience because sometimes life, it's so unpredictable. We like things that are predictable. But for Carlton and myself, we went into this not wanting to take sides. We didn't want to root for a particular outcome. We wanted to embrace that gray, because unfortunately, that's reality. And we wanted to be honorific to a very real set of circumstances.",

And again, as my father said to me, he was very thankful he didn't have to make those decisions. If my father, who again, to me, is one of the most honorable people I ever met could not make judgment, it was certainly not my place when a jury, a grand jury could not pass judgment, for us to arrive with any kind of prescribed set of visions or thoughts about what really happened in those circumstances.

But at the same time, it does come back to my parents in the things that they taught me about race, about representation, about taking opportunities and making the most of them. About never shying away from the stories that you want to tell and the urgent need to tell those stories. So, I'm very thankful that I can take stories about human tragedy, like what happened in Katrina, and tell them on a large scale and do it with a content provider like Apple. I'm very happy that I can take stories like \"Batman\", like \"Black Panther\" that speaks to other audiences, and speak frankly to my kids. You know, they're more excited about those stories, as proud as they are, about things like \"Five Days at Memorial\". Let's be honest, they're excited about \"Black Panther\", they're excited about \"Batman\". But for me, for whatever reason, to have the opportunity to tell all of these stories, in all of these spaces, as long as I can, as long as I can execute, I will. I take all of this real estate. I understand how precious it all is. Even having the opportunity to speak to you with everything that's going on in the world. I saw what you were talking about, missiles in North Korea. It blows my mind that you find whatever I do to have enough value to sit in some equivalent space. So, it's incumbent upon me to take all of that space and to maximize it with the storytelling.

In the hubris, that tragic flaw that Willy Loman has is while he had blinders on, searching for the material wealth, he lost sight of the wealth of love that he had around him and his family that would've helped him contend with all of the obstacles placed in front of him, especially were a black man in 1949 America.",

Like, as you said, when the boys go into the restaurant, they're segregated, and put in the back. I actually have the infidelity with a white woman. And everyone always questions the line that I have. I say, go in the bathroom here. When there's a knock on the door, there may be a law. I think there's a law in Massachusetts about it. About us being together. And everyone assumes that we put that in. I said, no. That was the play -- that was part of the play. It is heightened because you realized the miscegenation laws of interracial marriage and interracial coupling what it was like in 1949. So, those are heightened. And then the one that I always point out is, people always say, did you change anything? I said, if we changed anything, it was the reduction of one word. When Leejay Coach, played the role, someone insulted him by calling him a walrus. When Dustin Hoffman played the role, someone insulted him calling him a shrimp. When I play the role, someone insults me by calling me -- and I don't have to say it. The audience hears the racial -- in the silence. And so, that just shows you the power of interpretation of having an African American family. And there's -- I expect pushback. There has been some. But Arthur Miller answered that himself. In 1972, when I asked him about the first time that there was a portrayal of a black Willy Loman, he says, especially with this play. It's been so successful in cultures around the world and countries around the world, I totally expect a black guy to demonstrate his humanity and our shared humanity and his artistry in playing this role. So, for all of those who are accustomed to a certain way of interpretations being -- of the play, I would say, why don't we take the word of the author himself to embrace the interpretation that we're putting on today.",

Decide what our values are, and then go out and act on them. That is a mantra of mine. Those who have read interviews and have seen me, I say that all of the time. And it's very interesting that you said that Willy Loman doesn't have a connection to that culture, to culture itself.

And that line is so reflective of the hope that he has within the tragic interpretation of that, where he actually goes and he gets the seeds, and he is planting them and it is in that moment of giving hope to the future that he makes, I believe, his ultimate tragic mistake. We know the end of the play by the title, I guess. And it is iconic enough that I don't think I'm ruining it for your listeners. But when he makes that choice to take his life, the hurt and pain and destructiveness that it causes cannot compare. They overwhelm his idea that that act is also a legacy that he is giving something to his son by having his life insurance policy that is not going to pay off. He -- the disillusionment of that, if he had only known that the true seed that he could have left is what Biff asked him to do, ultimately, at the end of the play, just let me be me and I will find my way. You have given me enough. Let me be me. Let go of that phony dream. And that is the nexus of the pain and the catharsis that we all feel in the play.

She plays a middle-aged widowed, religion teacher, who's never had an organism, and who decided to do something about it.

One was that -- one man hadsaid, I have gone back to my wife and started to talk to her about whether she actually is feeling pleasure when we do have sex, and it's really helped our sex life. I was very impressed with that. And then another person who said to me -- he is 83 -- he said, you know, -- and he said -- he, sort of, leaned in, it's a little bit intimate. He said, I think, you know, a lot of my guy friends in their 80s, I think they're lying about how good their sex lives are. Because, of course, pleasure and intimacy -- and Leo is talking about -- he's talking about the release of pleasure, the physical release of pleasure, the emotional release of pleasure. I mean, true sexual pleasure is actually a very spiritual thing, because your boundaries just float away. And, suddenly, you're in this kind of universal space. I don't know how else to describe it. And he understands that. And he says, it's so wonderful when that happened because people let go. It's like a breath. It's like breathing, only more fun, and less like yoga. And I suppose, you know, there's tantric stuff that everyone went on about all that time. It just seemed to take forever. So, yes, pleasure as something that's a kind of a benediction.

I'm sure he gave a lot of women a lot of pleasure. Sorry. I just had to -- sorry, Ian. I'm sure you were lovely. But, yes, the consent thing, and even when -- and then Nancy learns it from Leo. And we're so -- well, I remember watching sex scenes and thinking, why does everyone look so angry? Pleasure is a delicate journey towards it, is very interesting.
