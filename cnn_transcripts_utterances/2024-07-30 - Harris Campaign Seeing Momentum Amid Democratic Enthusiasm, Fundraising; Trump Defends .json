President Biden won Georgia, you'll remember, by less than 12,000 votes four years ago. Harris, looking to build on that. Last night, she got a boot [SIC] -- boost from a White Dudes for Harris Zoom fund raiser: a $4 million boost, to be exact. A three-and- a-half-hour call attracted more than 180,000 participants including the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, who is a potential Harris V.P. pick. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

Witnesses say they vanished just three minutes later. Scientists believe the unusually warm water temperatures and strong winds may have steered the dragonflies ashore. That looks pretty scary. At least 24 people killed by landslides in Southern India, dozens more are feared trapped after heavy rains in the state of Kerala -- Kerala. Rescue operations hindered by more rain and the collapse of a crucial bridge. Hundreds of firefighters still battling California's enormous Park Fire, the state's sixth largest fire ever. It's destroyed more than 111 structures, forced evacuations across four counties. Ronnie Dean Stout is facing multiple charges of arson. He's going to be back in court on Thursday. And some good news out West. Cooler weather on the horizon after record heat and those wildfires. Meteorologist Derek van Dam joins us. Derek, where and when are we going to see some relief out there?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, it's coming. It's here today.But I first want to show you just this erratic fire behavior that these firefighters have been dealing with on the ground. I mean, this is just a heroic effort by this particular firefighter with some of this newly obtained video footage from CAL FIRE here at CNN. Now, the reason we're experiencing this brief break in the fire conditions is because of a cold front. So, this is moving through, cooling the temperatures, but it's doing a number of things to the weather. Not only is it picking up the wind ahead of the cold fronts, so making fire weather a bit more erratic; behind it, though, a rush of higher humidity levels will actually come help -- at least help the firefighters contain the wildfires that are ongoing. You could see the cooler weather across the Pacific Northwest. It doesn't last long. We heat up into the rest of the week. A lot of the heat has shifted Eastward. We have 50 million Americans across the central parts of the U.S. under heat alerts, triple-digit for many locations. You factor in the humidity levels: downright unbearable. And then I want to point your attention to what's happened overnight across Northeastern sections of Vermont. A flash flood emergency for St. Johnsbury. This is in Northeastern Vermont, where up to five to eight inches of rain has fallen, leading to multiple swift-water rescues. There aren't many ways to really put this, but Vermont has hit -- been hit particularly hard by flooding this year. This type of rain does not happen in such a short period that often -- Jim.",
