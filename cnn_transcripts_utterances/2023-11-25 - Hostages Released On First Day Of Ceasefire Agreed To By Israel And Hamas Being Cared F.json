We'll get to you in a moment, Wolf.We're monitoring breaking news in the Middle East. Tense moments right now as families in Israel await the release of a second group of hostages who have been held by Hamas for an agonizing 49 days now. And just moments ago, we learned of a diplomatic scramble happening behind the scenes as officials from Qatar, the U.S., and Egypt are pushing to sort out the current situation. Right now, Hamas says there is a delay in the handover to the Red Cross. The handover was expected to happen hours ago. They say there is an ongoing dispute about the amount of aid being delivered into Gaza and the selection of Palestinian prisoners set to be released by Israel as part of their brief four-day truce. Israeli officials had told CNN that they were preparing for 13 more hostages to be released today, but so far that has yet to happen. For more now, let's send it over to Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv.",

They played an integral part in that. And that they're suggesting that this deal will go ahead, possibly tonight, in which at least 13 Israeli hostages will be released from Gaza. So the same number as yesterday. An additional seven foreigners as well. Remember, there were lots of, particularly Thai workers, Filipino workers that were also abducted back on October the 7th, many of whom were released yesterday. Some more, the Qataris are saying seven released later on today as part of the second group of hostages.And in exchange for that, there will be 39 Palestinian civilians in Israeli jails who will be set free as well. It's not just about prisoners, of course. Hamas, the group in Gaza, saying they wanted more aid delivery, more trucks to enter the Gaza Strip. That was one of the reasons they gave for this holdup, a delay in the amount of aid into the Gaza Strip. They're also concerned, they said, and were kind of perturbed about the fact, they say, that the people, the Palestinians who have been released from Israeli jails were not the people they anticipated would be released. And so those issues now, according to the Qataris, appear to have been resolved. But we haven't heard back from the Israelis yet.",

Clearly, the Israelis are deeply sensitive about the idea that they are pausing their military operation against Hamas in order to allow hostages to be released.

      "sentences": "Wolf, there's certainly been a lot of uncertainty around the release of those Palestinian detainees and prisoners. We understand, of course, that 39 were set to be released today. Just in the last few minutes we have had a new list issued by the Palestinian Prisoner Society listing the 39 names who are potentially set to be released upon confirmation that those Israeli hostages are released from Hamas captivity inside Gaza from the Gaza Strip. That list includes 33 minors, children under the age of 18, and six women.Now, of course yesterday we did see 39 Palestinians released, including 15 children under the age of 18. The hope is that they will see those 39 released tonight, but of course there has been a lot of uncertainty, a huge amount of delay as well. And for the families who have gathered here, they are only now beginning to go through the list of those names, hopeful that they will see the names of their sons, their daughters, brothers and sisters, and loved ones. We've been speaking to many families who have gathered at this local municipality building near Ramallah who have told us that they had no information as to whether their relatives would be released, but have come here just waiting in the hope that there would be some positive developments. Now, of course, as we understand it, that system that we saw in place yesterday should be replicated today, if indeed we see those hostages released. We understand that those prisoners and detainees are currently being held at the Ofer Prison near Ramallah. We were there a little earlier today. We saw those three buses coming in, but those prisoners will be held at this prison until we have that confirmation of the hostages being released. Upon that confirmation, they will then be transported via a Red Cross convoy where they will be transported to their homes. Now, yesterday we saw a huge outpouring of support, of relief from family members, from locals who came out in the thousands to celebrate the release of these Palestinian detainees and prisoners. As I mentioned, 24 women, 15 children were released yesterday. Many of them were under administrative detention, meaning no charges were laid against them. We're still getting more details about the specifics of tonight's list of Palestinian detainees and prisoners. Of course, as I mentioned, 33 children under the age of 18 are set to be released tonight. This is, of course, part of the wider 150 Palestinians who are in Israeli custody, set to be released over the course of this four-day truce. We saw earlier in the week a list of 300, which was issued by Israeli authorities of people potentially eligible for release. Again, the vast majority of them are under the age of 18, and amongst the most common charges laid against them was throwing stones at Israeli soldiers and threatening regional security. Again, still waiting for more details of tonight's release. Many people here are anxious. This has been a hugely unsettling night. It has been quite fluid, and of course, this is a very delicate, fragile diplomatic system that we are seeing. We're still, of course, getting more developments, as you mentioned there, more information from the Qatari side of things. We know that they are scrambling to resolve the delays that we have seen. But there is still a lot of hope here from the Palestinian families waiting to see whether or not their loved ones will, indeed, be released tonight.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right, Wolf. Preparations have been underway for hours now for these newly freed hostages to drive down this road once they cross into Israel. And for hours now, we have been waiting to see if, indeed, this deal today was salvageable, if the release of these 13 Israeli civilian hostages could potentially still go through today. And now we have word that it appears that it will move forward with the Qatari government announcing that not only will 13 Israeli hostages leave Gaza, but also seven foreign nationals who are outside of the framework of this agreement, and in exchange for that, those 39 Palestinian prisoners released as well.But I think, Wolf, if yesterday showed the promise, the potential for this agreement and what it could mean for the families of these hostages in the days ahead, today showed the fragility of that agreement as we watched as negotiators for hours today try to salvage this deal over Hamas complaints that not enough aid was being allowed, not only into Gaza, but particularly into the northern part of the Gaza Strip, which I think is really interesting. And in addition to that, there was this dispute over the types of Palestinian prisoners who were being released from Israeli prisons. Hamas arguing that Israel was violating the terms of that part of the agreement. So this has really been a day where we saw so much potentially very close to falling apart. And, of course, amid all of this, you have the families of those hostages who are waiting, Wolf, to see whether or not they will see their family members tonight. The families of those 13 hostages expected to be released tonight, but also, of course, the families of the other hostages expected to be released in the days ahead. And that is because every family of these hostages, but beyond that, Wolf, everybody in Israel is watching so, so closely to see whether or not this deal can hold. And, of course, in Gaza as well, civilians there watching to see whether this deal will hold because of the truce, because of the temporary pause in fighting that this deal has delivered, a brief respite for the people in Gaza as well.",

And that's that crossing right behind me here. You can see the flashing lights of a police car at the junction there. That is the junction where the ambulances, as it was yesterday, or perhaps buses if they choose to do a different situation today, will drive down this road here and head, I'm told, toward hospitals in Israel. They may skip that step altogether of going to the Israeli air force base, which happened yesterday. But this is indeed the road where we will see that convoy, if indeed this deal has been salvaged, as it appears it has been.

It's 49 days, 12 hours and ticking. As it gets toward 50 days in captivity, and that's what they're trying to mark with speeches.One of the things we've heard over and over again including from families of the hostages, is now, now, now, bring them home now. One of the things I'll point out to you is just over my left shoulder here, and that's on the wall here, the hostages who have been in captivity, with the words on top \"bring me home now.\" Yesterday we were able to change 13 of those pictures as the first hostages came home, and it had a different message for the first time that those had been up there, \"I have come home.\" So as soon as they get the word here, and they've been following this very closely, as soon as they get the word that 13 more hostages have been released, the men who operates that will change those pictures quite quickly, I suspect, to show that another 13 hostages have come home. We've had the opportunity to speak with some of the families of the hostages, including that of 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage in captivity about what it's like to be here.

They're the primary sponsors of Hamas. They actually host some of the senior Hamas officials who live in great luxury in their capital of Doha. And so they get to play both sides of the game, typical Qatari movement. They support Hamas, and then they get credit for getting Hamas to release the hostages. But they have to produce.So the White House, the administration was calling the Qataris and saying, you better produce. And Israel was calling the United States and saying, we're waiting for this deal to come through. We've done our end, we've gotten the aid trucks in, we're releasing these Palestinian prisoners from our jails. Where is the other side? Again, we don't expect Hamas to be an honest broker. It is not an honest broker. But the Qataris have more on the line here. They are an ally of the United States. They also host a major American naval base. So they are expected to be honest brokers here, and I think all the pressure was on Qatar.",

Remember, the main goal, always the main goal of Hamas is the ceasefire, the ceasefire, the ceasefire. Ceasefire means Hamas gets away with mass murder. Ceasefire means Israel loses. We have 250,000 displaced people within our country who can't go back to their homes because Hamas is simply going to regroup and rearm and do it again. That's what the Hamas leaders themselves say. So at the end of the day, Israel has to not get into a situation where it is being forced to agree to that ceasefire.Hamas, on the other hand, is going to do everything it can possibly to get the ceasefire, putting pressure on Israel internally by ramping up the emotional distress of the families of the hostages. And you see that. You've been covering that demonstration in downtown Tel Aviv, 100,000 people protesting for a ceasefire, that's internally. But then in the world, the growing calls for ceasefire from foreign governments, not from the Biden administration yet, which is very admirable, but from other foreign countries, some of them quite close to us. So that puts the Israeli government in a very difficult bind. So I think that Hamas is going to try to ramp up that pressure every way it can, delays, also technical problems. The lists aren't going to be accurate. You'll see. This is the way Hamas negotiates. It broke the ceasefire of October 7th, didn't it? It breaks every ceasefire. So I think that that, again -- the last point, keep in mind that this ceasefire will cost us in terms of our soldiers' lives, because when the fighting does resume, Hamas will be in a better position to fight.",
