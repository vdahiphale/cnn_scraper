      "sentences": "Final preparations are underway this hour to honor and pay tribute to former President Jimmy Carter who died on Sunday at the age of 100.We now know that he will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol. And President Biden will deliver a eulogy at Carter's state funeral in Washington, D.C. on January 9th, a day that Biden has declared a national day of mourning. Today, the world is remembering Carter's extraordinary life. The humble peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia, who became the nation's 39th president. The Southern Statesman only served a single term as president, but then led one of the most significant post-presidencies in history. The former President and his wife, Rosalynn, founding the Carter Center in 1982, a nonprofit that works to promote peace and freedom around the world. Rosalynn passed away last year. And the two had been married for 77 years. We have a team of correspondents covering these developments. We have Ryan Young in Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia. But let's begin with Rafael Romo, who is at the Carter center in Atlanta. Rafael, what more can you tell us about these new details on Carter's funeral?",

Well, in addition to line and state of -- as a U.S. Capital, as you mentioned previously, we have also learned that there will be public observances both in Washington and here in Atlanta, perhaps here where we are at the Carter Center. We have also learned that there will be a private burial in his beloved Plains, Georgia for family and close friends, of course, his native town.And on top of all that, Brianna, we have seen this tremendous outpouring of love here at the Carter Center with many people stopping by to bring flowers to light candles. There was someone who stopped by to leave a jar of peanuts for the -- to honor the memory of the former peanut farmer who rose to become the 39th President of the United States. And much has been said about the fact that Jimmy Carter and his presidency didn't really reach its full potential. But people here in Georgia say that -- and they insist, as a matter of fact, that you have to look at his entire life and legacy, and also remember the causes that he promoted, including democracy, fighting disease, seeking international peace. I had an opportunity to talk to a former adviser here at the Carter Center earlier. And this is what he had to say about the late president. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She's the author of the books \"Team of Five\" and \"The Residents.\" And I just wonder what you are thinking and what you're reflecting on, Kate, as Jimmy Carter has passed after such a long and fruitful life in the White House and of course after. KATE ANDERSEN BROWER, AUTHOR, \"THE RESIDENCE\": Yeah. You know, I had the opportunity to interview him in his home with Rosalynn Carter. And the video you showed of Plains, it's just brings back memories of just sweat (ph). They were normal. They were as normal as you can get having occupied the White House. They had a very traditional home, couple bedrooms. They offered to get me a drink of water themselves. I mean, anybody who's been near the presidency, and, you know, Brianna, it's not normal to have a president and first lady that accessible. And I went and heard him speak at the Sunday school. And he was somebody who just really deeply believed in the power of prayer. And, you know, he practiced what he preached, as we see with the work that he did in the Carter Center. He and Rosalynn Carter, they got emotional, actually, when we talked about the eradication of guinea worm disease, which is a very painful disease that they almost completely wiped out with their work with the Carter Center. And that was something that meant so much to them. It wasn't the amount of money that they could make with paid speeches and sitting on boards. It was about really helping people. It sounds like a cliche, but I mean, it's absolutely true about the Carters. KEILAR: And that's what he did. He redefined the post-presidency and kind of set an expectation, I think, for other presidents that you don't just leave the White House, and that's it. You better still keep delivering.",

And that is the attitude he had, he was about serving the American people and not necessarily a political party. I do think that he criticized sitting presidents and their policies in a way that went against the kind of unwritten code of the president's club at the time. You were not to criticize a sitting president.And you had, you know, Jimmy Carter writing about Middle East policy during the Bush administration as being too pro-Israel. He was somebody who would go out on a limb for something he believed in. And I think that's what he'd want to be remembered for is being an, you know, authentic person who stood up for his beliefs, even if they were unpopular at the time.",

They were, you know, born between World War I and the Great Depression, but yet, they were installing solar panels on the White House, you know? It was -- it's fascinating, and taking on mental health.I mean, energy efficiency, the mental health crisis, these are all things that we face toady in 2024. And these were things that they were taking on. Even though they were born so very long ago, they had a very modern view of the world. And they were just both so true to each other, 77 years. They got married when she was 18 and he was 21. And I think that they were just a beautiful dedicated couple. And she worked side by side with him, The Carter Center. That was a complete joint dual project. She went around the world with him, just tirelessly advocating for clean water, free and fair elections. I mean, the list goes on.",

And what he did to really reinvent and reimagine the post-presidency, I mean, he just came up with the Carter Center.He had -- you know, Camp David was historic. And he thought, what am I going to do as a former President that will match that both in terms of international relevance and, you know, in terms of helping people at home with Habitat for Humanity? I mean, they just devoted their lives to helping people and not making money, which I think is the key thing. I mean, he made money off of his books. He wrote more than 30 books. But this was not somebody making $1 million a speaker, right? And I think that people admire that about him. It really wasn't about the bottom line for him.",

South Korea's Acting President has ordered an emergency safety inspection of the country's entire airline operations system. And the NTSB is sending a team to help with the investigation. In the meantime, there is anguish, there is anger, as South Korea is beginning to mourn the victims. 179 people died here, but two crew members sitting near the tail of the aircraft did survive the crash.

This is coming as some House conservatives have warned they're not committed to backing Johnson. They've been upset over the way that he handled a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month.

One, as you noted, these various House members who have said that they probably will not support Speaker Johnson, or at least their votes are in question. But also what we saw with that chaotic funding bill, which was Donald Trump and Elon Musk together tanking that CR that Johnson had worked behind the scenes almost tirelessly on to try to get through in the 11th hour. So there are a lot of questions as to whether or not Trump would actually stand up and back Johnson for speaker.Again, I will note, that Elon Musk, shortly after this actually passed, the proposal actually passed, he said that Speaker Johnson did a very good job. So reading the tea leaves there, given Musk and Trump's relationship right now, did seem likely. Trump was also on board with Speaker Johnson, but he didn't say anything publicly until today when he posted this very, very long post and at the very end of it said this about Speaker Johnson. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hardworking religious man. He will do the right thing, and he will continue to win. Mike has my complete and total endorsement. MAGA. So clearly, a helpful boost for Donald Trump. But we've also already started to see House members again saying that they aren't going to vote for him. And by the way, I think I said boost for Donald Trump, but I meant boost for Mike Johnson. Brianna?",
