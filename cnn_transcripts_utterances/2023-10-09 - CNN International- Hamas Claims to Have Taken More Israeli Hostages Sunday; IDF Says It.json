Because if there weren't hostages, I think you would probably already have seen the start of some kind of ground incursion by the Israelis to just try to completely devastate, in their words, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the other militant group there in the Gaza Strip.But because of these hostages and because presumably they are spread out across the strip, how do you deal with that? Do you just go in with all guns blazing and never mind the fact that there's the danger, of course, for booby trapped roads, improvised explosive devices and further -- further, you know, Israeli soldiers being taken captive in addition to the soldiers and the civilians that are already being held by Hamas. Or do you stay back? And of course. There's also, I suppose, a demand for a response, a strong response from the Israeli public, which is completely shocked. This came out completely out of the blue. And just to put this into context, we're talking about a death toll now, what -- of 700 so far, and that could climb further. And this is already round about the number of fatalities that Israel suffered during the six-day war in 1967. It's about quarter of the deaths that Israel suffered in the Yom Kippur War almost 50 years ago to the day. Everyone is completely shocked. They do not understand how this could have happened. And of course there's also the element of deterrence. You know, Israel's Armed Forces were seen to be not infallible, but certainly among, if not the strongest in the region. And something on the for something on this scale to have happened will be incredibly troubling. There are a huge number of questions to be answered. For now, though, Israel very much focused on clearing up what's happening inside of Israel and it comes with the attacks that are still ongoing and the gun fights that are still ongoing and then going more on the offensive inside the Gaza Strip.",

And this isn't a mistake Israel will again in future. But for now they are just trying to deal with this unprecedented attack, with the fallout, to try to get rid of the militants, to wipe them out inside -- the ones that are still inside of Israel, and the gunfights that are still ongoing in a number of places. And as I say, and then to really go on the offensive, more so inside the Gaza Strip. But as we've just been discussing. That is an incredibly complicated undertaking at the best of times. The fact that there are, at the very least, dozens of hostages, Israel hostages being held by militants inside the Gaza Strip just makes this even more complicated.",

As we all understand, there are dozens, hundreds -- nobody knows the exact number -- of Israeli citizens, of children, of a six- month baby, of a three-year old, of an 85-year-old grandmother, of soldiers, of all sorts who are being held both by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Not that they've really put out any real pictures about how they're doing. What they're trying to do is to taunt us in the most barbaric manner. I'm very appalled that you even call them militants. I think we're allowed to call them terrorists. Am I allowed to be cynical on the air? The barbaric actions of just killing endless families, not just at the party that you showed before, but in dozens of Israeli communities inside Israel, people waking up. So in an incursion it's going in, in both conquering and then trying to eliminate as much of the terrorist group Hamas that we can. You cannot do that just from the air. It means going in. Going in is the worst type of military operation there is. It's both 2.2 million people and I acknowledge there are people there and within them are 10s of thousands of murderous terrorists. Who some of them came into Israel over the last 48 hours. Not all of them. And in that sense, it's to go in. It's to clean that out. It's to try and get to the hostages. It's to try to do so in a way that we can continue as the state of Israel tomorrow morning too, as an idea, not tomorrow, figurative in our exact sense.",

In this video that's been circulating widely online, a woman is seen in the back of the truck as a militant puts a scarf over her head. CNN has not been able to independently verify it. But Yoni Asher, a resident of the Sharon Region told CNN his wife and two daughters, age five and three, were visiting their grandmother near the Gaza border. He lost contact with them on Saturday morning and suspected they may have been abducted. Later that day, his suspicions confirmed when he saw the video. The woman was his wife.
