James at the ready to seize, if Trump doesn't get the $464 million bond by Monday. Now, Westchester is just north of New York City. It has the location of one of Trump's private golf courses and his estate known as Seven Springs. Seven Springs is 50,000 square feet, just the structure, 60 rooms, 15 bedrooms, three pools, and a reported bowling alley. Just listen to Trump's son, Eric.

EXECUTIVE VP:  When we first bought the property in '96, I was about 12, 13 years old at the time and it's really my brother and I and my father during the summers would always put us to work. One of the things that makes this property so you unique, need really one of a kind. It's 230 acres in Bedford, New York. There's no piece of land in Westchester, government or otherwise, that's even close to that size. I mean, one of the highest points in Westchester, we are the highest house in Westchester.

You see them here, and hallways packed in shoulder to shoulder.Israel claims Hamas is using the hospital still as a base for, quote, terrorist activity. It claims it's killed 140 of those terrorists. But innocent Palestinians are there, and they are caught in the crossfire. Jeremy Diamond is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A crowded stairwell at Al Shifa Hospital, dozens of women and children await Israeli military instructions. For four days, thousands of civilians have been trapped here as the Israeli military raids the hospital, targeting Palestinian militants allegedly operating inside the medical complex. Soldiers are everywhere. The voice on the loudspeaker warns, if you leave the premises, the soldiers will shoot you. We have warned you. We have come here in order to get the Israeli hostages, then we will let you go. Soon, word of evacuations begins to spread. Now, they're forcing out the women, the voice behind the cameras says, we don't know where they're going to take us. The Israeli military says they have killed more than 140 militants in and around the hospital, and detained these five men described as senior terror operatives, among more than 600 suspects, the Israeli military says they've detained. Eyewitnesses say a medical personnel and other civilians have also been rounded up. Outside the hospital, the fighting continues, as seen through the lens of Hamas militants who have been targeting Israeli tanks and troops around the hospital complex. Israeli airstrikes reducing parts of the surrounding Al Rimal neighborhood to rubble, sending thousands fleeing south. It's a journey marked by the sites and smells of death. We walked over the martyrs who are dead in the street. People are reduced to body parts, this woman cries. Where is the humanity? The newly displaced, arrive on foot in central Gaza, carrying only backpacks and plastic bags, children clutching dolls and stuffed animals. Others like this mother and her triplets arrive with nothing at all. Tanks and artillery were firing at the buildings around Al Shifa and forcing people to leave the buildings, she says. They make them leave with nothing on them, nothing. No pillow, no blanket, not even water. Nusha (ph) isn't just fleeing the fighting, starvation that has left her eight month old babies thin and frail. You can see them, she says. Each of them is not even two kilos -- eight months old and not even two kilos. Anyone who sees them would think they're only two months old, and they're eight months.  It's a catastrophe. No water, no food, and siege, and gunfire. But her journey is not over yet. She's heading further south in search of food and shelter, no longer taken for granted in Gaza. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on camera):  And as civilians continued to flee the fighting in Gaza, negotiations are very much still ongoing to try and reach a deal that could see a weeks-long ceasefire and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages. Today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that there are still gaps between the two sides, but the gaps are beginning to narrow. He will head to Israel tomorrow to try and push for a deal.

And, you know, part of why you're leaving is what's happening. I know within the Republican Party. You see these numbers that Harry broke down. You know them well. The numbers are worse than they have been in more than 15 years when you look at this for the RNC. What does this mean, Congressman, for the Republican Party? REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO):  Well, I think you've got to look at a lot of different numbers. One, Donald Trump is leading in the polls and a lot of the swing states. Two, Donald Trump was behind Hillary Clinton significantly and fundraising in 2016. But these numbers are not good. It is clear that the Republican Party needs to gather steam. One of the differences I think was that we had six or seven or eight at one point primary candidates who were siphoning off money from the RNC's efforts and from President Trump's efforts. So I think you'll see a rebound in President Trump's numbers, but they still are very far behind.",

And then they've come out just before you are leaving Congress and said they're going to kick you out of the Freedom Caucus just days before your exit. They're going to kick you out. Done, obviously, just petulant lead to make a point. I have to ask you, Congressman, and I'm sure tonight is a night that you're reflecting on this.

Those are the people I think that we need to keep in Congress. We need to deal with the important issues as you've mentioned, the spending, the situation in Ukraine, the border.

We've told -- we've been told it was several hundred that essentially push through that area. And this is beyond the border wall that you see behind me that has existed here for years and then several hundred yards with past that to the river in along the way, there, there are layers of a chain link fence and razor wire that have been put in place by Texas National Guard. This is kind of at the heart of this battle between state authorities and the federal government over the immigration crisis here. And that is the layer that these migrants appear to have pushed through to put -- also important to point out that as soon as they push through that razor wire, they ran up to this fence that you see behind me and essentially turn themselves in where they were all picked up and taken into border patrol custody. And right now, they are in the process of being processed by immigration authorities. We're told that some of them will have asylum claims, others well be deported to large group and that processing will take some time. But that's the scene here.
