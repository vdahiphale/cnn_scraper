Though it's unclear the circumstances of the 81-year-old's death, he had been transferred there, again, in 2021, from Colorado's supermax where he was about two decades into serving eight life sentences after his 1998 guilty plea admitting to sending a series of mail bombs. Some 16 devices in all which killed three people, wounded 23. His reign of terror spanning about 17 years starting in 1978 up until his 1996 arrest.In fact, it was his own writings which is what led to the FBI -- led the FBI to the bombmaker's door, if you can call it that. We all know very well that primitive cabin that was more like a shack in Rural Montana, that was actually on display in Washington, D.C. I had the opportunity to see that myself multiple times. We remember the very basic nature, no plumbing, no electricity. The circumstances of his death, again, it's still unclear at this point. Though we do understand, as part of that transfer a couple of years ago, that he had been in poor health. We have reached out to the Federal Bureau of Prisons right now to try to learn a little bit more. But, again, we can at least confirm now that serial bomber -- convicted bomber, Ted Kaczynski, known as the Unabomber, dead at 81 years old. Fred.",

You know, he was so completely off the grid, really leaving no trace of himself in any of the traditional ways that people do.

So, Kaczynski started in the late 1970s with what began as a primitive, low-tech mail bombing campaign directed predominantly at universities and airline industry representatives and different airline-related targets.Of course, in '79 he was able to get a bomb on an American Airlines flight that fortunately did not detonate, but it let off a great degree of smoke which alerted the pilots, and they were able to effect an emergency landing. There's no doubt that had that bomb gone off it would have taken the plane down and taken all those lives with it. So, an incredibly focused, determined, resilient adversary, right? And somebody who was motivated primarily by his extremist positions with respect to the environment. You know, people today, we think about domestic terrorism, we typically think about it in very different contexts. In the '80s and 1990s, environmental terrorism was a major program that was being worked by the FBI because we had extremist activity around people who objected to environmental development, and Kaczynski was really kind of at the forefront of those thoughts, not that he was a member of a group, at the forefront of that ideology and he pursued this bombing campaign as a way of striking back against technological advancement, which he believed was damaging the environment in ways that needed to be stopped.",

It was right as the case was kind of coming to its close.Nevertheless, having been in many high-level meetings with attorneys general and FBI directors around these things, you know, I can only imagine the way that each possible impact of the causes of action that they were considering was micro analyzed to understand, are we making this issue worse if we give this person a platform, if we allow him to put his ideology out there, if it has an inspirational effect on other like-minded people? We could actually essentially be doing his job for him. On the other hand, and as I understand Attorney General Janet Reno argued pretty strenuously, that this was our best shot of kind of shaking the tree as it were to try to identify the author of the manifesto, and that, to her credit, is exactly how it worked out. Kaczynski's brother and his wife became aware of the manifesto. They had suspicions about Kaczynski before the manifesto, but it was the manifesto that really put Kaczynski's brother over the threshold and motivated him to contact the FBI and say that he thought he knew about -- he knew who the author was.",

He was moved to the facility in North Carolina, likely Butner, the federal prison hospital in Butner, North Carolina, is a place where many federal prisoners end up who have significant health issues. Bernie Madoff, I believe, was at Butner when he passed, as well.

The \"Wall Street Journal\" argues in its editorial today, and they have not been that cool on Trump as a newspaper, but they argue about the Presidential Records Act, PRA. That act gives access to ex-presidents to see classified documents. And they argue -- that would be argued by the defense. Well, where are the defense people? Another example and then I'll stop. And that is, you know, we've heard about all these documents, but you know, the number of documents they're talking about so far could easily fit in one of those boxes.

The Senate -- the Republicans in the Senate have traditionally been quieter in things like this that arise, but they're almost silent now. And Mitch McConnell hasn't said anything.

A source familiar with the intelligence telling CNN the move could allow China to eavesdrop on communications across the U.S. Southeast. Cuban leaders deny the reports and accuse the U.S. of using it as a justification for reinforcing the economic blockade on Cuba.If the facility were to go ahead, it could further inflame tensions between the U.S. and China. In two recent incidents, a Chinese warship cut in front of a U.S. ship in the Taiwan Strait, and a Chinese fighter jet made dangerously close maneuvers near a U.S. military jet. Joining me now, Michael Pillsbury. He is a former defense official under Reagan and Bush, and a key adviser to Former President Trump on China. He's also a senior fellow for China Strategy at the Heritage Foundation and author of the book \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\" So great to see you. So, let's start with this report that Cuba may allow China to build a spy facility. What are your concerns about that? MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, CHINA STRATEGY, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND AUTHOR, \"THE HUNDRED-YEAR MARATHON\":  Well, my concern is that it's coming out at all. Usually, these kinds of things are secret between governments. China would secretly come into Cuba and make a deal, pay money, and then expand the eavesdropping operation. There had been press reports in the past couple of decades that China already does some intelligence collection from Cuba. I tend to think that Admiral John Kirby's comments from the White House probably have some basis to them. This is not exactly what's happening, but something's going on. And frankly, it fits a wider pattern. The Chinese having a sense of anger or being aggrieved against the United States for what they perceive as our being more friendly in various ways toward Taiwan. So, we see this global pressure from China to imply that the Americans have gone too far. We are getting prepared for a war, we're not afraid of you Americans, we can spy on you with our balloons if we want to or from Cuba. We can cross the path of your ships. It's a kind of assertiveness the Chinese seem to believe. They have a different concept of deterrence than we do. They seem to believe if they act in this abrasive manner that somehow this will improve what we do on Taiwan. That's not happening. We're actually getting tougher, and the Biden administration's doing more to help Taiwan, I think because of these Chinese aggressive activities. So, it's not a good trajectory that we're on.",

So, the real takeaway, and what I'm waiting to see is, after he speaks today -- and I'm told it's around 3:00 today, after he speaks today, how many of those in attendance today will walk away and say, hmm, Governor Brian Kemp may have it right, may have called it correctly here. We need to separate from this rhetoric if we are going to be successful with the presidential campaign. So that's what I'm looking to see, just how many will change their mind, not necessarily, you know, turn against Trump, but realize how important it is to distance themselves from his rhetoric.",

Tali'Ja Campbell says she called 911 last week after her husband, Qualin, texted her a picture of himself inside a car with another man she did not recognize. She says it appeared her husband was being held against his will. Qualin was found dead about an hour after his wife says she made the 911 call. The scene less than a mile away from the Colorado Springs Police Headquarters.CNN's Camila Bernal is following this story for us. Camila, what are you learning?",

They say, yes, there was a 911 call that was made, but they don't want to comment on it because it is an active investigation. So, a lot of the information that we're learning is from the widow herself, and she is obviously heartbroken. She is planning a funeral, but took the time to go over the details of what happened.She says on June 2nd, she got these text messages from her husband. And they also included the photo and the location to where he was. So, when she called 911, she was able to give a description of the man that you see on the screen because this is the text message that she received from her husband, and then she was able to give them the exact location of where he was. But she says that when she was talking to the dispatch operator, she didn't sense urgency in her voice, which is why she, too, decided to drive to the location to exactly where her husband was, and she says it took her about an hour to get to that location. When she arrived, she says it was very notable that she did not see any officers on the scene. And so, unfortunately, what she did see was her husband's car, and he was slumped over the driver's seat. And so, she, of course, says she fell to her knees and was crying, but said she also needed to do more. Here's what she said about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TALI'JA CAMPBELL, WIDOW OF MAN ALLEGEDLY KILLED IN HOSTAGE SITUATION: I wanted to check to see if he had a pulse. I opened the door and I put my fingers on his neck, I couldn't feel anything. I put my fingers on his wrist, I still couldn't feel anything. So, my uncle was the only one that was big enough to help pull him out of the car in a pool of blood. It was me that had to try to perform CPR on my husband in a pool of blood. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
