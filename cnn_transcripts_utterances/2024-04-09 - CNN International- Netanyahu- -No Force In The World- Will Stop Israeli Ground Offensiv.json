      "sentences": "Thanks so much for joining us in the CNN Newsroom this hour. I'm Erica Hill in New York.Israel's Prime Minister promising the IDF will eliminate Hamas battalions from Rafah, as concerns mount about a pending offensive. We are live in Jerusalem. This is the scene, live pictures here of the Michigan courtroom where the parents of a teen who killed four students in a school shooting are set to be sentenced. And yet another unwanted first for the planet, new figures show last month was the hottest March on record, the impact just ahead. Defying international pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says no force in the world will stop his troops from storming Rafah to finish the job against Hamas, saying there is now a date for that invasion in southern Gaza. But, Netanyahu did not share that information. The U.S. and other nations continue to urge Israel against a ground offensive, fearing a bloodbath. Israeli troops have now withdrawn from some areas, including Khan Younis, leaving behind apocalyptic scenes of utter destruction, scenes similar to what we've seen around the Al-Shifa Hospital Complex in Gaza City. Gaza's Civil Defense says nearly 400 bodies have now been recovered from that complex following the two-week siege. Meantime, the leaders of Jordan, France and Egypt are calling for a permanent and unconditional ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages. Let's get more now from Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem. Alex Marquardt is in Washington. Jeremy, beginning with you, these comments from Netanyahu about Rafah, I know he spoke about it some more earlier today, he is clearly also or I should say the calls that we saw in this OpEd from the leaders of Jordan, France and Egypt really falling on deaf ears as Netanyahu makes it clear he is moving ahead with plans for Rafah.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. That's right. He is certainly defiant in the face of international pressure, and he is also at the same time bowing to domestic pressure that he is facing from some of those who are keeping him in power as Prime Minister, namely, Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's National Security Minister, who yesterday, in the wake of Israel's major military withdrawal from southern Gaza, warned that if the war in Gaza ends without an invasion of Rafah, effectively that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would lose his governing mandate and that his government -- his governing coalition would effectively collapse.And in the wake of that, we've seen the Israeli Prime Minister not once, not twice -- but twice reiterate his plans to go into Rafah, saying yesterday that a date has been set for such an invasion, although he didn't provide the details. It certainly seems to be more in the context of the political pressures that he is facing rather than any kind of specific operational plans. But, nonetheless, we do know that the Israeli military withdrawal from southern Gaza, in the words of the Defense Minister, is to prepare for battles to come. That could be battles in the north with Hezbollah in Lebanon or potentially to prepare for a coming military offensive in Rafah. All of that, of course, could potentially be forestalled by these negotiations to try and reach a hostage deal, but it remains very much uncertain as of now.",

Alex, Jeremy, thank you both.It is an emotional precedent-setting day at this hour in a Michigan courtroom. Any moment now, well, actually later this morning, we should say, James and Jennifer Crumbley set to be sentenced for their roles in the deadly school shooting carried out by their son. This morning, they are face to face with the families of those victims. The Crumbleys, you may recall, were both found guilty on involuntary manslaughter earlier this year in the deaths of four Oxford high school students. Those are the four students who are gunned down by their son. They are the first parents ever to be charged and convicted for a role in a mass shooting carried out by their child. Some of these victim impact statements happening now. At this moment, we are hearing from Nicole Beausoleil. She is the mother of Madisyn Baldwin. Let's listen in.",

This tragedy has taken an incredible toll on our family. So, our family is not going to give the Crumbley family a second of our time up here. It's time to turn our focus now. This is the low-hanging fruit. Now, it's time to turn our focus to Oxford schools, who played a role in this tragedy. I hear this morning when we listened to all the objections, you can hear Sharon talking about protecting the criminal's civil rights, constitutional rights. [11:45:00] Where is my rights being protected? I fight for everybody in this room. My rights aren't being protected. Criminal's rights are more important than our rights, my rights. We are ready for our government to perform an investigation on this tragedy. Many don't know that our government has not investigated this murder, a pre-shooting investigation, a day of the shooting investigation, and a deep dive investigation into the horrible response to this tragedy, the disrespect shown to us, families, the simple things like trauma training for somebody like a Sheriff Bouchard, who we got to talk to on the day that we got to go identify tape, and he referred to take it as a girl because he was too busy that night, working to cover-up, cover it up instead of learning what every -- about every kid, Tate, Hana, Justin and Madisyn. It's time for the whole truth to come out. It's time to learn from this, from the purchase of the gun to the response. That's when real change happens, is when we can look at something and we can evaluate it. Apply lessons learned. That's when real change happens. Is Hana St. Juliana's family ready for the truth? Justin Shilling's family ready to hear the truth? Nicole Baldwin's family ready to hear the truth? Tate Myre's family is ready to hear the truth. Quit denying us that.

The parents of that shooter, who was 15 at the time, are set to be sentenced today. Both were found guilty of four counts of involuntary manslaughter.I want to bring in Areva Martin, a Civil Rights Attorney, CNN Legal Analyst, joining me now from Los Angeles. Areva, as you listen to these heartbreaking statements from each one of the families talking about their children's lives, they were teenagers, Madisyn Baldwin, Justin Schilling, 17-years-old, Tate Myre 16, Hana St. Juliana, 14, when they were killed. It is emotional, understandably. They are pointing out this is the second time in a matter of months that they have been making these statements. How much impact will their statements have on this judge as the sentencing is decided?",

Here is a young woman, a young girl, really, talking about the loss of her sister and what it means for her life, and really admonishing the defendants taking them to task with statements they've made and for the conduct of their attorneys.",
