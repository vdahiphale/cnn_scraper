That's like calling a baseball game in the seventh inning before the game is even done, right?So, really, really phenomenal heat. This is dangerous heat. We know that heat waves are responsible for more fatalities than both hurricanes and tornadoes combined. So we need to take this heat seriously, especially as it builds into places that haven't had this type of heat in quite a long time. I'm looking at the I-95 corridor. That is the concern today. We have heat emergencies in place for some of the largest population densities, largest cities, Baltimore, Philadelphia, St. Louis today, Cincinnati. Those areas are really going to feel this excruciating heat. You can see the 30 states encompassed by this heat alert spanning from the West Coast all the way to the East Coast. And you can see how they impact the I-95 corridor as well. So, heat indices are going to excel over 100 degrees for many locations. And this is putting a strain on our power grid as well. The largest power provider in the U.S. calling for people to conserve their energy, especially as the demand skyrockets from the use of air conditioning, when these temperatures make its way over 100 degrees. So, a lot at play, but this is dangerous heat and we need to see some relief. That comes in the next couple days. Back to you, Erica.",

And Ohtani's going to be a free agent after this season. Expected to get the biggest deal in U.S. sports history, north of $500 million. And considering that he can do it all, you know, it might be worth it. Just a day after the Angels said they would not be trading Ohtani ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline, he had just a career day. Ohtani starting game one of the double-header against the Tigers. He was amazing on the mound. Striking out eight while throwing a one- hitter. This was the first complete game shutout of his career. Then in game two, Ohtani hitting not one but two home runs. He now has a Major League leading 38 for the season. Ohtani, the first player ever to throw a shutout in one game of a double-header and homer in the other. And he hit two in that game. The Angels won both of them. Here was manager Phil Nevin afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
