We will have those in just a moment.Voters are set to elect their first female president, former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, a prodigy of the outgoing president, is projected to win. Her rival, Xochitl Galvez, supported by a coalition of opposition parties earlier, she had said she thought she had won, but at this stage, we understand that Sheinbaum is the winner. I understand that we are actually going to bring up our reporter, who's standing by, Gustavo Valdez. Have we got Gustavo standing by? Gustavo, talk to us about the outcome here. Of course, we've learned that Claudia Sheinbaum has won, but what was the hold up here?",

They assured everybody that it wasn't hacking. But within minutes, they just announced the results and they're really shocking, because even though it was expected that Claudia Sheinbaum was going to win, the polls earlier during the campaign showed that she had broad support, but she might get up to 60 percent of the vote.This is even higher than what Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador got six years ago. So, the support for the Morena party that they represent, it's much higher than it was six years ago, considering that Morena has only been around for 10 years. That gives you an idea of the political power that Lopez Obrador has amassed over the past six years, and the continuity that it might represent having Claudia Sheinbaum be the next president, because she has pledged to continue with the policies of Mexican President Obrador. So, it is surprising the margin of victory of Claudia Sheinbaum. She's getting ready to give a speech that has been delayed because they were waiting for this announcement. Even though the (inaudible), the National Institute of Election has said that this is a preliminary report based on the early count, is very likely that it's going to stick in. As you said, Mexico will have its first female president in history. She's also the first president of Jewish descent in Mexico history, even though she doesn't talk a lot about her background. We can tell you that she's a 61-year-old academic. She started in academia. She has a Ph.D. on environmental engineering. She was first the minister of the environment for Lopez Obrador when he was the mayor of Mexico City. And then she was elected mayor of the city when Lopez Obrador became president six years ago. So, her incursion in politics is relatively short-lived within the past few years. But she is now the woman who is going to lead the Mexicans for the next six years.",

Now, these are historic elections, not only because more than 20,000 positions were up for elections, the largest in the country's history, but as you well mentioned, it is the first time that Mexico has elected its first female president. Now, going forward, the big question surrounding Claudia Sheinbaum administration is what role, if any, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will continue to play during her six- year term and what that means for her internally with the governing party. The grip of power that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador currently has over the governing party may look very different under a Claudia Sheinbaum administration. We have to remember that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador founded Morena, and in essence he is Morena, and so the way that the governing party reacts to Claudia coming into power is going to be increasingly interesting to monitor, and we have to wait and see the composition of Congress. I think whether the majority party is able to attain a supermajority will really dictate how much Claudia Sheinbaum will be able to achieve in the next six years.",

The first one is in the energy sector, where her scientific background and environmental engineering degree has pushed her to state that she looks to foreign direct investment in clean and renewable energies. In Mexico, something that's very different from sort of the fossil fuels and dirty energy that AMLO has, you know, pushed forward during his administration. On the security front, there seems to be a potential change in terms of AMLO's hugs-not-bullets strategy and what Claudia wants to do in terms of strengthening intelligence and information gathering to combat transnational criminal organizations that have taken control of a vast area of Mexican territory. And then on the last point, there is a potential shift in foreign policy in regards to the relationship specifically with the United States, given that the issues of migration, security and commercial ties between both nations will be determined not only by Claudia Sheinbaum's success today, but also who will win the White House in November.",

Republicans were unchanged for the most part, though about 15 percent of Republicans, which is very near the percentage that Nikki Haley has been getting, even though she's dropped out of the race.

Hunter Biden is accused of unlawfully purchasing and possessing a gun while abusing drugs. It's against federal law for a drug user or a drug addict to buy a gun and to possess a gun. And according to prosecutors, that is exactly what Hunter Biden did. He has been very honest and very public about his lifelong struggle with alcoholism and also with crack cocaine addiction, and prosecutors going to try to connect the dots between that addiction and that drug use and the purchase of this gun. If he is convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison. Although there's a few things that might get in the way of that ever actually happening. First of all, he does not have an extensive criminal record and first-time offenders don't get the maximum. They never get the maximum. And also a Hunter Biden's father, President Joe Biden, does have the power to pardon him for these offenses if he's convicted, which would wipe away the conviction and wipe away any potential prison sentence. But listen, before we get to the finish line here, this trial has to take place. So, the prosecutors have lined up some key witnesses that can testify about Hunter Biden's drug use and tell the jury that, yes, it did happen around the time that he bought that gun. They have three of Hunter Biden's former romantic partners. They have his ex-wife. They also have Hallie Biden, who is the widow of his brother, Beau Biden, who can testify. They're expected to take the stand probably in the coming days. And also the prosecutors have just a large trove of text messages and materials from his infamous laptop describing his drug use. And they also have excerpts of his memoir that they plan on using against him. That memoir came out in 2021 and he was very honest, very forthcoming about his struggle with addiction. Prosecutors are going to try to use that against him to win a conviction in court. It all kicks off Monday morning, 8:30 a.m. in Wilmington, Delaware. And, of course, Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Marshall Cohen, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Some residents can't afford the cost of milk or eggs, and others can't get the cash sitting in their own bank accounts.CNN's Patrick Oppmann has more on Cuba's deepening economic crisis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In a country of seemingly endless lines, these are perhaps the most frustrating people waiting to get money, their money in government-run banks. The lines are long and there's no guarantee that by the time they get to the front, there'll be any cash left. We've been here for an hour she says and haven't been able to get inside yet. Sometimes you do the line and they don't have enough money. Despite government attempts to move transactions online, cash is still king in Cuba. And there isn't enough of it. Many banks limit how much cash people can take out, and the largest build of the government prints is this one, 1,000 pesos. At the official rate, that's about $40, but in the black market, it's only worth about $3. Runaway inflation has inflicted further pain on the already ailing Cuban economy. Lately, government run banks no longer allow foreign companies to withdraw dollars or euros either, saying they simply don't have any on hand. The Cuban government blames the crisis on the U.S. government's economic sanctions and murky plots, they allege, to make record inflation in shortages even worse. But Cuban journalists tracking inflation from abroad say much of the country has lost faith in the banking system and currency. There's no production in Cuba, he says. Production in the country has collapsed. The country is bankrupt. In Cubans like retiree, Nancy, complaining that even when the peso regains some value against the dollar, the prices stay the same or still go up. I don't earn enough each month. She says, I received 7,000 pesos, but a packet of milk is almost 3,000 pesos. A carton of eggs, the same price. I'm not getting by at all. Some economists think Cuba needs to devalue its currency officially or adopt the U.S. dollar. But as the island confronts the worst economic crisis in decades, both money and time maybe running out.
