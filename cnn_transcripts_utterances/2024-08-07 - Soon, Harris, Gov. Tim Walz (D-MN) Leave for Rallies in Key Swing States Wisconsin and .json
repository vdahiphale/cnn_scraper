With just 90 days to go to the election, Kamala Harris' whirlwind 2024 presidential run kicks into high gear today. She and running mate Tim Walz begin their blitz through several key battleground states.As Politico puts it, this morning, Republicans are racing to define Tim Walz as the next liberal boogeyman. But if Walz's debut last night showed us anything, it's this. He is not scared to launch searing attacks against the Trump-Vance ticket, and Harris is eager for voters to get to know him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He's the kind of person who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. And that's the kind of vice president he will be. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They'll argue that Trump and Vance are principally concerned about tax cuts for the wealthy. They'll also argue that a Harris administration would work to ensure that Americans not just get by but they get ahead. And so that is what the argument that we will hear.I had the opportunity to speak to college students, this is a college town, and they told me that they think that Walz is a good strategic choice for Harris. That's because Wisconsin universities are not only Wisconsinites, they are students from across the region. So, many of the kids at the university actually are from Minnesota and they know their governor well. Sara, we got a sense of how the governor is going to make the argument across the Midwest. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN), U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, J. D. studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on. That's not what Middle America is. And I got to tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN Senior Reporter Isaac Dovere is with us now. I knew you were at that rally last night. Look, everyone knows everything at this point. The Democrats and Tim Walz know what attacks were coming if he became the running mate pick, liberal, Minnesota, George Floyd riots there. What's the response? How is Tim Walz, how did he sell himself knowing that? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, look, he tried to introduce himself as much as he could. It's important to know that speech that he gave last night was actually written by Harris campaign aides before they knew whether he was going to be the pick. They had prepared speeches for all the prospective finalists there. And it was about going through all of the reasons in his biography, why they feel like he is a choice that will set himself apart from most politicians, from most Democratic politicians, whether it's the IVF story that he told, about how his daughter was conceived, or something that came across to us in our reporting, where they said to us that he was -- it was a hunter. His experience as a hunter was really going to be part of the conversation that they wanted to have a way of talking. He hunts, he fishes, you want to have a beer with him. He'll play in Michigan, Wisconsin, Western Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina. That's the campaign argument that the Harris folks have here, that he can be a messenger to the type of voters that Democrats have lost to Donald Trump over the years, including as he himself said, in his speech last night to the white guys out there, the older white guys that Harris would like to have more of in her column going into November.",

But there were interviews and there were a lot of conversations between Harris and her staff. Shapiro and Walz were clearly the top two for a couple of days of it. But when Shapiro came in on Sunday to the Naval Observatory, what he was doing was talking about how he wanted to -- he was asking a lot of questions about how her job worked when she was vice president, how she wanted to think about what it would be that he would do, where he would fit in.Walz came in and said, you should tell me how you want the job to be. How much time do I -- am I in the Oval Office? You tell me. Am I the last person in the room when you make decisions? Sometimes I will be, sometimes I won't be. It's up to you. And for Harris, of course, this is a very interesting situation that she's in. Just four years ago, she was vetted to be running mate. Just a couple of weeks ago, she was the running mate still. She has been vice president, is being vice president day in, day out now, even as she's campaigning. She has a real sense of this job and what she wants it to be, how she wants it to be the same from what she's experienced, how she wants it to be different. But what she was looking for a lot in these interviews was saying to them, what do you see this job as, and here's how I see this job, let's see how they match up.",
