We're still waiting to hear from the Israeli government.It is also unclear when the hostages who were expected to be released today will make it out of Gaza. So far 58 hostages have been freed. That includes 40 Israelis, some of whom are dual nationals. 17 Thai citizens and one citizen from the Philippines. CNN is all over the region covering this fast-moving story, including my colleague, Wolf Blitzer, who is in Tel Aviv. Wolf, I am so glad that you're joining us for the hour here. This agreement is a very big deal.",

So, for Israel, that's really important news. For Hamas, it's an additional two days where there won't be any fresh airstrikes or ground assaults by the Israelis. So, they'll have some time to regroup. That's what they want.They also want more humanitarian aid coming into Gaza. So there is another at least two days where all these trucks will be bringing humanitarian supplies, food, water, medicine, all sorts of other things into Gaza and that's important. And another two days of this agreement, Dana, will also allow Israel to release more Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Hamas wants that as well. So, there's some important developments. And we're watching all of this very, very closely. And as you correctly point out, we're waiting to hear directly from the Israeli government to confirm that another two days of this pause will go forward.",

      "sentences": "Yes. The extension of this four-day truce by two additional days has just been announced. And actually, a White House official is now confirming as well that the truce is being extended by an additional two days. Dana, just keep in mind the original parameters of the original deal.It was a four-day pause in fighting for the release of 50 women and children hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being released by the Israelis as well as humanitarian aid flowing into Gaza. The understanding though, was always that there could be an extension of this four-day truce. If Hamas was able to release additional hostages, 10 hostages would by Hamas and additional one day in pause in fighting. But also, Israeli and U.S. officials would always believe too that there were more than 50 women and children hostages, as many as potentially about a several dozen more hostages. So, the fact that this truce is being announced, seems to indicate that there is an understanding that Hamas would be able to turn over additional women and children hostages in the coming days. Of course, we know that one thing that Hamas has insisted is that they needed this pause in fighting to be in place in order to actually gather up information about the hostages to physically locate some of these hostages, which our understanding is that Hamas doesn't even have a full picture of where some of these hostages are located. BASH: OK, MJ. Thank you so much for that reporting. I really appreciate it. And now I want to talk about what happened -- more about what happened with this agreement. It was announced by Qatar. And it was announced just a couple of minutes ago. And at this point, Israel as we've been told has not yet mentioned anything about it. Hopefully our next guest Mark Regev will be able to. He is the senior adviser to Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you so much Mark for being here. Can you tell us the details as you understand it inside the Israeli government of this extended truce?",

But just staying on this deal that was just announced inside Qatar and the White House is also confirming. If it is one day -- one more day of a truce for every 10 hostages.

The ceased cessation of fighting has given them the opportunity to find every last hostage. And we're expecting tonight to see the final group of women and children.

We're dealing with a ruthless, fanatical terrorist organization, Hamas. And it's always like pulling teeth. I mean, it's difficult. It's never easy. And that's why I urge, let's wait to see what happens tonight that we see our people -- that released hostages safely on Israeli soil. I mean, last night, we had the 13 Israeli women and children released. The youngest was that four-year-old American Israeli, Abigail Edan, right. She was kidnapped when she was three. So, you have to ask what sort of people kidnap three-year-olds, right. And I think that tells you everything you need to know about Hamas and explains why it's so difficult. These people are ruthless. And if they think there's an advantage in them for perpetuating the suffering of these innocent civilians and their families in Israel, they will do so, if they think it's in their interest.",

Once again, that is another manifestation of what we're dealing with. These people are heartless. These people are depraved. These people lack any sense of common decency, and that is our enemy.And when the fight against Hamas is resumed, I want people to remember that Israel is fighting a ruthless and despicable terrorist organization. And when we defeat them, as we will, that won't just be good for Israel. Our people deserve to live in safety and insecurity. It's not to fear terrorists crossing the border in the middle of the night and butchering their children. But the people of Gaza also deserve better. Hamas has been ruling Gaza for 16 years, and what have they bought the people of Gaza? Just suffering and pain and poverty. Everyone in this region will be better off without Hamas.",

They don't Hamas to be in-charge of Gaza because they fear that what happened on October 7 could happen again. So, they're going to continue to go after Hamas and resume their military activity, whether airstrikes or ground assault. They're making it abundantly clear that is not going to stop. It's stopping as long as this temporary truce and they call it a truce, a pause. They're not calling it a ceasefire.
