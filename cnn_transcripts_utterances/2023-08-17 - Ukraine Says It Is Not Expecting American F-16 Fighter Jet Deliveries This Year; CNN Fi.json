      "sentences": "Hello, and a very warm welcome to the show everyone, I`m Christina Macfarlane in for Isa Soares.Tonight, Ukraine says it is not expecting American-made F-16 fighter jets this year. We`ll look at why there are such a delay. Then we have evidence of a gruesome massacre that unfolded in west Darfur. We`ll have an exclusive CNN investigation. Plus, concerns for the safety of the jurors who voted to indict Donald Trump in Georgia, as it appears information about their lives has leaked online. More on that. But first, Ukraine says its skies will now be more protected, thanks to a new air defense systems supplied by Germany. But it will have to wait months longer to receive much anticipated U.S.-made fighter jets. Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson says the delivery of F-16s is not expected to happen this year. Ukraine has repeatedly made urgent appeals for the jets from the U.S. and other allies, saying they would be a game-changer by protecting against Russian missile and drone attacks. Ukraine is also calling for tougher sanctions against Russia, saying it should not be able to buy foreign parts to manufacture attack helicopters and other weapons. It says two Russian helicopters shot down in Ukraine today had high tech components from western and Asian countries. Well, let`s bring in our Nick Paton Walsh for more, he`s live for us tonight in Dnipro. And Nick, on those jets, I mean, in May, President Biden said that he would allow Ukrainian pilots to be trained up on F-16s. So what accounts for the day in these fighter jets being delivered in time for Winter?",

      "sentences": "Yes, essentially, the West, NATO, have decided that Ukraine should have F-16s, and the trainingand the supply of them has been something that`s been sort of TBD with European allies, saying the training would occur on their territory. But the supply was something that was supposed to have occurred, I think really this year have been the messaging from the White House. That is now not going to occur according to Ukrainian officials. It`s hugely significant, frankly, because the urgency of what Ukraine needs here is audible every few hours here in Dnipro with the air raid sirens we hear. And F-16s would be less helpful in taking down the ballistic missiles that often crash into major population census like this, it`s more useful in the counteroffensive. And that has an impact too in Russia`s ability to project its missiles into civilian areas like this. They need F-16s to take on the Russian air power that gives them superiority on the frontlines in the south. That means that Ukrainian troops can be hit at will by half-metric ton bombs dropped by the Russians. We see that all the time when we`re on the frontlines with Ukrainian troops. It`s the ultimate risk that they endure, and it`s throwing their progress forward. So the F-16 project was always going to be complex, it had multiple allies, it always involved technology that would often require NATO to be very present at times, metaphorically, in terms of the technical logical know-how, the servicing that these jets needed to function. And all that would have to happen in Ukraine without NATO somehow being dragged in by allowing these jets to fly into their territory and be serviced there. So, it was always tough. But they do appear, according to Ukrainian officials, they may be trying to apply pressure by saying this, they do appear to be not happening fast enough this year, Christina.",

But we must warn you, some of the images you`re about to see are graphic, and the report includes distressing descriptions of conflict. Our Nima Elbagir has this exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The streets of El Geneina in Sudan`s Darfur region are eerily quiet. Filmed at great risk by survivors, the video shows racist graffiti defacing walls and corpses littering the streets. Seen here in their own propaganda, Sudan`s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, RSF, occupied Geneina in June after a heavy shelling campaign and fighting in their war for dominance over Sudan`s army. A CNN investigation has now uncovered some of the cost of the RSF victory here in Geneina. (SCREAMING) (GUNFIRE) Survivors, aid workers and body collectors described to CNN how together with their allies, the RSF gunned down hundreds of civilians in and around Geneina on June 15th.

You recall a report from yesterday where they had guys out in these canyons with bottled water, trying to put smoking hot spots down until they actually eventually got some help from this chopper here. But the latest here is just that death toll continues to tick up in a way that has people worried about whether it`ll jump if this will just be a sort of a constant. One or two a day, about a third of the area in Lahaina town has now been searched. They`ve radically increased the number of dogs. Now I believe the Governor said there`s 40 dogs working in that scene now says that they should be able to get a lot more covered in the near term here. I did see a couple of folks in FEMA vests talking to homeowners today maybe trying to get them into the system to make a claim for a one-time cash payment or get some housing repair help but if your house looks like this, there`s not going to be any repairs. So for working class, especially Native Hawaiians, there`s a lot to worry that they`ll be tempted to -- and can`t afford to rebuild and dwindling that soul the cultural heart and soul of Hawaii, the natives is a great worry to a lot of folks here, especially rebuilding Lahaina town. There are concerns, it turned into another Honolulu. There`s a lot of talk about the alarm system. We continue to get conflicting information about what happened with the Governor saying that maybe some of those sirens were old and didn`t go off. We did hear from the fire chief who says it was never set off in the first place that the communication between the field and somebody to computer to start the alarm broke down given the speed of the fire. There were tests, they do test these alarms the first of every month so a lot of questions there for the investigation as that is unfolding. The president and first lady coming on Monday; we`ll see if that salves any wounds from a lot of people who feel abandoned here. Still no signs of National Guard although they say they`ve doubled the number of troops now close to 500 to help put out these fires. We`ll keep looking and keep you posted as best we can.

But ifa London-based company has its way, that could soon change, thanks to an innovative waterless toilet, designed to improve sanitation around the world. Bianca Nobilo reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  We live in a world of shimmering cities, with skyscrapers soaring above the clouds. But amid all this technology is an uncomfortable, often taboo topic of conversation. The World Health Organization estimates more than 40 percent of the world`s population does not have access to safely manage sanitation in their home. VIRGINIA GARDINER, FOUNDER, LOOWATT (voice-over):  If you`re walking down the street, you look and you`ll see perhaps a canal, which is obviously full of human waste. And you`ll see bubbles coming up. Those bubbles are greenhouse gases. NOBILO (voice-over):  From her small office in southwest London, Virginia Gardiner is working to revolutionize sanitation for many people in the developing world. GARDINER (voice-over):  There`s no one size fits all solution for sanitation. It`s important in any city, I think, to have a diversity of solutions available. NOBILO (voice-over):  Gardiner`s company, Loowatt, has developed waterless toilet systems that flush, which can be used in urban or portable environments. GARDINER (voice-over):  So what we have here is a per spec (ph) model of the electrified version of the toilet. When you flush the toilet, it pulls what is in the toilet -- whatever you put in there -- (LAUGHTER) GARDINER (voice-over):  -- down through and it then goes into a container underneath. Eventually, once it`s full, you change the refill and you swap out the container. So the act of servicing our toilet is a really hygienic experience as well. NOBILO (voice-over):  So far Loowatt has created partnerships in South Africa and Madagascar. In Madagascar, the social enterprise consists of about 860 families, each paying about $4 a month for the service. GARDINER (voice-over):  So in Madagascar, the brand name of our toilet is a Malagasy word. So the home service is called Soomsor (ph), which means serenity and well-being. NOBILO (voice-over):  After the waste is collected, it`s taken to Loowatt`s biodigester, which processes the waste into liquid fertilizer, compost and even some electricity. Loowatt says the waste deposited each month is processed and converted into about five tons of fertilizer and four tons of biogas. It`s waste that, without the Loowatt system, might otherwise end up in a nearby lake. GARDINER (voice-over):  I think all human beings want hygiene and health. And so, it`s nice and, I guess, comforting in a way, to realize that some things are universal for everyone. And I think that`s one of them. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sources say the man scaled the east pillar of the tower before making the daring descent. He landed on the roof of a nearby building.

And for many people now, Mongolia conjures up images of great khans, the endless steppe and epic horse battles and while Mongolians are proud of their history, they`re looking to the future and foreign investment.

Richard will be hosting his QUEST MEANS BUSINESS show live from Ulaanbaatar in just a few minutes` time. Richard, and you`re joining me from the Mongolian capital.

But if you had to actually design -- if you wrote it in a book, you wouldn`t actually believe this country, because, in a sense, the fact you`ve got Russia to the north, you`ve got China to the south. And you have all of these minerals, in a landlocked country with a near dictatorship in one and a Communist country in the other, it just shows the enormous difficulties, this nascent -- maybe not nascent; this maturing democracy currently faces. How do you position yourself between Russia on one side, China on the other, the third neighbor policy of Japan, South Korea or the United States?
