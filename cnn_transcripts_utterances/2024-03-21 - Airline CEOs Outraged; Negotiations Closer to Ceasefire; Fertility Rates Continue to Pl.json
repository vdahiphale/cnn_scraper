And Boeing is top of mind after that string of terrifying midair incidents that have rocked the company.And on that, Boeing admitted just yesterday that it is expecting a massive financial loss in the first quarter. CNN's Richard Quest is in Brussels with much more on this. And, Richard, it does seem that these airline CEOs and airlines broadly are in a tough spot. They can't be happy with Boeing, but they also need Boeing, right?",

And you can't just suddenly turn around to Airbus and say, oh, can we order 200 of your planes, please, because the Airbus order book is full.And, anyway, as the airline's CEOs told me yesterday, Boeing makes very good planes when it makes them properly. This is Michael O'Leary. He's the CEO of Ryanair, which actually is Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, 200 million expected this year. And he has more than 400 - 400 Boeing 737 Max planes on order. He told me about the production problems. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL O'LEARY, CEO, RYANAIR: In 2022 and 2023 we were finding little things, like spanners (ph) under floorboards that - in some cases seat handles missing, things like that. That shows, I think, a lack of attention to detail, quality issues at Boeing. We're in daily dialogue with Dave Calhoun, Brian West, the CFO. I have confidence in those guys. I think they're getting their arms around it. I think the situation at Boeing is improving. But there is no doubt this summer we're facing delivery delays. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Those efforts to secure both an immediate ceasefire and, of course, to secure the release of those hostages held by Hamas. That's what the secretary said when he was in Saudi Arabia. And one of the things he also said is that the gaps are narrowing.But we should take this all with a grain of salt. We have heard positive language about where this is all heading before, and it hasn't always resulted in breakthroughs. He also wasn't specific in terms of how the gaps are actually narrowing. So, we'll try and talk to sources to figure where this is all headed over the course of the next few days. But as you said, the secretary is in Egypt today. He's going to be meeting with a number of Arab leaders to talk about what it looks like for Gaza the day after there is some sort of ceasefire here, how they can govern Gaza, how they can secure Gaza. And then tomorrow he's heading to Israel. Of course, he has been Israel so many times throughout this conflict. And one of the things that we will be watching for him to discuss with his Israeli counterpart is the Israelis desire to go ahead with the ground operation in Gaza, in Rafah specifically. That southern portion of Gaza U.S. officials have been very clear in saying that they do not think a ground operation would be productive here. They are very concerned about how that could be pulled off given that there are 1.5 million civilians there. They just think that it would be too harmful for those civilians. So, that will be discussed by the secretary of state on Friday. But then we also have an Israeli delegation coming here to Washington next week to discuss the matter while Israel and the U.S. are just on opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of how a Rafah operation could be accomplished.",

And, Christine, I wanted to stipulate here, these are reports that as of now Ohtani's not accused or implicated in anything directly, but you've got literally the biggest star in baseball, one of the biggest athletes we've seen in maybe generations, really close to an area which is just completely off limits in baseball, which is gambling.

The last thing Major League Baseball wants is a scandal involving, as you said, of course, the biggest name in the sport, and one of the biggest athletes and biggest names throughout sport in the world.The idea that this story has broken at this moment is baseball's worst nightmare. As they're celebrating the games in South Korea, as they're celebrating the Dodgers super team, Ohtani with, of course, the Dodgers now, the entire season yet to come, and what are we talking about? We're talking about scandal. We're talking about this incredibly close connection. And that is the key here, as you said, the incredibly close connection between the biggest star in the game and the word gambling and betting. That doesn't mean he's involved. But when you're talking millions of dollars and its interpreter, which, of course, the interpreters is so close, so close to an athlete like Ohtani, he is - he is his voice. He is the translator. He is the one who's with him all the time, right by his side. To think that this is going on. And, of course, the key question that any journalists would ask, and we have to ask, is, what did Ohtani know and when did he know it? Did he have any inkling that this money, which is being stolen according to the reports, and these are excellent reporters on these stories, is there any - any hint that Ohtani might have known? Right now we're hearing no. But how did he not know and then we'll give him every opportunity to answer those questions eventually. It's a very, very big deal.",
