In exclusive new CNN reporting, U.S. officials warn Israel's Iron Dome could be overwhelmed if there is a full blown war with Hezbollah, telling CNN that Israel officials are planning to shift resources from southern Gaza to northern Israel in preparation for a possible offensive.CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins us live from the Pentagon with this new reporting. So Natasha, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Manu, so it's important to note, of course, that Hezbollah is really a lot stronger of a group than Hamas is, and with that, they have thousands and thousands of precision guided missiles and rockets and drones that, in the event of a full blown war with Israel, they could start launching, of course, right across that northern border.And so U.S. officials are concerned that if a war were to erupt between Israel and Hezbollah, then the Iron Dome, that key air defense system that Israel has had in place for years now, could be vulnerable, particularly if Hezbollah decides to launch large scale attacks at Israel using precision guided munitions as well as drones. And Hezbollah has already released a video of a drone purporting to strike an iron dome battery in northern Israel. They also released footage from a drone purporting to show sensitive Israeli military sites inside the country. And so there are serious concerns here that if Israel were to launch some kind of offensive against Hezbollah, then this could create a war that would require Israel to really have additional air defense systems that the U.S. would provide, but still there would be significant vulnerabilities. Now, this is all coming to the fore at this point because the U.S. understands that Israel is planning to shift some of its resources from southern Gaza, where it has been engaging in intense fighting against Hamas to northern Israel along that border with Lebanon in preparation for a possible offensive against Hezbollah there. So the rhetoric on both sides is really rising here. Tensions are rising really exponentially over the last several days. The U.S. working really hard behind the scenes to try to deescalate the situation, but there are still plans being made on both sides for a potential war here, Manu.",

That is just a fact. And women are being hurt. President Biden believes in women. Donald Trump believes in states. That's fine.

DAVID URBAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATORAmericans just aren't buying what the Biden campaign is selling. They have greater faith in former President Trump's ability to rectify this tragically flawed economy, to fix the border, the poorest border, to, you know, restore hope in America. People, you know, they answer the question, they're being asked the question, Manu. Are you better off now than you were 40 years ago? And they are resoundingly answering no. And so the things that the mayor is talking about, you know, we're going to go out and talk about, you know, jobs and democracy. You know, those things are great.
