Moments from now, Vice President Kamala Harris will arrive in North Carolina, where she is set to speak next hour. She's kicking off a new tour across swing states today as her campaign shifts to what it calls a more aggressive phase, following this week's showdown with former President Donald Trump.In the meantime, Trump is back on the trail with a stop in Tucson, Arizona, his first rally since the debate. And many of his top allies remain on damage control after his performance on the debate stage. Joining us now, we have CNN Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. And Jeff, there's some new reporting that the Harris campaign is guarding against overconfidence following the debate. After all, this is a race that is neck and neck. You look at the polls there, it's all in the margin of error. So what's her strategy?",

The Harris campaign believes they won the debate. And there's, you know, so much evidence to back that up. But winning debates did not win elections. You now remember that from 2016, Hillary Clinton academically won the debate, she lost the election.So what the Harris campaign is doing is using her words from the debate, particularly on abortion. They're launching a new abortion advertisement -- abortion rights advertisement really drilling down on one specific part of exchange she had with the former President talking about abortion rights. And in North Carolina with young voters, suburban women voters and others, they believe that certainly resonates there. Healthcare also an issue. But another reason she's going to North Carolina, early voting is going to start any day now. It should have started already, but it will start as soon as the ballots without RFK are printed. But North Carolina is a critical swing state. Obama was the last democratic presidential candidate to win it. The Harris campaign believes that they have a very good shot in North Carolina. The Trump campaign is worried. They've started spending much more money there. So that certainly is a key battleground here. And she's trying to take that confidence from the debate stage out onto the campaign trail for two stops today.",

If you look at the CNN race to 270, Pennsylvania is the biggest battleground of all with 19 electoral votes.However, if you lose Pennsylvania and if you win either North Carolina or Georgia, plus one more state, that can make up for a loss in Pennsylvania. But the Harris campaign believes winning North Carolina above and beyond can block Trump's path to 270. Again, all of the 70 battleground states you see in yellow right there on your map are absolutely essential, but they matter in different ways. Pennsylvania had the most electoral votes, but North Carolina can block that path. That's why she's going there. And of course, Donald Trump is on a swing out west as well.",

Let's take a listen. (Begin VT) UNKNOWN #1: Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office? KAMALA HARRIS, Vice President of the United States (D) and U.S. Presidential Candidate: There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announcing he will force a revote next week on a bill that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization nationwide, a measure that Senate Republicans killed in June, but it's now revived after former President Trump proposed making the government or insurance companies pay for such treatments.Let's discuss with the sponsor of that IVF, democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Senator, I know you are a Harris campaign co- chair, but because of the Hatch Act and obviously where you're coming to us live from on the Hill, we're not going to be talking about the campaign. We want to talk about this issue, one that I know is personal for you. You had two daughters via IVF. We're grateful that you're here to share your story with us. I am curious about what you think Republicans might do to try to derail this effort, because reports indicate that they might vote yes, but then attach a series of amendments to demand votes on issues that they see as problematic for Democrats.

I have so many of my colleagues who say, hey, I support IVF. Great. Vote for this bill. It's the right to IVF Act. It's really simple. It just says you have the right to access IVF or other forms of assistive reproductive technology if you want to access it. It also has a provision for military men and women. You know, I suffer from infertility as a result of my military service. And it would cover military men and women so that they could access IVF.

We've already started to do that. This is where using the power of mass buying will help. Again, the FEHB is the largest health insurance plan that's sponsored by an employer in the world.If you have that employee plan actually purchasing and negotiating for lower prices, you're going to bring the prices down.",

It would also allow veterans, actually military, active duty military men and women, to freeze their eggs or freeze their sperm before they are deployed to a combat environment. So many of our service members actually lose their ability to reproduce or have children of their own because they step on landmines, for example. And so this would allow you to preserve your reproductive genetic material prior to going into combat. I don't think any Americans oppose that.And overall, the bill -- the cost of this is not that expensive. I think the studies that I've seen shows that it's only going to be about $1.25 more in the plan overall if we have this mass participation by a large number of participants in the plan. Again, this is the power of being able to negotiate and mass buying that brings down what the price is, is really the cost of the drugs.",

It did two major things, which was it opened a back door to states actually dropping out of Medicare and Medicare -- I'm sorry, Medicaid programs, because it says that if you don't provide IVF, if you ban IVF in your state, and no state right now bans IVF, by the way, it just says that you can't destroy fertilized eggs, which, of course, is part of what happens with IVF. You know, eggs that are non-viable, that are fertilized, you discard of them.

The fertility industry currently isn't regulated by the federal government the way that other areas of health care are. It's largely self-police. So things like the reporting of serious problems or errors, that's not required by law.The inspection and accreditation of labs is also something that's usually self-regulated. That has created a number of issues for patients that I think has widely been reported. I'm wondering if you think any new legislation of IVF has to include stronger regulations to monitor the industry at the federal level and protect patients the way it's done in the United Kingdom, for example.",

They accredit Walter Reed, for example, where the hospital that saved my life post my injury in Iraq. And so I think we need to work with partners within, you know, the medical institutions to strengthen those requirements. And certainly, I would be supportive of that. My bill specifically says that the IVF treatments that you have theright to access must be medically supported. And that means that it has to be something that is up to current medical standards. You can't use experimental technologies or anything like that. It would rule all of that out. It's standard medical practice in the industry is what we're allowing people to access. But certainly, I do think that we need to make sure that people seeking fertility treatments, whether it is IUI, IVF, or just taking a pill to produce more eggs, are well-regulated and are also protected, and that it is done in a safe way.",

It had burned through -- by Monday, it had burned through 30,000 acres. So it shows you just how quickly it exploded in size. It's now over 51,000 acres that have burned here in this area, which people do come to for a lot of recreation.In fact, just this past winter, the San Gabriel mountains where we're standing were inundated with so much snow, people were having trouble getting in and out of the mountains. Now, you look at it and it looks almost like a moonscape here. And also, just to show you how hot this fire was burning, you can see back there that telephone pole, you see those lines are burned down, there's some where the poles are completely burned away in some areas. And again, this is not just here in the San Gabriel Mountains. You've got the Airport Fire that's down in Orange and Riverside Counties. And you also have the line fire as well, which you're showing that imagery from. All in all, it's taxing resources here. Normally, they would assign aircraft to a fire. They just can't do it with these three fires burning in southern California, so they're flying between them. We just saw that there was a jet that flew over a mountain range where we see some hot spots over to my left, flying over and dropping either water or fire retardant. But really, when you look at how much manpower is needed here, they've even had to bring in firefighters as far as from New Jersey to be here to help battle this blaze here. And while we've been standing here, Brianna, you know, we're standing out here in the wilderness along this highway here, and you see these trees, a lot of them look like they're burned out behind us. But we just heard what sounded like a tree falling over after it's been burned so much that it starts to collapse. And that's part of the danger of being out here. The air quality is still very thick. They have to wait for the sun to come up before they're able to get those jets in here to drop the fire retardant. And we can see now as the sun is starting to heat up the land, we're seeing more and more of these hot spots starting to burn again. And the firefighters are out here roving and trying to put them out. But still, people evacuated and they stayed away. And one official told, told me that has really made the difference because they could focus on keeping the property safe since the people had left.",
