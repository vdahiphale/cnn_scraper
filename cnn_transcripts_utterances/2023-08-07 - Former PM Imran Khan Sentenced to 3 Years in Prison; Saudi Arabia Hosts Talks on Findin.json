Just ahead I'm going tospeak to Pakistan's Defense Minister about what is going on the ground. First up though your headlines this hour the Ukrainian Security Service says it is thwarted an assassination attempt on President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A woman is now in custody she allegedly was gathering Intel to carry out an airstrike on the Ukrainian President according to authorities there. Well, the French Foreign Ministry tells CNN that the coup leaders in Niger are in talks with the Wagner Mercenary Group. Meanwhile, the Economic Community of West African States or ECOWAS says it will meet on Thursday after a deadline that it's set to reinstate the President passed by on Sunday with no action. Streets are closed outside in Atlanta courthouse as the city braces for a possible fourth indictment of Former U.S. President Donald Trump. Welcome to the second hour of \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson. Wherever you are watching you're more than welcome and it is just after four o'clock in the afternoon here. Well, a lawyer for Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan says that he's met with his client and will be petitioning for his release. Khan's party has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court on Saturday he was convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to three years in prison. According Islamabad found him guilty of making false declarations of his assets. Now this could disqualify him from holding office threatening his political future. But in a pre-recorded video shared on Twitter before his arrest, the Former Prime Minister called on his supporters to carry out peaceful protests. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But he consistently sought to sidestep the law hiding behind legal complexities and employing delaying strategies. Well I'm joined now by another government official Pakistan's Minister of Defense Khawaja Muhammad Asif, he's coming to us live from Islamabad via Skype today. It's good to have you sir. Mr. Khan's lawyer says he met with the Former Prime Minister in jail earlier today and will soon be filing a petition for his release your response to that? KHAWAJA MUHAMMAD ASIF, PAKISTAN'S MINISTER OF DEFENSE: Thank you very much, Becky. He has a right to appeal. Actually, he has two layers of appeal one, the High Court of Islamabad and other the Supreme Court of Pakistan. So his rights are intact. He can use these rights of appeal twice, if he's not satisfied with the verdict of a High Court in Islamabad, he can go to the Supreme Court, whereas when he imprisoned the Leader of Opposition then Nawaz Sharif, Former Prime Minister and my leader, there was no right of appeal. It was done by Supreme Court and he was never given a right of appeal.",

However, the U.S. is also at the same time trying to emphasize here freedom of navigation principles, right. They weren't international waters.

This video is from over the weekend show in a Chinese ship purportedly firing water at the Filipino boat. Smaller in size compared to the Chinese Coast Guard ship, the much smaller Philippine boat was attempting to deliver supplies to a Philippine military installation in the South China Sea. Some context these waters have been a source of tension between the two nations. Beijing claims it as its own, yet Manila feels it has a right too. A 2016 ruling from the hay contends that Beijing has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bark of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling. The incident has prompted the Philippine's foreign minister to deliver a complaint letter to the Chinese Embassy on Monday. The United States is showing support to the Philippines reaffirming its mutual defense treaty obligations. Australia, Germany and Japan have also weighed in calling the Chinese actions dangerous and destabilizing. Marc Stewart, CNN, Tokyo.",

A specialized team in Dubai had to sedate and remove the bear from the Iraqi Airways plane. There were two endangered bears on this flight. And this one when it tried to escape as you can imagine it cause delays and more than a few disgruntled passengers. The prime minister of Iraq is ordering an investigation into what caused the 'malfunction'. Iraqi airways say in a statement the bears transport aligned with international welfare guidelines. Dogs and cats have escaped from crates on planes before. Bears on the other hand, much less common and it has to be said a lot more frightening.

Seven spider monkeys were found hidden in a backpack in an attempt to smuggle them through the southern border.

You're watching a 25-year-old man clinging to a partially submerged boat before he was rescued 12 miles off the coast of Florida almost two brutal days at sea.

According to theCoast Guard, this rescue played out about 12 miles off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida. That's on the north eastern side of the state here. According to the Coast Guard, a 25-year-old Charles Gregory, he goes out on this fishing trip on early Friday morning. And early on encounters some pretty rough seas. According to his father, this 12 foot lightweight boat that he was on is hit by a wave. That wave causes the boat to take on water and in the process, it goes, it causes rather Gregory to lose his cell phone and his life fast. He's barely able to hold onto this boat. We're told that at one point, Gregory decides to take the motor off the entire thing, all in an effort to try to keep it afloat. We're told by the Coast Guard at least from the video that we saw that you can see Gregory on the boat here; it's dipping in and out of the ocean there. And that he spent about 35 hours out at sea. According to his father, the worst part of this whole ordeal apparently takes place at night because Gregory says he can't see anything. He's cold. He's wet. It is very windy out there. And as you noted Becky, earlier the day he had spotted some sharks, he had been stung by some jellyfish. And so, he has to spend all of these hours overnight, wondering if anyone is going to come out and rescue him. We're told that at one point he takes off his swimming shorts, all in an effort to try to flag down some nearby boats as well as an airplane. Now the United States Coast Guard eventually spots him Saturday morning from an airplane, they're able to decide exactly where he is. And so they send a boat out to get him. They bring him back to shore. And we're told that the 25-year-old had some severe sun burns. He was treated for dehydration, but is otherwise doing OK. His father spoke to CNN on Sunday and essentially told us that at the end of the day, the whole moral of the story is \"Don't ever give up\". Again this 25-year-old is lucky to be alive after this fishing trip nearly killed him. Becky.",
