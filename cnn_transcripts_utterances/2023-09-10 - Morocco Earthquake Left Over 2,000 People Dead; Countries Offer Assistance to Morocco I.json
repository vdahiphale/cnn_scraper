A nation in shock and grief after being ravaged by its deadliest earthquake in decades. More than 2,000 people have died since the disaster struck Friday night, and many of the victims are already being laid to rest. There are also fears that the death toll will continue to rise as emergency crews dig through the rubble of collapsed buildings. But many are still holding out hope that they will find people alive under all of that debris. Those who survived are now coping with trauma. Many sleeping outdoors after losing their homes. Others who still have a place to live are hesitant to return home. As you can understand, their worry that there could be aftershocks, and that their homes could once again collapse. Now, Morocco's king has instructed officials to set up an interministerial commission to provide much-needed relief. We get more details now from CNN's Sam Kiley in Marrakesh. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Morocco's King Mohammed has declared three days of national mourning here in Marrakesh, and that is because his country has been completely devastated by an extraordinary earthquake, totally unexpected in cities like this, Marrakesh. This has been the scene here in the Medina, the most ancient part of this ancient city. Here, a building clearly ripped away by this earthquake. But the scenes have been even worse in the interior of the country where one woman who was trapped for some 12 hours was pulled from rubble in a remote village. Now, there are 13 people dead here in Marrakesh. Across the country, more than 1,300 people have died. And the authorities here expect those numbers to climb with some rapidity.Their problem though is getting out into the areas that are worst affected. The epicenter is about 45 miles south of Marrakesh, but the areas that have been really badly devastated, according to the local authorities, have been villages in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. These are villages that aerial photographs have already showed have been completely flattened with one or two houses remaining, looking as if they've been built on scree. Now, that scree, that rubble was once villages, and it's in those areas where the authorities are most concerned that the numbers of casualties, of the dead and injured will climb. But of course, the other problem for the authorities is that getting to these locations is really going to be very, very difficult because they're saying large numbers of the roads, the communication networks have been severed by this earthquake, which is completely unanticipated. No locals I've spoken to here in Marrakesh can remember any history of earthquakes here. Elsewhere in the country, yes. But here, they say they've never experienced, no tell, no history, they say, of any kind of earthquake. But this is the result. Bedsteads, bedding, carpets left hanging over the edge of walls that have been utterly sliced away as this ancient city has been rebuilt over the last few decades. Enormous amount of effort has been put into the reconstruction of Marrakesh, particularly here in the Medina, one of the prides of Morocco. Very much a tourist destination, but also a location of one of the king's major palaces. It is very much the cultural center for many Moroccans, and this is what this latest earthquake has done.

Actually, yesterday, we were able to release a million U.S. dollars to the Moroccan Red Crescent just to support them on their moving forward to address those emergency needs. Basically, to allow them some space to start working already. We're seeing a lot of traumas in its very early days. I cannot stress that enough. We just entered the second full day, really, of the response here, and that window is still very, very much about search and rescue. We know that there are people, unfortunately, still trapped under the rubble, and the key here is to get to those people in good time. We also know that a lot of people have survived this, of course. And they've survived but unfortunately with injuries. So, really making sure that we take care of the survivors in a meaningful way. That we're able to triage.

But reaching those people in the first place is critical.

And no doubt more chaos amongst those communities.Trying to keep people in a safe space and away from those buildings that may well be impacted and we may still see buildings continue to fall as those aftershocks happen. But keeping people away and keeping people safe, even while the search and rescue window must carry on or that search and rescue effort must carry on.

But in the next several days, those areas and other Caribbean Islands can expect dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents.

U.S. President Joe Biden is on his way to Vietnam right now, having wrapped his participation in the G20 Summit in India. Earlier, he and other G20 leaders paid their respects at the memorial in New Delhi for Mahama Gandhi. Now, the leaders took part in a wreath laying ceremony at that site. Meantime, the just concluded G20 meeting managed to produce a final declaration after -- yes, a lot of diplomatic wrangling. But Ukraine, obviously, saying they're not happy with the language regarding the war. Saying, it felt far short of actually condemning Russia's aggressions. CNN's Kevin Liptak joins us now live from New Delhi. I know you have been following all these negotiations carefully. The G20 statement, you know, it's making more headlines for what it doesn't do than anything it substantively does. What are Biden's official saying behind the scenes about this declaration?",

And as you said, it was not a foregone conclusion coming into the summit that the leaders would be able to agree to any language on Ukraine. Because remember this is the block that includes Russia, the perpetrator of the war, but also countries like Brazil and South Africa who have not taken a firm stance against the invasion. And also, India, the summit's host, which is still trying to maintain close ties with Moscow. And these leaders' statements tend to reflect the proclivities of the host nation.And so, the statement, in and of itself, was an accomplishment. It came after, you know, hundreds of hours of talks. 15 different drafts. As you said, it doesn't mention Russia by name. It doesn't explicitly condemn its invasion of Ukraine. It talks about the suffering of the Ukrainians, the importance of maintaining territorial integrity, the importance of not using nuclear weapons. But it's certainly is a lot softer than a lot of the nations who are here would have put out themselves, including the United States. But President Biden's aides do say that this is a consequential statement, that was the word used by the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. And they do note that this statement included all kinds of other provisions. Things like debt restructuring for the developing world. Admitting the African Union to the G20 for the first time. And so, certainly, there was plenty that they were looking at and that they feel that they accomplished. But the statement still, you know, represents the divides that are in this G20. And as the summit concludes, those fractures are no less apparent. You know, it was apparent coming in, the absence of the Chinese and Russian leaders really showing you that this block is a fractured moment. As President Biden departs, he was able to secure this language, these commitments from the nations that are here, but it's not necessarily the strength of condemnation of Russia's war that many people were hoping for, including the Ukrainians.

I am told by a senior administration official that the U.S. will announce its own steps on Monday to help Vietnam diversify its arms supply chain, it's procurement. And so, that's something to watch.President Biden's goals in Hanoi is, really, to elevate the U.S.- Vietnam relationship. Currently, the U.S. and Vietnam are, sort of, at the lowest level of diplomatic ties on the Vietnamese scale, I guess you could say. They are elevating it to the very top level of the Vietnamese system. And it's interesting because the other two countries at that top level are China and Russia. And certainly, President Biden hopes to act as a counterweight to those nations on his visit. The U.S. acknowledges that they will not be able to convince the Vietnamese to totally sever ties with those countries. They aren't asking them to, necessarily. But they do want to position the United States as an alternative to those countries, particularly as China steps up its economic aggressions, its military aggressions in Asia. And Vietnam is only one country that the president is doing this with. He is doing it here in India as well. He's doing it in the Philippines, in a more traditional American allies in East Asia, Japan and South Korea. And so, certainly, this is an important visit for the president as he looks to step up the American footprint to this region. Paula.",

We've been following some of the artilleries efforts as it seeks to inch forward under constant drone fire and replies from Russian artillery positions.

Authorities in Morocco say more than 2,000 people have been killed in the deadliest earthquake to strike the country in decades. The tremor has ravaged remote villages in the foothills of the high Atlas Mountains. Survivors say homes and buildings in the area have been completely flattened, leaving them displaced. Others, who still have a place to live are hesitant, of course, to go back indoors, fearing they -- their homes could be brought down by another earthquake or any kind of even moderate aftershocks in the area. Many people now are also sleeping outside with their families, fearing for their safety. The U.S. geological survey says the powerful quake struck at a relatively shallow death -- depth.

As for the just concluded G20 meeting, it did manage to produce a final declaration, but only after the normal diplomatic wrangling, although, this time this involved, of course, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And Ukraine was not happy about this declaration. It said the G20's language regarding the war fell far short of condemning Russia's aggression. CNN's Vedika Sud joins us now from New Delhi. And you have been following all of it. I mean, I'm interested to hear from you in terms of Prime Minister Modi. He will, of course, interpret this as a successful meeting. But by what measure? What did it achieve as far as he is concerned?",

And, of course, he will be taking credit for this, along with the entire team that's worked for months to get to this point. However, I just want to even bring to you a notice how the officials have been speaking about this.A lot of information is now emerging about the effort that has gone in over the months, Paula, to get to this point. The G20 Sherpa from India, Amitabh Kant, has said, and I'm going to quote him here. He said, \"The most complex part of the entire G20 was to bring consensus on the geopolitical paragraphs.\" And here he talks, of course, about Russia-Ukraine. \"This is done over 200 hours of non-stop negotiations, 300 bilateral meetings, and 15 drafts.\" I think this itself encapsulates the hard work that has really gone on behind the scenes to get to the table with the different stakeholders of the G20 Summit and get them to sign off on that declaration. Yes, it's watered down. It's more diluted than this time. But most of the G20 member countries took last year in the Bali Summit. But if you look at it from Narendra Modi's point of view, he is known to be very close to Russia. He's also known to be very close to the U.S. So, the balancing act, the tightrope walk continues for the Indian prime minister. And it's pretty evident to everyone at signing off on this declaration. But yet, again there has been disappointment, at least for Ukraine, when it comes to this. You were talking about their statement. I just want to very quickly read out what the spokesperson of the foreign ministry there had to say. And I'm going to quote here, \"Ukraine is grateful to its partners who tried to include strong wording in the text. At the same time, the G20 has nothing to be proud of in the part about Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Obviously, the participation of the Ukrainian side would have allowed the participants to better understand the situation.\" Now, it's important to note here that India did not invite Zelenskyy for the G20 Summit, either in person or to address that bloc virtually. Back to you.",

This is the moment Mark Dickey began descending into the Morca sinkhole, a cave more than 3,400 feet, that's about 1,000 meters deep. Dickey was on an exploration mission with an international team when he fell ill with suspected intestinal bleeding. Nada Bashir picks up our story from there.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The American caver has, over the last week, been receiving urgent medical at base camp, more than three and a half thousand feet below ground. For what they said to have been a case of gastrointestinal bleeding.Now, according to rescuers on the ground, Dickey has received a blood transfusion and is now said to be in a stable condition. But this is a complex operation, and a lot of careful preparation has gone into this rescue mission. In its latest update, Turkey's caving federation says Dickey is currently being transported by a stretcher through the pastures of the cave. And you can imagine how tricky this will be given the narrow and winding nature of many of these passages. The actual ascent is said to be divided into seven parts, according to the European Cave Rescue Association, with each segment being overseen by different rescue teams. And this truly is a multinational rescue effort. More than 180 rescuers are on the ground from countries, including Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Italy. And while this route would typically take an experienced caver, around 16 hours to reach the surface under ideal conditions, Dickey's rescue is expected to take days. The priority, of course, is ensuring that the American caver remains in a stable condition throughout. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
