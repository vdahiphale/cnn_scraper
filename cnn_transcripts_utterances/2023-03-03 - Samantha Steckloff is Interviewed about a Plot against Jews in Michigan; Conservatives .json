And it was created by Holocaust survivors. And I say that because we have this great cultural fabric here in southeast Michigan. And while this is the first time in my lifetime I have seen this kind of stuff happen, it's not the first time we've seen it happen, especially when we go back to the 1930s and why so many of our seniors are scared.Back in October/November when Kanye West put that tweet out, \"The Detroit News\" editorial board put out an entire article calling Kanye a victim. And still to this day they refuse -- they absolutely refuse to retract it. I still go back and forth with the editor of \"The Detroit News.\" And I bring that up not to say so much about we need to be so much of going after our media. That's not it at all. But what it does mean is we need to be very conscience about what we say, the tropes we use. We, so often, here that the Jews are in charge of the media, that we are in charge of everything, and we need to stop that argument. And when you have someone who can tweet out to more people, to double the amount of people than there are Jews in this entire world, there are less than 115 million of us, a majority of people have never met another Jewish person.
