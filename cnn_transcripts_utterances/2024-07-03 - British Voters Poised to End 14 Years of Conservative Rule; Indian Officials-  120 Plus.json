Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is almost universally expected to lose. He took a major gamble by calling for early elections and has struggled to turn around dire polling.A Conservative defeat would likely usher in a center-left Labour government headed by Keir Starmer. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two lackluster candidates in a race with a result that is all but certain. It may sound boring, but this is a momentous election that could decimate the UK's most powerful political party. In what is widely seen as a referendum on their 14 years of leadership, the Conservatives are bracing for a very damaging defeat. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called for the snap election that almost everyone believes he will lose.",

It starts just before 10pm right here in London U.K. time.Now, meanwhile in France, hundreds of candidates in the country's run- off election have bowed out in an effort to block the far-right party from gaining power. More than 200 candidates from President Emmanuel Macron's centrist camp and the left-wing alliance have stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting that vote. Last Sunday, the anti-immigration National Rally and its allies won the most seats so far in hastily called national elections. If the National Rally gets an absolute majority in Parliament, it will become the first far-right party to lead the French government since World War II. Join us on Sunday for special coverage of those French elections as the results come in. That's at 8 p.m. in Paris, 2 p.m. on the East Coast. More than 120 people have been killed and 35 others injured in a crowd crush in India. It's one of the deadliest such incidents in the country in recent years. Officials say most of the victims were women and children. It happened as hundreds of thousands of people had gathered for a religious event in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

(END VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (on camera): Now Max, state officials are saying that the extreme heat probably contributed to this disaster as well as deep mud. But then there are really the questions about the organizers here and actually the police as well because we have a senior police officer who told journalists on the scene that they had dispatched some 40 police officers to deal with an anticipated crowd of some 80,000 people. That is clearly not enough. The state officials say they will be paying compensation to those who died in this disaster. And this isn't the first time sadly that India is seeing deaths like this. On January 1st of this year at least 12 people died in a crush at a shrine in Jammu. If you go back to 2008, 150 people died in a hilltop crowd crush in western India.

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Max. Good morning. Let me first show you how it's being received here in China. Very friendly reception to this road trip by Xi Jinping.The front page of China Daily, state media, an English publication, show Xi Jinping arriving in Kazakhstan, greeted by leadership from that country. There was also children there to greet him. There was music. This is friendly territory for Xi Jinping. These two nations have economic ties. It's a relationship valued by both, in particular by Beijing. But the bigger purpose of this trip, including Xi Jinping as well as Vladimir Putin, is for this meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the SCO. To give you some history, it's a club of sorts, you could argue. This alliance spearheaded by China, by Russia, Kazakhstan, certainly members as well as other Eurasian nations. Originally, this was set up for security reasons, to prevent terrorism and to create some security among these borders. But as you alluded to, it's taken on more of this geopolitical tone. And one occurrence that we are looking for in this meeting in the hours ahead is the admission of Belarus to the SCO. Belarus, a bit controversial because Belarus is, you know, credited, for lack of better words, of helping Russia with its invasion of Ukraine. And that is perhaps causing some different feelings among members. But it shows perhaps the tone of where this alliance is going. In fact, it was last year when Iran became a full member. As a result, we are not seeing the presence of India's president, Narendra Modi. He was supposed to be there. It could be viewed as a slight, it could be viewed as some trepidation about the direction of this organization. But if we look at Russia and China right now, they are clearly on a mission to establish themselves as an alternative to the world order, an alternative way of viewing things, much different from the West, much different from the American perspective. Max, this is a theme that came up just a few months ago here in Beijing in May when Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin were meeting face to face and likely is being demonstrated again by this meeting with Russia, with China and many other nations at the SCO in Kazakhstan.",

Just eight teams are left standing after two more were sent home on Tuesday night.We are going to start our round-up in Leipzig, an incredible game between Turkey and Austria that had everybody on the edge of their seats for the full 90 minutes, and it was entertaining right from the off. Just 57 seconds on the clock when Turkey's Merih Demiral smashed the ball into the roof of the net. That is the second fastest goal ever scored at the Euros. And Turkey doubled their advantage just before the hour mark, and it was Demiral again, again from a corner. This time he scored with a header. By the way, he's never scored more than two goals in a season for any of his club teams. He got two in one night on one of the biggest stages in the world game. But Austria never looked out of this match, and they pulled a goal back seven minutes later. Another set piece, Michael Gregorich flying in at the far post, and they never gave up looking for an equalizer. They actually thought they had it in stoppage time, a header from Christoph Baumgartner, but that was brilliantly denied by goalie Mert Gunok. The game of the tournament was effectively decided by the save of the tournament, Turkey holding on for a 2-1 win. They are going to play the Netherlands next. They thrashed Romania 3-0 in Munich, meaning they definitely belong in the last eight. Remember, they squeaked out of the group stage as the third best team. The Dutch dominated every aspect of this match, taking the lead through Cody Gakpo. Then this happened seven minutes from time. Gakpo involved again, setting up Daniel Marlin. He couldn't miss that. He had to work a bit harder for his second goal to make it 3-0, running half the length of the field. The Dutch through to the quarterfinals, where they will play Turkey next. We're all going to take a breather for a couple of days, but the action will resume on Friday with an absolute blockbuster of a doubleheader.
