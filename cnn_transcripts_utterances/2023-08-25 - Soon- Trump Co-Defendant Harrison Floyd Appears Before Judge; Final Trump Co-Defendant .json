Kelly, Kanye West, and she has just surrendered to the Fulton County Jail here ahead of that noon deadline for her role in this election subversion case. She's alleged to have intimidated Fulton County election workers. Prosecutors say that she drove down from her Chicago area home to intimidate Ruby Freeman, a Fulton County election worker, calling her a loose end that the party needed to tidy up.Just a short time ago that we understand Kutti surrendered to authorities. And had she missed that noon deadline, she really would have complicated what has so far been a relatively smooth process for these co-defendants who have surrendered prior to that deadline. Most co-defendants, other than the President, who spent about 20 minutes inside, has spent about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. We understand Harrison Floyd, who we'll hear report on in a short time. He is believed to still be in custody, but he did not work out a bond agreement. As it stands right now, Pastor Stephen Lee is the only co-defendant in this sprawling investigation that has not turned himself in. And if he misses this noon deadline, he runs the risk of putting himself in the criminal justice system instead of just about an hour for days. At best, people who turn themselves into Fulton County usually take about 48 hours. It could take sometimes days. We don't know exactly the whereabouts of Stephen Lee as it stands right now, but he is the only and last remaining co-defendant of the 19 that has yet to turn themselves in. And the clock is ticking.

      "sentences": "So, as Nick referenced, Harrison Floyd, who is the leader of an organization called the Black Voices for Trump, he was one of the rare cases yesterday where his surrender did not go very smoothly. And that was because he failed to negotiate a bond agreement before turning himself over to authorities at the Fulton County Jail.And as a result, he spent the time since then in custody. And he's just now about to make his first initial appearance in front of the judge overseeing this election subversion case here in Georgia, where they're going to work out the terms of a potential bond or determine his fate going forward. You know, Harrison Floyd is an interesting character in all this. He is one of those charged with crimes related to intimidating election workers. He's also facing a charge in a separate matter for allegedly assaulting an FBI agent who was trying to serve him a grand jury subpoena. So we're going to see Harrison Floyd make his first initial appearance today in court and we're going to learn more about his fate after that. Now, for some other defendants though, the court, you know, court activity is already getting on the books here. Ken Chesebro, who was one of the lawyers working with Donald Trump as he was trying to overturn the 2020 election, a judge set a trial date for Chesebro, October 23rd, 2023. So that's the first set court trial date that we know of, set by a judge for a defendant in this case. And it's interesting because the judge made very clear yesterday that this only applies to Chesebro. And Fani Willis has really made clear she wants to try all of these defendants together. So it'll be interesting to see how this maybe impacts her ability to do that going forward. And, you know, there's other defendants like Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff who's still trying to get this case moved to federal court. He'll have a hearing on Monday where he'll present his case for why he thinks that it should be moved to federal court. It'll center around the fact that he argues he was a government official at the time and therefore he was acting in a formal government, you know, capacity in his work for Donald Trump, where Fani Willis argues you can't try to overturn an election that doesn't fall within the scope of your responsibilities as a government official.",

It's better for Ken Chesebro to be sitting separate from President Trump and the other leaders of the conspiracy. So I think tactically, I understand why certain defendants want to peel off from the group and force the government quickly to preview their evidence.I think Chesbro likely thinks that if he goes first, the government will be reluctant potentially to show all of its cards in that trial because of the looming, much more significant trial of the former President and others. So, tactically, I understand why a defendant or two would want to go fast, particularly if it results in a severance which they likely think is favorable for them.",

He's having a hearing on Monday as he's trying to get his Georgia case moved out of state court into federal court.And in the request to get it moved, his attorney put it this way, basically laying out what he says is that he did not act illegally in his actions, stripped of the state's gloss the underlying facts, entailed duties, with the core functions of a chiefs of staff to the President of the United States, arranging or attending Oval Office meetings, contacting state officials on the President's behalf, visiting a state government building and setting up a phone call for the President with a state official.

Keep in mind, Kate, that elections are state functions. And when he is on the phone with President Trump talking to Brad Raffensperger, that is the federal official trying to influence a classically legally state proceeding.The DA's response to this motion will be that the acts alleged against Mr. Meadows are not within the scope of his employment as White House chief of staff, but are rather independent criminal actions. It's the very same argument that he made with respect to executive privilege. And a lot of defendants say, hey, we don't have to provide information to the Select Committee because it's covered by an executive privilege. Our response was always, this is beyond the scope of your official responsibility. It was campaign activity, it was personal. And therefore executive privilege doesn't apply. That's the same analysis that the federal judge will have to apply. Was this core conduct within the scope of the appropriate function of the White House chief of staff?",
