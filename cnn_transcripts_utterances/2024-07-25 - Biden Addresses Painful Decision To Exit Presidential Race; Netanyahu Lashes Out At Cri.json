And although this next round of the storm is not expected to be as intense as we've seen in the past few hours, what has happened in Taiwan and particularly in the Philippines certainly unsettling.And by the way, I want to start with the Philippines. Let me show you some video that we received over the last few hours from Manila. Many of the streets there are literally covered in water, water that is very deep. In some cases it's almost up to people's necks. And we've seen a lot of pictures of rescues taking place. We've seen rescue boats, those inflatable boats. We've seen rescuers, you know, wearing protective gear because this can be very dicey. It's not just adults. I mean I saw at least one image of a child being carried to safety. So it is quite unsettling. We've also seen it impact transportation. I saw a picture of at least two buses that were pretty much submerged in the water. This is really disrupting everyday life in the Philippines. Schools have been closed. Government offices have been closed. Airports have had to cancel flights. We are hearing from the Philippines president, from Ferdinand Marcos Jr., he said on Wednesday he's calling on all national agencies to provide assistance to all those affected by the typhoon. So certainly a mess in the Philippines. I should stress that the typhoon actually didn't make landfall in the Philippines, but it brushed by the coast and it's these bands of wind and rain that are causing all of this damage, proof that the storm at one point was extremely strong. Also, of course, we can't neglect the damage that we have been seeing in Taiwan. In Taiwan, it's interesting. The mountainous terrain there really helped to bounce the storm away. But in some places of Taiwan, what was predicted to be very minimal impact turned out to be much stronger than thought because the mountains actually moved the path of the storm. And as far as here in China, you know, concern is high. People's -- people are -- people's concern is elevated because as we have seen in recent weeks, the flooding, particularly in central and southern China, has been extremely severe. John, in China we have seen the flooding resulting in more than $10 billion worth of damage and tens of millions of people have been impacted. So the presence of this typhoon obviously is going to be very attention getting.",
