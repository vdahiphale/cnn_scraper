A closer look at the immense damage and the cleanup from Hurricane Milton.A familiar face and a pointed message, Barack Obama headed to campaign trail for Vice President Kamala Harris. Plus, Japanese survivors of the atomic bomb honored with this year's Nobel Peace Prize, their story ahead this hour. Heartbreak and relief this morning in Florida, as millions of residents begin picking up the pieces from Hurricane Milton. The powerful storm responsible for at least 16 deaths, countless lives, of course, forever change. More than 2.5 million customers are still without power at this hour, two days after Milton barreled across the state, water rescues also still ongoing. And the Red Cross says it is working to reunite missing people with loved ones. Officials noting, though this deadly storm could have been even worse. We are expecting President Biden to speak in the coming hours with an update on the federal response. CNN's Isabel Rosales is joining us now live from Florida's Hillsborough County, where you've been covering these ongoing water rescues. Where did things stand this morning?",

Yeah, across the state, there's been over 1000 rescue operations, that's according to Governor Ron DeSantis, with so many personnel spread out across the Sunshine State, here in Hillsborough County.We have brand new video from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office showing a very sensitive operation at an assisted living facility, a one story assisted living facility that suddenly took on water overnight right after Milton passed. Residents told me that water was rushing through their air conditioning units, that refrigerators were floating, and a lot of them they're on medication. They're on oxygen tanks. They're on walkers, using wheelchairs. Many can't even walk. So, it was a scary situation for them, waiting for hours in the cold waters for it to be safe enough outside for deputies to get out and help them. I spoke with them once they were on dry land, many of them barefooted, shivering cold. And thankfully, they were taken over to a nearby elementary school, given blankets, food, water and shelter, but certainly a heartbreaking scene seeing all of these rescues, Erica. And then there's the people who lost it all. They lost their lives over at least 16 people have died because of the storm, six of them alone in St. Lucie County. And over in Orange County, the sheriff's office tells us a man in his 60s died after stepping on apparently downed power lines as he was cleaning up that storm debris. So just terrible to hear these stories, Erica.",

Witnesses telling CNN, an entire four-story building filled with recently displaced people just collapsed.

Now I want to emphasize, when we're looking at these images of central Beirut, of the impact of this. During these last few weeks, as Israel has launched this unprecedented aerial campaign on Lebanon, the focus has been the south of the city, south of the capital, these Hezbollah strongholds. So, for two strikes, which is what happened last night, two strikes to hit the heart of Beirut, causing 22 people to be killed, more than 100 wounded. This will absolutely terrify residents and leave them with the sense that there are no longer any safe places in Beirut. Prime Minister Netanyahu has, of course, vowed to continue to strike. He says he wants to erode Hezbollah's abilities to strike at Israel at any time. It's not the only incident we've seen in Lebanon over the last couple of days. You also have U.N. peacekeeping forces who the U.N. said, were hit directly by Israeli firepower, causing two U.N. peacekeepers to be wounded. The chief of the peacekeeping force there unfold, which has been in place since 2006 says peacekeepers are now in jeopardy. As all of this is playing out on the ground, Secretary of State, Antony Blinken is trying to bring down the temperature. He is hoping, seeking, pushing for a diplomatic solution.

And they travel across Japan and also internationally to deliver their message of nuclear nonproliferation and of peace.And again, because they are all survivors of the atomic bombs, they know firsthand. I mean, they've lived through just how devastating these bombs actually are. They've seen the atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Japan during World War Two, decimating entire neighborhoods, entire towns, people's lives, their families and their livelihoods. So really, they draw from these experience and advocate for a world without these weapons, for a world that is actually peaceful, and for the group to finally win the Nobel Peace Prize after decades of advocacy, is really just a joyous moment for not only the group, but also for Japan, which has made nuclear disarmament a key foreign policy --",

After decades of nuclear anxiety during the Cold War, we're seeing nuclear weapons also cause a lot of unease right now, especially amid the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East.Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned the West that if the United States and its allies get too close or too involved in the war in Ukraine, that it could use nuclear bombs. Israel, meanwhile, which is believed to have nuclear weapons of its own, is trading fire with Iran, another country that is believed to have nuclear capabilities. Even some of Japan's neighbors, like North Korea, for example, are rapidly developing their nuclear arms and their arsenal. So again, the fact that this win comes at a time when there's a lot of global unease about nuclear weapons, and also the fact, again, that this survivor's group is really advocating for that same message, even while a lot of these survivors have died due to old age, is of extreme importance. And some of these survivors are also saying that they hope to see the world completely eliminate their nuclear weapons while some of these survivors are still alive, and they hope to continue to pass on their message generation to generation, even long after they are gone, Erica.",

But when you break that down, her advantage is mostly with Hispanic women, not so much with Hispanic men. There she is evenly split. And even when you look at it holistically, she lags behind where other Democratic nominees have been. So taken together, you can understand why the Harris campaign is trying to double down on their messaging with Latino voters and also be present by having the vice president again go to the West Coast to speak to Latino voters in those states. Last week, she was doing much of the same, and so they are trying to appeal to them, especially on the economy and lowering costs. This has been an issue top of mind for voters across the United States. And so certainly, that is where part of the focus has been, as well as putting out targeted campaigns for Hispanic men, hoping to peel some of those away from Former President Donald Trump. But so far, there is some anxiety within different corners of the party, and also sources that I've spoken with, just because the polls are not really moving it has been deadlocked. So certainly, we'll see more attempts, not only by the vice president, but surrogates, as I mentioned, to try to appeal to those voters and build on the coalition that they saw worked for Joe Biden in 2020.",

He vowed for the first time, to have interest payments on car loans be tax deductible. That is the latest in a series of costly tax cuts that he has been offering. But he argued and suggested, really, that it would help carmakers as well as consumers dealing with high prices. He also said that he wants to revisit his own 2020 trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, and said that he wants to renegotiate it so that Mexico has more tariffs imposed on it for any cars that they are making in their country. But to get back to his criticism of Detroit, at one point, he argued that Detroit is a developing city. He said, quote, it is more developing than most places in China, calling it a once great city. And then he also used the city to characterize what he argued would happen to the rest of the country should Kamala Harris win in November. Take a listen.

The other pot of money that you hear a lot of concern about from the White House and from the administration is at the small business administration, they're responsible for providing low interest loans, not only to small businesses, but to homeowners and renters as well. They only have about $100 million left that's only going to last a few weeks. And the president says that that urgently needs to be replenished. And he actually just yesterday, called on Congress for the first time to come back to Washington to approve that funding. When you talk to Congressional Leaders, they haven't necessarily been open to that idea yet. House Speaker Mike Johnson says that because it will take some time for them to assess the needs on the ground, to actually come up with dollar figure, that it would be OK for them to wait until November 12th, which is when they are scheduled to return to Washington to provide this additional funding. So, you can already start to see that battle brewing. He will come under pressure.

Here in Tyre, there have been no warnings.For 35 years Baha (ph) has run a small clothing shop next door, now in shambles. History is repeating itself she says. A three-storey building fell over our heads during the 1982 Israeli invasion. This ancient city is just 12 miles or 19 kilometers from the border with Israel. Most of the residents have fled north. Those who stayed behind live under constant threat. It was terrifying. The missile hit and it collapsed, says 70-year-old Megdad (ph) describing another Israeli strike that destroyed multiple homes in Tyre's old city. For more than half a century, every generation has witnessed destruction and death. We're used to it says Megdad's neighbor, Yousef (ph), we're used to wars. We've seen wars.

So certainly, in that time, Iran and Russia have grown militarily closer, but also politically closer as well. And certainly, Masoud Pezeshkian now in his first direct meeting with Vladimir Putin, seeming to reflect that as well. One of the things, according to the readout that Masoud Pezeshkian said, is that he said that Russia and Iran need to support each other on the international stage. Now, of course, for the Russians, the Iranians, Erica are also extremely important as far as the military technical sphere is concerned. The U.S. and Ukraine, of course, accusing Iran of giving Russia drones that are used in the war in Ukraine and also short-range ballistic missiles. Iranians continue to deny doing that. However, both Iran and Russia have said that their cooperation does extend to the military technical sphere. And all of us, of course, right now coming as especially here in Iran, where I am right now, the tensions do remain very high, as Iran does brace for what could be, or what the Israelis say will be a very strong response to that missile attack by Iran on Iranian -- on Israeli soil last week. Now, a couple of hours ago, we actually went to the Friday prayers here, which, of course, also are very political here in Iran as well.
