      "sentences": "Happening now, border retribution any minute now, House Republicans try again to strip a top Biden official of his job. But does the GOP have the votes or are they headed for yet another very public failure?Plus, special selection, New Yorkers brave snow and sleet to vote on who replaces disgrace former Congressman George Santos. How they decide they give the country a window into what could happen in November's presidential election. And serious progress in Cairo, Americans tell CNN that the CIA director and Middle East negotiators are moving closer and closer to striking a deal that would pause Israel's war in Gaza and get Israeli hostages home. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We're standing by for a critical vote inside the United States House of Representatives, Republicans planning to try to impeach the Biden Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas. CNN's Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill, is joining us live right now. So, Manu, what do we expect? Do we expect this vote to come up? Do we expect it to pass? MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, I am hearing fresh optimism and confidence from top House Republicans who believe that now they will finally have the votes to make Alejandro Mayorkas just the second cabinet secretary in history to be impeached, charged with high crimes and misdemeanors over their contention that he has failed over the act -- over everything that's happened at the southern border with Mexico, something that Democrats say is an abuse of power by going after the Homeland Security secretary and even some Republicans' opposes. We expect three Republicans to vote against it and that is all they can lose. But right now, I'm hearing from Republicans that they believe that they will have the votes. This is going to hinge in large part over absences because a lot of members are still traveling back to Washington. Some have been impacted by the snowstorm. But the question will be how many absences ultimately will be when the vote happens because that will affect the overall vote total. Because, remember, Wolf, it is a majority of voting members. That's what will determine whether or not the Republicans will have the votes to move forward here. Because last week what we saw was a miscalculation by the Republican leadership who believed that they would have the votes in large part because they expected one Democratic member to not appear because they thought he was going to be absent. Ultimately, he did appear and then that led to the embarrassment over the last several days. Now they have gotten one new member added to the ranks, Steve Scalise, the House majority leader who has been recovering from cancer. And, Wolf, there is an urgency for Republicans to do that given that this New York special election is happening tonight. If Democrats do win that seat, that is one more Democratic vote against impeaching Alejandro Mayorkas, meaning they would not have the votes to move forward here. So, Republicans are trying to push the gas, get this done now and try to move ahead on this historic and very controversial vote. And even if it does pass, we're here tonight, Wolf. It has no chance and the Democratic-led Senate, two-thirds majority, is needed to convict in the Senate control, 51-49 by Democrats. They are expected to quickly move to dismiss this, but one that, in effort that Republicans have been pushing for some time as they try to make the border central to their campaign in 2024.",

So, the border and immigration not breaking necessarily purely for the Republican as you might see in some elections. One last thing, Wolf, again, you can see the snow behind me, one of the Republican super PACs actually paid for snow plows to clear the seats around the election places, but I do have to say after the snow stopped around 1:00 or 2:00 getting around, not a problem at all.

      "sentences": "One of the interesting things that normally would not be on my list is just what John Berman just mentioned though because of the snowstorm. We know that Democrats seem to have a pretty decent advantage in the early voting. Republicans like to vote on Election Day. That's the tradition. You come out and vote on Election Day. Does the weather impact the turnout? And does that somehow benefit the Democrats? So that's an added thing to look for.This is a fascinating district. We should be careful. This will be studied closely and everybody will say, aha, New York 3 has taught us all these lessons about what's going to happen for the rest of the year, maybe, maybe not. But there are some great things to look at. Number one, this is an affluent suburb. Think about the last ten years, very fertile ground for the Democrats. Joe Biden won this district by eight points, right? So, you have a population that's about one and a half percent higher education than the country. More than 55 percent of the people there have a bachelor's degree. It runs -- it's a very affluent district, more than about 1.5 percent, even higher than that, the household median income. These are the places the Democrats have won. So, is New York going to be competitive in the presidential election in November? Most likely not. But it's a district that you find outside of Philadelphia, outside of Milwaukee, outside of Phoenix, outside of Atlanta, you know, people like that. So, that's what people will be studying there. Another thing I would watch, if we talk about the issues, immigration, the Democrats are trying to flip that. There is no doubt a month ago the immigration issue was set to punish the Democrats. But now the Democrats are trying to say, wait, we were ready to do this in the Senate. We had agreement. We would pass this and the Republicans said no. Can they flip it? It's the first test. But can the Democrats flip that issue on the Republicans? One last thing I would note, I always look at the subgroups. About 25 percent of the voters, the residents in this district are Asian- Americans. There are a lot of places around the country. Asian- Americans have emerged, it's probably one of the most underreported political stories the last five or six years, as a giant potent swing vote in this country. This is one of the places where they could make the difference. They, like Latinos, have been trending a little bit back toward Republicans. There's a tug of war there.",

Under the new guidance, people will no longer need to isolate once they've been fever-free for 24 hours and their symptoms are mild and improving.I want to bring in CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner. He's a professor of surgery and medicine at the George Washington University here in Washington, D.C. He's also a cardiologist. Dr. Reiner, what do you think about this new guidance coming out from the CDC? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: I think it's a bit unwise. We've moved on in this country in terms of our experience with COVID but COVID hasn't left this country. And, in fact, COVID is really everywhere. There were hundreds of thousands of cases last week, 20,000 people hospitalized, 2,500 deaths. So, COVID still impacts this country in a very meaningful and sometimes tragic way. But the country has tired of it. And we've become bored with it. And maybe politically, it's now sort of unwise to keep focusing on COVID. But the intent of these new proposed guidelines are basically to say, once you're feeling a little better, you can go back to work. Now, the problem with that is that when you go back to work, you may be exposing colleagues and other people whose risk might be different than yours to an unwanted virus. And with these new proposed guidelines, you just need to be afebrile, so your temperature has to go away, and you need to be feeling a little better. But that doesn't mean you won't be coughing and this virus remains transmissible for several days. So, if you go back to work on day two or day three, and your coworker in the next cubicle is getting treated with chemotherapy and is immunosuppressed, and you're there coughing because the guidance says, well, I feel a little better, my fever is away, so I went back to work, that seems unwise to me.",
