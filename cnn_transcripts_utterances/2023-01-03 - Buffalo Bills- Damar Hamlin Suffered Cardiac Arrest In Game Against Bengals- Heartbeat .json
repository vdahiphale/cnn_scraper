I mean, one is that they felt and expressed to us that the emergency plan that was put in place on the field, the way that the response was so efficiently conducted, the CPR.And we've heard a defibrillator was used even though we're waiting for confirmation that, that was, in fact used, you know, that, that really was executed well. And that's a credit to the league and the repetition, the practice, the access, to the tools that they need, the staff that's in place to make these decisions to help these players in a way that may not have been done a couple of decades ago. I mean, when seconds matter, according to our medical experts, which I am not. But, you know, it seems to be that every second here was crucial. And so, to see, you know, the league have a protocol in place that was executed the way that it did was great, but you know, I think, over the next couple of days, maybe the next couple of weeks, we're going to analyze why did it take so long to call this game, and included there's a lot at stake, the NFL is managing a lot. But right now, the focus is on a young man, in Damar Hamlin, who many people describe as kind, funny, caring, loving, we've talked a lot about the toy drive in his community that he's passionate about. At the beginning of the night, around the time of this incident, there was about $12,000 being donated. Now, that's upwards of 3 million and beyond. I mean, people around the country are identifying him as a person and wanting to reach out and do anything they can to show support, which I think is just wonderful as we remember that at the end of the day, this is very much about his health.",

And that is the real important factor for survive -- for survivability. And also, coming back to a normal life is how quickly after the event happens, that CPR get instituted. Sounds like it was within moment. The next critical thing is restoring normal circulation with the defibrillator. It sounds like it may have just been minutes that, that happened. Those are critical factors in getting his physiology back. Now, unfortunately, when you go down like that, you're having what's called brain anoxia, or no oxygen to the brain. Similar to when a child falls in the pool, for example. And that scenario, it is really seconds that matter. How long was the brain deprived of oxygen? It sounds like he was on the field for 10 or 15 minutes before they took them in the ambulance. And we didn't really get a good visual what was happening, but you have to imagine that CPR was started, they defibrillator him, and they were giving him oxygen.

And it's intentionally slow to make sure that they don't reinjure whatever injury occurred at the moment.But this was something totally different. This was performing a life saving measure on one of the players on the field, which is why you saw the reaction from those guys. We see these injuries, these -- just injuries, in general a lot. But the reactions were not the same. And we couldn't really tell at home what was going on. But me seeing the players reaction led me to believe that this was something that was unprecedented that had never happened before, just by looking at the players reactions and that -- and that can tell you, you know, by them performing the CPR on him, something devastating, which is why you saw the reaction from players on both teams.

Whenever the body suffers a cardiac arrest and CPR is instituted, you want to really get that body to relax.And the intubation was probably just really prophylactic because they needed to control his breathing. They wanted to control the body's physiology. And that's why they intubated him. That's why they sedated him. Now, they will slowly start weaning off that sedation to see how his body responds, to see if he's breathing. We -- the term we use is, is he breathing over the ventilator? Is he -- does he have his normal breathing dried back? That's what we're going to be watching very carefully this time. I am sure they are doing CAT scans of his cervical spine as well as his chest. Remember, this is all speculative. And we are -- we are presuming that he had a cardiac event secondary to the anterior chest trauma, but we wouldn't rule out the possibility of a cervical spinal injury. Also, he was hit pretty hard. It's less likely, but I'm sure they're scanning him. And then also another modality is what we call therapeutic hypothermia. That means that we have a device that we lower the body's core temperature to help preserve the brain and its ability to come back. Again, it's really going to be dependent upon how much anoxia or lack of oxygen his brain suffered.",

And they were able to get him to better care quickly, as quickly as they could. He had a police escort, take him in the ambulance. So, he got up there pretty quickly.

They -- well, I was in the tunnel close to the locker room when the game was called. But for the hour before then, it was just sitting in silence, absolute silence for the fans. And that stadium was absolutely sold out. So, there was a ton of fans there. And you could just tell everybody, whether you're a Bengals fan or a Bills fan, it was just absolutely speechless.And it took the NFL and the teams a little bit to figure out what they were going to do. That was another piece of information that it was up to the team. It was up to Bengals head coach Zac Taylor and Sean McDermott and the players. They were sent to the locker rooms to kind of debrief and the team came together and realized that they weren't going to be able to play this game with the emotions and the players and everything involved. So, they then notified the league and said, we're going to postpone this game. So, I thought that's an important piece to know, because everybody just assumed that the NFL makes the call.

We've heard from LeBron James, many players in the NBA that have held postgame press conferences have stopped to offer their thoughts and prayers. We've seen it all over Twitter, and what was really touching and also to me what was really one of the first signs of the potential severity of this is when you saw all the Bengals players react, both sides of the field clearing their benches. Joe Burrow going over to Josh Allen, consoling him.And there's a still image that's just really chilling and startling, both of the quarterbacks kind of staring into the abyss in the immediate aftermath of this incident. And you could tell how upset they were, how devastated they were. And to hear that Zac Taylor, the Bengals head coach, you know, made a trip to the hospital, that was widely reported and now confirmed by us that, you know, that Stefon Diggs was there, the Bills receiver who was among the players trying to rally his teammates, when it was thought that maybe they might have to go back out on the field and play. But to your point, I mean, athletes are tied to one another through what they do.

And now, you fast forward to this moment, happening right here and right now here in Cincinnati, it's kind of ironic that it both happened inside the same stadium. But you mentioned it, the head injuries, again, those are things that we see on a football field. It's a violent sport, the guys know what they sign up for. We see sometimes broken bones, knee injuries, spinal injuries, those are serious things, they happen. We don't see things like this happen. I can tell you, John, I've never seen medical staffs react with thekind of urgency that I saw tonight, when they ran out of the field. I don't know if you showed the video of when Damar stood up and then collapsed back to the ground. You can see the players immediately motioning to both of their benches to get as many medical staff members out to the field as soon as possible. And they rushed out there, and they were opening up the equipment with the kind of urgency I've never seen before for somebody on a football field. And within 30 seconds, the stretcher was on the way out. And also, a back support in case that was the issue. And then, within a couple of minutes, the ambulance was out there. So, all of that is very unique, things we haven't seen before.

We had a preseason game coming up in a couple of days. And so, this situation is completely different, obviously, for a number of reasons.But it's the only thing that I can relate it back to. And I know that the players didn't want to play, we weren't in the right mindset to play. Especially a preseason game, we just weren't in the right mindset. A lot of guys wanted to make sure that their families were OK, they wanted to make sure that the people in New Orleans were OK, and wanted to go back and even help any way we could, kind of like the guys in New York did during 9/11, and immediately after 9/11.
