With the once indicted twice impeached, one term president said to be arraigned in your courtroom.Moments before the blast, which could a pro-war Russian blogger who was handed a small statue of his likeness, possibly packed with explosives, and not appropriate Madame secretary the dressing down of a junior French minister for a Playboy magazine cover. In the coming hours, Donald Trump will once again make history for all the wrong reasons when he appears at a New York courtroom to be the first current or former U.S. president to face criminal charges. The judge has denied a request by media outlets including CNN for the arraignment to be broadcast live, but we'll allow five photographers to take still pictures before the proceedings begin. Right now Trump is at his residence in the Trump Tower. Aide say he's been huddling with legal and political advisors. He is not expected to speak publicly while in New York instead, he will deliver remarks on his return to Mar-a-Lago in Florida Tuesday night. Trump's attorneys have argued the former president is unlikely to get a fair trial in New York City. They've also publicly said they will not make a plea deal. Trump's supporters gathered near his Mar-a-Lago resort Monday to cheer the former president who has urged his supporters to protest. Security has now been ramped up by the New York City Police Department of the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and the Secret Service ahead of the arraignment in lower Manhattan. Well, a new CNN poll finds 60 percent of Americans approve of Trump's indictment. More than three and four people believe politics played a role in the decision by the Manhattan DA. 37 percent believe Trump's alleged payment of hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels was illegal. 33 percent say unethical but not illegal. 10 percent say not wrong at all. More now from CNN's chief U.S. National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Donald Trump has seen it all and done it all including run for the White House from here in Trump Tower in New York. But on Tuesday morning, he does something new faces a judge for an indictment and an arraignment in a felony case here in New York City for an old hush money case involving Stormy Daniels. Of course this was litigated during his first presidential run back in 2016. But now the Manhattan district attorney has brought this up again and a grand jury last week indicted the former president. So this will all come to a head really the first time and an historic moment where a former American president faces an arraignment in a criminal court. I'm told that the former president was huddling with his advisors as after he arrived here in New York City after flying up for Mar-a-Lago on Monday, meeting with his lawyers and his political team as well. He is not expected to speak on Tuesday here in New York. He's going to save his remarks I'm told for on Tuesday evening at Mar-a-Lago when he plans to deliver a full throated defense of this case as well as other cases of before him. But now this legal case is front and center in the 2024 presidential race. It is essentially brought this early stages of the campaign to a halt. He's raised some $7 million in the last few days alone with his supporters, coming to his defense. Even his rivals have been standing on the sidelines essentially defending him and watching this case unfold. But there is no doubt on Tuesday morning when the former President arrives at the district attorney's office and later goes into a courtroom. He is facing an uncharted territory, something he has never done before and his long years of entertainment and political life here. He's standing in front of a courtroom in which she has very little controller. Jeff Zeleny CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

China has no say in this matter. Earlier, Kevin McCarthy's office issued a statement also confirming the bipartisan meeting with Tsai. It will be held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library just outside Los Angeles. McCarthy will be the highest ranking U.S. official to meet a Taiwanese leader on American soil. This meeting, John, was long anticipated and obviously is guaranteed to further inflame the fractured relationship between the United States and China. Beijing has already threatened to quote resolutely fight back if this meeting takes place. Now as you mentioned, John, Tsai has been in Central America for an official visit in Guatemala and Belize and yesterday while addressing the National Assembly in Belize, she said her country is facing, quote, expansionist threats from authoritarian regimes. She's obviously referring to China. Let's have a listen to some of that speech.

Interestingly, John, the White House has declined to weigh in on this meeting a bit. As you mentioned, Nancy Pelosi, the former U.S. speaker when she visited Taiwan last year, China responded firing a ballistic missiles over Taiwan, deploying warships in the Taiwan Straits and conducting a simulated blockade of the island.

One is the capability of the Chinese to be able to deploy and capture information and means that there's potentially information that has to be modified, changed, moved, whatever it is that they capture, so that it can be continually can be used, but will be protected in the future. But I think it goes to another point that not many people are talking about. Remember, in the days that follow, we were essentially shooting anything out of the sky, none of them turned out to be balloons. But I -- this goes to why the Biden administration was so forward leaning, and maybe even too forward leaning, in shooting down the potential for -- the likelihood that there might have been other balloons.

But it's the hovering that can give you things like depth, distance, so real life distance it is -- it's sort of like having a drone with pictures. But you're able to hover over the facility.So let's assume some critical infrastructure and take in depth photos and potentially also audio so they could pick up what are there pinging sounds, are their alarm sounds going off, other pieces of information that might be relevant to the Chinese as they get an overall picture of our critical infrastructure, what we might have on the ground. And remember, this is not like they just have the balloon. They have the balloon, they have satellites, they have spies, they have signal intelligence, they have all sorts of different pieces of intelligence gathering.

But at this point what we should be looking at is the fact that a group of ordinary Americans, a majority of them, voted to indict a man who at one point was the most powerful man in the world. I think that's a sign of a healthy judicial system. There is that one argument that absolutely but what plays out in the coming hours, maybe unprecedented for Americans in many ways, but there is reporting by the Axios Web site, which notes that leaders who left office since 2000 have been jailed or prosecuted in at least 78 countries, including democracies like France, Israel and South Korea.
