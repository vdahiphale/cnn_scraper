It prompted a brief evacuation of the White House complex, a hazmat team with the city of Washington, D.C. came in, deemed the substance nonhazardous. But two sources familiar with the matter say that powdery substance tested positive for cocaine.Now, that was done via a field test, which is sometimes inconclusive. And it has been sent out for further testing and evaluation. Now, a Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, he says that this powdery substance was found in a work space within the West Wing. President Biden, for his part, he was not at the White House when this took place. Now, we should note on the weekends here at the White House, there are often tour groups that go through the West Wing of the White House. So, it's certainly possible, that that is how that baggy of cocaine apparently should be confirmed, made his way into the West Wing. That being said, the Secret Service is conducting an ongoing investigation into the matter to determine exactly how that substance made its way on to the White House grounds.
