And this lashing out against the judicial system where he is facing indictments in four different upcoming cases. And this message in particular was focused more generally at the, quote, \"prosecutors and judges that are doing everything possible\" that he said to interfere with the presidential election. Those are his words. Obviously, they would argue that is not the case here. And in that post he went on to attack Jack Smith, as you said, Fani Willis, the DA in Fulton County, Georgia. And this comes after a week where we saw the former president repeatedly attack several other individuals who are involved in overseeing these cases, and some other family members. As you mentioned, the daughter of one of the judges overseeing the trial that is set to begin, that will determine whether he made illegal hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. And the timing of this is coming just as the legal calendar is hitting a critical juncture for Trump. On - let me go through some of these dates for you because it really - they are stacking up. Thursday is the deadline for Trump to secure a $175 million bond in the case over - involving his business empire in New York. On April 15th, that New York hush money trial begins also in New York. And on April 25th, the Supreme Court of the United States will hear arguments that will determine the breadth of presidential immunity. Of course, Trump is arguing that he has blanket immunity while he is president and cannot be charged for what he did while in office. So, all these legal cases are starting to hit a head and we are seeing Trump attack the judges, the prosecutors, the judicial system at large at this critical juncture, John.",

Here's what Joe Biden said in his Easter message, and I'm quoting our president here. He said, I'm sending warmest wishes to Christians around the world. Gee, does he need to really tone that down? Is that really hateful?The Republicans are in a terrible spot here. It's actually the opposite. Isaac's report is very important, right? Joe Biden has the opposite problem. He's got a problem with his base. And he seems to be addressing it. But let's see if he can get black voters back and young voters back. Huge problem in Biden's base. Trump has no problem with his base. In fact, his problem is the base because the things he does that fire up that base, like hawking, God forbid, a King James Bible for $69 when you can buy it for $6.29 on Amazon, the rest goes to Mr. Trump apparently, those things alienate the voters Trump needs in order to win. You know, he lost 25 percent of the Republican vote in Kansas, 25 percent of the Republican vote in the primary in Arizona when he was unopposed. He lost 19 percent of the primary vote in Florida, his home state, where he's unopposed. So, he's got this huge problem with swing voters and moderates. Biden has a problem with his base, but at least Biden's addressing his. I think Trump is making his problem worse.",

I question the wisdom of that, but, hey, I guess he's allowed to do whatever. So, I - but I - you know, look, we're going to have another cycle like we've had before.

They should be and are very concerned about declining enthusiasm among young people. And they're working on it. See, that makes sense to me. A politician has a problem. A politician's working on the problem.Mr. Trump's problem is that he is alienating those voters he needs. He should be putting Nikki Haley on the ticket, not demonizing her and attacking her supporters. By the way, meanwhile, Democrats are reaching out to Haley supporters and Haley donors to try to bring them into the tent. You know, it is, I guess, because it's the day after Easter, there's two kind of churches, ones that hunt down heretics and others that welcome in converts, right?
