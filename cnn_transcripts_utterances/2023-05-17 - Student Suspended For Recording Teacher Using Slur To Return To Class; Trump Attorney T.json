He's reporting that a 50 percent drop in encounters over the past two days compared to last week. That's what they're seeing. You're hearing Alejandro Mayorkas also reiterate what they're seeing more broadly. Joining us now is former U.S. congressman Will Hurd.

The fact that the economy is as bad as it is but there are still so many industries that need workers, let's do that. And that bill is sitting on the table and can be brought up.
