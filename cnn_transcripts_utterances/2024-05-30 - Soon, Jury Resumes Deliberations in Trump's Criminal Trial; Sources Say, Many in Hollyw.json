The jury, which has been deliberating for more than four hours, has asked to be read key pieces of testimony, testimony that was a focus of the closing arguments from the prosecution, testimony largely from David Pecker, the man who published the National Enquirer, including his direct conversations with Donald Trump about the catch and kill scheme to bury damaging news prior to the 2016 election.Could this mean the jury is looking beyond the testimony of Michael Cohen, who the defense painted as a serial liar? It is impossible to know for sure. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to an adult film actress, all to influence the 2016 election. Now, the jury also asked for their instructions from the judge to be read once again. They will all be back in court again this morning. CNN's Brynn Gingras, she is already there. It's going to be an interesting morning, Brynn.",

Listen, two notes, two requests from the jurors, and this is where we start when court resumes at 9Now, remember this, during those closing arguments, the prosecution highlighted David Pecker's testimony saying that that should be a focus for the jurors, calling it utterly devastating. So, very interesting that they want to hear some of this testimony a read-back. Their second request, as you just said, hearing back some of the jury instructions are all of it. We're not quite clear. We'll know more one court resumes. That's 55 pages of jury instructions. It took a little over an hour yesterday. Remember, they don't get a copy of that when they go back into the deliberation room. So, we'll see how long it will take for all of this testimony and the jury instructions to be read back to jurors. Apparently the testimony will take about a half an hour or so they predict. So that's where we begin today, another day of deliberations for these jurors. They were behind closed doors for about four and a half hours or so, and they'll continue that at some point later this morning. Guys?",

JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  So, Kate, good morning, good morning, John. It's concerning if you're in the defense chair for a variety of reasons, right? Let's go back to closing arguments and Brynn's point in terms of what she said, the prosecution said. This is damning testimony. Have a listen. They're focused on that closing arguments and not evidence, but you bring the jury to the critical evidence you want them to consider. To me, this is about the big picture. Yes, you can parse the specifics of the three Pecker interactions and, of course, Michael Cohen, that's critical to, get to that in a minute. But the reality is, if you're talking about my theory from the prosecution's perspective, conspiracy and cover-up. [07:03] Well, what happens with a conspiracy? People talk, people meet. They meet about something. About what? About catching and killing a story, not in and of itself illegal, but when matched to other critical information, such as a campaign, such as money that's paid to hush that, such as reimbursements, right, or legal fees or retainer fees, right, that's factual consideration --",

Because the jurors are not -- well, there's two lawyers on them, but the two lawyers on the jury shouldn't be the ones influencing the province of the judges to instruct the jury. You have a legal question. You come to me and I will speak to you to the issues of legality.Now, in terms of what's important, what's important is the reading of the issue concerning why we're here and how you become guilty. What am I talking about? There's this thing called falsification of business records, which in and of itself is simply a misdemeanor, still a crime, but punishable by up to a year and a petty crime. But you have to make a leap with respect to getting to the felony. How do you make that leap? I think they need clarity with respect to that. We get if there's ledgers falsified, invoices falsified, checks falsified. But then how do we get to the leap of this other issue with respect to finding him guilty of the felony, the concealment of another crime? And if we find he concealed another crime, how do we get there? Last point, there's the issue relating to unlawfulness. That's the whole tweet, right, right wing conspiracy, oh, you don't have to find unanimous. The jury always has to be unanimous. However, there's one issue that's critical, and that relates to if you found he ultimately falsified the business records, and then there was concealment to the business records, right? Concealing what other crime? New York State campaign finance crime, right, that talks about these three prongs. If you found that he got there from unlawful means, whether that is because of a federal violation, whether that's because of a tax violation, whether that's because of the issue ultimately of falsification of records, right, you can find him guilty, even if the jury is not in accord on the specific unlawful means he got there.

The fact that they're looking for Michael Cohen's testimony means he's not disregarded. They want to know what he has to say.Now, you could say they're comparing that to Pecker's part, right, because they want to know what he says happened in the Trump meeting versus what Cohen says, what Pecker said, but if I'm disregarding Cohen, I don't care about anything, he says.

One is threats from ISIS- K. This is a highly capable external operations terrorist group that operates out of the Pakistani-Afghan border. But they are also the group that organized the attack in Moscow against a shopping mall, a devastating attack, the attack on General Soleimani's memorial service, which killed dozens of people in Iran. So, we know the capability. What you have to sort out is an external operations terrorist group isn't going to telegraph with big advertisements, a secret operation to strike a target in another country. On the other hand, they do have the flip side of their coin, which is they inspire the lone wolf terrorists. And that is probably what we're seeing here, an attempt to inspire people on U.S. soil to do something. Now, Nassau County P.D. came out with a 40-page threat assessment in advance of these games going over. Because remember, it's every team, every country, and visitors from those countries, what the threat is between the particular countries involved in a game, the threats for each countries. But the FBI and their bulletin, which came out yesterday, says specifically, homegrown violent extremists and lone offenders are of particular concern due to their ability to remain undetected until operational, which basically means when the person is acting on their own, there's no conspiracy, not a lot of communications, that's a real vulnerability for intelligence.",
