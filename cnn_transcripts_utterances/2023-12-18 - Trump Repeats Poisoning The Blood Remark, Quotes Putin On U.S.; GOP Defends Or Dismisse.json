Trump keeps gaining every week.And for the first time that I've ever done this publicly, if the election were held today, Donald Trump beats Joe Biden. So, we have to start to ask why and what does that mean for America? And I was debating because I'm about to go on holiday. I want to get away from this. It is a fear that we saw in 2015-2016, a fear of the economy, a fear of society, a fear of culture, I'm not justifying it, I'm only trying to explain it, where people feel ignored, forgotten, betrayed, left behind, you choose. And that fear is back again. Inflation has made it worse where our incomes have gone up 5 percent a year and inflation has gone up 8 or 9 percent, and people are really suffering struggling, food, fuel, housing, healthcare.
