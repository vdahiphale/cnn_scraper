      "sentences": "It is known that Yahya Sinwar is the main leader. He is the one who Israel believes is currently hiding in the tunnels below Gaza. And he is really the one that is believed to have the final say when it comes to this potential hostage deal.But we have seen Ismail Haniyeh playing a key interlocutor role, really, when it comes to these talks. And what we had been seeing in recent weeks was potentially a willingness by this individual to push this deal forward. He had shown a willingness to reach a deal if Israel would agree to pull its troops completely out of Gaza. That was one of the things he had been saying in recent weeks. The understanding we have is that, from Yahya Sinwar's point of view, there is a more hardline position being taken. So certainly there is a concern by many that this now, at least in the short term, has put these talks on hold as one of the key mediators on the, or at least I should say interlocutors on the Hamas side, has now been assassinated. It is understood, but there is also a concern that this now leaves a more hardline response from Hamas. I mean, we have seen many of the other leaders today give the expected fiery statements in response to this killing, Hamas's Sami Abu Zuhri, for example, calling it a grave escalation. The moment of truth has come, another leader saying that this will not pass in vain. Of course, it's a big question as to how Hamas could respond to this. It has been severely weakened during this war in Gaza since the October 7th attacks by Hamas in Israel. But we have also seen the Palestinian Authority president, for example, Mahmoud Abbas, condemning what has happened, saying, quote, he strongly condemned the assassination of the head of the Hamas movement, calling him the great leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and considered it a cowardly act and a dangerous development. Now, we have seen from other leaders in the region as well condemnation of this particular killing. But it does raise the question as to, going forward, if Israel does want to continue, as one would assume, to have these negotiations on a potential ceasefire, hostage deal, who would they then be talking to? As we know, Yahya Sinwar believed hold-up underground in Gaza has a far more hardline approach to these talks than Ismail Haniyeh did. MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR: OK. Paula, thank you. I've got a question about, you know, we've got this response from Israel saying they haven't denied it, they've said they don't comment on foreign media reports. But is that quite common?",

This may well be another one of those situations.And it obviously comes at a very inconvenient time for President Biden and his team. They were trying to advance the ball towards some sort of ceasefire agreement.

Worried about this region being pushed towards a regional confrontation since October, right?And it feels that every few weeks we are here talking about another escalation, unprecedented escalation, and here we are again. And it's not just the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. It is what's happened over the past 24 hours when you're talking about two targeted attacks taking place in two different capitals. Which a lot of people in the region are looking at this and seeing this as, again, of course, the Israelis have not yet taken credit for or claimed the assassination of Haniyeh, but they are looking at this as an attempt to try and push for further escalation in the region.
