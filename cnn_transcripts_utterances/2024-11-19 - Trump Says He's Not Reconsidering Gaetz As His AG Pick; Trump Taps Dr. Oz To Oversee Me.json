COLLINSI mean, these are some of these nominees who four years ago or eight years ago, Anderson, would not have had an easy confirmation process. I mean, Trump making his personal attorney, naming him as the deputy attorney general would have been considered controversial a few months ago or a few weeks ago. But now, given how these dynamics have shaken out, he has shifted the spectrum here and where these senators are operating from and what they're looking at. With Mehmet Oz, of course, he ran for Senate unsuccessfully in 2022, but he is being tapped to lead a very powerful agency and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. I mean, it insures about 150 million Americans and it operates under the tent of HHS, which of course, Trump has nominated RFK, Jr. to run. So if both of those individuals get confirmed, they would be leading figures within that department. And I think that is going to be how you're seeing senators look at this. Because they are deeply familiar with Mehmet Oz, not just because he tried to join that body a few years ago, but he was actually called to a Senate panel about a decade ago, Anderson, where he was grilled by senators on his promotion of weight loss drugs that were not proven to work using his TV personality. And so, they're looking at all of that right now. But, Anderson, its moving very quickly here as they're trying to finish these other positions. I should note JD Vance has confirmed last night he and Trump were looking and interviewing potential candidates to be the FBI director. That is the clearest signal yet that Trump plans to fire Chris Wray, who still has three years left of his ten-year term, that Trump appointed him to.",

It's interesting to me that three of Trumps top three picks have sexual misconduct allegations against them. You know, as an advocate for women and girls on these issues and on behalf of so many women, we find it highly offensive that that's not an automatic disqualifier off the bat. And the idea that that can just be brushed aside and never mentioned, and that Matt Gaetz is going to be a hammer for justice. Well that's why releasing this report is so important. There are survivors of sexual misconduct in Congress. So I'm hoping that they have a conscience along with other people. You know, you have Senators Grassley and Cornyn, Republicans on Senate Judiciary, which is responsible for investigating these appointees or nominations, they're asking for the House Ethics report to be released and if it's not tomorrow, look, there are other ways this could happen.

CMS oversees both as well as the Affordable Health Care Act Marketplaces. Now, in the first Trump administration, Dr. Oz served on the president's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. He has no experience running a large government or private organization.

U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Ukraine for the first time launched U.S.-made longer-range missiles into Russia days after President Biden gave the green light.The missiles have a range of almost 200 miles. Russia said Ukraine fired six ballistic missiles. Both countries gave conflicting assessments as to the damage. The attack came as Vladimir Putin sent an unmistakable warning to the West about the bar for using nuclear weapons. Fred Pleitgen has more. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): After firing half a dozen U.S. supplied ATACMS missiles deep into Russia overnight, Ukraine's president was coy when asked about the strikes. We now have ATACMS and we will use them, he said. Moscow up in arms, claiming Ukraine targeted military installations in Southwestern Russia overnight. The foreign minister ripping into the Biden administration. The fact that ATACMS were used repeatedly tonight in the Bryansk region is of course a signal that they want escalation, and it's impossible to use these high tech missiles without the Americans. And Putin has spoken about this many times. And now Putin has reacted breaking news on Kremlin control TV after the Russian president signed an order changing the country's nuclear doctrine. The use of Western missiles for strikes into the strategic depths of Russia means direct involvement of NATO in the war, the host says. And now, Moscow's hands are untied. Among the changes, the Russians now consider attacks by non-nuclear nations, like Ukraine, with the help of nuclear nations, like the U.S., worthy of a nuclear response, at least on paper. PLEITGEN: The spokesman for the Kremlin says the reason why the Russians decided to update their nuclear doctrine is so potential adversaries of Russia know that retaliation will be inevitable if Russia is attacked. (through translation): We're with American channel CNN. Can we? OK? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): OK. PLEITGEN (through translation): This morning, your president, Vladimir Putin, signed an update to Russia's nuclear doctrine. What do you think about it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): What is there to think about? What kind of response can there be? Only this kind.

In fact, they say that rhetoric around all this has been building up over the past couple of weeks.
