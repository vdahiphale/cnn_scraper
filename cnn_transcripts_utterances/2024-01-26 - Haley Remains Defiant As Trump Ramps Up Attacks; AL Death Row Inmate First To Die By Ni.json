She's talking about Donald Trump here.She says, \"Then he goes and encourages the members of the RNC and tries to push them into saying that he is the nominee in the race.\" They got so much pushback that he had to backtrack from it. She says he's totally unhinged. That, in a new interview just conducted by Nikki Haley. He's totally unhinged. Now, those comments make me think about a new column that Kate made me read in The Wall Street Journal this morning. It's from Peggy Noonan. It's titled, Nikki Haley should go for broke. She quotes a Republican speechwriter saying, \"There's only one subject now and it's Mr. Trump. Go at him, make it new. Feel the freedom of your situation. There was something glorious about a last stand. He can no longer hurt you. Pick up the sword. You don't have to give Shakespeare's band-of-brothers speech but live it.\" With us now. CNN political commentator and former South Carolina State Representative Bakari Sellers and Republican strategist, Rina Shah. You will both forgive me. Bakari has been through this before. But this column and this news made me think about the possibility of a multiple-choice quiz on the events in South Carolina. So, this is what I want to ask about Nikki Haley down there. Here's the question. The question is Nikki Haley is staying in the race because A., she thinks she has a nonzero chance of winning. B., she wants to hurt Trump. C., she is positioning for something else. D., she still has money. So, why not, Bakari?",

But second, Nikki doesn't necessarily have the self-awareness of most. And I think this is more of a vanity project than anything else.I will say I love it because what she's doing is fracturing the Republican Party and damaging Donald Trump for the future. I think Democrats and Republicans both acknowledge that. But this is turned into a vanity project because she cannot win this nomination.",

So, when you've got the combination of money, desire, stamina, you're going to take it right to him. And I see her getting more and more comfortable. And if I were advising her campaign, I'd say it's time. It's time to go for the jugular. Again, like Peggy Noonan said, nothing to lose here. This is a matter of how you want to see the future of this party. How you want to see the country talk about the issues? She was responsible in talking about the kitchen table issues this entire past fall. That is what brought her all this support that she was not expecting when you talk about the Koch brothers, Jamie Dimon, Reid Hoffman. People arrived at her doorstep, why? On the basis of merit. And I think look, she's made a few missteps here and there, but she understands. This is the fight for the soul of the Republican Party, and she's ready for it.",
