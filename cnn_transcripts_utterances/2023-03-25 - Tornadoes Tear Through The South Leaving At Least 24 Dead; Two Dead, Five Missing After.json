It's going to go out and they're going to survey a lot of these tornadoes to not only determine was it one or was it multiple, but also the intensity. What was it? Was it an EF zero, up to an EF 5? Because there's a lot of different varying degrees of tornadoes.And one of the possibilities for this particular storm was, in fact, an EF 4 -- what we refer to as a violent tornado. So the things that the weather service are going to look for, and we've seen a lot of the video already so far. they're going to look for well constructed and whole frame houses just leveled down to the foundation, down to the slabs; cars and other objects thrown almost being used as though they were small projectiles going pretty far distances. And again when you look at some of the video that's been coming in, specifically from Rolling Forks, Mississippi you are -- you're seeing some of those car parts up in trees tossed around like they were just marbles or small balls. Again, when you look at the houses, a lot of these structures are completely flattened from what they were just 24 hours ago. In addition to that, the survey crews are also going to try to determine whether it was one tornado, several tornadoes. Because if you look at where all the warnings were in the last 24 hours, you can see a very clear line here that stretches from Rolling Fork all the way up to just south of Huntsville. They'll try to determine was that in fact, one single tornado that stretched 60, 70 even 100 plus miles, or was it broken up into several different tornadoes? All of these things are going to be taken into account today by the National Weather Service crews when they go out to survey the damage. One thing to note, though, it's not over just yet. There are the rest of this system, albeit weaker than it was yesterday is still ongoing. You still have some strong thunderstorms. Severe thunderstorm warning valid right now across the Georgia-Alabama state line. We've had numerous tornado warnings as well throughout the morning. That threat is still possible across the southeast for today. And also Fred into tomorrow that front becomes stationary. So keep in mind some of these same areas may be going through some more severe thunderstorms tomorrow again.",

And look, what it means is that some top officials from the Trump administration and some of Trump's closest aides from that time are going to have to come in and testify before the grand jury. Now this was obviously topped by former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. And Mark Meadows, more than anyone maybe, can give the grand jury a sense of what was Trump's state of mind as this -- as these events are playing out, and as he was pushing to overturn the election. They also want to ask these witnesses about Trump's state of mind when it comes to these voter fraud claims that he was pushing at the time. They want to know and establish if Trump actually believed the false claims that he was pushing. We know from this list of people that there were individuals in his administration who were telling him repeatedly that there were -- there was no such thing as foreign interference that changed the outcome of the election. Robert O'Brien, for example, already told the January 6th committee just that. So, you know a significant moment in this investigation, and now the grand jury will likely hear from several top officials who are around Trump at that moment. Now Trump's legal team is probably going to appeal this but -- so we'll see how that plays out. But at the end of the day, it likely means the grand jury will hear testimony from these witnesses.",

So from the public evidence it would seem to me that this is among the weaker cases of all the cases that Trump faces and what comes to mind when I think about this case is the prosecution they've brought a long time ago against John Edwards, the senator from North Carolina who ran for president. Remember he was prosecuted for campaign finance violations, money secretly sent through to his paramour, and the jury failed to convict him, and then the government dropped the cases. And I think that is similar to what we have here which is these types of cases generally, in my view, are settled civilly. That's what happened in the Hillary Clinton campaign when the moneys for the purchase of the Steele dossier were funneled through a law firm. Her law -- her campaign paid the FEC a big fine.

That's according to the commander of Central Command General Erik Kurilla, who spoke to lawmakers on Thursday. REP. DON BACON (R-NE): Can you give us a feel for how often you're being attacked? GEN. MICHAEL \"ERIK\" KURILLA, COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: There has been a number since one January, 2021. The number is about 78 times that we have been attacked. BERTRAND: The U.S. maintains about 900 troops in Syria as part of the anti ISIS coalition, but Iran also has proxies in the country who are fighting Syrian rebel groups on behalf of Syria's President Bashar al Assad. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: They want to make sure that the U.S. and allied forces don't forget that they're there.

The U.S. has said that it does reserve the right to retaliate in order to protect U.S. personnel in the region, but they have also said they do not want a war or an escalation of this conflict with Iran, so it's going to be a very difficult balance for the U.S. to strike.

The governor in 2021 also said there should be a voluntary reduction of 15 percent in the amount of water that we use. That is also being rolled back. And it's because the recent storms have left us with records amount of snow pack that reservoirs are nearly full and the water is flowing even here in Los Angeles. I mean, this is the L.A. River and it's not normally flowing the way it is right now, and that's because we're coming from the three-year period that has been the driest in California history. So when Governor Gavin Newsom was asked is California out of the drought, his answer was, it's complicated because there are certain parts of California that are still in a drought condition where water is still desperately needed but most of the state is out of the drought. Here is what the governor said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): So we talk about weather whiplash, we talk about extremes. It is incumbent upon us to recognize that and to recognize that the conditions have radically changed throughout the state.

So one could say that California is learning and trying to figure out how to deal with the very dry years and the very wet years. You're seeing a lot of it back and forth with state leaders who are just trying to figure out exactly what to do with this.
