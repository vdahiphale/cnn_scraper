So the most important thing you can do is delay the age at which you give your child a smartphone until high school and delay social media until 16.And while these sound hard, if you're listening at home, these sound hard to do because your child's going to say, but then I'm the only one.

It's going to impose significant fines on platforms for systemic fails to police the age of their users.Now, like Jonathan Haidt, I really enjoyed my conversation with Secretary Hillary Clinton regarding her latest memoir, \"Something Lost, Something Gained, Reflections on Life, Love and Liberty.\" The part of her book that most impacted me had nothing to do with foreign policy or her run for the presidency. Instead, it was her reflection on her own upbringing in comparison to the challenges faced by our youth today. And I'll bet it seemed odd to some who watched the interview. But what I most wanted to explore with the former first lady U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential nominee was the title that she selected for the book. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And each of those conversations revealed a warm, a soft side of her, not always evident when the conversation is strictly politics. I can't help but wonder if more of that had come forth in 2016, maybe she'd be ending her second term right now. One of my most frequent and favorite guests is Professor G. Professor Scott Galloway, the NYU Stern professor, business school professor, host of hit podcasts. He's that rare combination of academic and street brilliance.Speaking of which, last spring with my wife, I met Scott for a drink at an outdoor London cafe. And at the time, theft of cell phones was rampant. So we're sitting there engrossed in conversation. A guy creates a distraction at the next table so as to provide cover for a buddy who stole somebody's cell phone at a neighboring table. The first person to intervene, Professor G. No wonder why the subject he and I often discuss then is masculinity. He's got lots of thoughts about the plight of young men. And as my sons can attest, he's their champion, always careful to diminish toxic masculinity while espousing what he calls aspirational masculinity. I love this guy. He gets more into this topic and offers great insight into how to launch your career and manage your money.

There were, I'm going to date myself, but there were jocks and there were nerds and there were pod heads and there were, you know, techies, votechis or greasers, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And what you argue in the book is there was a level of protection that actually came from that sort of differentiation that is missing today.MALCOLM GLADWELL, AUTHOR OF 7 \"NEW YORK TIMES\" BESTSELLERS: Yes. Yes. So the basic idea here is that epidemics, like a monoculture, where you have a culture where there aren't -- Where there's one set of values and one dominant group, it's very easy for a contagious idea, contagious behavior, to race unchecked through the entire population, where you have what your high school, mine had lots of different cliques and groups that are separated, it's very difficult for one idea to dominate the whole culture. And I think what's happened is that in certain parts of America, we've fallen in love with the idea that every kid ought to be -- ought to share the same values and be focused on the same goals. So in this town I talk about, it's a town of upper middle class professionals. Every parent wanted their kid to go to an elite school, to do really well in school, to be a sports star, to be happy and successful and dress really well and be attractive. And, you know, the pressure that put on the population was such that they became susceptible to this suicide outbreak. And I think it's, you know, sometimes when we talk about the benefits of diversity, we focus way too narrowly and we, you know, we talk exclusively in terms of ethnic diversity. And we forget there are broader benefits to all kinds of diversity and that creating a society that has a home for all kinds of people with very different perspectives is part of what makes a society safe. Diversity is safety. It's not the opposite. I think sometimes people think of diversity as scary, and that's not what happens when you look at teenage life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

His latest book is called \"Get Honest or Die Lying, Why Small Talk Sucks\" and addresses why kids need to get off their phones and go outside. Once again, I was drawn to the lessons this author offered for the fraying of our national fabric.

So sadly, her concern was ahead of its time.Early in the 2024 presidential cycle when I would advocate for a third party choice, radio callers would say to me, OK, well give me a name. And I would say one of the two admirals, William McRaven, who created and oversaw operation Neptune Spear, which took out bin Laden in 2011. McRaven went on to write a New York Times bestseller called \"Make Your Bed, Little Things that can Change Your Life and Maybe the World.\" His book was inspired by a commencement speech that he gave at the University of Texas where he shared 10 principles that he learned during his Navy SEAL training. That speech went viral with more than 10 million views. And the other name that I would suggest is Admiral James Stavridis, the former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. Stavridis is a frequent guest of the program and spent more than 30 years in the Navy. Admiral Stavridis, this is interesting, was fully vetted by Secretary Clinton as a potential running mate back in 2016. And after Donald Trump was elected for his first term, it was Trump who summoned Stavridis to Trump Tower to sound him out for a possible cabinet level appointment. Appealing to both in our divided climate, that really says something. Stavridis is a man in full, and one of his talents is writing fiction, but he does it in a way that makes very real points. And in his novel \"2054,\" which he co-authored with Elliot Ackerman, Stavridis warns about the dangers of artificial intelligence and gives keen insight into the warfare of the future.

The printing press, electricity, the Internet, all of these have been decried for the possibility of nefarious activity associated with them. Same with artificial intelligence.

And warning that, you know, social welfare programs like Medicare and Medicaid were going to lead to a socialist or even communist takeover of the United States.But once he was in office, he pivoted to the center and turned out to be supremely pragmatic. I mean, in fact, the first big bill he signed as governor of California in 1967 was a large increase in spending and taxes to deal with a looming budget deficit. I mean, he signed one of the most liberal abortion laws in the country in both Sacramento and Washington. He cut deals with Democrats. And ultimately, his crowning achievement as president was working with Mikhail Gorbachev, the world's number one communist, to peacefully end the Cold War despite a long career as an anti-communist.

      "sentences": "Welcome back to Book Club. I confess to having been totally hooked on the trial of Alex Murdoch, who was convicted for the murder of his wife and son in South Carolina. My fascination began long before the trial, when Valerie Bauerlein wrote about the tragedy for \"The Wall Street Journal.\" As events unspooled, she was both a Sirius XM and CNN guest of mine.Valerie knew the player. She knew the terrain. She was ultimately a fixture in the Lowcountry courtroom. And when the jury visited the crime scene, she was a designated media representative reporting on that tour. I thought I knew the story, but found the revelations in her book, \"The Devil at His Elbow,\" to be an eye opener. Valerie Bauerlein is a national affairs reporter for the \"Wall Street Journal.\" She spoke to more than 200 people for her instant \"New York Times\" bestseller. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I only wish that there were cameras in all courtrooms, all state, federal, including the Supreme Court.My view is that if you have a right as a citizen to be there as an observer, that a camera should be present, school board, township supervisor meeting, congressional hearing and Supreme Court.
