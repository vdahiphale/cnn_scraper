      "sentences": "President Biden is in India for the annual G20 Conference. The war in Ukraine and climate change are two of the agenda items there.Meanwhile, here at home concerning new poll numbers, a looming auto workers strike and the expected indictment of his son, Hunter, are serious troubles that he most surely cannot leave behind. CNN White House correspondent, Jeremy Diamond, joins us live from New Delhi, India. Jeremy, what are you hearing from sources inside the Biden team about how he is trying to kind of square where he is with what he left behind?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, Dana, there's no question that any world leader wants to come into one of these summits from a position of strength, both at home and abroad. And there's no question that President Biden is arriving at this summit from a position where his poll numbers are not where he would like to be. And in a very different position from when he came to the G20 last year after those midterm elections that saw Democrats really outperform historical trends.So this is a very different moment from the President. But at the same time, you know, for the president's advisors tell me that what they see here is also an opportunity, an opportunity for the president to use, basically the best card that you have as a political candidate, which is being the commander-in-chief on the world stage. And there are certainly opportunities for President Biden at this summit to put the United States in a position of leadership, especially -- and that is really the mission here as it relates to the developing world, is President Biden looking to try and show the developing world that the U.S. is a reliable partner. And he's also going to continue to press on issues, despite the fact that even the host country, India, really isn't on board with a lot of these sanctions campaigns as it relates to Ukraine, hasn't really condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I'm told that President Biden will, nonetheless, make a very forceful stand, making clear where the U.S. stands on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And those differences are really going to still be apparent here. Even as President Biden makes that stand, it's going to be very difficult, given the fact that Russia and China are both members of this G20 to get a joint communique that iterates a unanimous position in particular on that war, which is also why we're going to see the president pushing here on other fronts, including on the developing world and taking advantage of the fact that China's president, Xi Jinping, is not here. We just had a briefing from a senior administration official who made clear that India is upset about the fact that China is not here. And the U.S. certainly sees an opening on this stage. Dana?",

The whole watch me, which Joe Biden says over and over again, well, he's going to go to India and back and fewer than five days and he's traveled even more abroad than Donald Trump.

They want voters to see it that way certainly. And this is an opportunity a trip like this for him to showcase that.I mean, this is his sort of sweet spot. This is kind of his area of expertise for a long time, global affairs, and he will have the chance to, you know, speak publicly about it and be sort of like the leader of the free world rallying everyone around a cause, although the politics of that as well, geopolitically, are difficult, as Jeremy was also saying. But it also goes back to what Gloria was mentioning about that people don't find him inspiring. It's like we know that already about Joe Biden. He is the stable, strong leader, you know, that that's sort of baked in. And I think the big frustration right now for his -- for his campaign, for his allies, is that they can't seem to break out of that. And I think that's some of what's reflected in the polling.",

Typically, foreign policy issues are not the front and center, it's economic issues. And when I'm talking to a number of Democrats in the aftermath of our polling, their concern is that the economic agenda that they believe that Biden deserves credit for, he's not getting enough credit for.They -- the Biden team clearly sees that this -- about his efforts to bring the world together in the fight to save Ukraine is such a central part of his narrative as president, and they believe that will sell -- will play well with voters. The question is, how do they reconcile those economic concerns?",

And yet to fight politically against him in these times, do you have to fight his fight on the Trump level or at least closer to Trump's level than the Biden campaign and Biden himself are willing to go?",

And, you know, the president is fond of saying, don't compare me the -- oh, my, they compare me to the alternative.They are -- they need to sort of figure out how they're going to move into that contrast campaign on a daily basis now. Because as you said, sometimes the president wants to restrain himself, doesn't want to comment on the legal matters that president -- the former president Trump is involved with right now in his indictments. He doesn't want to, in any way, jeopardize those cases. And, yet, that is the information stream that is out there about his potential opponent right now. And so at a certain point, if Joe Biden is going to commit himself to making this a battle for the alternative, you got to start presenting that to the American people.",

That may have entered into the calculus for Fani Wilson (ph). But, you know, again, it's inscrutable. We can't really know exactly what went into it. And but to me, it gives me confidence that we've got prosecutors here that are making very fine-grained selective judgments.I mean, just like the decision in the government documents case, they didn't charge Donald Trump with pilfering and maintaining all of these documents, only the ones that he held back even after he was given a chance to return them. And so I think in each of these cases, we're seeing proper reasonable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.",

It's on appeal. He hasn't served any time in jail yet.I mean, somebody in a different position was Mark Meadows. We recommended that there be a prosecution against him for contempt of Congress in this same way with the others. But the Department of Justice decided not to bring that case because he had engaged in some partial compliance with it. So, again, I think we see the rule of law working and it's not really, you know, a subjective call on who I'd like to see punished in what way, but rather that the system itself continues to work.",
