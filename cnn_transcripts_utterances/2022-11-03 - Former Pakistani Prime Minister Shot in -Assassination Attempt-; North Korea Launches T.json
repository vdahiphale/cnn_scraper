Punjab police falls under the provincial government, which holds power in the province of Punjab.

There is, you've interviewed Khan, you know, this in the past couple months, there has been an incredible (AUDIO GAP) in this country. Just this past week, a high-profile journalist was critical of the government and the military establishment. At the same time you had for the first time in Pakistani history, the director general of the ISI, a secretive intelligence agency, came out and did a press conference, speaking out against Khan. He also said that in the lead up to this long march, which he is going forward with, because he wanted early elections, since he was ousted in April. That's something he's been calling out for, for a long time. He's also said that he feared for his life. He said this multiple times in the leadup to this march. He had not reached Islamabad yet but he is an incredibly popular leader here in this country. And that popularity has only increased as he's taken to the streets of cities across this country. There has been already reports of protests in the capital here in Islamabad. You've seen images of people burning tires on a motorway, the main artery leading into the city. There have been protests there as well. There has been a call for calm by the minister of information. He said that they shouldn't politicize this incident but it is a politically charged atmosphere here in this country. The former information minister has said that he is calling for revenge. He's saying that this is a party of peace but there must be revenge for the fact that their leader's blood has flown -- has flowed. We are still waiting for more details regarding the investigation into this incident. But it happened on live TV a couple of hours ago.

Pyongyang never officially recognized that line until Wednesday. They never fired a missile over it, either. South Korea's president holding to his hawkish stance on North Korea, calling the launch an effective territorial invasion. The missile actually fell just shy from of the south territorial waters. He infuriated North Korean, forging ahead with Operation Vigilant Storm, South Korea's largest combined military air drills with the U.S. Five days of war games, 240 aircraft, thousands of service members from both countries. Pyongyang's foreign minister promising powerful follow-up measures. For the Korean Peninsula, a day of unnerving firsts. The first time North Korea launched at least 23 missiles in a single day. Skyrocketing tensions to levels unseen in half a decade. The first time South Korea and the U.S. responded by firing surface to air missiles near the North's territorial waters. CNN counts 29 North Korean missile launch events this year, including a barrage of eight missiles in a single day back in June. And October's highly provocative ballistic missile launch over Japan. Triggering a rare nationwide emergency alert. Japan strongly condemning the latest launches, calling the blitz utterly unacceptable, violating U.N. Security Council resolutions at an unprecedentedly high frequency. Tokyo's solemn protest via diplomatic channels in Beijing, apparently falling on deaf ears. China and Russia have veto power at the U.N. Security Council, both in no mood to work with the West on punishing Pyongyang as they bolster their authoritarian alliance. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thank, you Will.To Israel now where near final results on Tuesday's election show former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu poised to return to power backed by a bloc of far-right ultranationalists. The Israeli media say that he has already started talks with the coalition partners to form a new government. Some of them are already talking about the future. Right-wing Jewish Power party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir wants to be Israel's public security minister, leading the police, tweeting that the time has come to impose order. The time has come for there to be a landlord. This is a big moment for Israel and the region. The surge of the far-right is sure to heighten Palestinian and Israeli tensions and possibly, impact Israel's improving relations with its Middle East neighbors. Hadas Gold joining us from Jerusalem.

But still it will be quite the majority there.As you, know it's really supported by the far-right group. It's the Jewish Power/Religious Zionism group, that's expected to get 14 seats. This will make them the third largest, the third largest bloc in the Israeli parliament. Now as coalition talks will be completed and then they will become the question of what sort of positions will these figures get? As you noted, people want to be in charge of police, that could potentially be a very controversial position, especially considering that being in charge a police would mean, being in charge of police in places like East Jerusalem, places like the holiest sites. This is somebody who has gone into East Jerusalem during clashes between Palestinians and Israelis, pulled his gun and called on police to shoot Arabs who he said were throwing stones. Will Netanyahu heed their calls because they're holding up his government or will he try to do something else? This will likely be the most far-right government in Israeli history. One thing that I find really noticeable, Becky, is that when you dig into the numbers of the results, when you look into the actual vote counts, you find that when you break down votes based off of this, if they were pro Netanyahu or anti Netanyahu, the difference between the two sides is only something like less than 10,000 actual votes. Why, if there's only a difference of 10,000 votes, does the Benjamin Netanyahu side have so many more seats in parliament? That's because Netanyahu managed to cohesively bring together all the right wing blocs. Now there are essentially only four parties in this coalition. When you look on the other side, all of these smaller parties that fractured. In the Israeli electoral system, if a party doesn't get enough votes, it doesn't have a threshold, it doesn't enter parliament. And essentially those votes are wasted. That's why when you look at the actual numbers, it's not that 65 percent of the Israeli voters wanted that bloc, it's the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu, who's an expert politician, he managed to really bring all of the right-wing together and create what will be the most right-wing government likely in Israeli history.",

So our job is to convince our voters to turn out, because if they turn out, then there's no doubt that we will win. But it is an uphill battle in a midterm election to convince people to get out and vote, whereas the other side is motivated because they want change at any cost. And so I think that you'll see at the rally tonight where I'll be with Governor Hochul and Vice President Harris a real strong message about how this election has to be put on the front burner for everybody, and voters need to turn out and vote for themselves, vote for making a real difference in their lives. And also, I want to go back to underscore what's at stake, because we just had some video put online by the Republican senator from Utah saying that he wanted to pull Social Security and Medicare up by the roots. What more evidence do we need? We know that the Republicans for 50 years have said they were going to overturn Roe v. Wade, and get what, they did. I take them at their word. So if you're worried about the economy, cost of living, getting by right now, think of what it will be right if they go back to higher prescription drug prices, undo what the Democrats did, go after Social Security and Medicare to literally pull it up by the roots.
