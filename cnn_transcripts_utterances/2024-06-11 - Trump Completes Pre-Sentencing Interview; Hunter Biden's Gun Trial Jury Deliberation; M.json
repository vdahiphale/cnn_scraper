It is a very pleasant surprise and quite unusual from what we're used to in terms of brashness, in terms of making statements about the system and being a victim and injustice.And so, yes, it is a surprise, but remember a big picture what this is about, right? There's something called a PSI. What is a PSI? Pre- Sentence Investigation. And pursuant to that investigation, a defendant, as we look at here, now convicted felon, is provided with the opportunity to give information with respect to things that are relevant about you. Like what? Like your family background, like your mental health history and status, like the nature of the conviction and how it affected your ability to support and otherwise provide for your family. Generally, not getting into the facts or circumstances of the case itself, which is why counsel generally doesn't even appear or need to for that matter. And the whole reason for that, Kasie, of course, is that then you go from a PSI, Pre-Sentence Investigation, to a PSR, right? A lot of acronyms. Pre-Sentence Report. And that report is certainly helpful for a judge to provide sentencing to the defendant, having learned more about them. And then, of course, this comes with and along -- alongside what your attorneys will give, which is their recommendation with respect to the sentence, and then prosecutors will weigh in, and then the judge will certainly look at all of it and render a fair and just determination as to what sentencing should look like.",

Of course, deliberations just having begun yesterday. Of course, this dealing with three different counts. Did he lie to a federally licensed firearm dealer? Did he lie on the form with regard to the purchase of the weapon? And did he illegally possess it? So, those are the issues. I think they're very clearly defined.What's a bit murky is that is whether or not there's really was he addicted at the time, whether he thought he was addicted at the time. Was he deceiving himself with this evidence to that regard? And let's not forget, he's got home court advantage. His family is pretty popular in Delaware. It matters. I think you have an African-American jury that is pretty in tune to what's appropriate, what's in just, et cetera. And so, let's see whether or not we get a hung jury. Or finally, jury nullification, whether the jury says, you know what? Perhaps it's something he did. I think they're shaming addiction. We're not going to do that. And then, let's throw it out. Of course, the defense has been arguing that, but the prosecution saying it's about lying. Let's see what narrative the jury comes up with. We'll know soon.",

This has really been an ongoing thing, but it's starting with Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina. According to NBC, operatives aligned with McCarthy are directing big money into these races through outside groups. Tuesday's challenge to Mace is the first test, and then we'll see House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, who faces a primary in Virginia next week. Two other anti- McCarthy voters, Representatives Eli Crane of Arizona, Matt Gaetz of Florida, also have primary challenges this summer.

There's no wiggle room for Hamas. And so, a message like that suggests that there is wiggle room and that there's some negotiation that can or should happen with Israel. And that's simply not the case. This is a deal that lays out what Hamas should do. And I think that the challenge that we see with Hamas is that even though we see a message like that, Hamas is not always in control. You have a number of different groups and factions that maybe making decisions that are not necessarily in line with what the negotiators want to do. So, it's not helpful.
