And we begin on the border with Gaza, where the clock is ticking down to an Israeli ground offensive while negotiations continue to try and free more than two hundred hostages being held by Hamas, and other militant groups in Gaza.Sources say those negotiations appear to have reached an impasse overHamas demands for fuel. Israel says that is a nonstarter. At the same time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems to reassure troops who have been on standby for more than two weeks the ground offensive is still on track with just one goal to smash Hamas. Retaliation for the militant group's October seventh attack which left more than 1400 civilians in Israel dead. Even before any ground incursion, unrelenting Israeli airstrikes have had a devastating impact on Gaza and more than two million Palestinians who live there are now facing a dire humanitarian crisis. On Tuesday, only eighth of an expected 28 trucks crossed over from Egypt and as the civilian death toll in Gaza climbs higher, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire bringing an angry backlash from Israeli diplomats. Guterres said the appalling acts of Hamas do not justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people, and that said delivered to Gaza so far does not match the enormous need. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UN SECRETARY-GENERAL: Relief is finally getting into Gaza but it is a drop of aid in an ocean of need. In addition, our UN fuel supplies in Gaza will run out in a matter of days, and that will be another disaster. Without fuel, aid cannot be delivered, hospitals will not have power, and drinking water cannot be purified or even pumped. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Matthew Chance has our report, and a warning, his report contains graphic content.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is the extraordinary moment an 85-year-old Israeli grandmother was released by Hamas. In video recorded by the militant group, you can see her shaking the hand of a masked gunman, shalom, or peace, she says as she is led away. Back in Israel, Yocheved Lifshitz is speaking about her hostage ordeal. YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, ISRAELI HOSTAGE RELEASED BY HAMAS (through translator): I went through hell, they went on a rampage in our kibbutz. They kidnapped me, lay me over a motorcycle on the side and flee with me through the ploughed fields. They stormed our houses, beat people, some of them like me kidnapped. They did not distinguish between old and young. CHANCE (voice-over): The Hamas attack on her kibbutz of Nir Oz in Southern Israel earlier this month left a quarter of its residents killed or kidnapped, including many children according to Israeli officials. Yocheved described as she was forcibly driven away with her elderly husband and hit with sticks on the journey into Gaza. Her daughter who helped translate her mother's ordeal to reporters described where her mom and several other Israeli hostages were held underground in Gaza.",

So how much more complicated does all of this make these negotiations? O'LEARYBut Palestinian Islamic Jihad is an extension and was born out of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which, if you peel that back a little bit, some of the founders of Al-Qaeda came from EIJ, and they are, you know, very militant, very Islamist and traditionally Hamas has been a little more nationalistic and, you know, with Islamist leanings although that has been turned on its head in recent weeks. But trying to negotiate with Hamas, who does not have control of all the hostages, makes it a much more challenging negotiation to try to get all of the hostages out at some point.",

That level of readiness comes with a time limit. So how much more time do these negotiations have from a military point of view, and once that offensive begins, what are the chances of rescuing the hostages, any kind of operation to get them out of Gaza?O'LEARY: Going into Gaza is going to be extremely difficult and complex, having spent time in places like Fallujah and Mosal. Gaza is much denser because they had limited geography in Gaza, they've built buildings up whereas if you look across the Middle East, most Middle East cities have, you know, buildings that are on average two or three stories with open rooftops, the families sleep on the roof during the hotter months. You know, Gaza is much more complex making any kind of hostage rescue very difficult. It is a 360 degree threat picture, and also has been widely reported potentially hundreds of miles of reinforced tunnels, which is likely where all the hostages are being held.",

This coming after three other nominees saw their bids collapse, including one Congressman Tom Emmer just earlier in the afternoon, just a couple hours after he won his party's nomination faced a fierce backlash on the right and then decided it was time for him to drop out because he had no path to the speakership. Well, Mike Johnson then won the nomination himself, the fourth time a nominee has come forward in the aftermath of Kevin McCarthy's ouster. There was some concern inside the room. There were roughly 44 members who voted for other candidates, someone who is not Mike Johnson or any of the other declared candidates. Ultimately though some of those came to his side when it came to one of the final vote to decide whether or not they would back him on the floor. It were 22 members who were missing from that vote and also three members who voted present. And Mike Johnson on the floor on Wednesday can only afford to lose four Republican votes, so he has some work to go, but still there is confidence in the ranks that after all of this infighting that even though the members who finally opposed pushing out Kevin McCarthy even they say it is time to put this to an end and back Mike Johnson to the speakership.",

How will they deal with that in the House when there has been resistance to the idea of tying Ukraine aid to Israel aid. Also avoiding a government shutdown by mid November, something that could cause a huge fight within the ranks as well. So, so many questions for Congressman Johnson.

Well 65 percent of Independents say they do not want him to be president again if convicted of a crime. It does not mean Biden is really going to win 65 percent of Independents in a race against Trump because a lot of those Independents are dissatisfied with him too. But the issue of how the electorate responds, beyond this universe of Republicans who have been talking about, whether in the primary or in the House, if Trump is in fact convicted of a very serious 91 criminal charges he is facing, That I think it remains a very open question and one in which the outcome could be quite different from what we are seeing, the collective shrug from Republican voters and leaders alike to all of this gathering evidence against him.",

CNN's Jake Tapper spoke with one of the organization's representatives to find out how the Hamas attacks on October 7th and the Israeli government's response has shaken up its mission. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JAKE TAPPER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Peace activist Vivian Silver lived on kibbutz Be'eri and was the former board member of B'tselem, a progressive group that monitors the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians. Its name, B'tselem, means \"in the image.\" It's from a Bible verse. It means in the image of God. All of us, all of humankind, are in the image of God. On October 7th, Vivian Silver disappeared. She's thought to have been kidnapped by Hamas. Today, I spoke with B'tselem's Roy Yellin. ROY YELLIN, B'TSELEM DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC OUTREACH: Part of, like, the shock and horror that we all experience is the fact that a lot of our supporters, immediate circles, even family members were killed, kidnapped or affected in other ways in what happened on Saturday.",
