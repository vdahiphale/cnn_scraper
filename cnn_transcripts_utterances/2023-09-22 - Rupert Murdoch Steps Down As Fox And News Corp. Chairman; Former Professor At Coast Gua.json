Our boss, Rupert Murdoch, is transitioning from chair of our parent company, Fox Corporation. Rupert Murdoch created all of this and so much more across America and the globe. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We just got it in. And you have an interesting take at the very beginning. We know that Rupert Murdoch is going to have his hands in this still because he said so. But you say that in naming his eldest son Lachlan as his successor, Murdoch -- is 92 -- has ensured that Fox Corp. goes forward and will live on. But maybe not with the same vent. Maybe not as conservative as we have been seeing. Explain.",

Now, we know where Lachlan stands. Of course, he's taking over this company. He shares his father's viewpoints. But do the other three? That's what's going to be the question. And if they don't all come to a consensus about the future of the company, it's unclear what the direction is both for Fox Corp. and News Corp. long term.",

So they want this business to continue but the direction that they want it to continue is so different.James Murdoch stepping down on the board of News Corp. in 2020, citing differences ideologically with what their editorial board was saying, gives you a sense of where he stands versus his brother. The two sisters are sort of the wild card and we know that you need a majority. So it's going to need to be at least three people coming together on the same side here. I think, sort of, the thing I'm watching, though, is that as Lachlan takes over, how is he going to continue Rupert Murdoch's vision for this sort of populous, conservative editorial bend, but also in the digital era? You know, in the newspaper era where you had very powerful op-eds and in the cable TV news era where you could have a voice and reach a lot of people, it was easy to carry on that torch. In the digital era, Phil, you know this -- it's very different. With streaming now, it's hard for one outlet to command huge, huge, huge attention. It's a very fragmented media environment.

U really looked great and the nails were very hot. Ur very precious. I adore u. I really do want u. I am a good boy. No final for the goddess.\" Coast Guard attorneys learned about the texts years later after Sulmasy had retired from service. Yet, they were so concerned they wrote this 2016 prosecution memo recommending two court-martial charges against Sulmasy, including willful dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer. The document states the cadet, who was 20 years younger than Sulmasy, denied any sexual contact occurred and appears to have been a willing participant. Sulmasy's attorney saying to CNN, that means \"texts between them were entirely consensual between two of-age adults.\" Yet, the memo's conclusion was \"...prosecution appears to be the only proper course of action.
