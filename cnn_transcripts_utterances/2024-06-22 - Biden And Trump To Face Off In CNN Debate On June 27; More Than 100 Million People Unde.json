Now, it is unusually early in the campaign, giving the candidates a chance to jolt a White House race that has been largely stable for months. CNN's Camila DeChalus is joining us now from Washington. So, let's talk Team Biden. What's their goal for this weekend? CAMILA DECHALUS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTNow, campaign advisors tell us that during this weekend when he's at Camp David and even next week, he's going to be gathered around close aides and close advisors that will really be helping him prepare for this debate. We are told that his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, is leading these debate preparations. And these preparations entail everything from informal conversations he's having while discussing a lot of topics to just even a formal 90-minute mock debate, where he's going, where he's trying to just really tune that messaging of how he wants to respond to certain questions. And we're told that his ultimate goal here is to strategize more ways to show how Trump is unfit for office and strategize ways to really hold Trump accountable for the policies he has enacted in the past. And, Victor, we know that is no small task, that this debate, there's a lot of stake, at stake for Biden and Trump during this debate, because this is a way for them to really gravitate and tell voters where they stand on issues and make it clear why Biden or Trump is best to serve as the next president.

However, that has set a very low bar for Joe Biden, and it's something that behind the scenes has become somewhat of a concern.

So far, based on the polls, that has not happened. So this really is an opportunity for him to show voters that front and center for the first time in several years.

That seems in the past few weeks to still be a focus, but now we're seeing how they are going after Donald Trump's legal issues and his recent conviction more often.

It stretches from the Midwest, the Ohio Valley, the Mid-Atlantic, into the Northeast.All of these folks dealing with temperatures well above where they even should be for the summertime. And it's not just here. You've also got some that are out into some Western states as well. So a lot of different areas dealing with that extreme heat. And taking it into comparison of when we would usually have it, look at how much we've seen the number of people under those heat alerts really take off in just the last week. For some perspective, this black line here, this is the summer average. So comparing it to last year to where we are now, we are way above. We're really getting that early onset in a lot of these states. Even if you aren't under an alert though, you're still likely feeling the heat. You've got about 80 percent of the U.S. population having those temperatures at or above 90 degrees and for some folks it's even beyond that. It's into record-breaking territory. You're looking at 40 possible records still potentially that could be broken this weekend, today and or tomorrow. Some of them could end up breaking them both days in a row. Looking at the temperatures, Philadelphia looking at 95 for the high today, dropping down on Monday. D.C. likely to hit that triple digit mark today. Richmond also getting awfully close but notice one thing a lot of them have in common. Monday, we finally start to see those temperatures dropping back down. That's thanks to this right here. This system here that's going to bring heavy rain to the Midwest, eventually into the Great Lakes once we get into Sunday. That's going to shift in towards the Northeast once we get into Monday and allowing those temperatures to come back down. The downfall in the short term, it's dumping a tremendous amount of rain across the Midwest. We're talking 6 to 10 inches of rain.
