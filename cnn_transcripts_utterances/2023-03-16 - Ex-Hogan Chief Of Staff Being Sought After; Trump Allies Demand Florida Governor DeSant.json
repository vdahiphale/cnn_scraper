We can do a better job listening to women when they feel like something is off during childbirth or pregnancy. We have high rates of c-sections in the past two years. We also had the pandemic which could have exacerbated the issue. Now, when you look on the screen right now, you see in 2021, that is the year with the most recent data available, more than 1,000 women died due to maternal causes, and that's up from 861 deaths in 2020. And the maternal mortality rate was higher among black women compared with white women. We know that black women are almost three times as likely to die due to maternal causes. So, these numbers just show the situation here in the U.S. is only getting worse, Jim and Erica.
