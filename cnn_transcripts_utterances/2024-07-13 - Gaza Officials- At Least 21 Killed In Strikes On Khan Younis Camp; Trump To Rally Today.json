      "sentences": "Yes, well, that last question, Fred is indeed the critical one, and it is one to which we do not yet have an answer. The Israeli military at this hour, is still assessing whether or not the target of this strike was, in fact, killed.The target, the Israeli military says was Mohammed Deif, Hamas' top military commander, the number two, Hamas official in Gaza, right behind Hamas' leader, Yahya Sinwar. The Israeli military believes that he was in this wooded area within the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, what's been designated as a \"safer\" area by the Israeli military. Very near to there, though, there were clearly the tents of displaced Palestinians, some of whom appear to have been killed and injured in this strike as well. What I'm learning from an Israeli official, in terms of the intelligence that led to this strike, it began filtering in through the Israeli security establishment over the course of the last few days. But it was only within the last 24 hours that a clear window of opportunity to take out Mohammed Deif, actually began to crystallize. Overnight, I'm told that the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, the Israeli military's Chief of Staff General Herzi Halevi, as well as top officials with the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, held multiple discussions to assess the viability of this strike. One of the key considerations for them was assessing whether or not any hostages were in the area. And once they were able to assess that there were no hostages in the area, and also that they believed that they could limit civilian casualties in the strike, then, they decided to move forward with this one of the key questions, of course, will be how and if this strike impacts those ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations. I can tell you that the view of the Israeli defense minister, according to one Israeli official, is that more military pressure, including of the kind that would take out Hamas' top military commander, can only help to increase Israel's leverage at the negotiating table. That is certainly not a view held by everyone in Israeli society or Israeli politics, but it is one strongly held by the Israeli defense minister as well as the prime minister. But again, beyond the targeting of Mohammed Deif here, we do know that 71 people were killed, nearly 300 injured, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. No clear sense of the breakdown of how many of those are civilians versus how many of those are Hamas militants. The Israeli military says that in addition to Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas's Khan Younis Brigade, was also on site, as well as several other Hamas militants, although they declined to provide an exact number to us.

You know, whether that be human intelligence, signals intelligence, intercepting calls in the aftermath of this, to try and assess what Hamas's internal reaction is to this strike, all of those tools, I'm sure will be employed right now.I've been speaking to a number of Israeli officials over the course of the last few hours, and for now, none of them were able to confirm with any certainty that Mohammed Deif was indeed taken out in this strike. And we should note that Deif has been targeted for assassination by the Israeli military in the past. In 2014 there was a strike targeting him that killed his wife, as well as two of his children in an Israeli air strike. He, however, managed to escape that strike. And so, we will see so far, though, I should note, Hamas has denied that this strike actually took out any of its leaders. It did not name Deif, specifically, but it said that its leaders were not targeted in this strike, arguing that this Israeli claim is simply cover for what they have described as yet another massacre.

Biden is spending the day at his Delaware home where he plans to hold calls in the next few hours with groups of moderate and progressive members of Congress. And those calls come after a group of two dozen former Democratic lawmakers published an open letter calling for Biden to release his convention delegates, and for the Democratic National Committee to hold an open convention in Chicago next month.

They being the Palestinians on the ground and others to find out what happened. But it seems that Israel had pretty good intelligence about his whereabouts. And as you know, based on the previous reporting you had at the top of the hour, he is the number two top official in Gaza right now. He is considered one of the masterminds of the October 7tth attacks against Israel, second only to Yahya Sinwar, who is also somewhere around or underneath Gaza.

Fred, that means there's serious prosecutorial misconduct in this case, because evidence that should have been turned over wasn't. And to answer your question, it does not happen that often. It is rare, it's because it's the prosecutors obligation, both ethically and their duty as an officer of the court to turn over any and all relevant evidence not to make unilateral decisions, like we saw here in this case about whether or not something matters to the trial, those are evidentiary issues for the judge to decide.

She said there was scorching prejudice, it was at least bad faith, or if not bad faith right up there on the line of bad faith so that's what throws out this case, which is the most serious consequence that can happen in a criminal court to actually toss the case say it can't be brought again with prejudice.But to your question, there are certainly avenues that could be pursued for prosecution that was not fueled by justice, but was fueled by vengeance or something of the like, will he pursue that? I doubt it. However, what will likely happen is there will be an inquiry and ethical inquiry will be required to make a determination of why and how this happened, and to investigate the prosecution's process in this case, and potentially impact the prosecutor.

Democrats I've talked to over the course of well, every day since the debate have been of two minds one mind is, yes, let's -- let the convention decide. The other is no, absolutely not. If President Biden were to decide, in the end is not to stand for reelection, it would need to be vice president Kamala Harris at the top of that ticket, and the only choice would be who's her running mate?We're seeing two things. One is that President Biden showing absolutely no signs that he any decision like that is imminent, as you said a fiery performance in Detroit and a very full schedule next week. But the other, you know, is that I think that notion of a contested primary really has given way, among Democrats. I've talked to two more discussions around the idea that there could not be that sort of cast, but you're seeing President -- former President Donald Trump and his campaign team sort of prepare a dual track ahead of the Republican convention next week. One is to be attacking President Biden. The other is to ramp up attacks on Vice President Harris. So certainly looks like that's how they are splitting their calculation.",

A lot of Democrats said look at the minute NATO's over you're going to see this, this rush -- this flow of people demanding he stepped down. And what you've seen is not quite that. It is much more of a split scenario where some Democrats are continuing to come forward in elected office and say, Mr., you know, Mr. President, we love you and value you please pass the torch and others, like you saw with John Fetterman. You're seeing it with Senator Bernie Sanders are saying absolutely not. Joe Biden is our candidate. And it's time to stop doing this and rally around him.You mentioned Texas, President Biden is going to be there on Monday. This is not because Texas is in play for him but because he will be at the LBJ Presidential Library commemorating what is the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. And Texas congressional delegation and the Democrat congressional delegation are split right now. You have some like Lloyd Doggett, when the earliest ones to come out and say he doesn't believe President Biden should run for reelection. And you have other Texas congressional Democrats standing by President Biden. After that Texas trip, you do see stops in Nevada. You'll also see him addressing the NAACP and Latino audiences next week. So he is certainly yesterday in Detroit in many of his stops next week, going to be courting African American voters, Latino voters, base voters, in addition to making that case to elected officials, so sort of courting the Senators and House members by seeing how the public responds to him, but he's still has an uphill battle to address all of these concerns. There are still a lot of concerns the Democratic Party resistance from donors, there's one Super PAC, The New York Times is reporting a major pro Biden Super Pac, putting as much as $90 million on hold as this process moves forward.",
