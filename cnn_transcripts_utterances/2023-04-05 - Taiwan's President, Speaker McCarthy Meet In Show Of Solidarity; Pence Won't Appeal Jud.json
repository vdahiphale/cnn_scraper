Plus, one day after Donald Trump's arrest and arraignment in New York, two major developments in the federal case investigating him. One, a CNN exclusive, the grand jury testimony revealing the Trump was warned he could not legally seize voting machines.

And we start with the world's superpowers on edge, in a potentially provocative show of solidarity between democracies.Moments ago, Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen wrapped up a news conference with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on the Republican's home turf in California, and the Chinese government is not happy about it. The top official in Beijing warning that Tsai's visit could lead to a, quote, serious, unquote, confrontation with the United States. Quick refresher here. China claims that Taiwan is part of its territory, and China has vowed to take Taiwan by force if necessary. The U.S. government does not recognize Beijing's claim over the island of nearly 24 million people, but also for fear of offending China's government, the U.S. government does not recognize Taiwan as its own sovereign country. It is also worth remembering right after then Speaker Nancy Pelosi's August 2022 trip to Taiwan. China's military fired several ballistic missiles over the island, bombarded them with cyber attacks and iced the U.S. out of several communications channels. Ahead of today's meeting, China says it positions several warships right next to Taiwan's coast. We're covering all of this consequential meeting from California to Washington, D.C., to Taiwan. CNN's Will Ripley is in Taipei, Melanie Zanona is on Capitol Hill. But let's start with CNN's Josh Campbell outside the Ronald Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, California. Josh, this meeting comes as China's Xi Jinping is developing this increasingly cozy relationship with his fellow autocrat, Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Jake, and that's one of many issues that are factoring into these tensions we've seen recently between the U.S. and China.As you mentioned the U.S. officials concerned about China's unwillingness to condemn Russia's invasion of its neighbor. Now, two other issues also include the national security concerns that the U.S. intelligence community has voiced about Chinese technology, including the popular app TikTok as well, of course, China's ongoing territorial claims in the South China Sea. And just to remind our viewers why this is so important. This historic meeting today between President Tsai of Taiwan and Speaker McCarthy, as well as this bipartisan delegation, it's important to note that the U.S. sees Taiwan as a strategic ally in three key areas. First, economic. Taiwan is a powerhouse when it comes to the manufacturing of computing technology, of semiconductors. It is also a geographic ally as well strategically placed serving as a buffer of sorts to ongoing Chinese expansion into the Pacific. And then finally, as we've heard from Speaker McCarthy, other U.S. officials, Taiwan is an important Democratic ally. Of course, its Democratic government completely counter that the Chinese government, run by the communist Chinese party. And so what we'll have to wait and see here, Jake, is how the Chinese government does actually respond. We know that when Speaker Pelosi at the time when to Taiwan in August, the Chinese responded with a barrage of missiles, increased military exercises over 100 airplanes flown in and around Taiwan. And so, of course, those concerns remain here will have to wait and see how they respond to this visit. They clearly are not happy, but that's not stopping this bipartisan group of lawmakers here from the meeting, historically with the president of Taiwan here in California, Jake.",

The Taiwan Strait only 110 miles wide, but Chinese warships and planes are regularly crossing over that line that both sides had respected since 1954, not to mention the threats of the -- you know, possible retaliation and by China to the United States because of this meeting, which China views as highly provocative.They were even apparently emailing some U.S. lawmakers, Chinese diplomats telling them not to do this because then China would have no choice but to respond because there's a lot of domestic pressure on the communist party, largely because of the propaganda. People want to see China fight back if you will, when the United States conducts this sort of high level meeting with Taiwan because Chinese people have been fed a lot of lines, Jake, about how -- about how Taiwan is part of their homeland, and it's only a matter of time before they're reunited and China builds a bullet train across the Taiwan Strait. Here in Taipei, President Tsai Ing-wen, by meeting with these U.S. lawmakers, trying to elevate Taiwan's position on all of this and show the legitimacy of her government, which was rightfully and democratically elected by almost 24 million people on this island, Jake.",

And here to talk about both after his trip to Ukraine and exclusive interview, the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence in the House of Representatives, Ohio Republican Mike Turner. Chairman Turner, good to see you. What do you make of McCarthy and that bipartisan group meeting with Taiwan's president amid this difficult time between the United States and China? REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  Well, Jake, after China complained that Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan, they're reminding everybody that they're an authoritarian regime by now complaining about Speaker McCarthy meeting with the president of Taiwan here in the United States. Now, one thing they obviously don't understand about freedom is the freedom to meet with whoever you want. Taiwan is a democracy. It certainly is important for Speaker McCarthy to meet with them, recognizing our support for their democracy. This certainly is way overstepped up by China. They emailed members of Congress with very threatening language, and I think, again, they're just reminding everybody. This is an authoritarian regime.

TERRA MARTIN, DALANEO MARTIN'S MOTHER:  My son should still be here. But instead, officers I want all the offices punished for all their roles. This pain hurts so bad. (END VIDEOTAPE) TODD (on camera):  And showing you the scene now where the shooting took place, the officers converged on the vehicle right about where that black pickup truck is. The vehicle, then moved down the street in the opposite direction there, then crashed into a house a couple of blocks down and to the left. What we can tell you this afternoon also is that the park police will not confirm the current status of their officer who shot Dalaneo Martin, but the Park Police Officers Union is defending that officer, telling \"The Washington Post\", the head of the union telling \"The Washington Post\" that they believe the shooting was justified. That use of force was justified and they're standing behind the actions that all the officers took -- Jake.",

Now, one clue on this win here is both of them had to beat incumbent mayor Lori Lightfoot to get to this runoff. Lightfoot when she was going through, took nearly every single Black ward in the city. So because she wasn't here, that's a lot of votes that was up for grabs. Brandon Johnson swept every single ward or area that Lightfoot did. That was likely the difference here. But now comes a challenge to actually govern and at the top of the list as far as those issues he's going to have to manage, public safety. Take a listen to some of his comments on that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRANDON JOHNSON (D), CHICAGO MAYOR-ELECT:  I am arguably the first mayor to wake up in the city of Chicago who lives in one of the most violent neighborhoods of the entire city. And so what I want for my family, which is a better, stronger, safer community, I want that for every single family across the city of Chicago, and what Chicagoans said overwhelmingly, is that we have to get at the root causes of crime.
