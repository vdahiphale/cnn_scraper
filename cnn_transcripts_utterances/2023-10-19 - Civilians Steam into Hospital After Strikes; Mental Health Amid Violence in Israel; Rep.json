Hospitals are absolutely on the brink in Gaza. Some of them warning that they're soon going to run out of fuel, that they're already running out of medical supplies. Doctors were telling us that they were performing surgeries without painkillers on the floors of some of these hospitals. That's the medical treatment that these victims will receive when they enter this Khan Younis hospital. And the location here is extremely significant. Khan Younis is in the south of the Gaza Strip. These were areas that families, civilians were told to flee towards this weekend by the Israeli military for their safety. So, families went there. I think about 500,000 people went there hoping to find that refuge, to absolutely not see that at all. They continue to face death, continue to face destruction in those areas. The other significant thing to take away here, when we're talking about southern Gaza is that's where the Rafah border crossing is. You'll remember President Biden just announced this deal that will allow some trucks into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing. That could complicate those efforts if there is continued fighting. We already have from rights group that there has been destruction to the Rafah border crossing, to the roads leading to it, caused by Israeli airstrikes. That humanitarian aid is absolutely crucial. Rights groups say every single hour counts. And, again, when you're looking at those people, trapped, sealed into the Gaza Strip essentially by this complete siege, by the closure of the Rafah border crossing, rights groups accusing this offensive by Israel of being collective punishment on this enclave.",

Obviously, it's worse for people who are on the ground that are seeing it firsthand. But even witnessing the images on television.What is interesting is here, and I brought this brain model to give you an idea, but you have two areas of the brain that are relevant here. One is the amygdala, which is the emotional center of the brain, and that's going to activates no matter what just by seeing some of these images. And what happens as a result of the amygdala is that you're sort of bypassing the frontal lobes, the judgment. You're basically just a reactionary, emotional sort of person at that point. And as Gail Saltz, who is a psychiatrist said, you are not in your wise mind at that point. You're not making rational decisions. It's all emotional. That's no surprise. I think the surprising part is it can happen anywhere. She has all sorts of suggestions on what to do about it. Here's some of what she told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. GAIL SALTZ, NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL: I'm agreeing with the American Psychological Association and other organizations that have come out to say, hey, take these social media apps off your kids' phone for a while. But I would also say for the adults, it may be a time to remove for yourself. And I'm not saying, hey, crawl under a rock and have no idea what's going on. I'm not advocating for that.

When you brush your teeth, you take care of your skin, how do you take care of your mental health? How do you even know? Passed deep breathing is something anybody can do. And I don't mean to -- this may sound like I'm minimizing things, but it makes such an impact. Five seconds in through your nose and then seven seconds, two extra seconds, out through your mouth.

In yesterday's vote, 22 of his fellow Republicans voted against him. That's up from 20 who rejected his bid the day before.Joining us now, Republican congressman from New York, Mike Lawler. He voted against Jordan twice. Instead, voting for the ousted speaker, Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, I appreciate your time. Is there anything Jim Jordan can do to get you to vote in support of him? REP. MICHAEL LAWLER (R-NY): Well, as I said to Jim last week, the fundamental issue, frankly, is not who the speaker is. It is the ability of the conference to work together. You have 221 members. And throughout the course of the year, around 20 folks have undermined the conference by voting down rules, by delaying the vote in January for speaker, by voting to vacate the chair, by refusing to support a conservative CR that would have cut spend big 8 percent and helped secure our border. And so, you know, the frustration among many is the ability to govern. And that, to me, is the focus. And so, as I said to Jim last week, if you want to be able to advance this forward, you have to get those 20 folks together with folks in swing districts and find a way forward in terms of legislation because that's what the fundamental issue is.",

He just hoped the rest of the conference would solve the problem for him that he created. But you have a real challenge here. And especially after the removal of McCarthy, after blocking Steve Scalise, there's a lot of frustration within the conference. So, to me, at the end of the day we need to come together.

Anything would be helpful for the people who are desperate. The innocent people who are desperate for aid inside.But, you know, taking a big picture look, this goes back many, many decades. And, remember, in 1967, when Israel was attacked by Egypt, by Jordan, by Syria, Israel walked away with more territory, including the West Bank, including Gaza. Now, since then, Egypt and Jordan are both saying we are home, as you noted in the intro, to millions of refugees ourselves. Egypt, I believe, houses about 9 million refugees, and Jordan over 1 million. The United States providing aid to both countries for years as well, which is why the president is leaning on that aid in the push to get Egypt specifically to participate here. But Egypt and El-Sisi said yesterday, we're not taking any more of these Palestinians in for a number of reasons. Both Egypt and Jordan are fearful that this may be a push by the Israelis to permanently displace these Gaza residents. Israel saying no we will have them return but after the war. They're not really buying that. El-Sisi yesterday said, and I don't know if it was in gest or what, that Israel should send them to the south of the country, to the Negev Desert. That is a nonstarter. So, going through the particular options here, it speaks to a bigger issue. These are countries that have normalized relationships with Israel, Egypt back in 1979, Jordan in 1994, and they're saying that if these people, if these -- some of them terrorists, cross into our border, this war could expand beyond just Hamas and Israel to perhaps even within Egypt and Jordanian borders and that that could really impact whatever peace treaties they have.
