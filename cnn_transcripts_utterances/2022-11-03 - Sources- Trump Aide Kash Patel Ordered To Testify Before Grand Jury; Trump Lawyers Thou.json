Two Ukrainian officials have denied that. One telling CNN that any statements about a possible Russia withdrawal are, quote, more like a trap. We'll watch closely there.North Korea is escalating tensions this morning, firing three short range ballistic missiles just hours after government officials said a separate launch had failed. That failed launch involved a much bigger longer-range missile, an ICBM, intercontinental ballistic missile, a move the U.S. has violated multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. All of these comes after the U.S. and South Korea said they will extend joint military exercises as a response to these North Korean launches. North Korea called that decision, quote, a very dangerous and false choice. North Korea has launched some 30 missiles just this year. Now turning to Iran, where one human rights expert says as many as 14,000 people have been arrested so far in the ongoing protests, originally sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, in police custody in December. CNN cannot independently verify that number of those arrested. We do know that Iran has announced the public trials of 1,000 people involved in those demonstrations. At least one report says dozens of them now faced charges that carry the death penalty. Masih Alinejad is an Iranian journalist and activist.

He signed a $10,000 contract as a 16-year-old, and now all the way to the sport's biggest stage. You know his parents flew him before the game to see him pitch and they told him, God willing, you'll throw a no hitter here. And that is exactly what he and his teammates did. Javier striking out nine over six innings including five in a row at one point before he turned it over to the bullpen. And Bryan Abreu in the seventh, Rafael Montero in the eighth, and Ryan Pressly slamming the door shut in the ninth. Just incredible. The Astros second combined no-hitter of the season.
