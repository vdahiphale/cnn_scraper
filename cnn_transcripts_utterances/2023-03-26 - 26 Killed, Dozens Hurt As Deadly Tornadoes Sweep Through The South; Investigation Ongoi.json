The strongest storms, at least at the moment are an Alabama and Georgia. That's where we have a tornado watch as well as a severe thunderstorm. Watch lots of these orange squares you see here, indicating severe thunderstorm warnings. We are tornado warning free at the moment, but we have had several so far already and that is likely going to continue throughout the day because we have two separate waves of storms. This is the first one that's going to make its way through this morning and then a secondary one that will begin in east Texas this afternoon and then begin to push east into some of these very same states all over again as we push through the afternoon and evening hours. That concerns, however, for both rounds is going to be the same. You're still talking damaging winds, the potential for very large hail. We're talking tennis ball size or even larger. And yes, the potential for a couple tornadoes all within this area you see here, but that does include the community of Rolling Fork that was just hit on Friday, and some other areas of Alabama and Georgia that were hit this morning. So, again a lot of these rounds of showers and thunderstorms coming through these areas again, there's the first one followed by the second one.

I mean, you just can't do that. And so the Supreme Court's already addressed this in Nixon, you know, back during the Watergate time.

Again though, you know for the Russians, this is a way of tightening their grip over Belarus because Putin made it clear he's not transferring these nuclear missiles to Belarus. They're going to be accompanied by Russian forces.

You've got the snow pack that's as high as one and even two story buildings here. It's not only on the trees, it's on the roadways. And this video specifically is from about a month ago, when you think of all of the low pressure systems and even the atmospheric rivers, we had roughly a dozen atmospheric river events just this winter season alone. So again, it's a lot of snow and intense amount of snow. But the Sierras are not all equal, and that's the thing you have to keep in mind. It's broken down into three separate regions. So let's talk about those three areas, ok. It's broken up into the northern, the central and the southern the southern. The southern, interestingly enough, is the area with the highest amount of snow. You're talking 283 percent of their normal snow water equivalent. Basically, what that is it takes into account not only the snowpack on the ground, but if you were to melt it down -- what's that water equivalent? But now let's take it into perspective and compare this year to other years. When we talk about this year specifically, it's been very impressive. 2023 for the entire state of California, you're talking 227 percent of that snow water equivalent. Look at the last couple of years, though, we haven't even gotten to normal, let alone what this year's number has been. And one thing to know and especially when we talk about all this snow is how much that's really improved the drought across the state of California. So here's a look at December 6th just not that long ago. Look at all that red color of the extreme and the exceptional drought there. Now fast forward to just a few days ago, no part of California has any extreme or exceptional drought anymore. A lot of that, yes, in thanks to the snowpack, but also the rain that has fallen too especially the coastal region. So it's helped the reservoirs. It's helped build up that snow pack. And now we're about to add even more on top of it. We have another system that's set to arrive starting late Monday, and then it will continue to push in on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. Now it's not just impacting California. We do need to emphasize this will also hit Oregon and Washington with a pretty intense amount of rain and snow. For the coastal regions, specifically for northern California, you're talking about two to four inches of additional rainfall on top of what they've already seen. And then when we talk about snow, especially for the Sierras, now we're going to be measuring that, Amara and Victor, in feet at least 1 to 3 feet of additional snow pack on top of all that snow you already saw on the ground.",
