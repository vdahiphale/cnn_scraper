It is 109:00 a.m. in Chicago, where the Democratic National Convention kicks off this evening, and it's a convention we're watching. Many political pundits, of course, would have considered it to be unthinkable just a moment ago, the U.S. President Kamala Harris poised to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for president, her meteoric rise, both as the party's standard bearer and in the polls, have been a cause for celebration for Democrats. Amid that festive mood, though, there's this. Just some of the protests there over Israel's continuing war against Hamas in Gaza. Protests starting, of course, over the weekend in Chicago. They're expected to continue there throughout the week, and they come as the U.S. and its Arab allies are making another effort to broker a ceasefire. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is once again in the Middle East. Stephen Collinson is in Chicago for us this hour, we're going to continue to monitor that situation in the Middle East. Stephen, I want to start with you, though, in terms of what we can expect this week in Chicago, there's, of course, what's happening outside. There's what we will hear inside that convention center. How much is support for Israel? Is the state of the war in Gaza expected to be addressed this week?",

Advocates for the Palestinians, progressive Democratic groups raising this issue, I think it's still unclear about how many speakers will actually raise it inside the convention hall, and whether we will get protests during some of the major speeches. That wouldn't be a surprise, given the extent to which we've seen such disruptions in almost every campaign event that the President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris has conducted so far this year. So, clearly, it is something that's at least going to be part of the conversation here. It will be interesting in her keynote speech on Thursday to see how the vice president talks about this, whether she'll put more of a stress on the need for an immediate ceasefire, and perhaps changes to Israeli policy in Gaza than President Joe Biden has so far.",

Joe Biden is the big speaker tonight, and then he's done at the Democratic National Convention. This is, must be a somewhat bittersweet moment for the president, one would imagine.

Senior elected officials in the Democratic Party concluded that he was going to lose to Trump after that disastrous debate performance in Atlanta, and that they needed to move on to another candidate. We will see tonight, I am sure, an outpouring of love and respect for the president from the crowd in the United Center, speaking to a lot of Democrats, they see him as a hero, not just for the things he did in his presidency, a very successful presidency legislatively, but also for sacrificing his own career in the wider chords of beating the former president, and as he says, to save democracy. You know, four years ago, Biden didn't get the kind of acceptance speech and big welcome from a convention, because everything was shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic. So, this is his first real, big moment at a convention as the party's leader, and I think it's going to be a very emotional one.",

      "sentences": "Well, Secretary Blinken has come in to this, this round of talks here, with a sort of feeling, asense of positivity. And President Biden has said, look, he thinks this is really close, there's a real opportunity to close this deal and get it done. The White House's view, the State Department's view, is somewhat of a variance with the sense in the region here, Hamas does not feel that the deal is that close, and even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not as -- is not that optimistic. There are big gaps between the two. But one of the reasons to have this sense of optimism and project a sense of optimism is to try to make sure that there isn't an escalation in the region, that Hezbollah in Lebanon doesn't escalate with a big strike on Israel that it had promised a couple of weeks ago when Israel killed one of its very top military commanders, and Iran had promised vowed the same, to Strike Israel, because top Hamas official was killed in Tehran. So, this positive atmosphere the Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is coming in here with isn't reflected in the region. And in many ways, that explosion last night, that terror attack in Tel Aviv simply signifies just how bad the situation is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over): A terrorist bomb, the first in Tel Aviv in almost two decades, scattering shrapnel, sowing fear, exploding within hours of Secretary of State Antony Blinken's arrival, the city's alert level raised. America's top diplomat's peace mission here more high stakes than ever, pushing America's bridging proposal to get over talks disagreements. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home to get a ceasefire. ROBERTSON (voice over): Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pessimistic. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): There are things we can be flexible on and things we can't and which we must insist upon. Desire to make a deal should be directed at Hamas. ROBERTSON (voice over): And Hamas in a statement as Blinken arrived, blaming Israel for the impasse. The new proposal meets Netanyahu's conditions and is in line with them, especially his refusal to a permanent ceasefire. Key sticking points, they say, are the net serene junction, referring to Israel's demand to search Palestinians returning to Northern Gaza for guns, a red line for Hamas. The Philadelphia Corridor, Gaza's six mile border with Egypt, Israel insists it needs to control it to stop Hamas smuggling in weapons. Another red line for Hamas. Rafah, Gaza's only road crossing to Egypt, the IDF controls it. Hamas wants it back. Israel says no. Meanwhile, in Gaza, ceaseless suffering, a family killed in an Israeli air strike Saturday, another Sunday, safe zones shrinking and more people ordered to them. The IDF saying it's hitting Hamas while trying to protect civilians, but claims Hamas continues to fire rockets using residents as cover. Blinken's recent track record wrestling compromise from Netanyahu, publicly, at least, has been poor. No reason yet to think this visit will be different. (END VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (on camera): So, that 2-1/2 hour meeting that they had, perhaps that does indicate something positive. That's what the prime minister's office here said, that it was a positive meeting, with Israel reassuring the United States that it supports all its -- all its positions in that bridging proposal. But we've seen Secretary Blinken have long meetings with the Israeli Prime Minister before and not get everything that the United States wants out of those meetings. So really, you know, later today, we're expecting Secretary Blinken's readout, and perhaps that will give us a better understanding of really the progress that he feels he might be making here.",

On the one hand, they say they do want a cease fire to happen in those talks. However, number two is that they're not very optimistic that one is going to happen. They don't believe that the Israelis are serious about the negotiations, especially Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But the third thing, and this is something that the Iranians have once again emphasized today, is that the retaliation against Israel for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh here in Tehran on July 31st for them, is a completely different issue than the ceasefire negotiations, and that that retaliation is still very much in the cards. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over): Iran says its drones and missiles are ready for an attack against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh. But as tensions remain at a boiling point, Iran's political transition continues.

TheMiddle East, of course, is in severe turmoil as the region awaits Iran's possible harsh retaliation for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. PLEITGEN (voice over): While Iran's response appears delayed, parliamentarians here say, make no mistake, revenge is coming and will be harsher than Tehran's last strikes against Israel after Iran's consulate in Damascus, Syria was bombed in April. This time they attacked our mainland, the world will witness a serious reaction by us, the time, the place, and the type of reaction is to be decided, he says, and then adds, you saw the first example. You can multiply that as much as you like. We will teach our enemies a lesson so they will not attack us anymore. this parliamentarian says, We are seeking peace and calm in the region, and are not warmongers at all. The U.S. says it's seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas also in the hopes a deal to end the violence in Gaza could persuade Iran not to launch the retaliatory strikes against Israel. But Washington has also deployed substantial forces to the Middle East. A senior Biden administration official warning Iran could face, \"Cataclysmic consequences\" if it attacks Israel. Iranian parliamentarians brushing off that warning. If they attack or threaten us, the Iranian response will be jawbreaking, he says, Iran has showed in practice it will do so, and has the means to do so. The capabilities we have are not what the world knows about, they are far beyond. But when, where and how Iran plans to use those capabilities remains shrouded in secrecy, keeping the Middle East on edge. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And you know, Erica, one of the interesting things that we've seen over the past couple of days is that while the Iranians obviously are not part of the ceasefire negotiations that have been going on in Doha and are set to continue this week in Cairo, the Iranians still very much a factor in all of that. And one of the things that was showcased was the fact that the Qatari prime minister on every single day that there were negotiations in Doha, at the end of each day, he called the Iranian foreign minister and updated him on the progress that was being made. Still, the Iranians definitely sending the message that they are not optimistic about the ceasefire talks, even though they do say they want a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza.",

That has now all changed. And what we're going to see tonight is the passing of the torch. And I know that's an overused term that you'll hear over and over today, but there will be this symbolic passing of the torch, and this idea that Joe Biden, you know, got us through these last three years, that people forget, you know, he came in during COVID, towards the end of COVID, and he will talk a lot about that.

The Ukrainian military now says it controls a thousand square kilometers of Russian territory and claims it has destroyed another Russian bridge by using precision airstrikes. As all of this fighting rages on, CNN was among the first news organizations to go into the part of Russia's Kursk region, which is now controlled by Ukraine.

This Ukrainian assault, so persistent, and Russia, despite its sense of history, it's sort of past as being so impregnable, completely unable to push the Ukrainians out here. A sound of small arms fire we can still hear, so clearly there is a bid for the Russians to push back, but it simply isn't working, and the humiliation for Putin endures.

They know they are not going to break through in terms of media coverage at 7:00, 8:00, 9:00 p.m. when you start to see those big speakers at the DNC, like President Joe Biden, like Hillary Clinton, like Bill Clinton. That is not going to be something that you're going to then pop-up Donald Trump in the middle of. So, they are trying to try to see some of the media narrative when they possibly can. Now, what this is going to look like is a series of what they call \"messaging\" events. These are smaller events held at smaller venues with smaller crowds that focus on one issue. So, what you're where you're going to see Donald Trump this week? He's going to be in York, Pennsylvania, talking about the economy.

It was calm at that time, but you could tell from the police presence what was coming to a certain degree. That was the most divisive political convention in modern times in either party. And the Vietnam War was very different than the Gaza-Israeli war. Yes, people are concerned about what's going on now in the Middle East. But in with the Vietnam War, the country was torn right down the middle, every family had an argument about it. It wasn't just in politics. And so, what happened there affected not just the election, but the entire debate about Vietnam. You only have, as I understand it, about 30 uncommitted delegates. There are probably other supporters in the hall that have gotten in some way or another, but you don't have a critical mass sufficient to do what the anti- war delegation supporting Senator McCarthy, and also the leftover delegates from Senator Kennedy, the -- of course, occurring after his assassination. They were right there in the hall. And you also had the convention being run by Mayor Richard J Daley, who was a tough guy, and he was determined to run that convention the way he wanted to run it. And he ran into an immovable force, the anti-war delegates. It was a disaster of monumental proportions. That's not going to happen this week.

It was developed for use on the battlefield and was used in the Vietnam War. But since then, it started to be used for a lot of other things as well, both recreationally, but also sort of off-label with the FDA approval. So, it's being used for things that it's not FDA approved for, often through these clinics that have proliferated. Also, in 2019 a version of ketamine called esketamine was approved to treat treatment resistant depression, a nasal spray version whose brand name is Spravato that's sold by Johnson and Johnson. But ketamine itself has been used through these clinics for everything from anxiety to depression to PTSD and pain. And some doctors worry that the oversight over those clinics, many of which are cash pay, is too lax. We have seen prescriptions for ketamine go up by more than five-fold since 2017 according to data from epic research, and those are just uses within the medical system. So, it's not capturing all of the ketamine use outside of the system, and doctors are concerned, because this is quite a powerful drug that could be done unsafely in some situations.",

But it can also cause, you know, sedation, dissociation, psychiatric events, and increases in blood pressure, and depressed breathing, or slowed breathing. And so, there are concerns that if you don't have supervision while using it, that could be quite dangerous. And, in fact, the approved version, esketamine has a lot of guardrails around it.
