Really, if anybody knows how to do this, it's Buffalo officials. Right? What they did overnight, they basically cleared this tram route. So what we've seen is a tram make its way up and down this clearing right here for those who do have to go to work this morning to have a way to get to work. But largely, though, officials here in Buffalo and, really, throughout Western New York have been encouraging folks to simply stay home. This should be a snow day for those who aren't able to make it a snow day. But like, if you have ever heard thunder snow? That's exactly what woke me out of bed this morning. That's what meteorologists here have been warning some of the residents here. It's like, look, snow in Buffalo, like you said, typically not a headline. But according to New York Governor Kathy Hochul and the experts that she's -- she's hearing from, this is still going to be a treacherous storm. We are still expected to see many more feet in the coming hours here in Buffalo. LEMON: It's interesting to hear. You sound so clear, and it's because that snow is acting like a natural sound barrier, because the only thing that we can hear is your voice.

This is in a lawsuit against him by murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee.Of course, we all remember Khashoggi, who was murdered in 2018. His remains have never been found. A U.S. intelligence report concluded that bin Salman approved the operation to kill him. Of course, he was a journalist for \"The Washington Post.\" And in July, President Biden stunned the world when he went to Saudi -- and there you see it -- fist-bumped with the crown prince, following a promise to make the kingdom a pariah on the national stage. As a candidate, remember this? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I will make it very clear we are not going to, in fact, sell more weapons to them.

He's simply the son of the king. But a couple of weeks ago, the king, King Salman, gave his son, the crown prince, the title of prime minister. So then he technically became the head of the Saudi government. Now experts and activists who I've spoken with said that that was a ploy in order to get this immunity, and now it has worked. He is technically the head of the Saudi government, and that is what the Justice Department pointed to in their filing late last night, that they made in this case that was brought by Jamal Khashoggi's fiancee. That filing made at the request of the State Department. This is what a State Department spokesperson told me: \"This suggestion of immunity does not reflect an assessment on the merits of the case. It speaks to nothing on broader policy or the state of relations. This was purely a legal determination. Across administrations, there's an unbroken practice of the United States, recognizing immunity for heads of government while they are in office.\" So it's not because they believe he's innocent. It's because of what they call this unbroken practice. Now guys, I did hear from Khashoggi's fiancee overnight. She called this the devastating day. She said that Biden himself betrayed his word, betrayed Jamal, and that history will not forget.",
