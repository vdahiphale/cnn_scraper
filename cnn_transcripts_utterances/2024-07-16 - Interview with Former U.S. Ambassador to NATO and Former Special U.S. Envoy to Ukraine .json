I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. It's day two of the Republican Convention in Wisconsin, and already, a sense of dread is descending here across the pond because Former President Donald Trump has named as his running mate an ultra-isolationist Senator J. D. Vance. Trump, his ear bandage, was greeted like a hero at the Milwaukee Convention Center in his first appearance since the assassination attempt this weekend. Fight, fight, fight, the crowds cheered and they chanted, we love Trump. In a moment, we'll dive into the global implications of this new GOP ticket. But first, let's go to Correspondent Jeff Zeleny at the convention for the very latest. I guess I really want to ask you first, Jeff -- thanks for being with us -- what -- why do you think it was J. D. Vance? It doesn't bring anything if Trump wanted to expand the base. He's a white man. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Christiane, it's such an interesting question. I think what it brings, though, is an extension of Trumpism. What an extension of the Trump brand of politics from this populist strain that is coursing through domestic politics in the United States and also an isolationist strain as well. He is a continuation of the Donald Trump era. So, I think that is what Former President Donald Trump, talking to his advisers, was looking for. Yes, their chemistry is good. And yes, it's someone who doesn't threaten him in the short-term. The longer-term question is a bigger one because immediately, should they win election in November, J. D. Vance will be thinking immediately about 2028. So, that will be a complication. But in the shorter-term, no, it doesn't necessarily bring him suburban voters like a Nikki Haley might have. That's what some Republicans here were hoping for, really an expansion of the base. We talked a lot about the unity message that Donald Trump claims to want to bring here. This did very little for that. But I think it's a sign that Trump is doubling down on trying to focus on some of these Midwestern states, like Pennsylvania, like Michigan, like Wisconsin, turning out his own voters rather than trying to expand to perhaps win over some of the ones who are still skeptical of Donald Trump.",

This is Donald Trump's Republican Party. And the isolationist strain is a first and foremost among the foreign policy. So, that is one of the biggest divides. For all the talk of unity here, and there is unity around Donald Trump, but there are deep divisions inside this Republican Party about foreign aid, first and foremost. Senator Mitch McConnell, who, of course, has been a big proponent of aid to Ukraine, he was booed on the floor of this convention quite loudly yesterday. It wasn't a surprise that he didn't get a warm welcome. I was a little surprised at how loud and energetic the boos were. But look, this is something that has been happening in the Trump era, and J. D. Vance signifies a lot of this isolationist strain in the party. So -- and he's a young senator. He's not even 40 years old. He will be by November. So, should they win, this is really taking that many, many years, perhaps even a decade or more from this. But we will see how those differences resolve themselves in the campaign, if President Biden uses that as a way in here. But it's unclear that foreign policy really is on top of mind of American voters.",

If they're not unified within their own party, how can they be unified any other way, as Trump has said that he wants to be, and I understood that was the directive to delegates and others speaking to just show a unity message. But we have to ask you a different question, because there's been some news that has just come in, and let me just read a little bit of it. It regards the conviction of Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey on -- a jury has found him guilty on all counts in his federal corruption trial. That's 16 counts.

Thisis someone who has had access and has continued to receive classified briefings. This is very extraordinary. But for the fact that a former president was also convicted, you know, just a couple months ago, this would be incredibly unusual. Now, it seems I guess a bit of a sign of the times. But it also pushes back certainly on the notion that the Justice Department was simply out to get Donald Trump. And this is a Democratic senator charged and found guilty of 16 counts. It also, I think, erodes some of the Democratic Party's attempt at moral high ground here in terms of corruption allegations and the like. I'm not sure that voters will pay that much attention to it across the country, in New Jersey, obviously significant. Will he have to resign his seat? Will he not? We will find that out in the coming days. Of course, this is the -- not the first time the senator has been charged, but the first time he's been convicted of this. So, it's an extraordinarily serious count, the bribery allegations, et cetera. But, again, it's hardly a one-off in this political season here in the U.S.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, the first advice I would have for all my European friends and our allies is don't react with emotion. And don't push back on-- you know, don't be so negative toward Trump or, or J. D. Vance because that's only going to cause a counter reaction from them about not liking Europe. I would say, don't make any assumptions about what policy would be. Europe should do its own homework on what needs to be done in Europe and what they're prepared to do, and then be proactive. Let's be problem solvers here about what needs to actually get done, propose things to the U.S. that Europe would like to do. I think that's a much more pragmatic way to handle things. As for what this election means, I have to say, I don't think it means very much. First off, Trump is going to be the president, and we already know Trump. We've seen him in different lights, and he's very much his own person. I don't think choosing J. D. Vance is going to make a difference in terms of what Trump decides to do. I would even think that the selection of Vance is aimed really more at that Rust Belt area of voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, trying to solidify that part of the voting base. I'm not sure that it's going to do a lot on foreign policy. Second, the thing that Trump has emphasized, and we got this from J. D. Vance when he was at the Munich Security Conference in February of this year, is about Europe doing more and the United States doing less, meaning that they feel that the U.S. has done more than its share. It's done too much. And so, we need to push Europe to bear a bigger share of the burden. That is actually not that objection -- not that objectionable. In fact, many Europeans say the same thing. And when it comes to Ukraine, it was actually President Trump who gave political cover to Speaker Johnson when they pushed to get that supplemental aid package through the Congress. It was delayed for six months over a series of other issues. And when they finally decided to put it through, President Trump supported it. So, I think that's also an indicator that it is not necessarily as dire a situation as some of this European commentary would make it out to be.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, several things here. Again, let's take them in pieces. So, the war in Europe, Russia's war against Ukraine, which is thelargest war in Europe since World War II, that is indeed serious business. It is a real problem, and it runs a great risk of escalating into a wider war if it's not stopped. So, a lot of what we hear from the Biden administration right now is on not doing things that would escalate because we don't want a wider war. My own view is that we actually need to do more to defeat Russia in Ukraine in order to prevent that wider war. Now, one of the things I think will be a point of reference for President Trump will be Afghanistan. If you remember, he wanted to get out of Afghanistan, he started the negotiations with the Taliban, he kept urging the U. S. to get out. But he never actually pulled the trigger on getting out because he was briefed that if you do, it's going to be a catastrophe. We then saw that actually play out in the Biden administration, where we pulled out of Afghanistan and it was a catastrophe. So, I think looking now at Ukraine, this is now a cautionary tale for President Trump. Don't create -- don't make Ukraine your Afghanistan. Don't let this failure -- you know, don't let this become a failure on your watch. I think it's going to have to take a different approach than just pulling out the support for Ukraine.",

But the other question is, you know, he's very good friends with the Orban camp. But, you know, as you know, President -- Prime Minister Orban, very right wing, very conservative, no friend of Ukraine, believes in Putin, doesn't give aid to Ukraine. And Orban's chief political adviser tweeted a picture of him with Vance saying, Vance-Trump, that's just what we need. So, how should Europe think about this?

The difficulty with that is on some of the substantive issues where Orban has taken a stand, they're very much at odds with what the right in the United States would be doing. Most important there is China, where Orban has described Hungary as open for business, China's best friend in Europe, the U.S., under a Trump administration, if he's re-elected, is going to take a very tough stance toward China and would expect Hungary to do the same. So, these are political alignments because of left and right and domestic politics, but I don't think that the foreign policies are really going to align that much.",

Today, we have 23 countries that are spending 2 percent or more of GDP on defense, and we are seeing that that is not enough. Not enough in terms of the number of countries. There's still, therefore, nine other countries in NATO that have to increase spending. And 2 percent may be too low a threshold. It may have to be two and a quarter, 2.5 in order for Europe to have what is needed. Now, the trend line there has been positive. I think you're going to see more and more emphasis from the United States, particularly if it's under President Trump on European defense spending. And when we talk about Ukraine, they're going to want to see more balance in that as well. The U.S. is providing over half the military aid there, they're going to want to see that Europe is doing more, spending more on the ammunition, the equipment and so forth for Ukraine.",

And sometimes it's actually the television screen, but more often than not, it's the iPhone or the smartphone screen. And they're not actually -- sometimes they're using those to connect with other real people, but often they're living in some fantasy world. So, it isn't at all the equivalent of, let me say, the Boy Scouts, or the Girl Scouts, it's just -- or the team on which there's a coach. It's a very self-isolating kind of technology. Now, there are -- I have to say, and reviewers can look at the movie on, you know, Netflix or someplace, and they can see the movie highlights a number of really important new initiatives being pursued across the country. A religious group is reaching out to young kids who are interested in the environment, interested in -- you know, in gardening and so on, but are also wanting to connect with other people.

That's been shown around the world, really, that it's not so much what the constitution says on paper, it's whether people actually connect with one another and therefore, can give life to the constitution. And we have had periods in our country, most of the time in our country, we've been a nation of joiners. And that's why our constitution, it's not just that the words on the paper are good, they are, but it's that they've been sustained by this living constitution among us. And that's what, you know, 125 years ago, because of the Industrial Revolution, basically, had begun to collapse. We restored that. And now, we've got to restore it again in the very short run.

There's such a perimeter around Fiserv Forum. I think I went through about five or six checks even to get there when I was going there earlier today. So, I am pretty sure the security has already -- was already beefed up, and he was probably even more so since the events on Saturday. But I would also say that we shouldn't see political violence and the incident on Saturday as an isolated one. When we look back over the last six-ish years, violence has been a pretty core to a lot of what's happened in our country. We think about the Tree of Life shooting, Paul shooting, El Paso shooting, the attack on Paul Pelosi, the attack on Steve Scalise, I mean, these have been consistent incidents over the last several years and it reflects a growing tenor of division and discord that is in our politics. And so, I think Saturday was certainly a bracing moment for a lot of people who watched. But unfortunately, I think it's an American public that has come to expect a political system where violence seems at its core. I left out January 6th, but that obviously was a big one as well. It's been a steady drumbeat of increased -- of political rhetoric and that has people scared not only at this convention, but I think we'll see that at the DNC.

D.Vance, they've been the ones who've been most explicitly trying to link this to Democrats, and frankly, creating an argument that says that Democrats have been violently targeting Trump for years. This plays within a Republican narrative that they've been creating for a long time, one that started with him as president being obstructed by Democrats. They point to the impeachments as things like trying to invalidate his presidency, certainly the legal proceedings that have taken place since he's left office. And now, this recent kind of assassination attempts plays within a script that the right-wing is trying to say, which is that the left and Joe Biden are trying to do whatever they can to stop Donald Trump from coming back into office. I think it's important to not conflate those things. The things we know about the shooter on Saturday do not link him directly to Democrats, do not -- there's no evidence to saying that there's any kind of connection with the parties here. And frankly, if it's a profile of kind of a mixed ideology school shooter type that we've seen often in this type of incidents. And so, Republicans are doing a slight of hand here to play their political purposes, but I do think that the seriousness of what happened does cause a kind of question mark for Democrats about what the message is going forward. The clear message from Democrats, up until this point, was that Donald Trump was a threat to democracy, and that created an emergency that forced people to act. And you even hear some Democrats now saying, is that tenor a little too -- is little too intense for this moment? Are we contributing to the kind of polarization of this moment with that argument? That's going to be interesting. Do Democrats back off from what has been their most potent message to rally their base?",

I don't want to conflate those two things because I do think the shooting in this are a little different, but they get to the same type of message that Republicans are going to pitch. They are going to say, this is a candidate that has been under attack. And I walked past the big billboard today in the Fiserv Forum where they're going to hold this that said, you know, one of Trump's quotes from his speeches, which is that, you know, they're not coming after me, they're coming after you.

Democrats, remember, tried to have their 2020convention there before it was upended by COVID, partially because Milwaukee and Wisconsin remains a bellwether for the rest of the Electoral College. Many of the last presidential elections here have been decided by less than a percentage point. Wisconsin is a clearly purple state, but that has not been reflected in their state politics. They had a huge gerrymander that allowed Republicans to really control power on a state legislature front for years here. Think the Scott Walker era and that time. But what Democrats have been able to do is slowly claw back to the point, I think, the onus is now on Republicans to do a little better here. Here's something I would say, Wisconsin's not necessarily a really Trumpy Republican state, has a lot of those Milwaukee suburbs that have drifted away from him. You saw Nikki Haley put up pretty good numbers in Wisconsin, even though she dropped out, and they've kind of been pulled between the Trump base and a more, I would say, a traditional conservative type in this state. And it's actually hurt him. It's actually hurt Republicans here. Where Democrats have struggled is a motivating in places like Milwaukee and Madison. They've had a full drop off in terms of people of color in this type of places, which has allowed Republicans to seize on some of that. So, I think it's important of why the Republicans are coming here because they're trying to do two things, they're trying to limit their losses in the suburbs in places like Waukesha and Oshkosh, outside of Milwaukee, and they're trying to claw back some of the black and Latino voters in Milwaukee, because they think that is a recipe that allows them to make up what is sure to be a razor thin margin.",

And so, the traditional kind of policy writing process, the platform process that we think about that happens at this type of conventions has been totally upended by Trump already. Last week, there was a lot of reporting about how the Trump campaign, frankly, steamrolled a lot of the traditional conservatives who are a part of that process to make sure things like abortion were not mentioned in the party platform, because he wants to have a really mushy position on that. Instead, you had kind of a series of Trump pronouncements that were largely pretty vague that now make up this party platform. Things like saying, we'll make America safe. We'll bring back energy independence. Just kind of the things you hear Donald Trump say on the campaign trail. And I think this is partially why things like Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation's attempts to make up a policy platform have really exploded because Donald Trump and Republicans have been fairly vague on what they're going to do on that front. And they have -- and they intentionally have done that because they don't want to be kind of pushed into unpopular positions. I think this is going to be a big thing to watch going forward.",
