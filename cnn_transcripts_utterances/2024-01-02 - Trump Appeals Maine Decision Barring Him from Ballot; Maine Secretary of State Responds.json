I'll get her reaction tonight.Also, Chris Christie joins me with the Iowa caucuses growing closer and any challengers' chances seeming to grow slimmer. And later, you've likely seen the Japanese airliner engulfed in flames. Five people were killed on the smaller plane it hit. New details tonight on how every single one of the nearly 400 people of the airliner got out alive. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin with breaking news. At the start of a year, which will be unlike any un-American political, legal, and constitutional history. A former president running for office again facing 91 federal and state felony charges, also facing two civil trials and fighting efforts to start in several states to remove him from the ballot. That's where we start tonight. With his attorneys late today asking a court to overturn Maine's Secretary of State Shenna Bellows' decision to remove him from the ballot because of his role in the January 6th insurrection. We're also waiting for his appeal on a similar case in Colorado and a filing tonight on the question of whether a former president can even be prosecuted for actions taken while in office. In addition, the former president is also spinning fresh conspiracies about his legal troubles online, all of this with the Iowa caucuses now less than two weeks away. Welcome to 2024. We're going to speak with one of his challengers shortly, former New Jersey Governor, US Attorney Chris Christie, joins us here. But first, the Maine case. CNN's Paula Reid starts us off. So what more do we know about the former president's appeal?",

She is a Democrat, but the process in Maine is that the first stop for any questions about whether someone is eligible to appear on the ballot go to the Secretary of State.Now, in their appeal tonight, they argue that she was, quote, \"a biased decisionmaker\" who have should recused herself, had no legal authority, made multiple errors of law, and acted in arbitrary and capricious manner. I understand her decision was based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. This part of the constitution and who should enforce it, well, these questions have been litigated now across multiple states. And Colorado and Maine opted to remove Trump from the ballot, but the other states, largely on procedural grounds without getting into the merits, have kept him on the ballot. But they've also left open the possibility that this could be litigated through the general election. So, Anderson, unless the Supreme Court really steps in here and provide some guidance to the states on the meaning of this section, this is an issue that could hang over the entire 2024 race.",

It said, look, if someone files an appeal here, then this will be stayed. It'll appear on the primary ballot until the Supreme Court weighs in.Now, Trump has not filed up his appeal, but the Republican Party of Colorado has filed an appeal and that has been recognized as staying the case. It's expected that he will appear on the primary ballot. He is also expected to file his own appeal in that case, but it's unclear when. Now, again, two weeks have passed by. That's a lot of time because while many people do expect the Supreme Court will weigh in here, Anderson, it's not clear how quickly they will do that.

So she did hold the hearing that was provided by Maine law. She sets forth in her opinion that she repeated tonight, she provided the process that statute required to the former president and to the other side during that. And there's no suggestion of what, in particular, he was deprived of the opportunity to present by way of evidence or argument. She gave him every opportunity, including to supplement at the end of the hearing. So I haven't seen anything persuasive from the Trump side about how he was deprived of the opportunity to present specific evidence or arguments before her.

Did Trump, as a factual matter and a legal matter, engage in insurrection however that is defined? And then also this question of do states and the state courts, the Secretary of State have the authority to make those determinations, or is that something that only, let's say, federal courts can decide after a conviction for insurrection and pursuant to legislation enacted by Congress. These are all open, novel, legal questions. And as the Secretary of State said, the US Supreme Court really needs to settle those.

They're artists, Joshua Orr who's 29 interestingly enough, family says he was an advocate for those struggling with mental illness. Justina Hughes who was 28, she was an artist, she loved the music.

I myself was woken up multiple times last night because of these major tremors. But for locals here who call this place home, we experienced that initial 7.5 earthquake.This has just compounded the trauma for them. We spoke to several survivors at a nearby emergency evacuation center and woman, one woman told me how every time an aftershock happens, she gets brought back to that moment, that moment when she thought she and her children were going to die. She says that she starts to shake that she can't eat, that she can't sleep. And we know that these aftershocks aren't going to happen anytime soon. We literally just experienced one. And authorities have warned that a really large one could happen any day now in the coming days. Now I also just want to show you why tens of thousands of people have been taking shelter at these centers rather than going home. We're just outside what we think used to be a warehouse. But as you can see the roof has come down. All these walls have collapsed, the furniture inside. It's just completely destroyed, completely wrecked. And you know these traditional wooden Japanese homes don't stand a chance when it comes to an earthquake of this magnitude. That's why tens of thousands of people are taking shelter at the centers, but they're running out of essential items like diapers, they don't have running water, there's no central heating. So they're crying out to authorities for any assistance that they can get. Now the death toll is currently in the 60s but Japanese authorities fear that this could be much, much higher as the window to find people in the cold shortens and as incoming rain means potential landslides, Anderson.",
