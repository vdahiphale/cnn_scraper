      "sentences": "We're following breaking news for you out of Louisville, Kentucky. You're getting a bird's eye view of the scene there. Police say at least five people are dead and six others injured, including a police officer. The mass shooting occurred at the Old National Bank which is right across the street from Slugger Field. Any moment now we expect to hear from the police, the mayor of Louisville, and the Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. We will bring you that press conference exactly as it happens.We have also learned that President Biden has been informed of the mass shooting. The White House says they will have more to share later on. I want to bring in our senior crime and justice correspondent Shimon Prokupecz. Shimon, what more are you hearing there? We know that this happened before the bank was open around 8:30, which gives us a little bit of a clue of what may have been going on and who the suspect who was now dead is.",

Police officers arriving and then within minutes, that they were there, they had encountered, according to police, they were fired upon, there were gunshots. And then we have seen indications where glass has been broken at the front of what appears to be the front of this bank. It has happened as you said, around 8We're hearing from people inside the bank having to hide inside the vault, the bank's vault to try and protect themselves. And police we believe at this point encountered the gunman as to how the gunman died and ultimately we don't know yet. We're waiting to learn more from police. But it's five dead six injured, according to police, including a police officer who was also injured. And so hopefully here in the next few minutes, we're certainly hoping to learn more information. Certainly you can tell early on when police got there, they went right into action going towards the gunfire. It appears then also searching throughout that area. There's residential buildings, there's a parking lot, other businesses, everything was shut down. Most of that area was cordoned off and shut down.",

The governors -- I mean just such a tragic day in Louisville. The governor has the connection himself to people in the bank, at least two people the governor said had died were close friends of his.But the latest that we learned from this press conference, the latest update very importantly, is that there are four victims who are dead. The gunman is also deceased. Eight people are being treated at the local hospital. Two people in critical condition, one of those in critical condition is an officer who responded to the scene. There are at least two officers shot and one of them is in surgery as we speak. Let me bring in right now. Go ahead, John. I'm sorry. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: One other key piece of information, the officer there just said it does appear that the shooter was a previous employee of the bank. He said that the shooter had a connection to the bank it seems. It appears a previous employee. Also said that it took the police three minutes to show up when they arrived.

As far as the incident is concerned, I mean, what we've heard described is you can only imagine how obscure and violent the scene was that these police officers showed up on only three minutes from the phone call until they arrive on scene which is, you know, really a pretty, pretty remarkable response time.And the shots are still being fired as they arrive. They immediately deploy their own weapons, gain entry to the building. And one way or another we've seen those windows shot out on the front side of the building, engaged with the shooter and then the shooter is killed not -- it's not clear yet whether he was killed from police gunfire or if he took his own life. Obviously, we'll learn more about that as we go forward. Just, you know, maybe the 15th mass shooting in the first 10 days of this month. What we're seeing around the country now are more and more fast, effective, lethal responses by law enforcement, and yet they are still and always will be behind the first shots, the first acts of violence and potentially the first steps and that's how you get situations like we have today.",

They took immediate action to enter had to breach the bank with breaching tools, sledgehammers and so on to get through, confronted the shooter.There is the question that Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey has raised, did they -- did police shoot him in that confrontation or did he take his own life? Still not clear. What we do know is he's a former or current employee of the bank, according to Deputy Chief Humphrey's understand him to be a portfolio -- a syndicate manager and portfolio specialist who started at the bank in 2018, as an intern, worked his way up into a significant position. And apparently, as Juliette said, this is classic workplace violence. What we're told is he was either a former employee or about to become one. It could explain something that we've grappled with in our conversations here this morning, which is, if the bank doesn't open until 9:00 a.m., how did the shooter get in? As a current employee or former employee, he would have been recognized. Somebody may have unlocked the door to let him in. So we're seeing a picture that is starting to become a richer picture. And a little clearer as to motive, which is going to be personal against the bank or a personal against the people inside.",

It's different from the last mass shooting that we all got together to talk about the shooting in Nashville Covenant School. But every one of these is unique in some respect, each one of these mass shooters are different people and potentially carry different motivations, different grievances, different mental health challenges, whatever that mixture might be, that brings them to this moment where they're unleashing this kind of violence on their fellow citizens.But there are also some strong similarities. The similarity is the easy and in most cases, as we've seen, lawful access to high powered military weapons. Now, we don't know what the -- we haven't heard any details about what the shooter was using in this shooting. And we'll, of course learn that as we go a little bit further through the day. But, you know, the thing that links all of our problems with gun violence in this country, be they mass shootings, be at street crime, be it suicide by firearm, is the easy availability, the, you know, how easy it is for every American to acquire these incredibly lethal weapons. So, you know, yes, each one of these situations is different. And it's important for us to know as much as we can about them, and about the shooters who commit them. But I think it's also important to step back and look at those commonalities just address what's undeniable. People get fired around the world and are mad about it every day, and thousands, hundreds of thousands of places, people have mental illness struggles, in every country in the world. People unfortunately take their own lives in every country in the world, but no place on earth experiences, the frequency and the mass violence and particularly related to firearms, like we do here in America.",

I spoke to him a year ago when he survived, you know, murder attempt at his campaign office.So there's an extraordinary tragic connection that so many people have to this type of gun violence. John Miller, you know, in Mayor Greenberg has made, you know, fighting gun violence part of his administration in the short period of time throughout the rest of his campaign and this, but as you pointed out, right from the beginning, if you respond in three minutes, and there are still five people dead, or four people dead plus the shooter, it does tell you the limits of even a perfect response.",

But what we see commonly in the active shooter realm is in the first two and a half to four minutes is usually the key moments of lethality when the active shooter is, is engaged with innocent victims before the police get there.So even if that response is two minutes and 30 seconds, most of the killing at that point is done. And then, you know, if they engage the shooter, we know those three outcomes, either the person surrenders takes their own life or is taken down by police and sometimes killed. But that critical time is why when they get there, there's really much less assessment, you know, much less of the hand wringing, we saw on places like Uvalde, mostly immediate action, rapid deployment, which is what we saw again today.
