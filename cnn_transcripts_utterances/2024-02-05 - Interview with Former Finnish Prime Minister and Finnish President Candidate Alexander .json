The U.S. Senate has finally unveiled a bill tying together border security and support for Ukraine and Israel. The package would transform immigration law and give some $60 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine, a much- needed boost for the beleaguered nation that's mired in a two-year effort to fend off Russia. But the bill has a tough road ahead still, especially in the House, where it's already been declared \"dead on arrival,\" under pressure from Former President Donald Trump. Meantime, uncertainty within Ukraine too as President Zelenskyy tells Italian media, a reset is needed to shake up the country's war effort. But despite being bogged down on the eastern front, there is progress in the south. Kyiv has successfully used drones and other technology to outmaneuver Russia in the Black Sea, as Fred Pleitgen reports from the main port city of Odessa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was one of the most brazen and most successful operations by Ukraine's military intelligence service. Sea drones attacking and, the Ukrainians say, sinking a Russian warship inside occupied Crimea. And he was one of those involved. His call sign is 13, from the elite sea drone unit named Group 13. So secretive, we had to hide his face and change his voice. We used 10 drones in the operation, he says. Six of them hit the Corvette Ivanovets. CNN cannot independently verify that the Ivanovets was sunk, but video provided by the intelligence agency seems to show the mini sea drones evading machine gun fire from the warship and then massive explosions. Their weapons are not designed to deal with such small sea drones, 13 says. In most cases, they use anti-ship guns. Ukraine barely has a functioning navy, but the Magura drones pack a massive punch, around 500 pounds of explosives.",

The Nordic nation recently became the 31st member of NATO and shares an 800-mile border with Russia. They're currently in the midst of a presidential election, but both candidates for the top job agree on supporting Ukraine. Joining me now is Alexander Stubb, who squeaked out a win in the first round and faces the voters again on Sunday. Alexander Stubb, welcome back to our program. I'm going to talk about the election in a second, but I want to know first, after our report from Fred Pleitgen, what you make of the successes? Because really, as you know, there's just a lot of doom and gloom coming from the Ukrainian battlefield.",

And there's been a lot of back and forth in the past two years approaching the anniversary. I do agree with secretary general of NATO that the path towards peace does go through the battlefield. I think right now what Ukraine needs is finance. We got that from both the U.S., hopefully, and from the European Union. It needs weapons. And finally, it needs ammunition. I think we should use the term that Mario Draghi, the head of ECB, used in the old days during the Euro crisis, whatever it takes, we need to help Ukraine.",

So, I don't know. Is Finland grappling with political tensions? You are in a runoff for the next round of voting to be president.

And indeed, the president of Finland is tasked withforeign policy and he or she is also the commander-in-chief. We've done our share and will continue to do that. I know the sums feel a little bit small, but 1.6 billion is not a small figure for us. On top of that, we've given about 0.6 billion on aid. So, we will continue to help Ukraine. And of course, you can ask why. Well, the reason is that we have in our historical memory many skirmishes with Russia. They attacked us in the winter war in the war of continuation. So, we have a very similar experience to the Ukrainians. We can identify with the tragedy that's taking place right now. That's why most Finns stand behind Ukraine.",
