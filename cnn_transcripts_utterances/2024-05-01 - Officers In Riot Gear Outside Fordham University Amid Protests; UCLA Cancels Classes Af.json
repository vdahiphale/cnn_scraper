The college newspaper photographed a counter-protester spraying from an aerosol can. Daily Bruin reporters on the scene were slapped and indirectly sprayed with irritants.

This is the Library Mall at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.There is a mix of students and protesters. A protest organizer tells me that most of the students you see here, Wolf, are protesters, again, very calm here, very different from what we saw this morning. University officials say that this encampment has been up since Monday. And in that time, the students here have been issued warning after warning after warning that there is an explicit ban on camping, and even still those tents remained. So, it was around 7:00this morning that police here at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, as well as local and state police began that law enforcement action that we saw earlier today. And as it was described to me by a protester, police linked up had basically a line with their riot shields and moved into those tents and took down several of them. But, Wolf, I'll take you over to where the tent encampment is. You can get a better sense of it. So, earlier today after that law enforcement action, this was almost all gone except for a few of these tents. In that time, since that law enforcement action happened, it wrapped up around 9:00 this morning Central Time, these tents have gone back up. So, now the big question is, is there going to be another law enforcement action? We've asked that question. We have not yet heard back. The results of the action this morning were 34 arrests. 30 people did not receive charges. Only four people received charges. And some of those include battery on a police officer. Although our understanding is that of the 30 who were released, there is always a chance that they may be cited later. But at present, the majority of those people were detained and released without charges. Again, Wolf, the situation remains very much as it began with this tent encampment. So, we'll see if there's another police enforcement action later on.",

She spent the day focusing in her speech on abortion rights. But how much pressure are she and President Biden facing to speak out about the campus protests all across the country? M.J. Lee is joining us right now. What's the latest on that front, M.J.? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, the focus for the Biden campaign here in Jacksonville today was entirely on the issue of reproductive rights, Vice President Kamala Harris coming to Florida on the same day that a controversial six-week abortion ban went into effect. And the vice president really pointing her finger at the former president, Donald Trump, saying that there's currently a full-on assault on reproductive rights and saying that a second Trump term would mean more bans, more suffering, and less freedom. One thing that the vice president did not mention on stage here in Jacksonville is the eruption of pro-Palestinian protests across college campuses. You know, back in Washington, of course, the White House has been closely monitoring this situation. And we've seen the White House trying to walk this delicate balance of saying that they support the right to peacefully protest and the freedom of speech but also trying to draw the line at any kind of hate speech and anti- Semitism.

So, I do think he's trying to make sure we don't lose the real issue here, which is anti-Semitism, pushing back against hate. But it's a different thing to say you care about the Palestinian people than it is to -- than some of what we're hearing from the protesters. The last thing I'll just mention, I think the size really matters. I mean, I think monitoring how big this really is. As you know, Harvard University is one of the best youth polls.

We know the progressive left is not with him with regard to America's response and support for Israel. But we also know that a lot of moderate swing voters who he carried in 2020, who are probably inclined to be with him, they see what we're seeing on college campuses, this violence, this lawlessness, this recklessness, and it really resonates. I'm just going to disagree with Karen here. I think the president should give a national address. I think he owes it to the young voters here to explain exactly what he is doing with regard to the war in Gaza, what he's asking of Bibi Netanyahu and how he's been working to get a ceasefire. There's a level of educating, be the communicator in chief here. He can't sit back or he can wake up in a moment and realize that this really benefited Donald Trump.",

On the other hand, there are many peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstrators, and they understand that the Democratic Party is deeply divided over the war. And the approach President Biden has chosen to take in, which so far is unconditional military support of Israel with more than 35,000 Palestinians who have been killed, a lot of criticism of the way the war has been conducted.So, I think they are trying to be very careful to not alienate the moderate voters they need to repeat their winning 2020 coalition, but also they really need the young voters and progressive voters, which polls show widely disapprove of the way Biden has handled this war. So, they're sort of trying to walk this middle line of condemning anti-Semitism, but also saying they understand where the protesters are coming from, and there's a right to peaceful protest.

The students have been refusing to leave. The school notified them, that, as a result, they were being suspended. And then a short time ago, the school sent a letter to the NYPD, just like we saw with Columbia University last night, and what we have previously seen with the NYU, asking the NYPD to come in and make arrests and to remove the individuals that were in the lobby. What Fordham says was that there was a clear and present danger, that there was a safety concern, and, regrettably, they needed to ask the NYPD to come in and remove the protesters. Also significantly, what's significant, Wolf, is that Fordham University is now asking the NYPD to remain on their campus, around their buildings, for the graduation on May 22nd. So, this will now be the second university in the city of New York, requesting the presence of law enforcement at their graduation. Right now, most of the people who were outside when we were on last, they've all gone. You can see here, Wolf, they all have left. The NYPD sort of, they came in force. You saw that earlier, about 100 or so officers came in here, they lined the street as they were making the arrests, and many of the protesters left. But the campus, the university, and the building right now is still surrounded by law enforcement, by the NYPD at every entrance and exit, and they remain on the street with this presence outside the university. But certainly a significant development here, that the students, the protesters that were in the lobby here, I don't know how much you could see through this glass, Wolf, but I'm hoping you could see a little, they were just simply camped out here. It was less than, probably about a dozen or so, less than 15 of them. They were in the lobby.

It's classic civil disobedience. The instruction was given to those who wanted to leave could leave. Those who remained would be arrested. They lined up peacefully. And you know, in that genre, it's looked at as a sign of your commitment to the cause. I'm willing to protest. I'm willing to take my arrest. It's called passive resistance.

As dissent against the Israel-Hamas war is intensifying, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been turning up the pressure on Hamas to accept the new proposal to release more hostages and to accept a pause in the fighting in Gaza.Joining us now, Congressman Jim Himes, Democratic of Connecticut, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. He's been briefed on these ceasefire proposals that are now under consideration. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. These hostage and ceasefire talks as you and I well know and our viewers know, they've been going on for many months. How close are the parties right now to a potential breakthrough? And you think that would lower the temperature at college campuses here in the United States? REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yeah. Well, Wolf, you know, it's always unwise to bet on the success of a deal in the Middle East. Sadly all too often, conflicts there go really very, very poorly. But the president, the secretary of state, the director of CIA, you know, the United States government, has really gone to work and put their shoulder to the wheel on trying to get Hamas and Israel, and, by the way, not just the us, but Egypt and Qatar and others the stakes are really pretty high, Wolf. I'm not sure that what happens on the college campuses holds a candle to the stakes in terms of innocent life in Rafah. If a incursion into Rafah can be averted by a deal that will be a lot of lives saved. You know, if a deal is established, it might be something that could serve as a foundation for a larger piece deal. So there's a heck of a lot at stake. Whether what the reverberations would be on campus. I don't know, but I must tell you personally, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that a deal can succeed and that a lot of lives will be saved because of that.",

Possibly a closer comparison to what's going on now took place in the 1980s, when students across America protested against apartheid in South Africa.
