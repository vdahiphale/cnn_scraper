The gulf cartel alone is probably a ten billion dollar entity. But then you have human trafficking. The smuggling of migrants across the Mexican border which runs for many miles has become a boom for a number of the cartels who are making millions and millions from that. And then you have to launder that money, which, you know, there is timeshare scams, financial services companies, things that they are doing with Chinese money launderers, and organized crime groups.

This one on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic at the first public hearing by the House panel investigating COVID. Witnesses called by Republicans made the case that the virus may have been the result of a lab leak in Wuhan, China. We know now that two U.S. intelligence agencies in the Department of Energy and the FBI have now issued low to moderate confidence assessment that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak. That means that they believe the evidence was largely circumstantial. But, there's still no consensus among all U.S. intelligence communities. With us now, Republican Congressman Brad Wenstrup of Ohio. He's the chair of the Select Committee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. He's also a physicians and an Iraq war veteran. Mr. Chairman, thanks for joining us. First, I want to get your overall takeaway on what you and your committee learned in today's hearing. Is the U.S. any closer, do you think, to finding solid definitive evidence about how and where this virus originated and spread? REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): Yeah, I don't know that we'll ever get exact, definitive evidence though. There is no smoking gun at this point. But I think we did make some progress today because, you saw all the witnesses today and really all the members agreeing that it is important that we try to find the origins of COVID. If we are going to move forward, and hopefully this committee can produce a product as we move forward, that will help us to try to predict if there is going to be another pandemic and prepare for it and maybe preventative possible and protect the American people. So, we have to have the serious conversations. So, I thought that was a good start today, as we went forward in that direction. You know, there were interesting moments to. When you talk about nature versus the lab, I think it is hot healthy to have the conversation about both. We had the chance to do that today. But we've seen some curious thing that came out of the testimony today. Dr. Redfield was talking about things that happened in the fall of 2019 in China, where they destroyed the sequences. They had a couple of researchers they got sick during that time. They changed over from civilian control to military control at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. So, we see some things that raised some eyebrows. They also change their ventilation system within that layout. So, those are things that make you curious. And, you know, look, I love for this thing to be from nature. I think that would be the safest thing for mankind is that it came from nature. I do want to look at that. I hope that is what we find. But I do have grave concerns that if it came from a lab, and it was created in the lab which we know that capability exists. We were finding that type of research over there. But if it came out of the lab and was man-made, that's a threat to us and so many ways, and I worry about nefarious behavior with anything.",

ROBERT REDFIELD, FORMER CDC DIRECTOR:  This virus was immediately the most infectious virus -- not the most, I think probably right behind measles -- virus that we have ever seen in fact man. So I immediately said, wait a second, this isn't natural. And then you go back and look at the literature and you find in 2014, this lab actually published a paper that they put the H2 receptor in dehumanized mice so it can infect human tissue. And then you learn that the new COVID, which came from bats, now can hardly replicate in bats. How does that happen? I don't think that answer is going to come from the scientific community. I think that answer is getting from the intelligence community. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, if you have members of an organization that aren't there for the same purpose or not willing to cooperate, then there needs to be some repercussions in some way. But, you know, look, this virus was novel. And no one has seen anything like this before. As we went along in America, people were making decisions, in some cases flying blindly. I don't fault anyone for that. The question is, when we found, when we got more data, when we understand more about the virus. Did we make the correct decisions to? So -- but, as far as the lab goes, I think it is extremely important, especially if we were conducting this type of research or finding it in some way, even their fungible means. There are scientists going back to 2012. There was an interview with Dr. Fauci, where he said I think we can learn a lot by creating these types of viruses, and if we can create them, and I'm paraphrasing here, Jake. If we can create these types of viruses and cure them, then maybe we can take care of any pandemic that comes down the road. I can see where that scientific mind with either. But he was also asked, are you concerned about this potentially coming out of a lab in creating a pandemic? And his thought at that time was, he thought the benefits outweigh the risk and the risk of it looking from a lab is very little.",

I talked to Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey a few days ago. He said it is not that he is a pretty Republicans on this. He told me it is just that he is against what D.C. did here. He said, if anything they should be raising penalties, not lowering them in crimes like robberies and carjackings. Now, other Democrats like Elizabeth Warren will be voting against this. She said this is stomping on Washington, D.C.. Those were her words. And there are some other Democrats that of course will be voting against this. But on the whole, we are going to see pretty bipartisan support in favor this resolution that will block this D.C. crime bill. And as you mentioned, the president kind of angering some House Democrats on this. When it went through the House, he had not yet said what he would do if this were to get to him. That he would veto it, or just let it be. And when he came to speak to Senate Democrats, he said he would just let it be. He would not veto. And some 173 House Democrats voting against the measure that would rescind this bill, they were kind of thought they were hung out to dry this.

We need to make sure that everybody understands that the terrifying crime of carjackings is totally unacceptable. We need our police and our law enforcement to work together so we can effectively prosecute cases. But Councilmember George is exactly right. The deterrent effect for criminal loss is when people know with certainty and swiftness that there are going to be consequences. Long, long prison sentences have not proven to be a deterrent.

Four firefighters were in the truck, but fortunately only had minor injuries. And, Jake, we don't know is that if that self-driving feature was actually turned on at the time. But if it was, NHTSA documents show that it would be at least the 17th time that a Tesla with that autopilot feature engage has hit an emergency vehicle while it is parked in the road. And, just last month, Tesla was required to issue a recall of 363,000 vehicles because of that software, because of the full self-driving software that investigators felt was not sufficiently obeying traffic safety laws, like, for example, running soft signs.
