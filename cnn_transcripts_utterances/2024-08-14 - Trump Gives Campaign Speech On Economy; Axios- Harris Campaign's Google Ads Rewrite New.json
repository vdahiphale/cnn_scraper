We will bring this to you live once it begins. Now it comes as both campaigns now are making big plays in the Tar Heel State, with the Trump and Harris teams spending a combined $25 million in ads there, while Republicans have won North Carolina in ten out of the past 11 elections, Democratic strategists see the state as a place Harris could win this November. The vice president planning to hold an event in North Carolina on Friday, which her campaign says she will detail economic good policy. This all comes as CNN is reporting the Trump allies are begging the former president to just stay on message after several weeks of Trump obsessing over crowd size, implying the Harris campaign used A.I. to fake her own crowd size, and attacking Harris's race and her intelligence. Earlier today, before heading to North Carolina, Trump was in Florida casting an early vote in the states primary, where he once again talked crowd size. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Trump campaign selected North Carolina for this speech today. There's also a reason why the Vice President Kamala Harris will be in the same battleground state on Friday. Let's dive into the politics at play here. Really, you can kind of look at the strategy. Well, actually, the former president is taking the stage right now. We'll get into the details of the politics of the pathways and the population in a moment. But right now, the former president is ready to speak on the economy. (MUSIC) MATTINGLY:  Well, you see the signs that Kristen Holmes was just referencing in her live shot behind the former president. No tax on Social Security, no tax on tips. Two of the kind of new policies the former president has rolled out, explaining how exactly in practice that would work, particularly on issues that economists and both sides aren't totally supportive of on some level. It's still very much an open question, but it is certainly two focal points of his economic message. She's seized on over the course of the last couple of weeks. I think what's going to be interesting as we heard from Kristen Holmes and her great reporting, looking at the excerpts of the speech, the planning of these remarks heading into them is whether or not the former president will actually stick to the remarks, stick to the science that's around him. It is a critical issue that the campaign very clearly believes draws a very important contrast, one in which they had large vintages over President Biden in poll after poll after poll, advantages they've seen winnow in recent polling as well. So the ability to define Harris as being part of the Biden-Harris administration on the economy which people up to this point had not been very supportive of or approved of is a critical part of this and doing it in a battleground state that honestly a few weeks ago, we talked to Democrats and Republicans, they said was mostly out of reach for President Biden now very much seems to be back in play with both campaigns, spending millions of dollars there. The Trump campaign surprising I think a lot of people at the end of the month dropping their first major ad buy there. Here is the former president come up to a lectern now.

It was true there was significant growth during the Trump administration. There's also been significant growth during the Biden administration. So, there's been no jobs, losing jobs with the Biden administration, that created over 15 million jobs. He continues to say it the largest tax cut in history. It was certainly a significant legislative achievement for the former president and Republicans in the House and the Senate. It was nowhere near the largest tax cut in history. But more than anything else, he underscored that there are very clear differences in terms of the economic priorities, the economic policies, and the economic messages from the two candidates here. We should hear more from Kamala Harris, vice president when she speaks in North Carolina about the economy on Friday. I do want to bring my panel in. And, Mark, I want start with you.

He claimed California where a whole lot of people happily live is unlivable. He claimed that we're a banana republic and a third world country, I think a lot of people who dispute that. But also a whole bunch of claims, Phil, filled that were just flat-out false. He again said that Kamala Harris was made the border czar, put by President Biden in charge of the border. That didn't happen. In reality, she was given a much more limited immigration-related assignment tasked with dealing with the so-called root causes of migration in certain Central American countries. He repeated his claim that she's allowed 20 million people into the country. Aside from the question of her own role and responsibility, the total number of border so-called encounters under Biden and Harris is 10 million and far from all of those people were actually allowed in, that includes the people who are expelled from the country upon arriving at the border. He boasted of how good African American poverty, the poverty level was during his administration, he didn't mention, its actually fallen to a low lower level. A new record beating the Trump era record under Biden and Harris, he called switching candidates and the Democratic primary, a minor form of cheating. It's not a form of cheating at all. It's allowed completely within the law and the rules. And he spoke of how the Inflation Reduction Act, he said, gave us record inflation. The U.S. has never had record inflation under Biden and Harris, even the Biden/Harris peak of 9.1 percent was about a 40-year high, nowhere near the all-time high of about 23.7 percent. And that 9.1 percent number has come way down since then. It's now 2.9 percent. So, whatever peak reached before so were near it now. And finally, he spoke of so-called very good polls for him coming out right now and claimed we're leading. He might be seeing private numbers we're not seeing, but in the national averages of public polling, he is not leading. He's now trailing -- Phil.",

So, people's economic situation is getting better. There also substantive things that Kamala Harris can talk about that she helped achieve in the White House, things like capping the cost of insulin, junk fees -- junk fee regulation. I mean, there are tangible things she can point to, but had made a difference in people's lives. That's -- so that's one issue. The facts don't exactly line up with where his argument is.

TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION:  It's resonated and I think that's why Vice President Harris decided it was something and she can get behind, too. And quite frankly, I would love to hear both of them talk more about how they want to in taxation on tips and what that would actually look like. How they would address any other consequences of changing the tax policy, the impact on the deficit, for example, the impact on people who aren't currently tipped employees who might like to take advantage of a new tax or new elimination of taxes on tips. So I think this is why -- this is why journalists have been saying Kamala Harris needs to answer more questions about what she would like to do, but this is also wide journalists need to be asking more of Donald Trump. He gave a great stump speech today. Relatively speaking for Donald Trump, this was a pretty good one from what we heard. He didn't go too far off -- off the rails, but he's still very light on details, even about the ending taxation on Social Security wages, pretty populist. If you want to talk about stealing, that's a bill that Democrats in Congress have already filed to stop taxation on Social Security wages. But again, it's okay if he agrees with them, but I'd love to hear more about what that would look like.",

Thanks so much for coming in. Appreciate you all very much. In our health lead, a warning for those who consume artificial sweeteners. A study now links the common sugar substitute erythritol to hire a higher risk of blood clots and heart disease. CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, is on call this week on the science behind the sweeteners. Sanjay, tell us about the latest study. Start with what is erythritol and how is it related to heart health. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDNET:  Yeah. I mean, there's so much confusion about these -- these artificial sweeteners, these substitutes. People understandably take them, I think in the pursuit of good health but they don't always get that. It's a bit complicated. And the headlines, as you mentioned, Phil, are around erythritol. So this is one of those sugar substitutes. It's specifically a sugar alcohol. It naturally occurs in certain fruits and vegetables. But what we're talking about here is the mass production of it, the synthetic production of it in law large numbers. It looks like sugar, Phil. It tastes like sugar, and it's generally recognized as safe by the FDA. But the problem is that within the last couple of years, there's been some studies that have come out saying, hey, look, this does seem to be linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke, which by the way, a lot of people are taking these sugar substitutes to avoid that. And that's what they\\re getting instead. What this latest study really was trying to figure out what is going on here, what's the mechanism? So it's really interesting, Phil, they had 20 people, so they had 10 people who took 30 grams of erythritol and they had ten people who just took glucose, sugar and they fed them this and then basically measured all these things in their blood afterwards. And what they found as you just saw on the screen, there, was that the risk of clotting specifically was two times higher in the group that took the erythritol. So the people who took they're just regular sugar. They did knock that increase in overall clotting. So look, these sugar substitutes again, I want to be careful here because they can be really helpful for people, for example, who are diabetic. But we're seeing this concern about heart disease, about stroke, and now clotting.",

The brain is getting all the sweetness, but they're not getting the calories. So as a result, sometimes people will go out and forage for the calories later on. It's the story of someone drinking a bunch of diet soda during the day and then eating ice cream at night. I mean, that would be a problem. And what they find over the long term if you're trying to use these sugar substitutes to lose weight, they're not really effective for that. Again, they can be helpful for diabetics specifically. And, you know, we talked to the industry as well about this and they say, look, he beat be a little cautious with interpreting these studies. I want to read this for you.They say: Consumers should interpret the results of the pilot with extreme caution because the limited the number of participants, a total of ten, were given excessive amounts of erythritol and that exceeded the maximum amount approved in any single beverage in the United States. That's true, Phil. So just to put it in perspective, 30 grams of erythritol is what the study consisted of. A diet soda would have about somewhere around seven grams of erythritol. But people drink more than one. You may have three or four during the day. And I think that's what's got people sort of particularly concerned. But I think there's enough cause for concern where people should say, look, it's not, we shouldn't just have as much of this stuff as we want.",
