The way this is going to happen, this is a plan signed off on by the EPA. Norfolk Southern is going to -- There's at least two -- two tracks that go through this area where the derailment happened. They're going to pull up the Southern end of it. They're going to -- they're going to remove those tens of thousands of tons of toxic soil under those Southern tracks. They're going to replace it with fresh earth. And they're going to put those tracks back on. They're going to do the same thing on the North side of those tracks. The other thing the EPA is going to force them to do is test the air for, and the area for dioxins. This is something that residents, you know, they are upset. They want certainty. They want answers. And all of those things are hard to come by. But this -- the dioxins, possible chemicals, harmful chemicals that were created by the fire from all the other chemicals that burned in that train. And then the other thing happening right now is the NTSB is starting to dig more into this investigation. They're looking at the tank cars themselves. They're now issuing an advisory to other freight carriers. Because when that fired happened, and you had those cars filled with vinyl chloride, it got so hot the covering of the valve that was meant vent the car, that melted. It was made of aluminum. That melted, blocking them from being able to vent, which obviates the entire reason for the valve itself. It was supposed to be a release valve. That meant that they had to do an emergency venting of those -- of those cars which created even a bigger problem for the air and for residents here. We expect to see even more work here along the tracks as the day goes on now, that they have that plan in front of them. It is clear that they will -- they will stay very busy.

This was the facade of La Azteca Meat Market, which collapsed last night in those high winds that you were talking about, crushing about a half dozen cars underneath.But by and large, you know, this storm system which was massive, about 500 miles long, which stretched from San Antonio all the way into Southeast Oklahoma, you know, moved through this area very quickly with those high, intense winds. But by and large, you know, most of the area in this North Texas area unscathed by this storm. So there are still over about 100,000 customers without power because of these high winds knocking over power lines or, you know, blowing up transformers, that sort of thing. That's the kind of issues that people are dealing with this morning. The good news is no injuries, no deaths being reported because of this storm. But it's the sheer size. It's the second severe storm outbreak we've seen just this week. We were in Oklahoma earlier this week, where we saw those intense, high winds. So really, this storm serving as a reminder that the spring storm season is off to a very early start, Don.",

We are in a neighborhood here in Shreveport where that tornado moved through and where we're seeing some of the most significant damage. It took out what we believe to be an insurance company, a business out here. You can see the folks already started to clear up some of this debris. It took out that sign. They've already got a tarp out here. Now the most serious damage that we found on our drive early this morning was this laundromat out here. You can see what we're talking about. Just the roof of this place was taken out. The front side of this business fell on these three cars. That tornado, we're told, again, was on the ground for under a minute. The folks that were interviewed out here told us it was anywhere between 30 to 40 seconds. Now, we -- we heard from someone that was inside of this laundromat. He was telling folks, look, it's too windy out here. The weather did not look good. All of this happened right before that tornado hit. Here's what he told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The man who is accused of threatening to kill Jewish state officials in Michigan is making his first court appearance today.We broke the news on the program yesterday, as federal authorities say that Jack Carpenter first made the threats online; had plans to go to Michigan to actually carry out those ideas, those threats. The FBI says that he wrote posts supporting an anti-government extremist movement that is classified as domestic terrorism. CNN's Omar Jimenez has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The threats were allegedly posted on the Internet from out of state by suspect Jack Eugene Carpenter III: \"I'm heading back to Michigan now threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan government if they don't leave or confess, and now.\" Later adding, \"Any attempt to subdue me will be met with deadly force in self-defense.\" Court documents show his mother told investigators he had three handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, and two rifles. A law enforcement source tells CNN among those specifically targeted, Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel. She says, \"The FBI has confirmed I was a target of the heavily armed defendant in this matter.\" She's the second high-ranking Michigan official to be targeted in recent years, after a plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer was foiled in 2020. This time it was allegedly about more than just one official.",
