Now nine candidates are vying for the job of speaker, but the reality remains the exact same for all of them as it did for Jim Jordan before them, it is not clear if any of them or anyone can get the 217 votes needed to actually win the gavel.CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill for us. So, Lauren, what are you hearing and where do things stand now with these nine people who would like to be speaker?",

      "sentences": "Yes, as you can see, Kate, from the fact that there are nine candidates vying for this job, the race is really wide open. I think the expectation is that Representative Tom Emmer, who is the majority whip, probably has the lead in some significant ways. One of which is that he has the infrastructure. The other piece of that is the fact that he got the endorsement from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who said he was the guy for the job because he has the experience and that this is not a moment to have a rookie trying to figure out how to run the House Republican conference given the defections and divisions you have seen up until this point.Now, tonight there's going to be a candidate forum for these nine members to make their pitch to their Republican colleagues behind closed doors. Then tomorrow morning, at 9:00 a.m., the vote begins. Now, that is going to happen in a closed-door session. They're going to try to get a speaker designee. But, Kate, again, it's not clear that whoever emerges from that meeting is going to be able to go to the floor and get the 217 votes that's required to become the speaker of the House. Kate.",

I mean, first of all, you know, we are in an unprecedented scenario in that we've never had a successful motion to, in effect, fire the speaker by vacating the chair. And then we've seen the breakdown of the traditional party order. I mean, you know, when -- you can vote -- people can vote against their party on individual issues, but in the House you are supposed to vote with your party on the organization of the chamber. And the notion that the person who received the most votes in the closed session could not have their opponents or their critics fall into line on the floor is - is truly remarkable. As long as that goes on, obviously, this could - this could extend a very long time and those Republicans, who are more institutionalists, or for more competitive districts, they do have that option. I mean they have the option of aligning with the Democrats to pick sort of a, you know, a bipartisan speaker. I think it's going to have to go further into chaos before they are truly willing to countenance that.",
