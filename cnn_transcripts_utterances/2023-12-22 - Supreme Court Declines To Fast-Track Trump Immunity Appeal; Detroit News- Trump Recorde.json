The former president says he knows nothing about Hitler, while defending and repeating his Hitler-like language.Plus, a survivor of the October 7th massacre and her remarkable journey to find a man who saved her life and the lives of many others that terrible day. Good evening. Anderson is off tonight. And we begin with the Supreme Court's decision not to decide, at least just yet, the central question that could invalidate many of the charges against the former president, namely, does Donald Trump enjoy immunity from prosecution for actions he took as president? The judge, in his January 6th trial, ruled he did not. His lawyers appealed to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Special Counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to bypass the DC Circuit and take it now, and today the court said no. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us with more. So, Katelyn, we have a decision not really clear -- not a clear understanding of the explanation of why the justices decided this. But walk us through what we know, how many votes this got and so forth.",

And it's a question of whether Trump has immunity because he was president that would allow him to essentially be avoiding any trial as a criminal defendant.And so, what is happening now is that instead of it going directly to the Supreme Court after the trial judge made the decision and said, no, Donald Trump, you do not have immunity, we're not going to dismiss this case against you, you're going to go to trial. Instead, it's going to go to the appeals court above the trial judge, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. They are indicating that they are ready to go very fast.

He will, if he wins, order the Justice Department to drop these cases. And so, he does not want this case to go to trial. It's not good for any nominee of a major party to be sitting in court during the general election. And so, yes, they view this as a win. And they would say it was a win, frankly, even if it wasn't.

The fact set around what happened in the leadup to January 6th and his efforts to subvert the election results is going to involve a parade of his former and, in some cases, current advisers showing up in court to testify that he, you know, in many instances, was told that he had lost and about other things that he was saying.

And so, I don't think through that lens we'll get any details about the source material or who recorded it.

If we add everybody else, Pam, the figure is close to a quarter of a million.

He also said that CBP and other federal agencies need more resources from Congress to both enhance the security at the border and the country as a whole.
