Private boats, some of them longer than a football field. They can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and it seems there's plenty of buyers. Since the pandemic, more people than ever are building and buying them. Business is reportedly booming. They've become status symbols for the superrich and striking symbols of the economic inequality. Their impact on the environment and the oceans is a topic of debate. The U.S. has seized some superyachts of Russia's elite and now your tax dollars are surprisingly being spent to keep their ships in tip- top shape. CNN's Alisyn Camerota takes us inside this hidden world of superyachts and her first stop at the Monaco Yacht Show. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Monaco. Land of the ultra-wealthy. And dotting the harbor like crown jewels are some of the world's largest superyachts. Bonjour. (Voice-over): That's no surprise considering this is the richest country in the world per capita. People here don't pay income tax, which as you can imagine, attracts millionaires and billionaires from all over the globe.",
