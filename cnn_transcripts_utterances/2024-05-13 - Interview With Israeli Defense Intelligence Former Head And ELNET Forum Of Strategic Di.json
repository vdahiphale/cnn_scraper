I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. In Israel, it's Memorial Day, more solemn this year in the shadow of October 7th, when more than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds were taken hostage by Hamas. But also, a more divisive time than usual, as government ministers find themselves booed and heckled over their war in Gaza. Now, in its eighth month, more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed. There's no ceasefire or any hostage deal in sight. Many now are asking what the Israeli government plan is. Does it have one? So far, some areas, the IDF says it's cleared in Gaza are being reoccupied by Hamas fighters. As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says, a full on Rafah offensive would lead to even more anarchy and chaos in the enclave. Analysts say Israel is losing allies and risking becoming a pariah state. MAJOR GENERAL AMOS YADLIN (RET.), FORMER HEAD, ISRAELI DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE: is the former chief of the Israeli military intelligence, and he joins me now from Tel Aviv. Major General, welcome back to the program. So, you know, I made a whole lot of statements there. It is Memorial Day, and it's one of the most solemn that you've had in a long, long, long time. And I wonder whether you think that all the loss that you've experienced since October 7th is being rightfully and efficiently, I'm going to say avenged or even justified in these last seven months. MAJ. GEN. AMOS YADLIN: No way that -- no doubt that the goals and the objectives of the war were fully justified. Israel was attacked by a terror organization that killed and burned and raped hundreds of its civilians in the Western Negev, and this is a kind of pogrom that was never done since the Holocaust. And Israel decided that it will never happen again. And Israel will destroy Hamas and will bring back the hostages.",

And I wonder what you think then of analysts. I mean, even Americans who are very concerned that Israel, by its actions in Gaza, which you've already said the goals are not being reached, is making itself into a pariah and isolated state.

But in the meantime, we're witnessing from abroad, anyway, what looks to be like whack-a-mole, you know, you go to -- whether it's al-Shifa or Jabalia or the north or whatever, declare some kind of victory, leave, and up pops Hamas again, filling a vacuum. The U.S. Secretary of State Blinken has said, Israel is on the trajectory, potentially, to inherit an insurgency with many armed Hamas left, or if it leaves a vacuum filled by chaos, filled by anarchy, and probably refilled by Hamas. So, what would you advise your government as a better military operation, better strategy here, tactics?",

And in a way, the fact that in the West Bank, there is a Palestinian Authority, but security is delegated to Israel because we cannot have terror 12 miles from Tel Aviv. And this model should be developed in Gaza whenever Hamas is gone. You're absolutely right, the Hamas is not gone yet. And Blinken saying that Hamas -- pointing that Hamas is coming back, on the other hand, is unhappy with Israel continue the war. And also saying that Israel gave a very painful and generous parameters for a hostages deal and Hamas rejected it. So, they left no other choice but going back to these areas, because we don't want to occupy Gaza, but we don't want Hamas to be there. And as I said, in Afghanistan, it took 20 years, and you haven't achieved the goal. In Mosul and Raqqa, it took nine months or 12 months, and you achieved the goal. So, if you fight a terror organization that use the population as a human shield and doesn't care about what happened to 2 million Gazans. 2 million Gazans are not in their home. 2 million Gazans are moving from place to place and Sinwar doesn't care. So, why put the onus on Israel?",

It's better than the American numbers in Afghanistan. And I'm not mentioning you Tokyo or Dresden. So, it is difficult. But Israel is doing all it can to minimize the fact that innocent civilians are attacked. We never attack innocent civilians. We never burn them. We never rape them. We never kill children in front of their kids, as Hamas have done. So, we try to minimize it as much as we can, but it's not easy because this is exactly Hamas kind of behavior. The embargo on the 2,000-pound bombs is a huge mistake. Because Israel is not using them now in Gaza. We do need them against Hezbollah, against Iran. The U.S. interests are, in a way, a counterproductive here. They are not advancing them. If they don't want a regional war, why to encourage Hezbollah and Iran by telling them that Israel have no munition? In a way, they even encourage Sinwar, say, OK, the Americans and the Israelis are now fighting each other. This is good for Sinwar from strategic point of view. So, I think this is a huge mistake. And the Americans, in a way, disturbs their own objective. And the Middle East is looking. The people in the other allies' countries of America are asking themselves, is that the way that America is using its ally? It's not a good idea and I hope it will not happen.",

And if we want to look at this purely from a number's perspective, the offensive in Mosul against ISIS, which lasted about 18months, killed at the top sort of estimate of civilian casualties around 18,000, 20,000. So, Israel has by far surpassed that. And that was a very heavily densely populated civilian area. But then also this whole sort of comparison of combatant to civilian, it's a very skewed way of looking at the numbers because it's not necessarily about the overall death toll, it's about death per strike. It's about all of those strikes that Israel has launched using these massive 1,000, 2,000- pound bombs that have leveled entire blocks, entire neighborhoods to go after one or two fighters. And so, you have a number of well documented isolated incidents where, you know, dozens of civilians have been killed and some upwards of a hundred to, what, go after one or two low level fighters?",

This reminds me, even though the economy and the economic data is actually significantly better now than it was in 2012, but I worked for President Obama when he ran for re-election. This period, you remember well, I'm sure the economy was still recovering. And the argument that President Obama made at the time was that, I'm going to be the one fighting for you, and if you give me another four years, I'll continue to make it better. And that needs to be center in this. It's not about accomplishments. It's not about data even.

Then came The Great Depression. Then came World War Two. Then came the baby boom and years of tremendous economic progress in Europe coming out of the rubble of war. So, by 1960, the average immigrant in the United States, the average foreign-born resident was older than the average American. And the percentage of people who were born in another country had dropped to around 5 percent, which is a low that we hadn't seen in over a century. at that point, during the hot cauldron of the Cold War, Lyndon Johnson, leaders of the House and Senate talked about how this looks to the rest of the world that we made it difficult for people from other parts of the world to get here, and they began to tinker with the machinery of immigration.
