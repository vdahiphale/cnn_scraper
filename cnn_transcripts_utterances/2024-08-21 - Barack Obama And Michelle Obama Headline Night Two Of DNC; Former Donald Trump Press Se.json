But even more striking to me was the way that this night of the convention dealt with the potential threats of a second Trump term in a very different way, I think, than Joe Biden had been doing. Because tonight was less about preventing the darkness that could come from a vindictive Donald Trump in the White House again, than it was about encouraging voters to envision the morning, which, you know, we heard specifically, almost like a morning in America of a less divided America. It reminded me that a Democratic consultant said to me last week that the last voters Harris needs, she has to inspire, not scare. And I thought tonight was a striking pivot in that direction. CHURCH: Right. And we also saw Republican speakers Tuesday night at the DNC, including former Trump Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who revealed Trump's true feelings about his own supporters, and it wasn't complimentary.

We're not going back argument. Now, you know, electorally, there are not a lot of hardcore Republicans who are going to vote for Kamala Harris, no matter how deep their concerns about Donald Trump, but there are clearly, I mean, in the last few elections, we have seen -- the results we have seen in states like Georgia and Arizona and even Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin would not have been possible if there were not a substantial number of independents who previously leaned toward Republicans, who are now voting for Democrats because they can't abide the Trump definition of the party, and this was clearly an attempt to create a permission structure for more of those voters to make that transition.",

Tens of thousands of protesters have descended on the city to voice their opposition to the war in Gaza.CNN's Ryan Young has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RYAN YOUNG, SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So, a lot of back and forth tonight with protesters and police. I want to give you the scene the officers who stacked here, ready in their riot gear, their helmets, they're on the right. Now, that's where protesters have been most of the night. They moved them back this direction. Now, you can also see on the other side of the street, there's another group of officers who have all lined this street right here. They created this barrier so that the protesters could not leave this boxing intersection. The building they were all protesting is right over here. If you walk this way, you can see this building right here at central tower. That's where the Israeli consulate is. Some of those protesters obviously wanted to get inside, but that was stopped by the large police presence. Now, you look over here, that's the last bit of group of protesters that has left, a small fracture of them took off in another direction, and there were bike officers who followed them as well. This has been intense, and I have to say that, because there's been real pushing and shoving between protesters and police officers, and we believe at least one person was taken into custody. At some point, officers addressed a large group of protesters and asked them through the area. We walk this direction, you can see the mess that has been left behind by some of the signs that were thrown out here, but this is really the intersection of where everything we've been talking. So, protesters like this one here have continued to stay in the street, get in the face of the officers, yelling, and there's been back and forth. So far, it doesn't seem like there's been any injuries. Now, a counter protesting group showed up about a half hour ago. They were on the other side of that large continued police officers. I'm going to ask my cameraman to raise his camera up just a little bit, and if you look in the distance, you can see that the officers have actually shut down that backside of the road as well. So, this was a coordinated effort to make sure this entire intersection was protected, but at the same time, the intensity of this situation really, really got pushed into a corner at some point, as people started falling or running, that was shut down. Doesn't seem like anybody was injured at this point, but we continue to watch the action that's going on here on the streets. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I was in al-Aqsa's ICU 24 hours earlier, and there they have a 13- year-old boy who has 60 percent of his body covered in second and third degree burns. And the reason why this child is in the ICU is because the hospital didn't have enough bandages to be able to keep his injuries, his burn injuries, sufficiently sanitized, and that resulted in a blood infection and early sepsis. There's also a little girl. She's a year and a half. She needs to be moved to another facility for a surgery, but they're missing a small little piece of plastic, basically to be able to insert a tube into her chest that would then potentially allow her to be stabilized. But they don't have this particular piece in pediatric sizes. There are no free beds in the ICU, and so when you look at scenes of these mass casualties coming in, you can't help but think, you know, if one of them needs to be in the ICU, if one of them needs these basic supplies, the hospital just can't provide it because it's not available.",

CNN's Jeremy Diamond met one woman whose husband and daughter were killed in an attack in their neighborhood.

There are the streets and homes scarred by war, this building where she recited her final prayers, and then there is the indelible sight of her father and sister shot dead before her eyes. Sham's mother Sanaa, who suffered burns as a child, will never forget that day. SANAA ABU TABAQ, SURVIVED ATTACK THAT KILLED HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER (through translator): I wish we hadn't returned. I lost the most precious people. I lost the most precious thing for me, my daughter. DIAMOND (voice-over): But there is more to that story than tragedy and loss in war-torn Gaza. Sham and Sanaa's story is unlike any other we have come across in ten months of war. That's because Sanaa doesn't just accused Israeli troops of killing her husband, Akram and daughter Yasmeen, an Israeli soldier may also have saved her life. On November 24th, the week-long truce between Israel and Hamas begins, thousands of people begin heading back to their homes in northern Gaza. Sanaa and her family are among them. But as they approach the Salati (ph) neighborhood where they lived, they find themselves walking alone and then shots ring out. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): May God bless her soul, Yasmeen. One bullet in her back and one in her shoulder. I was hit in my leg and my husband was hit in his stomach. So we all sat on the ground. We couldn't move and we were bleeding. Sham is the only one who wasn't hit. DIAMOND (voice-over): Her husband soon decides to crawl away to try to find help. But moments later, he is shot again, fatally. Sanaa lies on the ground bleeding, cradling her eldest daughter, Yasmeen. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): She was saying, 'Mom, did you die? Please don't die and leave us. I'm still alive.'

What happens next is captured on muted body camera footage provided by the Israeli military. Two soldiers treating Sanaa's gunshot wounds. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): I told him, 'Please have mercy. Didn't you see my daughter who was killed at the door? I beg you, please don't kill us, it's enough.' He told me, 'It wasn't us who killed her. It was Sinwar.' I told him, 'I have nothing to do with Sinwar, or anyone else. You took my daughter and you took everything.' DIAMOND (voice-over): The medic soon realizes her condition is serious. She needs to get to a hospital. SANAA ABU TABAQ (through translator): The one who spoke Arabic started to make his calls. Then he told me, 'We decided to help you and take you with us.' DIAMOND (voice-over): Israeli soldiers carry Sanaa out of the building on a stretcher, her hands clutching Sham. Nothing about this footage should be extraordinary. Militaries must protect and care for wounded civilians when possible under international law. But in this war, this site is exceedingly rare. For eight months, Sanaa and Sham have lived in this Jerusalem hospital. Their journey here was no less traumatic. Interrogation and strip searches came before treatments at an Israeli hospital. Israeli authorities are now planning to send them back to Gaza next month, unless another country takes them in. The Israeli military for its part told CNN in a statement that Sanaa and her family were caught in the crossfire. The IDF says its soldiers issued verbal warnings after the family stumbled upon a concealed military position, drawing a militant attack. The four people who entered in the area were caught in the intense exchange of fire between the terrorists and our troops. The troops did not open fire at the four people, nor did they aim at them.
