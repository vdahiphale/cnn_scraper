I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we're following the breaking news out of Morocco, where more than 1,000 people were killed, after a powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck late Friday. It was the strongest to hit the area in over a century. The epicenter was located in the High Atlas Mountains, just southwest of Marrakech, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Rescuers are now struggling to access the hardest hit areas after roads were damaged. Hospitals are filling up, prompting many patients to wait outside as hospital beds were moved onto the streets. More than 700 people are in critical condition. And with intense aftershocks expected in the area, officials believe the death toll will steadily rise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMED TAQAFI, WITNESS (through translator): I heard people screaming. Everyone went out of their houses. The street is full of people. An women's screaming, that's what happened. Even now, people can't go back home because they are still afraid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, there are a lot of remote towns and villages in those mountainous areas. And these rescue teams need to get to all of them because the by all reports, it is in those areas where the injured and the dead are concentrated. So, they need to get there. But the Moroccans clearly don't have the manpower or the equipment to reach all those areas simultaneously. And keep in mind, Fredricka, that really the first 72 hours after an earthquake are critical. It's after 72 hours if you're caught under the rubble and you have no water, you will die of dehydration. So, time is of the essence. At this point, the death toll has now exceeded 1,000. The last we've heard from Moroccan state television is 1,037. But we have seen the death toll steadily increasing throughout the day, as those rescue teams are getting more and more access to the areas that have been hit. But there have been aftershocks, more than a dozen -- most people in these affected areas slept outside because of fear that more -- another earthquake or just simply strong aftershocks, as well. Now, help is on the way. A variety of countries, including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and others are sending teams and supplies. And some of these countries like Turkey and Israel have lots of experience in dealing with this kind of natural disaster. But the Moroccans clearly are in desperate need of all the help they can get given the strength of this earthquake. Fredricka?",

That this was an earthquake.And immediately, basically, after, I started shaking and shaken up with this stuff in Marrakech that filled the sky. Yes, this cloud dust basically above the city. We, that's me and other hotel guests then made our way out and through the narrow alleyways Marrakech very quickly to get to open areas where we were hoping we'd be far enough away from falling debris, be at -- toward buildings or a wall. Marrakech, obvious with ancient city walls (PH). We were quite worried about because we'd also seen some of the damage that they had come under. Things piling and falling off wards.

At first in stretch has been brought out and destroyed half that one person wraps carpet.

But there were real concerns going into this summit, that the gathered leaders would not be able to come to any form of agreement, in part, because of the Ukraine war, because Vladimir Putin isn't attending because he's wanted for alleged war crimes. And Xi Jinping canceled at the last minute.But in the end, everybody was able to agree on a common statement. It stopped short of condemning Russia, but it did go deep into the Ukraine war. Saying that all states must refrain from the use of force to seek territorial acquisition, that the threat of nuclear weapons is inadmissible, and that the geopolitical security issues can hurt the entire economy, and that the Ukraine war is having a terrible impact on the economy, and particularly, on the world's poorest countries. Ukraine isn't happy with this. Its foreign ministry has said this hasn't gone far enough that there's nothing that the G20 countries should be proud of. But the fact that they're able to come out with a statement is a sign of at least they can get around in a same room and agree on something. They also agreed on some climate change measures, they want to triple the amount of renewable energy capacity by 2030. And there is a significant outreach to the world's poorer countries. For example, inviting the African Union to be a member of the G20, which I guess theoretically would make it the G21. And this gave President Biden a chance to come out and present himself as a defender of poorer countries. One of the measures he announced was an initiative to create an economic corridor, linking India to the Middle East, to Europe. Take a listen to what he had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is essentially being carried by rescuers on a stretcher, through what is really more really than 3-1/2 thousand feet through Turkey's third deepest cave. Now, as you mentioned there, he suffered from gastrointestinal bleeding last week, and he has been receiving medical attention at base camp in the depths of this cave. But this is going to be a long and complex operation. Typically, it will take an experienced cave at around 16 hours to make it to the surface under ideal conditions, but this is going to take a lot longer than that and they are taking extra care because of the delicate health situation that Mark Dickey is in and, of courses, a lot of the passages in this cave are very narrow, they are very winding, and so this will pose an obstacle to rescuers as well. He is, of course, being transported mostly via stretcher. So, that will certainly be a challenge to overcome. Now, we've heard from the European Cave Rescue Association, who I've been lending hand in this rescue mission. They say that so far, the plan is to divide the ascent into seven segments with a separate rescue team overseeing the process for each section. And this is a really multinational rescue effort. We're talking about teams from Turkey, Hungary, Croatia, Bulgaria, Italy, and Poland, all taking part. Around 180 rescuers on the ground. So, days ahead until Mark Dickey is out.

He's worried about the Russians responding with nuclear weapons to Ukrainian attacks. But on the other hand, he's not allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves fully. He did, you know, the right thing at the beginning of this conflict, but because he cut off communications at this particular juncture for that sneak attack, it prolonged and, you know, has the possibility at least a quote from the war at this point in time.",

I -- you mentioned that I used to be the health commissioner in Baltimore. I also oversaw school health services. And even prior to this year's heat wave, every year, we had this situation of deciding, well, when is it that we close schools? How hot does it have to be for us to close schools, and we know that there are so many downstream effects of sending kids home. First of all, kids, many of these kids depend on school for having meals. Also they may not have air conditioning at home, either. And then there's the learning loss aspect as well. But at the same time, extreme heat kills more people every year than any other weather emergency. And so as the climate warms, this is a really significant health issue, economic issue, and educational issue, too.",

Wastewater testing, though, remains very accurate. It's a good early detection system, because this is just measures what is the level of virus that we see in community wastewater. Those numbers are going up. And we also see that hospitalization numbers are going up as well.But I think it's important to put those numbers into context. Compared to last year at this time, we're actually quite a bit below last year's level of hospitalizations with COVID. And we're way below the peak of COVID. Back to when Omicron first started, we're only about a 10th of where we were back at that point for hospitalizations. And so I think it's important for us to talk about this uptick in cases because people who are still vulnerable to severe illness should make sure that they take additional precautions, make sure that they're up to date with boosters, and make sure they know where to get antivirals, like Paxlovid. And then consider masking, wearing a high quality mask. But I also think it's important to consider that there is a cost to returning to pandemic era restrictions as well. And for many people who don't want to bear that cost, I think it's also reasonable for them to say, look, we have pretty successfully decoupled infections from severe illness for the majority of people.
