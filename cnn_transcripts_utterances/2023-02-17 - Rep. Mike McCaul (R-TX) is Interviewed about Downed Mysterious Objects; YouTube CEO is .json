It should never have been allowed to enter U.S. airspace where it flew over three major military nuclear installations, from Montana, which was the triad, which is air, land and sea nuclear, to Omaha, Nebraska, where there -- our strategic command is, where President Bush was taken after 9/11, and finally over our B-2 bombers in Missouri, taking images and sending them back to China.

And certainly when it was shot down over the Atlantic, it stopped.But I think even more disturbing, as you pointed out, is a lot of the components in the spy balloon were made in America. So, these were American components, American parts in a Chinese spy balloon. And we've seen this movie before. The hypersonic weapon that circled the earth with precision and landed, could carry a nuclear payload, is also built on the backbone of American technology.

But the majority of the majority still support this effort. I think, you know, Zelenskyy gave a very powerful speech just a few minutes ago comparing himself to David against the Russian Goliath and that he needs David's sling and that we are providing that, but we can do more to help them defeat in Goliath.
