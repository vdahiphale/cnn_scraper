The president-elect is now trying to stop Special Counsel Jack Smith from publicly releasing his final report on his investigations into the president-elect and the two federal cases that were brought and dismissed.Why is Donald Trump fighting this now? His lawyers read a draft of that report and argue in a new court filing it contains, quote, baseless attacks, which they call an obvious effort to interfere with upcoming confirmation hearings. So, this only adds to the mounting intrigue, of course, around this report and its potentially imminent release. Let's get over to Katelyn Polantz. She's got much more of this for us. Katelyn, walk us through this. What do we know about the report and when can we see this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. We've seen reports like this before from special counsel's offices, but not a fight like this on whether it could be released from the Justice Department.So, what we can gather from court filings so far is that in these two cases against Donald Trump, the attorney general is going to be reviewing a two-volume report, one very likely about the classified documents case that was before Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida and then another volume about the January 6th case against Donald Trump. What is happening in those volumes, we haven't seen them, but Trump's lawyers and others have been able to review them behind closed doors, is that they are the summations of these cases, the summations of the investigations. What the special counsel's office says is that they are not going to be handing their finalized report over to the attorney general until at least 1:00 P.M. today. And if the public sees it, it won't be out until at least the morning of Friday. But, ultimately, it's up to the attorney general and the attorney general hasn't decided yet if that report is going to be public. Now, Trump's lawyers did write to the attorney general on January 6th, yesterday, saying that he's got to get rid of Smith and not release this report. He said that part of this is about presidential immunity, that Donald Trump should face no criminal process, including disclosures about a prosecution around him while he is the president- elect. We'll see if that argument holds in court with Judge Cannon too, which is where Trump's lawyers are now, arguing to her, stop this, don't let them release it to the public.",

The D.C. area, as we showed you yesterday, side, more than five inches of snow. It's snowiest day in two years, but that's nothing compared to the record snowfall in Kansas, the city of Chapman. Some more than 20 inches of snow, the storm's top total.Crews across several states now racing to clear roads, restore power before the frigid temperature set in, locking in snow and ice and creating dangerous conditions for people who don't have access to heat.

That is incredible. That snow that fell yesterday, it's going nowhere anytime soon.This is what it feels like this morning in Kansas City. That's a big goose egg there, zero degrees. That's the wind chill, single digits in the nation's capital where we saw over five inches of snow yesterday from the snowstorm. In fact, there was a swath of snow that extended over a thousand miles with over six inches from this latest snowstorm, Kansas City all the way to the Delmarva Peninsula, including the nation's capital. This will indeed lock in the cold air, which you can see with the high temperatures and that weight of the snow and the ice from the previous storm has also caused the power outages that still remain. And guess what? The arctic air is going to stick around. As I mentioned, we're talking 250 million people experiencing the mercury dropping below the freezing mark. And this is also going to set the stage for another potentially impactful snow and ice storm. Pay attention. This is for Thursday into Friday, Dallas and into Southern Oklahoma into the southeast by Friday afternoon and potentially the East Coast. It's the arctic air that's in place that's setting the stage for the potential winter mix. We already have winter storm watches in place for parts of Texas in the southern plains starting tomorrow.",

At 11And then after that, John, what is going to happen is really symbolic. What we will see is the horse drawn casket take the very same route that President Carter walked during his inauguration several decades ago from the Navy Memorial to the United States Capitol. And it was remarkable when President Carter took that walk because he wanted to be out and among the people during such a fractious time in our nation. And so he takes that very same walk again today. And then, of course, people from across the country will have the opportunity to say their goodbyes in the nation's capital as he lies in state.

So, Zillow just came out with their annual rankings of the 50 largest metro areas. And for the second year in a row, the hottest housing market in America is Buffalo, New York.There's a number of other cities in the northeast that are high up on this list, including Hartford, Connecticut, Providence, Rhode Island and Philadelphia in the Midwest, Kansas City, St. Louis, the only city out west to make this list, Salt Lake City. Now, Zillow takes into account a number of factors here, including home prices, how fast homes are selling how fast they're being built and also job growth, which is an important indicator of future demand. Now, as I mentioned, Buffalo leads this list for the second year in a row. I know that's going to be music to the ears of Buffalo Bill super fan Harry Enten. And as far as why this is happening, it's because inventory is really low relative to before COVID. Also, they're adding a lot of jobs relative to how many homes are being built. Prices were up by 6 percent last year. Zillow expects another 3 percent increase this year. Hartford is supposed to have an even bigger increase in home prices. Zillow forecasting a 4 percent increase for Hartford, Connecticut. That's going to add another $15,000 to the typical home. Now, as always, when we talk about housing, this really cuts both ways, right, because if you already own your home and you don't need to move, the fact that home prices have gone up is good news, right? It's adding to your net worth. It's giving you some added financial flexibility. But, Kate, as we know, the American dream of home ownership, it just feels like it's out of reach for far too many people right now.",

In Austin, home prices, according to Zillow are expected to dip a bit.So, look, if you live in those areas, or you're willing to move to those areas, that could be an option if you're looking to get a little bit of an advantage.
