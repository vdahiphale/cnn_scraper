Her one-point lead in Wisconsin is within the margin of error.On Wednesday, both nominees sought to get their messages out. Harris was in Washington where she slammed Trump's immigration proposals, while Trump criticized his Democratic rival at a campaign rally in New York.

And this was kind of checking off that box for the former president.But they also acknowledge that they don't necessarily believe that New York is going to turn red in November. Now a few notable things that Trump spoke about on Tuesday. One is that he addressed an endorsement from a major union group, the Teamsters Union. Actually, I should say a non-endorsement from the union group. However, Donald Trump falsely claimed that they had endorsed him. I'll note that their decision not to endorse this cycle is a big deal. They have been going, they have endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee for the last several election cycles, every election cycle really since 1996. Trump also vowed Springfield, Ohio, of course, the place where both he and other Republicans have been spreading baseless rumors about Haitian migrants eating pets. He said he wanted to go visit that city as well as Aurora, Colorado, another place where he has claimed that Venezuelan gangs are taking over the city, something that officials on the ground argue is grossly overstated. So a lot of harsh rhetoric on Wednesday night and again, not necessarily in a state that is crucial to the election come November. Alayna Treene, CNN, Uniondale, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE) COREN: Officials in Lebanon are worried the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate following twin attacks involving booby- trapped devices targeting the militant group. The Lebanese Foreign Minister tells CNN he fears the consecutive attacks could signal a quote, \"introduction to war.\" Well scores of walkie-talkies exploded across the country on Wednesday, killing at least 20 people and wounding more than 450 others. It comes a day after hundreds of pagers blew up nearly simultaneously across Lebanon in an unprecedented attack which wounded about 2,800 people. The death toll rose to 12 on Wednesday. Israel's defense minister tacitly acknowledged his country's role in the exploding devices. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): I believe that we are at the start of a new phase in the war and we must adapt. This is true for everyone.

One is it's actually killed and wounded a number of individuals connected directly to Hezbollah and then even some innocent individuals.

And then a third is Hezbollah, partly through its Iranian connection, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Quds Force, has allies across the region in Syria, in Iraq, the Houthis in Yemen, we could see some kind of coordinated activity as well.

We haven't gotten to that stage yet. If we do look out for a lot more weapons flying at Israel from Lebanon and probably also Syria and potentially Iraq and even Yemen, and then on the other hand, I would expect to see the Israelis really pummeling parts of -- of Lebanon, including Beirut.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell he stopped short of declaring victory over inflation but they're all but doing that.It does also suggest though that they are worried about what they're seeing in the jobs market. Now Powell, he said repeatedly that he's not alarmed with the jobs market. He even said at one point, the labor market is in a strong place. We want to keep it there. But there are some economists who are concerned that the Fed is late and that they need to play catch up before the cracks in the jobs market turn into something more ominous. So, the Fed has made clear that they've switched the mission. They've gone from fighting inflation to fighting unemployment. Of course, all of this is happening just weeks before this hotly-contested election. Now, Powell, he stressed politics played no role here and that the Fed only does what they believe is right. And I asked Powell about the idea from former president Trump that the sitting U.S. president should have a say in where interest rates go. And Powell, he made clear he's not a fan of that idea. JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE: We do our work to serve all Americans. We're not serving any politician, any political figure, any cause, any issue, nothing. It's just maximum employment and price stability on behalf of all Americans. And that's how the other central banks are set up too.

And then they would have done another 25 basis points in September, right?And now, we're back to where we are. I think that there was a little bit of a panic, right, with some of the numbers and with inflation already in the 2 percent and interest rates north of six, there's a big gap that you had to do something. So I think this wasn't a panic because something was wrong underneath the system. I think it was more of like, you got to start right sizing it now and how do you get there quicker and so, yes, they're still, it's still not solid. I don't think we're still out of the woods because we're still teetering.

And the market's always looking, what's next? And for me, that's important of like, okay, are you going to do 25 basis points at one cut or two cuts this year? Is it going to line up with four cuts next year? And so, Jerome Powell and the Fed, this is not the time to not, you know, you have to be really transparent and the numbers of the next month and the jobs numbers are going to be really important to be, you know, what, what's next.
