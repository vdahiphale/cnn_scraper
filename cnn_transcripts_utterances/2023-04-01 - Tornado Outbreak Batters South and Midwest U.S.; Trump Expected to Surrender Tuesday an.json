      "sentences": "Mr. Trump is the first individual, first former president in American history, to have been indicted for something he did while he was not in office. In his case, it was something he did before he was elected.There was a president in the 19th century, Ulysses S. Grant, who was mixed up in a controversy -- actually a fraud in New York City -- that occurred after he left office. He was not responsible for the fraud. There was no real legal jeopardy for him. But it looked bad for him. Donald Trump is the first person about whom there's a probable cause of a crime committed before he was president. And so what's being tested here is not whether the American people are capable of judging a president who has survived a political scandal in office; it's whether the American judicial system will treat someone, who has once been president, can treat them as any ordinary American after they've left office. So that is the test and that's what's so interesting about what's going on now. An American president, once they've left office, should be as susceptible to an indictment, as should anybody else in the United States if a grand jury so chooses. And we've seen that happen. At the moment, there are actually three grand juries that are looking at various aspects of president Trump's alleged corruption. New York is the first to have come to an agreement or a decision. We have another grand jury that has been impaneled in the state of Georgia, which is looking in to president -- then president Trump's behavior during -- just after the 2020 election, where he tried to influence the count in Georgia. And then there is a third grand jury that is seated in the District of Columbia. That's looking at apparently -- at perhaps charges against the former president for acts that he committed after he left office with regard to his presidential records. So there are three different grand juries that are looking into him. The very fact that Americans feel free enough to render judgment on someone who was once the most powerful person in the world is a strength of the American system. So it's something I think people ought to keep in mind. In the United States, it's very important, I believe, as a matter of good government, that the powerful know that they could be indicted and that presidents know that they might be held, that they will be held accountable for any criminal acts that they might have undertaken before they became president or after they were president. So if you take the long view, this is a very important step for the American republic. And is an historic step.",

And the allegations are profound and deeply disturbing. Several hundred Ukrainians believe to being killed in that town center. And more than 1,000 killed in the Bucha greater area. Multiple allegations of possible war crimes, crimes against humanity that the Ukrainian and international investigators are still piecing together to try eventually to prosecute those responsible. You had that, as you called it, somber moment of the president there. And it's worth remembering, you know, a lot of attention is put on Bucha but there have been similar crimes alleged in towns and cities that are now occupied by Russian forces and very difficult to get independent information out of, like Mariupol and parts of the eastern front and even in cities like Kherson, which we were in a few days ago, where Russians are still shelling civilian areas. So these alleged crimes continue and these investigations are going on in real time as this war continues.",

And while we focus, of course, on the civilian and military impact of this invasion, it has devastated in many ways the Ukrainian economy, which has contracted by at least a third.Now this latest news from the IMF is they've agreed to extend more than $15 billion on top of the already more than $100 billion in multilateral loans and grants to this country. Now it's important to note this is in two pots. And why that's important because there's a short term funding that will come to this government to prop up its balance of payments and the long term is to get this country more in line, possibly with the European Union. And it is -- while it's not a political move, this move by the IMF, it can be seen in the political framing because part of this funding is to reform the country, its institutions, to limit corruption, all things that would be required to eventually join the European Union or become closer to the European Union, when and if this war does eventually wrap up. So it is an important moment and certainly critical just to the functioning of this economy as the war drags on.",
