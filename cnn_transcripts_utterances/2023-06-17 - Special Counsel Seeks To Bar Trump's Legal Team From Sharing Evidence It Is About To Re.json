Now, according to this request, both sides both prosecutors and defense attorneys have agreed to these rules about how to handle the sensitive evidence that will soon be shared with defense attorneys.Now we're not talking about classified information here, we're talking about the other sensitive information that is part of this case. Now among the rules that prosecutors are seeking here have to do with the defendants, former President Trump and his aide Walt Nauta. They are insisting that the two defendants not be able to view any of the evidence that is shared with attorneys without their attorneys present. They also request that they not be given copies of it or be able to take notes and then take those notes. The notes need to be protected and kept safe by the attorneys. And the prosecutors say in this request that they worry that sharing this information with the public or others could compromise other ongoing investigations, witnesses or other people who haven't been charged. We know the Special Counsel is of course looking at the events in and around January 6, and efforts to undermine the 2020 election. We also know that many of the witnesses in the Trump documents case are also interviewed in the January 6 investigation. Now when it comes to classified information, they're not quite there yet because the Trump attorneys need clearances before they can handle any of those sensitive secrets that are at the heart of this case. The former president is accused of taking over 30 documents. Now earlier this week, the judge overseeing this case, Aileen Cannon. She told the lawyers to begin that process to get their clearances. She wants an update next week. Now the lawyers Todd Blanche and Chris Kise have said they're already in touch with the Justice Department to get that process started so that they can eventually be able to view classified evidence as well.
