Good evening.We are inching closer to what could be an historic week when Donald Trump is potentially indicted for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Even the former president himself believes the indictment is coming. The question is when. It would be Trump's third criminal indictment and a potential game changer in the battle for the GOP presidential nomination. But some of Trump's Republican challengers are shrugging off Trump's role in the Capitol attack. Among those questioning the case, Mike Pence. Here is the former vice president and his family being whisked away. You probably remember these images from January 6th as rioters were chanting \"Hang Mike Pence.\" They apparently believed Trump's lies that Pence could overturn the election results. Here is what Pence said to CNN earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: While his words were reckless, based on what I know, I'm not yet convinced that they were criminal. President Trump was wrong on that day and he's still wrong in asserting that I had the right to overturn the election, but what his intentions were, and as you know, criminal charges have everything to do with intent, what the president state of mind was. And I don't honestly know what his intention was that day, whether as he spoke to that crowd, as he tweeted during the riot itself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was also co-counsel for the Judiciary Committee during the first Trump impeachment. Norm, Ambassador Eisen, great to see you. Let me ask you what Mike Pence was just saying there a few moments ago about intent. Is that accurate that that's like the whole ball game?

And the sad thing for us on the weekends is reporting on gun violence. In Chicago this weekend the police department says that shootings in that city have left at least six people dead and more than 20 others injured. Among the dead in one shooting a 16-year-old boy. In other news, the NAACP chapter in Columbus, Ohio, now calling a roadside police encounter gone wrong, quote, \"barbaric.\" And before we show you the video, we want to warn our viewers that some of you might find this disturbing, but it's important to watch. The bodycam on an Ohio state trooper recorded a police dog attacking 23-year-old Jadarrius Rose, who appeared to have his hands up to surrender after a police pursuit on the highway. Despite that officer telling another officer not to, the video shows the dog unleashed on an unarmed Rose who is heard pleading with officers to get the dog off of him. Our Polo Sandoval is following this case for us. Polo, walk us through what happened.",

You know, CEOs in 1980 used to make something like 30 times what their lowest workers would make. Bob Iger now makes 400 times what his lowest worker makes, and I would love to ask him the question, why is that okay? Is that a good thing for -- is it a good thing for the country? Is it a good thing for your company that you're squeezing every last dollar out of the people who work for you? And I think that for him to say it's unrealistic, is utter nonsense. He takes home a salary of forty or fifty million dollars a year. The writers crunch numbers that show that their ask would only cost Disney $75 million a year. You know, Bob alone could make up for a third of that if he cut his own salary in half. Now, nobody is saying Bob Iger shouldn't receive a fine salary for the work that he does. But for him to say that they just don't have the profits, it is just wrong. It's just another tactic to squeeze every last penny from labor and bring it up to the CEOs as much as possible.",

At least one person was killed, a security guard and President Zelenskyy on Sunday says that Ukraine needs what he called a full- fledged sky shield, saying that that is the only way to defeat Russian terror. Now we have heard recent calls for more air defenses from Western allies, not just from Zelenskyy, but from other Ukrainian officials, including the Ukrainian Defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, who I sat down with this weekend for an exclusive TV interview.
