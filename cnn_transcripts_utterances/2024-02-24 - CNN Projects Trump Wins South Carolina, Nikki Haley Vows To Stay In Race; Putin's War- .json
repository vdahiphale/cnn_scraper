Trumps solidifying his status as the party's expected nominee and delivering a powerful blow to his last remaining rival, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.But Haley is sticking to her vowed to fight on despite being trounced on her home turf. If you're just joining us, I'm Jake Tapper with our special coverage of this first GOP primary in the south in 2024. Let's take a look at the vote right now. With 86 percent of the vote in from the South Carolina Republican primary, Donald Trump is ahead with 60 -- 6-0 percent of the vote, 385,207 votes. That's more than 132,000 votes, more than two-time Governor Nikki Haley of the same state, who has 39.4 percent of the vote, 252,971 votes. Now let's listen to what we've heard from Trump and Haley this evening speaking to their supporters a little while ago. Here's Trump focusing on his anticipated rematch with President Biden and Haley insisting she's in the fight to the bitter end. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're both friends and we're going to be up here on November 5th and we're going to look at Joe Biden and we're going to look him right in the eye. He's destroying our country and we're going to say, Joe, you're fired, get out! NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In the next 10 days, another 21 states and territory this will speak. They have the right to a real choice, not a Soviet style election with only one candidate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not as though he's going to change who he is as a human being. But we're talking about a rather big campaign pivot. They want to focus on where they need to be for a general election or potential general election rematch with President Joe Biden.That means talking about where they can build out their campaign apparatus, particularly in those critical swing states. We're talking about Michigan as well as Arizona and Georgia. They are going to start having these conversations stations as to how to make an actual general election campaign. And the other part of this is a Donald Trump is still very annoyed frustrated. He is vented privately that Nikki Haley remains in the race. He's annoyed after tonight that she's still in the race and his advisers have told him time and time again to focus that ire on President Joe Biden. They want to make this about Donald Trump and Joe Biden. But one senior advisor acknowledged that will likely be difficult as they themselves have to have -- has had to remind Donald Trump time and time again to ignore Nikki Haley.",

It says every free day, we are reminded of the thread Donald Trump poses to our future as Americans grapple with the damage he left behind. The campaign here goes on to note, Roe versus Wade, the economy and later goes on to say, we all have more to do to push towards a more perfect union. But Trump wants to take us backwards. Now Jake, soon after former President Donald Trump was projected the winner in South Carolina primary, the Biden campaign was already fundraising and saying that he was positioned to be the GOP nominee and the campaign looking for contributions to shore up support for President Biden. And that was really the thought going into this evening and talking to campaign officials. This was just another moment. They said that confirmed what they already knew that former President Donald Trump is going to be the GOP nominee, and that is exactly what they are preparing for. In fact, sources tell CNN that President Biden has directed his senior campaign aides to focus more and more aggressively on the former presidents inflammatory rhetoric and we're already seeing that come to life with the statements they're putting out about the former presidents remarks about NATO, as well as on reproductive freedoms. Now, I will also note, Jake, we did see the president earlier this evening. He gave remarks to governors who are here for a black-tie dinner. He said that politics has gotten too bitter. Now he did talk about the South Carolina primary, but it is a bitter and tight race that his campaign is preparing for come November.",

So, you know, she has done what no other candidate could do, which is wipe everybody out of the race, challenge him in New Hampshire, come to South Carolina, and again, challenge here, hopefully collect the delegates as you go. She has a multimillion dollar ad buy going forward in the next 16 states into Super Tuesday. She's going to challenge him in Michigan as well. So I think there's still a lot of opportunity. After Super Tuesday, I think the campaign will probably reassess and say, okay, where do we go? Where do we pivot as every campaign will do? But this is about the voters, the voters decide where they should go and folks want a choice. Forty percent is nothing to shrug and it's really not. A lot of folks said that this is going to be an absolute runaway and all that. And again, Nikki Haley never had to win any of these early states. The early states are all about filtering and she filtered this field down faster than anybody. So, to get the 40 percent to carry that momentum, to have the resources to do it. If she had no resource and can no backing, that would be one thing. But there's a lot of folks still coming out. There's a lot of opportunity on Super Tuesday.",

She's headed on. She's trying to raise more money. Of course, there are a few things that we have to look at. There's a few questions we don't know the answers to how much is she going to raise during the course of these next ten donor events. We really don't know. We do know that the minimum amount that donors can give to get in the door with Nikki Haley at those is $1,000. That isn't such a high amount so appears maybe they're trying to expand the tent. But the other thing is that she had her most successful month of fundraising in January, but still she wasn't able to win here in South Carolina.

And some of them have gotten behind some, some haven't. So, you -- that's kind of hypothetical down the road. Her job is to say I'm going to raise money, I'm going to fight hard. I'm going to make sure the voters have a say. If you want to worry about hypotheticals three weeks from now, we can deal with those hypotheticals then. But right now, all Nikki Haley is worrying about is how to keep, keep that momentum going, keep people excited, and making sure that folks aren't giving up and they are getting out the vote. The challenge with Donald Trump is the RNC is practically broke, leadership is leaving like literally in a week or something like that. He drags down the rest of the ballot. Republicans want winners all the way down. Even if President Trump were to win, there's no doubt were probably going to lose the House and the Senate and governorships and all that. That's the case that she's really out there making. She's connecting with people about their school board seats in their local seats.

Whereas I think a great deal of the American public are either checked out or desensitized because the insults to the military, for me, I adore those individuals who had the courage to go and serve, particularly looking at all of them, you just want to work harder to ensure the country is perfect for them to live in.But they don't care about it. I mean, it was not a big deal to the overwhelming majority of them. I mean, they were desensitized to it, and it just seems as if Donald Trump can say and do about anything. And I go back to my analysis, which is really simple about this race. I say it all the time until I'm blue in the face, but this is Joe Biden, Donald Trump and the couch. And the couch is going to be very, very successful in November of 2024 because I think more people are going to stay at home that you can possibly imagine.",

One of them said, if Trumps convicted, oh, it's a kangaroo court, right? And that's what Donald Trump is going to try to convince everyone of, you know, basically -- I mean, he already is, right?But the other one said, you know what, that scenario I'm not going to oh, it actually was a difference, right? And so that's that group of people that we keep seeing that 30 percent or so in the very conservative Iowa electorate that say a conviction, not, not these indictments, but a conviction would make a difference.

Nikki Haley defeated in her home-state, failing to capitalize in what may have been her last best chance to slow Trump down.As Donald Trump takes another leap toward the GOP presidential nomination, the world is marking a full two years of war and bloodshed in Ukraine, a milestone that does not seem to be moving Trumps allies in Congress who are standing in the way of new us aid for Ukraine in its battle against the Russian invaders. CNN chief national security analyst, Jim Sciutto, joins us now to mark this two-year occasion. And, Jim, the primary season is playing out as we mark these two years. You've reached out to sources in Ukraine, in Europe, and the Pentagon on the Hill for their assessment of the war, two years in what are they telling you? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: So, big picture. Remember, you remember this well. At the start of this war, the U.S. intel assessment was it was going to be over very quickly. They expected Russia to overwhelm Ukraine, take Kyiv, and 72 hours, that didn't happen. Two years later, Ukraine is still fighting, but a year ago, the feeling was that Ukraine was in a position to gain back territory, start pushing Russians back. But the counteroffensive didn't really accomplish that. Certainly hasn't yet. And its pretty much a frozen conflict in the east with even Ukrainian forces losing ground and fear is rising that Ukraine could be at a tipping point primarily because the largest military in the world, and its number one backer, the U.S. is standing on the sidelines. I want to tell you what a senior Ukrainian military has officer told me just in the last 24 hours. He said that my biggest worry is that wed be left on our own to fight against embolden evil. In case the West is overwhelmed by domestic politics, of course, speaking in the U.S., populists, pacifists, it would be a massacre and exodus of biblical proportions as Russia continues to escalate in its brutality. That's the Ukrainian view here. They feel that they're being abandon and without that help, that could be the faith that they're facing. They're not alone in that. I spoke to Mike Quigley. He's the co-chair of the congressional Ukraine caucus, and he's concerned that if aid doesn't come very, very soon, it could effectively be lost. To his point, first and foremost, he says, my concern is that time and speed providing arms and ammunition the pipeline is emptying and it takes a lot of time to refill the point being, you could vote tomorrow or next week or next month, but that doesn't fill those ammo dumps. It doesn't provide the weapons that they need right away. There's a lag time. And during that time, Russia is pushing by the way, there's a Russian presidential election next month. The feeling is when Putin wins again because its not really an election that he feels emboldened. He might mobilize more officers and push even harder to put Ukraine on its back foot. Bigger picture, when I speak to senior U.S. military officials they're concerned that they're not learning from the war so far. This is what a senior U.S. military official told me. I've been speaking with since the very start of this war. He says: We aren't learning enough from Ukraine events. We have again tried to build their forces in an image of our own. And it is unlikely to succeed in the short term. He goes on to say, it matters today for Ukraine, but he also says it matters tomorrow for Taiwan. The point being, they tried to turn the Ukraine into an American name 8:00 style fighting force there in the span of weeks, with weapons we were providing and saying basically, go out and fight with this new weapon system over and over, and it just didn't work and it didn't match the Russian forces. And that's where we are today. So you have concern that from Ukrainian certainly that they're being abandoned, from us lawmakers, that if they don't act now, then they're really going to put the Ukrainians in a position to lose and then the U.S. military saying, we didn't adjust quickly enough to.",

They're right on Russia's border.And when she hears Trump say, listen, I may not defend you NATO allies in the east as he did the other day, and he stood by those comments. If you don't pay your two percent, they listen, they say we have to listen and take that seriously, because he said this before. He said this while he was president and since he was president, and the point of the alliance is, is confidence. And if you don't have confidence that your allies is going to come to your defense, then you doubt that, you doubt that commitment. And by the way, and she makes this point all the time as do other eastern European leaders Russia than doubts it, because if the commanders and chief is saying he's not going to fulfill that commitment.
