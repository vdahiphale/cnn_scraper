He credited President Trump with winning the speakership.So what is Trump saying to Gaetz behind the scenes there? The fact that they talk is interesting, especially given that Gaetz is still moving ahead. We know that things have been a little frosty, at least from the Trump side of vote, some of the comments that McCarthy had made recently about Trump's strength as a candidate. McCarthy has not yet endorsed him for the presidency, but McCarthy very much has aligned himself with Trump knowing full well the power that the former president has with many members of his -- of the GOP conference. So that's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. But also here, making clear, Dana, that he still plans to move ahead and as you said, as you heard there, he could move ahead repeatedly. He could lose a first vote here, a procedural vote potentially, or maybe on the merits to kicks McCarthy out. But he claims he's going to do it over and over and over and over again until he gets his way. So can McCarthy keep a coalition together to fend this off? We have never seen this before in the history of the country to be successfully to pull off ousting a sitting speaker. McCarthy is ready to grit it out. But the question is, does he have the votes? How many Republicans will side with Matt Gaetz and will Democrats at the end of the day help him? All major questions at this chaotic moment unfolds. But as you heard there, Matt Gaetz says he's not concerned about the chaos. He says it's not him. He says it's the leadership that's creating the chaos. Dana?",

Matt Gaetz, of course, was a person who was blocking and opposing these short term funding bills. Now the government shut down, and now it is Matt Gaetz's -- or this government is open, and because of Democrats, and now that's Matt Gaetz's reason, it was also interesting that Matt Gaetz focused on the Ukraine component, and this backhanded deal, apparent deal that he has with the president over it because Matt Gaetz also said it.
