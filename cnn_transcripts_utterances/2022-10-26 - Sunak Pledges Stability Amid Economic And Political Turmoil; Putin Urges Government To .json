Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.Russia is President admits to serious challenges in his war on Ukraine, as Moscow continues to push its unfounded dirty bomb claims. Britain's new leader vows to unify his party's turmoil and tackle the country's economic crisis. They'll start explaining how in the coming hours during his first prime minister's questions in Parliament. Plus, 40 days after a young woman died in the custody of Iran's morality police. Anti-government protests are growing louder and spreading. It's 9:00 a.m. in Moscow where there is yet another indication of the trouble Russian troops are facing in the war in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has told his newly formed coordination council to speed up their decision making as the invasion enters its ninth month. He's also demanding faster production of efficient and modern military equipment. Meanwhile, at the U.N. Russia's deputy ambassador is discussing what Russia calls a potential disaster that could threaten the entire Earth. Moscow is circulating claims that Ukraine is planning to use a dirty bomb and blame Russia. Ukraine calls that a pure lie. It says U.N. nuclear experts will visit Ukraine to disprove the allegation. Western nations are also sounding the alarm saying Russia's false claim could be a pretext to escalate the war. U.S. President Joe Biden had this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What is clear, though, is that in this war, so far, only one party has actually openly threatened to use nuclear or radioactive weapons and that is Russia. And what is also clear is that they are ramping up this sort of psychological pressure on the west.It's a long-time tactic of Russia to sort of alongside military activity use what it's called active measures try to sort of sow chaos and confusion, influence public opinion. And I think that's why we see this allegation around Ukraine allegedly building a dirty bomb become ever more elaborate. The letter that Russia circulated at the U.N. for this closed security council meeting, said that Ukraine was allegedly going to use -- spend fuel from its civilian nuclear power plants. The testing systems were already in place that it was allegedly going to do this with the support of the west and that it was Ukraine planning a sort of false flag operation to try to frame Russia for this. So they are not backing away from this. Meanwhile, though, a U.K. deputy ambassador at the U.N. called this pure Russian disinformation. And it is still worth noting that the Pentagon said yesterday, reiterating what we've heard from Western officials that there is no evidence as of yet that Russia has actually done anything concrete to prepare to use any kind of nuclear or radioactive weapon.

And she made an impassioned plea to the judge to reduce her sentence. And then she did that by apologizing again for what she'd done. She admitted her guilt again, but said it was so hard for her essentially to paraphrase her to be away from her family. And she said that other people should she had seen committed much more serious crimes had received much, much, you know, less of a prison sentence, much reduced sentences. But none of that emotional plea seems to have had any impact on the Russian judge. The judge upheld the conviction, a guilty verdict for Brittney Griner for smuggling drugs essentially into the country. Remember, she was caught with a tiny quantity, less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage when she -- when she came into Russia back in February.And he also basically upheld the sentence as well, they did reduce it a little bit by a couple of months. So instead of serving nine years now she'll be expected to serve 8-1/2 years. So it's not much consolation there. The lawyers on behalf of Brittney Griner have said they're surprised and devastated that this -- that this has happened, they were expecting a much bigger reduction of the sentence. I spoke to them last week actually in Moscow. And that's what they told me. They're now unfortunately kind of at the end of the road legally, it's not clear whether they'll be able to appeal again to a Russian court. And so now what happens is that Brittney Griner will eventually be taken away from her pretrial detention center outside Moscow where she is now and moved to a more permanent location, a penal colony elsewhere in Russia, it could be close to Moscow, it could be further away. And of course, the conditions in those Russian penal colonies leaves much to be desired to say the least. And so perhaps the worst sort of moments for Brittney Griner are still potentially ahead of her. So not a good day at all in terms of news for that American basketball star.

The U.N. secretary general says that the world's reliance on fossil fuels has spiraled out of control, adding, \"the climate crisis is killing us. It is undermining not just the health of our planet, but the health of people everywhere.\" Well, the head of JPMorgan Chase says he is more worried about geopolitics than a U.S. recession. Jamie Dimon and his comments came at a Future Investment Initiative which got underway Tuesday in the Saudi capital. The annual conference draws thousands of policymakers, investors and scholars. CNN's Richard Quest is there and moderated a panel with top Wall Street bankers, many of whom focused on the risk posed by recent political developments around the world. Here's what Dimon had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMORGAN:  Some very good news right now in the United States. People see it, consumers, businesses still spending, still lots of money, a lot of physical stimuluses. But there's a lot of stuff in the horizon which is bad. And could -- it doesn't necessarily, but could, put the United States in a recession. But that's not the most important thing for when we think about it, what matters right through that. I would worry much more about the geopolitics of the world today.",

He plans to auction off the rest and donate the money to charities finding racism and antisemitism. Well, many people got their wish on Tuesday after Adidas announced that they were ending a nearly 10-year relationship with Ye. They are the latest brand to dump the rapper after his offensive remarks, ending profitable relationships with him after years of growth and success. The sudden retreats have been enough for Forbes to take Ye off their billionaires list, claiming he's only worth about $400 million now. Ye had previously bragged Adidas could not get rid of him.
