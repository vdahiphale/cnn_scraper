Now, The Detroit News has unearthed audio in Michigan, where Donald Trump was recorded pressuring election workers, not to certify the vote there.Imagine getting that phone call. Here's how it all went down. On November 17th, 2020, canvassers in Wayne County met to certify the election in favor of Joe Biden because he won. Two GOP workers initially voted no, but were then chastised by their fellow Canvassers. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We knew at the time in November 2020 that he had made these calls, but we didn't know what happened on the calls. And now, thanks to The Detroit News, we know.So, let me read for you some of these quotes. This is Donald Trump on this phone call with the local officials in Wayne County. That's in Detroit. He said, quote, we can't let these people take our country away from us. Everybody knows that Detroit is crooked as hell. He was peddling false claims about dead people voting in Detroit and shifting the votes away from him and towards Joe Biden. Of course, that was a complete lie. This is where it really gets serious, this next quote. Ronna McDaniel, who is the chairwoman of the RNC, she's also from Michigan, she was on the call, too. And she told them, do not sign it, referring to those certification papers, do not sign it. We will get you attorneys. And that is where Trump followed up and said, we'll take care of that. Sara, why would you need an attorney if you're not doing anything wrong? It's a critical question. And this is why tapes like these will definitely factor into the criminal trial here in D.C. against Donald Trump, where he is accused of doing stuff just like this to disenfranchise voters and overturn the results of an election that he lawfully lost. SIDNER:  Yes. Calling the attorney sometimes indicates consciousness of guilt, a term I have learned from Elie Honig, by the way. This does implicate not only Trump, but has some tentacles to RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, how is her camp responding this morning? And what's Donald Trump's camp saying?",

This is a statement put out from Stephen Cheung, the top spokesman for the Trump campaign.

And, three, win or lose for Donald Trump, I have full and complete confidence in our election process and our election officials across the country. And what we're seeing here is a perfect example of that.Look, clearly, Donald Trump and Ronna McDaniel didn't like the outcome in Wayne County, and according to Ronna McDaniel, she felt as though there was reason to have an inquiry, but this is not how you do it. You don't get the president of the United States on the line with people at that level and try and intimidate them and pressure them to not signing off on them. I have been deputy secretary of state. I have overseen elections at the state level. I know how it works. And I support the Michigan secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, who has confidence in how they handle this. And, look, this just goes to show yet again that regardless of the outcome of these elections, we can look back at the people that are running these elections and certifying these elections, doing the right thing, and, fortunately, not being pressured by anyone, including the president of the United States, to try and change the outcome.",

And, look, it worked to a certain extent, right? They tried to change their vote. So, I agree with Alice. I think there have been a lot of Republican officials around the country, especially in Georgia, who did rise to the occasion, who ultimately did the right thing.

And when she gets a question like that, she obviously will address it.But I've spoken with every of these campaigns that are out there. Most of the questions they're getting are about the economy and health care and jobs. And when they're asked about nitpicking every stupid thing that Donald Trump says or does or his denying the election results, I feel like they have done what they needed to do is push back on his statements and his actions, but trying to do so in a way that does not alienate his base. And to this point, they have done that. But now, as we're two weeks out from the Iowa caucuses or a few weeks out, the gloves are off and they're becoming a little bit more forceful against Donald Trump.

He's not conservative enough on things like abortion.Same time, I'm seeing commentary like op-eds in the New York Times making a pretty interesting case that the secret sauce of Trump is actually that he's like a secret moderate when you look at his policies versus his rhetoric.

I think that actually most of the voters are more comfortable with Donald Trump being moderate, for example, on the abortion issue. So, I think DeSantis is running Ted Cruz's campaign. Now, why would he be doing that, though? Let's ask ourselves that. Ted Cruz lost, right? Yes, he did. But guess what Ted Cruz won. He won Iowa. So I think that everything Ron DeSantis is doing now is about one thing, winning Iowa. That's what he hopes to do. I think it's a failed strategy if he wants to be the nominee.

The GOP hasn't picked a candidate yet, but Biden's team is setting its sights on Donald Trump just looking at the numbers, like everyone else is as the inevitable nominee for the Republicans. Part of the plan is to convince voters in key states that Trump is truly a threat to democracy.CNN Political Analyst and White House Reporter for the Associated Press Seung Min Kim is joining us now. As Biden heads into 2024, it is clear that it's going to take two attacks. One is reproductive health and the attack and assault, as they call it on that, and the other is really about the democracy in this country. How do you see them tackling this?

And that's what you're going to be hearing hammering. That's what you're going to hear Democrats hammer for months up until November because they do feel that's a contrast that works and it resonates with a broad swath of voters.",

But the humanitarian crisis there has really hit some Democrats very hard and made them think about even being part of the Biden administration, as well as the voters have been very loud and clear, for example, in a place like Michigan, where you have the highest population or second highest population of Arab-Americans who are looking at this and could potentially vote.And I just want to throw up this poll real quick. Among voters under 30, 72 percent were shown to disapprove of how Biden was handling the war.
