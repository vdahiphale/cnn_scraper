I'm Max Foster.We begin with breaking news, a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake has hit western Japan and a tsunami warning has been issued. It struck at about 4:00 p.m. local time. A series of strong aftershocks have already been recorded. And tsunami waves of 1.2 meters have hit a number of areas along the western coast. Japan's prime minister is urging residents in tsunami areas to evacuate as soon as possible. The U.S. Geological Survey and Japan Meteorological Office as well have been making similar warnings. CNN's Hanako Montgomery is joining us live from Tokyo. Tell us what information you've got right now, Hanako.",

As you mentioned, it was 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit around 4We know that also it was a shallow earthquake with depths of around 10 kilometers or about 6 miles. Now, this is significant to note because with shallow earthquakes, we know that they could potentially be more powerful and more destructive and essentially trigger tsunamis that could really devastate certain cities and towns that lie against the coast. With the Ishikawa prefecture, residents have been told to evacuate because they were close to the epicenter and we know that the Japanese prime minister's office is trying to confirm just how extensive the damage is and how many people might be hurt or injured because of these powerful quakes and subsequent tsunamis.",

We also know several bullet train lines have been suspended and they won't resume in the near future.

We also know that in Noto, right, near the epicenter of the earthquake, it is a seaport town. It's quite an idyllic town with a lot of different ports and just locals, you know, who love to fish.

It was a combination of missiles and drones, as you said in our introduction, the death toll has now been upgraded because they have been essentially pulling more bodies out of the rubble, and many of them in the capital Kyiv. So this is really significant. And we've seen since then that the violence has continued really on both sides. Russia is accusing Ukraine of attacking Belgorod, that border region, and later Friday, and they say that 24 were killed, many more injured, and then attacks over the weekend by Russia on Kharkiv Ukraine says and then New Year's eve brought more attacks. They air force says that pretty much almost all regions were under air alert. There was a record number of drones fired, some 90, in which 87 they managed to overt.But this is really bad news for Ukraine because we know western support is waning particularly from the U.S. they just got promised the last aid package from the U.S. unless more funding is agreed by Congress, that means that these air defenses are dwindling, the number of missiles they have to shoot down Russian drones and missiles are going down. They want to conserve them, they don't want to have to deal with the massive attacks. And, of course, Russia is watching and knows this. So if you were in any doubt as to whether this is an all out war not concentrated to the frontline, I think the last few days have certainly proved it.",

This year it was about 3 1/2 minutes in front of the Kremlin and he didn't mention the war once.He alluded to it, he thanked Russian soldiers, military men and all that but he really just sort of called on Russian patriotism he said, things like the colossal responsibility that Russians feel from the homeland. He said we'll never back down. In some way both addresses, both Zelenskyy with his account of the war, very detailed, 20 minutes long, talking about the successes, diplomatic and production in Ukraine and things like that, in some ways both trying to call on their people to stay the course, stick it out. Almost two years in, and both populations are getting tired of this. So I think that that is what these speeches said in very different ways. Of course from Putin, this is an opportunity going into an election to project that strength and confidence, to set that tone.",

He says an emergency response office has been set up and the government is working to assess the damage, the extent of damage at least. A tsunami threat has been issued in parts of eastern Russia that is close to the Sea of Japan. Now, U.S. helicopters repelled an attack by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea Sunday sinking three boats and killing all those onboard. It is the first time since the war broke out in Gaza that the U.S. has killed members of the Iranian-backed group that is targeting vessels in the region to show support for Hamas.

Others say President Biden is striking the right balance striking the right balance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  This administration has been very timid in responding to escalations by Iran. The president absolutely has to look at what actions need to be taken in Yemen to be able to prevent the Houthis to continue to put commercial and military vessels at risk. The fact that the president is not doing that is giving Iran a total pass and ability to operate without consequences in the area. REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA):  The U.S. is taking the absolute right approach, carefully engaging obviously what happened early with self- defense and the idea that the president or White House does not take Iran seriously is completely false. I mean, Iran is clearly a danger to the region and clearly there are abuses of civil rights and human rights for their own people, it should disturb everyone. The president has been very forceful against the entire government, the authoritarian government that Iran is really pressuring on and really I think hurting not just their own people but the entire region.
