But look at that. Well over $100,000. Now, this is, of course, because we have too many people trying to buy too few homes. So home prices have had nowhere to go but go up. Mortgage rates, of course, are much higher as well. So is home insurance. Now it's true that people are making more money but often not enough. This same Oxford Economics report finds about one in three households make enough money to be able to afford to buy. That is down sharply from 59 percent five years ago. Now when you look at where this problem is most severe, it's in some of the cities on the coast that you might expect, right, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Miami. In all of those cities, you need household income of at least $200,000 to be able to afford to buy. And in San Jose, you need $460,000 a year. Now, it's true that the fact that home prices are up, that's boosting the net worth of everyone lucky enough to own a home right now. But we know that there are a lot of people who are on the outside looking in. They want to buy but they just can't, not at these prices and not at these rates -- Brianna?",
