They'll play the National Anthem.They'll inspect the Guard as well. You'll remember a few years ago it didn't go so well when President Trump was here. He got a bit lost going along the line. But this is King Charles' first moment like this, really, where he can guide the president along that Guard of Honor, so it will all be interesting to see. The red carpet rolled out for the U.S. president as it always is. An absolutely crucial relationship to the United Kingdom. The most important alliance. So you've got the Welsh Guards here. They're actually based just down the road here in Windsor. They were involved in the coronation, which President Biden didn't attend, of course, so some people suggesting there's some tension because of that. I think that actually, King Charles was very happy to have Jill Biden there. And he had the invitation but he wasn't able to attend. But this is a moment where we can really celebrate the bilateral relationship between two countries and ignore some of the tensions between the U.S. and U.K., which undoubtedly have set in in recent weeks, really, over the strategy in Ukraine.",

You saw the two Chinook helicopters carrying staff and press landing just outside, so we should be seeing the president shortly. The president on the international stage.

It also -- you know, he was the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, too. These are issues that really animate him. I can tell you just behind the scenes when even aides will say you can tell that he is just like going through these briefing books looking for little things -- going and doing this meticulous details about the ammunition that they're sending to Ukraine, really getting in the weeds and ways that he doesn't always with other issues.",

They both have it now so they'll meet for the first time. And this real interest in climate change, right? If you think about Queen Elizabeth, it wasn't really clear what she was interested in other than those cute little dogs that she had. And we know here for King Charles that this has been a real passion of his for years and years and years. It's also a passion of President Biden's as well and the Democratic Party -- progressives, in particular. So I'm sure that will take up some time in their discussion.

But the queen would obviously not want to travel up to Buckingham Palace in her older years so she would hold a lot of these receptions -- these national events at Windsor Castle instead.So we can see the king coming out now. A big test for him, really. You were discussing the environment. We never found out what was discussed in the meetings with the queen. She always kept that absolutely confidential. We're seeing a new way this king is handling these moments. Both the White House and the palace have told us that they're going to be discussing environment, which for many has become a political issue, which is something that monarchs are not meant to be getting involved with. Here in the U.K., the environment minister recently resigned because he said Rishi Sunak didn't care about the environment, and that caused a real stink. But we know that King Charles has always had an interest in the environment and he's refusing to let it go. He's told the world that he's going to discuss it in this meeting with President Biden and hopefully get some movement on that issue -- on something that they have common ground on. But once the president arrives there will be this Guard of Honor and you'll see them inspecting the guards there, which is something that Charles has a lot of experience in. It's one of the advantages he's had for being one of the longest last -- longest-serving heirs to the monarchy here in the U.K. And they're currently playing the British National Anthem and that will be followed a bit later on when the president arrives with the American National Anthem.",

So it was the COP summit in Glasgow when they had a meeting in 2021 on the sidelines there, and they got on really well on that issue. And this is the key issue for King Charles. So I think that's where they find common ground.I think, as you say, in my experience of U.S. presidents coming to the U.K. and really enjoying these moments because they stand the test of time, don't they -- that image next to a British monarch. And the queen was the towering figure -- the longest-serving head of state. And I know that U.S. presidents would like to have that photo with the queen. And this is a new era -- Charles' era. So it's a significant moment because he's obviously going to be in this role for many decades to come. So I think they can look to the long-term relationship between the two nations, whereas this morning we saw a shorter-term discussion of relations between the U.S. and the U.K. when President Biden met with the prime minister. But these are very important moments because they go down in the history books. These images last forever. And King Charles will use it, showing how many U.S. presidents he's met in many years to come. And this is the first serving president he's operated with so it's interesting to see how that will play out.",

      "sentences": "Well, the difference is just that we never -- you know, the queen's policy was to never, ever discuss what happened in those meetings. And we would be told that we would never have found out what happens in those meetings. Because the idea of those meetings was the presidents, just as their own prime ministers here in this country, could have a completely free discussion without any concern about it leaking and not having to hold back in any way.And this was something that U.S. presidents -- I know that President Trump would talk to the queen about historic moments because she's had so much experience. She had so much experience. But Charles has also had a lot of experience. He met President Eisenhower -- his first serving U.S. president -- back in 1959. He's been often in those meetings with the queen. So I think that he's got a lot of history -- just not as a serving monarch. They'll go inside, as the queen would have done, and have tea. You know, that's the British tradition and I think presidents always enjoy that. The one difference is they are then going to go into a discussion about a conference that's being held here about climate change. So, President Biden will be drawn into that. It will be interesting to hear if you guys hear from the White House what was discussed in there. I don't know how much we'll hear from the palace. But I think it will be very telling to see how Charles will handle his monarch -- if they really divulge a lot of information about that meeting. He's a bit -- a bit more political -- this monarch -- than the -- his predecessor and it shows how he's changing the tone of British monarchy, really.",

But I think that the most important thing is that they seem to get on very well and that's what today is all about, and showing those images.This is the Quadrangle, by the way. This is the part that the public is never allowed in. This is the private part of this huge, 1,000- year-old castle. Interesting to see how Charles is using these properties now as well. He hasn't moved into Windsor in the same way that the queen was there. It was her favorite property. She was always there. She had her horses there. He hasn't done the same. But we're being shown here that he will be using it for state events and we'll wait to see how this private part of the property is used in the future because there's a suggestion that Buckingham Palace will just become a public space and perhaps Windsor Castle should be as well. He's trying to cut back on the cost of the monarchy to try to show that he's in tune with the cost of living crisis and the world going forward, which often has quite an awkward relationship with the monarch, frankly, and all the privilege they have.",

It's just a tradition that they have there at Windsor to invite a foreign head of state to inspect the Guard that's there to protect a head of state. So it's seen as a big honor.As you say, Trump struggled with that because he didn't quite know how to walk along the line. And the queen wasn't guiding him properly, to be fair, because it was always Prince Philip previously who had done that and he had passed on at that time. But it's interesting hearing your debate about Ireland because certainly, here in the U.K. Biden is being touted as an anti-British president because he spent so much time focusing on the -- on Ireland, which is, of course, legitimate because he identifies as being of Irish descent. But at a time when there was a huge row about Brexit and the exit agreements between the U.S. -- between the U.K. and Ireland and it were -- you know, they were concerned that President Biden was favoring the Irish side rather than the British side in those debates. So that's certainly a tension here in the U.K. -- one of the many tensions, frankly, in the U.S.-U.K. relationship right now. So this body language -- what we're seeing here very important to show in images that the two heads of state do have a good chemistry and are getting on. And to be fair to Biden, he has a very good chemistry as well with Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister, but they have some quite fundamental differences of opinion on how to handle the war in Ukraine, currently. But I'm thinking they're not going to go there in these discussions. They're going to keep it, as Sally says, to environment.",

Do you see this as an opportunity for President Biden to try and kind of utilize this meeting for political or policy purposes?
