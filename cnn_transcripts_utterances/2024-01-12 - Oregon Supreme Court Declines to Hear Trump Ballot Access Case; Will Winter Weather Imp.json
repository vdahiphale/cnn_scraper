This is in retaliation for dozens of recent drone and missile strikes that the Iran-backed rebel group has fired up at commercial vessels in the Red Sea.

Now, importantly, we are already seeing what could be the beginnings of a Houthi response. We are tracking reports that a missile has been fired towards the Gulf of Aden near Yemen. Defense officials are looking into those reports right now. But, look, the Houthis have vowed to retaliate against the U.S. and British attacks that occurred overnight. And the Houthis actually released a new statement just a moment ago saying that American and British interests are -- quote -- \"legitimate targets\" for the Houthis. They say that their presence in the Red Sea as part of this multinational coalition is -- quote -- \"unacceptable and they violate all laws and they will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.\" Now, of course, all of this raises the major concern that this conflict is going to escalate even further. And the National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, spoke to that a bit earlier today. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, the U.S. did not want to do this alone. They had been weighing options for quite some time about how to retaliate against the Houthis, because the Houthis began these attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea back in November.And the U.S. was developing options for a potential response, but they were reluctant to do so without kind of an international coalition and without a partner nation conducting these strikes in this operation alongside them. The U.S., particularly President Biden, he likes to do things in conjunction with allies. And so the British, who have also been very active in the Red Sea protecting shipping lanes and shooting down missiles and drones that the Houthis have been firing, they decided to take part in this as well. And the U.S. and the U.K., they got support, albeit not operational support, from a number of other countries, including, significantly, Bahrain, which is an Arab nation that is a majority Shia Muslim. And so there was clearly a lot of buy-in here from a significant coalition that the U.S. believes was necessary in order to get the support it needed to launch these strikes in Yemen, which are very controversial and were hotly debated inside the administration, because, of course, the Houthis and the Saudis had been undergoing a civil war that the U.S. brokered a peace for. That fragile peace obviously could be upended now.",

Of course, Saudi Arabia has many ports on the Red Sea. It is a very important and vital economic link for Saudi Arabia. We have heard from Jordan and Kuwait as well expressing their concern about what they see as an escalation, Egypt also concerned about what they see as an escalation of violence. Iran, for its part and some of its proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, have come out very clearly in support of the Houthis. No surprise there because the Houthis are a proxy of Iran. But their comments very clearly frame this as a U.S.-U.K. attack, not on the Houthis' military capabilities but on the whole of Yemen, which, of course, that's not the intention, but they're framing it like that. They're framing it in a way that the United States and the U.K. are coming out in support of Israel. So, the rhetoric there is really designed to inflame tensions at the moment. So it is a moment of great concern. The British, of course, not -- for all the reasons Natasha mentioned, of course, their -- one of their ships, HMS Diamond, was targeted earlier this week. And, of course, easy for the prime minister to convince his Cabinet and opposition figures that this was the right thing to do to join the coalition.",

So they have a reach that extends throughout the Arabian Peninsula. And when you have that kind of a reach, it becomes really important to get rid of those launch sites of those ballistic missiles and also cruise missiles that they have. So these are the kinds of things that the Houthis are still capable of. And if they are not -- those capabilities are not degraded, that's going to present a problem not only for Saudi Arabia, but potentially also for Bahrain, which, of course, helped in this effort.",

And that news today out of Oregon from the Oregon Supreme Court, they said in a one-page decision that, basically, they're doing the same thing as we are. They're going to watch the U.S. Supreme Court and see what they have to say on this matter. And then if there's possibly an avenue for the challengers in Oregon to continue their pursuit against Trump to get him off the ballot, for instance, if it's a narrow decision from the U.S. Supreme Court that maybe only applies to Colorado, then they can refile their case. And the Oregon court was very clear about that today. They said, we're not taking this up for now, but we're going to wait and watch. And one more thing I should point out here. You hear Donald Trump very often on the campaign trail -- we heard it yesterday -- where he makes the case that this is all one massive partisan witch-hunt by liberal judges, Democrat judges who are just trying to get him off the ballot. The decision today from Oregon was a win for Trump. He's still on the ballot there. That court, all of the appointees on that court came from Democratic governors, and the Democratic secretary of state of Oregon agreed with the decision.

Monday's caucuses are expected to be the coldest ever. Windchills, temperatures could drop -- or, with windchills, temperatures could drop to as low as minus-40 in some parts of the Hawkeye State. Today, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson are holding campaign events, but Nikki Haley has canceled all in-person events because of blizzard warnings. The front-runner, Donald Trump, returns to the campaign trail this weekend with rallies planned there. And as the candidates make their final pitches to caucus-goers, one voting bloc remains top of mind, Iowa's evangelical voters. The latest Des Moines, Iowa, poll shows Trump leading among evangelical voters. They are a key group in Iowa's Republican base, and often they have been consequential in the caucuses. Let's get some perspective now from Ralph Reed. He's the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. Ralph, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. Compared to 2016, Trump has gained significant support among evangelical voters, despite some of his personal behavior that likely wouldn't make him a role model at church.

And how do you see him potentially faring in Iowa broadly? Does he still have a path to the White House if he comes in third? REED:  Well, I don't think he wants to come in third. I mean, I think -- again, I'm not a pundit or a prognosticator, and I'm not in the prediction business, but I think he would have to come in a healthy second, I think. And it's very interesting, because, again, as I said, Boris, we have had a number of candidate forums and events and town halls and house parties where all of these candidates have gotten a chance to meet these voters of faith. And I interviewed Ron DeSantis at one of the biggest of those events with over 1,400 pastors and pro-family activists in Iowa. It was one of the biggest events before the caucuses. And he was outstanding. He made his case. He talked about signing the heartbeat bill in Florida. He talked about creating a culture of life. I think he's done extremely well. I think the challenge is that, when it comes to the primary electorate, Donald Trump is not a big fish in a small pond. He's a whale in a bathtub. He's got a lot of support.

But if it's -- if the wind's blowing 40 miles an hour and the snow's falling sideways, that could be a problem. But without -- with that as the caveat, there were 190,000 votes counted in the caucuses in 2016, the last time it was contested and competitive.
