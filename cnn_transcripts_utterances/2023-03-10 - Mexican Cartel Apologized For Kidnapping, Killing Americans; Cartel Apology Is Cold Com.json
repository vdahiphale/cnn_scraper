They also handed over five members who they claim were responsible. CNN's Carlos Suarez joins us live from South Carolina where the victims are from. Carlos, I imagine an apology from a cartel is probably pretty rare. What exactly does this letter say, and how are the victims' families reacting to it?",

They're still, of course, taking a look at that letter.But late word at this hour is that it does appear that the Mexican government has arrested five people in connection with this kidnapping. That brings the total number of folks taken into custody to six. One was taken, detained shortly after all of this happened earlier this week - Kristin?",

But we're in this weird world where good news isn't always good because it gives the Fed more ammo to aggressively hike rates, which, of course, has its own consequences.

I've been worried about the deficit for a long time, especially in a world with rising interest rates. That said, you don't use the debt ceiling, which is obligations we've already spent and just owe people, the debt that the debt ceiling would affect, we've already made that spending. That doesn't change the spending trajectory going forward. I think it's very important for us to think, at this stage of the game, the bond market has gotten jittery already. We don't want to have some kind of additional shock to the bond market that affects it in a very different way in an inflationary environment that we're in. That could cause the Fed to stop and have to reverse course and then leave us with more residual inflation than we'd like for much longer.",

Thanks so much.So this gives a whole new meaning to the term \"model rocket.\" A company is preparing to launch the world's first 3-D printed rocket. Yes. We'll talk to the man behind the Terran 1 Project, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:51:46] FISHER: It could be a big milestone for the space industry. The launch of the world's first 3-D printed rocket set for tomorrow. The company, Relativity Space, tried to launch the rocket, called Terran 1, for the first time on Wednesday, but the launch was scrubbed at the last minute. If it works, it will determine if 3-D printing can really be an alternative to the traditional rocket building method. Joining me now is the co-founder and CEO of Relativity Space, Tim Ellis, live from Cape Canaveral, just steps from the launch pad. Tim, I noticed a big step that your company has been building towards for many years now. First, I would like you to explain why you believe the world needs 3-D printed rockets. I believe you once called it the holy grail for automation in aerospace. TIM ELLIS, CEO &amp; CO-FOUNDER, RELATIVITY SPACE: Yes, Kristin, happy to share. I started my career as a propulsion engineer working for Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, where I designed and developed rocket engines, starting from a blank sheet of paper to the 3-point conversion. As part of that process, I ended up doing the first model 3-D printing at Blue Origin and then working with Jeff and the senior executives to start the 3-D division. But very quickly, when I started Relativity seven years ago, I realized instead of printing bits and parts of a rocket, 3-D printing was a completely new approach to many constructions. That could actually replace the traditional factory, the design process and the development process, and result in rockets that have far fewer parts and are much faster and cheaper to build. That's what we've been pioneering at Relativity is this new large- scale 3-D printing approach. Seven years later, we have a rocket that is 85 percent metal 3-D printed sitting on the launch pad, ready to go, and be the first of many historic milestones for our industry.",
