      "sentences": "The flag above the White House is once again flying at half staff, as we watch this all too familiarritual in the wake of yet another deadly mass shooting play out. President Biden putting out a statement offering his prayers to the victims and their families and also thanking first responders for acting quickly and courageously. He says that federal law enforcement officials are offering assistance to state and local authorities. But what we`re also hearing from President Biden is once again a call to action a call to enact the kind of common sense gun reforms that President Biden believes are necessary. And he`s also making clear who he believes is responsible for the inaction on those efforts in Washington, saying in a statement, quote: Too many families have empty chairs at their dinner tables. Republican members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug. Tweeted thoughts and prayers are not enough. Once again, I asked Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Enacting universal background checks. Requiring safe storage. Ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe. And President Biden in this statement also says that he believes the country has made some progress in addressing this issue, pointing to his signing of that bipartisan safer communities act that sought to incentivize more red flag laws in the country and address mental health resources, but he also makes clear that he believes that despite the nearly two dozen executive actions he has signed on this issue, he believes he`s now reached the limit of his executive authorities and he says that the burden now rests with Congress.

And there were a number of important issues on the agenda North Korea and security issues in the region but also historical issues which date back to the time when Japan colonized Korea. Now, for example, forced labor during wartime. This is an issue that President Yoon has been trying to resolve. He has come under domestic criticism for that in a belief by some. Certainly, the more liberal part of the country that he is offering more concessions to Japan than he is receiving in return. Now there were some hopes from the liberals that there would be another apology from Japan`s side for the colonial times. There was not but there was a personal message of sympathy from Japan`s prime minister. FUMIO KISHIDA, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): My heart aches as many people went through a very difficult and sad experience in the harsh environment at that time.",

Now, North Korea was also a very important issue and the increasing threat from the North. Now, we have heard repeatedly from Washington that they would like to see their two allies in the region move closer together. Now, we have seen and heard from both leaders that they are information sharing. That there is more of a security sharing process when it comes to the missile threat from North Korea and that is certainly being welcomed by Washington. Here`s President Yoon. YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Prime Minister Kishida and I shared the recognition that North Korea`s nuclear and missile development poses a grave threat to peace and stability not only on the Korean peninsula and Japan but also throughout the world.

On your grocery list, the French to English translation for pain is bread. Now, when it comes to finding authentic French bakeries, Rhode Island maybe not the first place you`d look. But looky here, one French baker named Belinda Quinn will make you think a wee bit different about the Ocean State. She came from Paris, opened a bakery in Newport and her shop sells out within hours of opening every weekend. I sure hope my pate a croissants with it someday. Belinda, the French baker shares with us some of the secrets to the scrumptiousness of the pain au chocolat. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELINDA QUINN, CO-FOUNDER, LE BEC SURCE: We open at 7:00 and then we usually set out by 9:30, if not sometimes by 8:00, 8:30.",

You haveto be really patient to make a good pain au chocolat. I met my husband in Paris and I decided to follow him and then to move to the U.S. When I came to Newport, my first impression was you the food it was very different here and there is nothing for me authentic. So that`s why I decided I should really bring a touch of French. I knew that it would work because I knew that people they would know the difference. They would taste the quality. This is the day one when we mix all the ingredients and we make it into a dough. Day two, you do the lamination. You put -- you incorporate the butter in the dough and then you shape the pain au chocolat. It`s a French butter because there is a high content of fat. If you use the wrong type of butter, it won`t create any layers in the pastry. All right, this is like 30 something layers. And then day three, it`s where you proof and you bake the particular. So what makes the perfect pain au chocolate for me is when you buy in it, you have to taste this crispy crunchy layer on top and then inside, you have to have this very light and flaky dough, and then the taste of dark chocolate. Some people, they would just tell me, reading that this is like being in Paris again. I am proud of my French culture. I wanted to create my Le Bec Sucre to have this taste of French.
