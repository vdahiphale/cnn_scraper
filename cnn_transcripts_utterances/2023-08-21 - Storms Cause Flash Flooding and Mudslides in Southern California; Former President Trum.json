That's according to a senior law enforcement source with knowledge of the surrender. This time, the former president set to appear in Georgia where he's facing charges related to 2020 election interference there. The Fulton County district attorney has set a deadline of Friday for Trump and 18 co- defendants to surrender at the county jail. CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz is live outside of Rice Street there, the Fulton County -- actually at the courthouse. Not at Rice street at the jail.

That negotiation is important to them, because this is a different situation than when Donald Trump had to appear and be arrested and processed into the system in the federal cases when he was charged twice by the special counsel's office related to documents in Florida after his presidency as well as January 6th.Here in Georgia, now that he's facing these state charges, he has to go to the physical jail at some point, and his lawyers are going to want to make that as smooth as possible. They don't want him to be sitting inside that jail for an elongated period of time. It is not a pleasant place to be, and they have a large amount of people coming in every day. There's already dozens of people that have been booked at that jail just this morning. And it's Monday morning, overnight and into the morning. And so Trump is not going to want to spend a lot of time there as he's being arrested in responding to this warrant here. So his lawyers are very likely going to be coming over here first so that they can get everything negotiated, set, his bail time, approved by the judge so that they can be on their way to the arrest. Of course, we're going to have to see exactly if Donald Trump is going to be treated differently than any other criminal defendant and how much time he spends in the jail as opposed to the 18 other defendants in this case, who are also going to have to go through this process, very likely also going to want to negotiate their bail terms, and then head over later this week, to be processed, arrested, fingerprinted, potentially even searched and mug-shotted.",

One, he went to the federal court and said, I'm a federal official, I want my case to be in federal court. That's something that the law allows. He did that very soon, like, within two days after being indicted.And now over the weekend, his lawyers came back to the federal judge and said, we're asking to dismiss these charges because everything Mark Meadows did after the 2020 election he would not have done if he had not been the chief of staff to Donald Trump in the White House at that time. Someone who was carrying out their official duties, even if what Trump was doing does have some level of criminality around it. Meadows is trying to argue that he does not, in the federal case against Trump, he's not even named as a co-conspirator. He's another person, very likely a witness there, talking about what Trump and others were doing after the election. And so his lawyers are trying to move fast, get rid of these charges. We'll see if they're successful, but the thing to watch, Victor and Poppy, as we head into this week and into a hearing for Mark Meadows next Monday is whether this case will move differently for him than Donald Trump, and how much Mark Meadows wants to push himself away from his former boss.",

First is, well, I was acting as a federal official, therefore I need to be over in federal court.And then you say, I was acting within the scope of my job, in this case, as White House chief of staff. Therefore, I have immunity, and throw it out. There's really actually very little daylight in between those two things.

Now he says, now I need to be called special counsel, I need expanded powers. But it seems like all of this is only happening in a reactionary posture.

We've had -- we had great turnout at the Fair-Side Chats. I had a lot of Iowans and people outside of the state come up and just say thank you for doing that. It was a great opportunity to hear from the candidates. And so you know, I always take it very seriously. They're very knowledgeable and they want to interact with the candidates. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was a former president. These voters, they know who Donald Trump is. So I think Donald Trump is not new to media. He was a media personality before being president, so he understands that he can go on with this interview with Tucker Carlson, it's a much friendlier environment for him, so he doesn't have to answer those tough questions.",

But I think that if he doesn't show up in the primary debates, there's little evidence that it would necessarily hurt him. Could it help the other candidates try to make inroads in Iowa or in other states? Sure. Is it enough to catch Donald Trump? I'm skeptical that it is.
