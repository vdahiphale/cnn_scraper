LAUREN FOX, CNN'S POLITICS CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: Well, many lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats were obviously very inspired by the message you heard the Republican Leader from the Senate Mitch McConnell saying that he was inspiring as always. John Cornyn and other Republican arguing that he really hit it out of the park in terms of striking the right balance between thanking the American people for what they have done already, and also reminding Congress that more is likely needed in the future. And that comes at a very critical moment because lawmakers are going to be heading home for the holidays. And when they return, Republicans will control the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy, a Republican who has been for Ukraine aid in the past. But is now trying to become the Speaker of the House is going to have to make sure that he can pacify his right flank and in the future spending bills, it may be harder to get aid to Ukraine because of the just political dynamics in the House of Representatives. Now, that's not to say that it will be impossible. But the latest spending bill will include $45 billion in military assistance for Ukraine.

But certainly people here in Ukraine are expressing pride in their President; they're glad that he's bringing back more in terms of weapons and money from the United States. It is gratefully accepted and badly needed. And of course, if you ask any Ukrainian soldier, they will tell you that they never have enough weapons, they could always use more especially because they don't just want to hold the lines as they've been doing as of late. They want to make progress to push the Russians out of their country completely back to pre-2014 borders. But that was going to take a lot more than the Patriot Missile Defense Systems and the other weapons announced by the United States, it's also going to take more manpower. And there are a number of fronts that Russia is challenging Ukraine on right now with the East Bakhmut, of course, which was the main focus of President Zelenskyy's meetings with President Biden and his speech to the U.S. Congress comparing it to the 1777 battles of Saratoga that were decisive for the Americans and their fights against the colonial British. So many hundreds of years ago, that certainly struck a chord with some of the U.S. lawmakers in that room. And that was deliberate on the part of Zelenskyy, a very media savvy President who honed his chops on television, not only as a comedian, but also acting in a television program called servant of the people where he played an ordinary guy who stumbled into the presidency. But here he is now leading this country through this war getting rave reviews in the States but back home the reality is millions of people are living without electricity and heat right now in the dead of winter. There's a possible Russian build up to the northern border with Belarus, which could pull Ukrainian troops away from the frontlines where the fighting has been intense both in the south and to the east. And then of course, there's also the ongoing question of what Russia has planned next? Now the Kremlin is responding to Zelenskyy's visit at the White House saying that the U.S. supplying Patriot Systems to Ukraine will only prolong people suffering. Saying neither Biden nor Zelenskyy showed potential willingness to listen to Russia's concerns during the U.S. visit and the Russian Foreign Ministry - the Russian Foreign Ministry warning that the collective west is set for a potentially long confrontation with Russia, Lynda.",

      "sentences": "Well, I really think that it was a very important moment. Because if you look at what President Putin wasdoing, I mean, essentially, although they do not say that they are doing this, they don't use the word. But essentially what they're doing is putting Russia on a war footing, what they're saying what President Putin is saying, this clash in Ukraine was inevitable, it would have happened one way or the other. And as he put it, you know, people are dying. And unfortunately, that happens in war, but better now than later. So this is a justification that he's had, actually, for quite a long time. But it kind of to me, culminated in the statements that he made, you know, again, he would say, this is a conflict, not just with Ukraine. Ukraine is being manipulated by the west, he would say, this is a conflict with NATO. And then, as when I said up the ante, I mean, he's saying, you know, we can fight anywhere. And the implication of that, of course, is that there could be some out of region, action by Russia, and then the increase in weapons, you know, we'll spend whatever will it takes? And so I would say it's really an answer to Biden, an answer to certainly is Zelenskyy. And also there was I would go back to one more quote, which to me kind of summed it up, and explains the resentment that Vladimir Putin has where he said, Russia sought to be part of the civilized world. But it turned out we weren't welcome there. And so I think it's, you know, Putin turning his back saying you didn't want us any way you were planning on this. And I'm going to; you know, turn it around and do what you're doing. And, you know, take it to the enemy. It's a very real to me, one of the strongest moments, sadly, in what President Putin has been saying.",

So it must be very galling to him to see those pictures and that video of Zelenskyy in Washington, regardless of what he would say about it, but that must be really galling that the man they wanted out, and maybe even to be killed as Zelenskyy said, alive and kicking in Washington. And now he's back again. So he hasn't, Putin has not accomplished what he wants. But right now, he is intent; not only in giving messages to the world, but giving messages to his own people to stay the course follow us. This is us against the world - this in a very much that feeling. And I do think that some of that does have resonance with Russians.

Now it's been 18 months since Netanyahu has been in power. And obviously Russia has invaded Ukraine. And while Israel has always been sort of advancing this sort of tightrope, diplomatic tightrope is supporting Ukraine and humanitarianly and in the UN, but not providing it with weapons.

We are learning as you laid out from the three principles in Kabul from three separate girl schools that they were told that their elementary gold students would be unable to return to school until further notice. Now it is important to note the schools are currently on break, they aren't due to return until late March. But there isn't a whole lot of clarity on what these restrictions currently mean and how far reaching this ban will be whether it is affecting only a few schools in Kabul or whether this could potentially affect elementary school girls across the country. And of course, this is hugely concerning and hugely distressing for the young women and girls of Afghanistan. We've heard from one university student, a young 21 year old woman who was due to be finishing her final exams just over the coming day. She had this message for us; I always thought that we can overcome our sorrow and fear by getting educated. However, this time is different. It is just unacceptable and unbelievable. And this is hugely distressing. We have seen women and girls taking to the streets protesting. But there is a concern around what measures the Taliban will take to really clamp down on education. We heard from one student at a private education sector, center say that they had seen a sign on the wall telling them that women were to wait until further notice before returning to school. But men could continue to go to the private education center for classes according to an administrator at that center, Taliban officials had personally come some of them armed to inform them of this new measure.

That means that people who died because of another underlying condition will not be counted as a COVID death, even if they were sick with COVID at the time, that goes against the World Health Organization's guidelines and the W.H.O. says it will severely underestimate the true death toll in China.

I also went to a COVID designated hospital where a worker told me elderly patients with COVID are dying every day. A new study by Hong Kong researchers estimates nearly 1 million people in China could die from COVID if the country doesn't take necessary public health measures like increased vaccinations. The vaccination rate is still lagging for people over 60 and only run 42 percent of those over 80 have received a booster shot. And experts say that third dose is necessary to get enough protection since China is using less effective vaccines compared to the mRNA vaccines used overseas. China is only now going through this painful reopening but the rest of the world has already gone through, but China is not sharing the same data. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.",

This rover was only supposed to live up there for about two years. That was what it was designed for. And it's lasted twice as long. It's been up there for four years, so don't feel too bad for it. It has been scientifically very successful it is detected, the Mars version of earthquakes, they're called Mars quakes, for the very first time, really getting like an internal health check of the red planet. And what ultimately led to its demise, Lynda, was all that dust one of the last selfies that this rover took in it, you could see its solar arrays all covered with red Martian dust. And if those solar arrays get too caked with dust, of course, it can't get the energy from the sun that it needs in order to power all these systems. So NASA did indeed lose communication with the Insight rover earlier this week, formally saying goodbye to it, but you know it lasted twice as long as it was supposed to, so good luck, Godspeed.

It's actually the loss of space because if wildlife are not able to move over large distances, they affect the environment in a way that negatively impacts them. If the territories of lions are much smaller and have little prey, the lands fight and prides kill each other as a result. So the conservancy actually expands the area available for wildlife. And in the Mara, now, it has doubled by the creation of the 22 conservancies. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): The success of the conservancy's movement lies in the fact that it not only helps the wildlife, but also the local community diversifying their income streams with the addition of tourism. In Ol Kinyei and the neighboring Naboisho Conservancy 90 percent of the camp workers are from the local community, with more Maasai students being trained each year.",

This is one of the big things you don't want to see when you are headed out on the roadways or heading onto an airplane. We already have significant delays out of the Chicago airport also some delays out of Miami for an unrelated issue. But we anticipate a lot more of these airports starting to transition into the orange and red color, meaning that delays and cancellations are ticking up as the snow begins to make its way off towards the east in the coming hours. Behind that system though, incredibly cold temperatures, all of these areas where you see the purple and blue color are under some type of wind chill advisory or wind chill warning. And it's the combination of the temperature but also the wind and when they mix together you get these bitter cold feels like temperatures. Denver, Colorado for example, the feels like temperature is minus 39 degrees Celsius, even Amarillo, Texas, a state as far south as Texas looking at some of those wind chills around minus 32. So again, this is a very widespread concern. Here's a look at the forecast map of where we anticipate some of those delays we already talked about for the rest of the day. So other cities like Memphis, Atlanta, Raleigh, Washington, DC, New York and Boston all likely to end up with pretty significant delays and cancellations as the bulk of that storm begins to make its way off towards the east.
