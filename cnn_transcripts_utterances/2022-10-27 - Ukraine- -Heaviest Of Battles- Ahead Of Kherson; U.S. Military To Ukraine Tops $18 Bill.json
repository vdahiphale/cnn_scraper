Russian installed administrators are leaving the city along with more than 70,000 civilians. Kherson was the first Ukrainian city to fall and remains the largest city still under Russian control. For the east, the Ukrainian town of Bakhmut has been under intense and sustained Russian artillery fire for weeks. Tactics President Zelenskyy described as crazy.

It's very difficult for them to get out. The Ukrainian said the other day, they have blown all the bridges, and they are attacking the ferries that are carrying supplies and equipment both to the east and the west of the Russians.

He had 24 hours to prepare, to face the House of Commons and the conservative benches behind him are full of cheers and support for the new prime minister as energetic and boisterous as I've seen them in a number of years. Here's Donna, the leader of the Labour Party and Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish National Party both sincerely celebrated the fact that Britain's new prime minister is of Asian heritage. Starmer didn't waste too much time on celebration and pleasantries though before he started asking hard questions to begin with revolving around Sunak's reappointment of Suella Braverman as Home Secretary. So far, his most controversial appointment since becoming prime minister. That's because Braverman was fired as home secretary six days before her reappointment, she was sacked by Liz Truss for a security breach. So, there have been questions raised and eyebrows by the Labour Party and other opposition parties as to whether or not there was some kind of deal made behind the scenes between Sunak and Braverman. But in terms of giving his party more confidence and more enthusiasm for the prime minister and the direction of the party, Sunak seems to have delivered. It was interesting to see him go up against Kier Starmer, as both politicians have some similarities in terms of their communication style, known for being serious, having a good grasp of the brief and detail. Watching them go toe to toe, it seems that Sunak may be able to get his wish, which he said at the beginning of this Prime Minister's Questions which was to have serious grown up exchanges with the leader of the opposition.
