Both states have banned the former president's name from the ballot in the Republican presidential primary. The legal challenges successfully argued the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban, what seems to be Trump removed from the ballot, so those decisions have been paused, pending potential appeals.Challenges in several other states have been rejected though. And now Oregon Supreme Court will decide whether to ban Trump from the ballot there over his alleged role in the January 6th insurrection. Tuesday's expected appeals are coming at the start of a busy month for Trump which includes closing arguments in the New York civil fraud trial and the start of the presidential primary season. First test of this year's presidential election come to just two weeks, the Iowa caucuses. Trump has maintained a consistent lead in the polls there despite mounting legal troubles but his rivals Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis hoping for a strong showing.

When you look at the poll numbers, you still see that Donald Trump, according to these polls, has a very substantial lead. He is the front runner.And their goal is to keep that margin really high between him and whoever the second place person is. Now the polls show that that would be Ron DeSantis right now and after that, Nikki Haley. Now the thing about Ron DeSantis is that Iowa is critical to the Florida governor. He has made this centrally his make or break moment put all of his cards or all of his eggs in the Iowa basket and is really focused on that. However, we have seen some substantial rise in the polls from Nikki Haley, but still looks as though that would be the order. Now whatever happens in Iowa is really going to set the tone for the rest of the primary and caucus season. Right now, Donald Trump is leading in most states, but there is a part or there are several Republican operatives who believe that if Donald Trump has slowdown in Iowa, if that margin is not as big as those polls show, it's possible that someone else could take the lead we could see someone else surge. But right now, it's just still very early, and the big focus still remains on Iowa on the Hawkeye State. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington.",

His lawyers argued in court, they -- and they said, well, we only want a temporary immunity. And that immunity exists while he's president, Donald Trump as president.And it will, in their words, his lawyers expire when the President left office. So Donald Trump has already argued in court against his own position now. But Donald Trump's broad claim of immunity is laughable. It doesn't pass the smell test. Because in no way would the framers have said, yes, everybody basically is subscribes to the law. But the President if while he's -- if he's president can commit murder, can do anything.

There's also concerned that he has additional bleeding, so efforts are underway to rush him from a hospital in Busan likely fly him by helicopter here to Seoul where he will get treatment.This happened at a very open event, this happened at a tour of a construction site, unlike other parts of the world where distances between the public and politicians. Here in South Korea, this is a very open event, a very typical open event. He was touring a construction site when this man came up to him with a knife, jumped in front of him and then attacked him. As far as his attacker, according to people on the scene, he was wrestled to the ground and then restrained by several people. In fact, I saw one photo of him earlier, where Mr. Lee is lying on the ground. Someone has a handkerchief to his neck presumably to stem the bleeding. So right now he is supposedly being transferred to a hospital in Seoul where of course there are top notch medical facilities here in this major city here in South Korea. It is important though to give you some context too. The political atmosphere right now in South Korea is extremely divided. Lee is a liberal. Current President Yoon is a conservative. In fact, Lee lost to you in the bid for the presidency in 2022 in a very slim margin. So these politicians, you know, are both very prominent. The president of South Korea, it is notable to point out is very quick to respond to all of this, emphasizing that violence should not be tolerated under any circumstances and ordered police to investigate this swiftly. And this is a reflection of the fragile political atmosphere that South Korea is witnessing right now. In fact, Lee's own spokesperson called on party members to remain calm and not to make any kind of political interpretations. And finally, John, this is not the first time we have seen an attack like this back in 2006. Former president Park was attacked while she was on the campaign trail. Also in recent years, the U.S. ambassador to Korea was also attacked by someone wielding a knife. So the priority right now for us, at least here is to find out the condition of Mr. Lee. We expect him to be arriving at a hospital very shortly if he hasn't already arrived and hopefully doctors. In the hours ahead, John, we'll give us a briefing.",

But they are hampered by these aftershocks as well that we just heard about. So actually, the U.S. Geological Survey has come out in the last hour saying that they have detected some 35 aftershocks in the 24 hours around that epicenter. So you can imagine the kind of pressure that they are under to get to those incidents that have been reported. Now as for Wajima City, this is where local authorities have earlier said in statements, said you know, they had all of these incidences that were reported overnight. As daylight came they were able to see the extent of the damage. They need to get to all of those reported incidents and try to get to people who might be trapped. Now with earthquakes like this, with the kind of damage that they caused, it is often under collapsed buildings where you see the greatest worry and the loss of life. You mentioned that that death toll has gone up. We also have heard from authorities that they will and gradually likely to revise numbers, and you know, obviously they wouldn't want to see them to go up any more than they have. But you know, like you said it is a race against time and they're doing what they can in daylight hours to get to all of the incidents that have been reported. I just want to give it a bit of environmental context, as well. Of course Japan on that ring of fire and as we just heard in your package there, this is a flank of Japan that is not often affected by earthquakes like this. Nevertheless, it has knocked out power.

Also many conservative legislatures around the country, around the United States have made voting harder for some groups.So out of all of these three things, which poses the biggest danger? And what is the impact having all three at once? WALDMAN: Well you're right that they all do kind of combine both as threats and as threats to people's trust in the election. The good news is that we have a track record now over the last few years of how to strengthen our democratic systems so they withstand this kind of thing. If you recall in 2016, Russia interfered in the American election with hacked emails and got involved in that way. There've been a lot of improvements in the cybersecurity and other kinds of security of election systems all over the country. Though there is more to do, and as you said we have every reason to think that not just Russia but China and Iran and North Korea, who else knows, will have a reason to kind of get involved. We do have a new risk though of artificial intelligence, A.I. and the kinds of deepfakes that have been used to try to influence elections in other countries. We need to be ready for that. We need to stand by the election officials who are getting lots of threats of violence and harassment. And to make sure they have the resources they need, the money they need, the law enforcement protection they need. If we do all of these kinds of things then we'll have a smooth election that people can trust.",

And AP/NORC poll finds 87 percent of Democrats believe a second Trump term will negatively impact democracy. While 82 percent of Republicans have the same believe should Biden win.There was another poll from the Public Religion Research Institution which found nearly a quarter of Americans, 23 percent, agree that because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country, according to this survey. This is up from 15 percent in 2021. Is it too simplistic to look at these polls and say right now the country is moving close to some kind of outbreak of violence as we head toward these elections?

We haven't seen anything like that since the beginning of the U.S. Civil War, if that.It is of course, unnerving, that Democrats and Republicans in some ways for different reasons are concerned about the future of American democracy. I think there's also potentially a silver lining in that. We have thought for a long time that the health of our democracy ought to be a central public issue as it has been at other times in American history. People really care about this. Voters at the polls, for example, in 2022 punished election deniers. People who claimed the election had been stolen, they actually did considerably worse than other Republican candidates when they were running for statewide offices that could control, could have a big impact on the elections like governor or secretary of state. It turns out there's a big -- sort of exhausted majority, I wouldn't call it a silent majority, that cares about American democracy and kind of resents people, extremist people who would try to undermine it. I'm hoping this is kind of a bipartisan coming together around first principles.",

Franco has been on administrative leave from the Rays since the allegations were made back in August. At the time he posted a video statement on Instagram where he seemed to deflect the accusations, and talked about his own self-efforts -- own efforts rather at self-improvement. Also in the United States, a victim of cyber kidnapping, a foreign exchange student from China has been found safe in the Utah mountains. Neither the student nor his parents in China actually met with the kidnappers. They just dealt with him over the phone. Details now from CNN's Nick Watt. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And they told 17-year-old Kai Zhuang to isolate himself. That is why he was in this tent in the middle of nowhere. The family, they say that they paid around $80,000 into Chinese bank accounts. They also contacted the high school in Utah. The high school contacted the police and the police by looking at this 17-year-old's spending patterns what he bought, they worked out that he was camping. So search parties were sent out and eventually he was found in his tent. Apparently the cyber, kidnapping is an increasingly common occurrence targeting foreign exchange students, particularly Chinese foreign exchange students. Now this story ended well in that the student was found alive and well. He asked to speak to his family. He asked for a warm cheeseburger, he is safe. But as I say this is apparently an increasingly common trend seen in this country of cyber kidnappers targeting these young vulnerable kids far from home.
