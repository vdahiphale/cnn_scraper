When I talked to Donald Trump senior advisers about this, look, they didn't have a direct response to the father of IVF quote. But what they said - where they said that was coming from was essentially that Donald Trump thinks that he is a leader on that particular issue, especially when you look back at some of the IVF rulings or Supreme Court rulings like in Alabama in February that did impact access to IVF, and Donald Trump had quickly come out and said, I support this, and other Republican officials followed suit.It is something I know that he brags about often in private conversations, and he thinks it's one issue where he can really help narrow that gender gap and try to make inroads with female voters. But I do want to turn your attention to another very notable moment from that town hall, which was when he tried to clarify his comments, when he said that the greatest threat to United States is the enemy of the people.

I think the big thing here is that a lot of Republican allies, people in the Trump campaign, were trying to defend these remarks from the former president and say that he was referring to protesters, to rioters. He talked about sending the military in to deal with the enemy from within.And then he said, no, actually, he was talking about his political opponents. He was talking about Democrats. He mentioned directly the Pelosis. And so I think it's very clear what he was trying to say. The other part of this, of course, is that Republicans continue to argue that Democrats are using very dangerous rhetoric. They continue to blame we just saw Nancy Mace do this with you moments ago, blame Democrats for the assassination attempts on the former president. But it is, you know, Donald Trump is using very dangerous language too.",

But yes, he was asked about this. A Republican voter said that, you know, I've seen these comments. The officials on the ground, Republican officials on the ground, have debunked these claims. You said that you would revoke their temporary protected status, the Haitian migrants who are living in Ohio, are you about that, do you take any of that back.And Donald Trump, he kind of tried to dodge it. He said that he was just looking at reports. He said, quote, \"I was just saying what was reported.\" He went on, though, to add that they were eating other things too, that they were not supposed to be.\" I mean, he is not running away from this. I think it's very clear that, you know, these officials on the ground, again, Republican officials, the Republican mayor of the town, the Republican governor of Ohio, have been saying that these are just not true. And it goes beyond that as well. We know that these communities have been deeply impacted. We've seen the stories of these Haitian migrants saying they are scared now in that community, we've seen the bomb threats and the closures of schools because of this rhetoric and it's something that Donald Trump and JD Vance and a lot of Republicans are not running away from. I think it was very interesting that a Republican voter asked him that question directly and tried to see if he would walk away from it. And Donald Trump said, this is something I read. But again, even if he had read that and it is later not true, these are comments that have been - he's been consistently told are not true and is continuing to pedal.",

Listen to the question and answer the question. I think that's what she has to do.She has to show that she is a competent person who has easy access in her mind to the facts, at least in a general way, that she has spontaneous thought that she can be original, that she has to portray a kind of competence that, you know, going back to memorized campaign slogans, does not project. But I think that she's maybe relaxing for the first time she understands she's in the 11th hour that she may be trailing. It's so darn close, you don't know. So I think that we will see now the real Kamala Harris, and I'm optimistic that that she will represent in a way that that is profoundly appealing to the voters, contrasting - I think of Donald Trump is also with these town halls, Boris, I also think that he portrays or projects himself in the best possible light. Of course, he says dumb ass things like Haitians are eating things they're not supposed to. And, you know, going off on some of these crazy rants like you and I and people that look like us are poisoning the blood of the nation.

If Donald Trump was talking about them when he says things as you noted, that are just off color to say the least, and 51 percent - this is overall Latino voters - but 51 percent of Latino voters who were born outside the country, who were not even born in the United States, do not think that Donald Trump is talking about them when he says those things about immigrants.

All he wanted to do is be an American.You know, he tried his best. That's why the family became Republicans. We wanted to be, you know, just like every other citizen and there's a - there is an appeal, I think, that is effectively being made by the Trump campaign now to divide and conquer, make it a class kind of thing. You know, we're not the horde coming across the border in our many 10s of thousands. We're the ones who are opening businesses and becoming anchors on CNN and NewsNation and this and that. But the fact of the matter is that there is a racist appeal here. You know, I've known this guy forever, and I don't believe when I knew him in years past and decades past, that he had any racism in him. I could tell by the people he hired, the people around him, he had, you know, everybody, he's very integrated. He was not race conscious. But now I believe that he has made a decision, a pragmatic - a ruthlessly pragmatic decision, to make a racial appeal that the other is coming to take over, that this brown horde is coming to rape your children and steal your jobs.

And remember that he even went after the Vice President of United States, Pence - Mike Pence and tried to get him to distort his constitutional role in certifying the electors to disavow or discredit or disallow the election results. Remember how you felt that that man was impeached for a good reason. He was acquitted, but he was a peach, impeached for a good reason. He used anti-democratic tactics to try and thwart the will of the American people.
