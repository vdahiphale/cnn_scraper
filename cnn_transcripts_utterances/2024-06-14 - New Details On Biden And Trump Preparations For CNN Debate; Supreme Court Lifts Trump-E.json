Also tonight, Pope Francis makes a historic visit to the G7 summit in Italy, meeting with President Biden and other world leaders about concerns over artificial intelligence. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer and you're in The Situation Room. First up tonight, an inside look at the debate preparations taking place inside the Biden and Trump campaigns. CNN's Kristen Holmes is working her sources for us. She's over at a Trump event in Florida. And CNN's Arlette Saenz has details on President Biden's plan to take on his predecessor once again. First to you, Kristen. Trump is expected, I take it, to speak at any moment now. Give us the latest.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. Well, this is actually his 78th birthday celebration with some of his biggest supporters called Club 47. It is a group committed to getting Donald Trump re-elected. And while you are likely to not hear Donald Trump take any jabs at Biden's age, he will probably make some self- deprecating jokes. He is turning 78, meaning that if he does win in November, he would be the oldest person in to become president of the United States, something that the former president is very aware of. That is why when you hear him attacking Joe Biden, he often talks about his mental fitness but avoids the actual comments about Biden's age, knowing that he is just a few years younger. Now, you mentioned that debate prep, that's part of how he spent the day before his birthday when he was in Washington, D.C. What we saw publicly was those meetings with House and Senate Republicans, but according to sources, afterwards, he had a, quote/unquote, policy session at the Republican National Committee building. Present were some of his closest aides, as well as Senators Eric Schmidt of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida, someone who we know is on the short list to be vice president.Now, according to these sources, they want to be very clear that this wasn't debate prep in the traditional sense, that they were just talking policy, but one of the things that came up in those topics was January 6th, how to answer questions about what happened on January 6th, about how to answer questions on democracy and how to answer questions on what Donald Trump has talked about post-January 6th, including pardoning some of the people who were involved in January 6th, clearly preparing in some way, or at least in his way, for those debates. Now, again, his team has said over and over again, he is not going to have any kind of traditional debate. There's not going to be someone coming filling in for President Joe Biden filling in for Jake or Dana. It is instead going to be these series of policy sessions as well as taking questions like we saw last week when he was in Arizona from voters in the crowd or meeting with various groups of people or sitting down for contentious interviews. We will obviously see how this plays out when he takes the stage in just two weeks, Wolf?",

But what it should steer away from is a laundry list of accomplishments that can become numbing and voters aren't directly feeling it and rather do the storytelling of what it means when the Biden administration puts out a policy around gun violence reform is able to pass historic legislation and how that saves people's lives or puts out a policy about a care agenda and how we have a growing community of people who need care whether that's child care or whether that's caring for our elder parents and talk about how that's what they stand for.Those are the issues that Americans care about.

They're reaching out to African-American influencers, sports figures and different people who can help carry that message. He doesn't have to win black voters or black men. He just needs to carve out a few percent. And it strikes me that they're on track to do that right now, if you look at the polling. So, it's very alarming for the Biden campaign.

So, I think what Donald Trump is doing right now is trying to show up in the late stages of his campaign to begin to court black voters.But what I do think Democrats need to do, they do need to show up and have that conversation and understand where voters are. We often say meet the person, meet the voter, where they are. If you are not happy with Joe Biden, acknowledge that. Have a conversation. Talk about what you're unhappy about. And the Biden campaign then needs to make the case about why black voters should stick with President Biden. I will just say Joe Biden is not going to win black voters but he does need to ensure and run a successful campaign to make sure black voter -- excuse me, Donald Trump is not going to win black voters, but Joe Biden does need to run a successful campaign to make sure that black voters show up and don't stay home this cycle.",

There was also another big gun rights case, and that question is whether folks who have a restraining order related to domestic violence can own a firearm. Also, a big, really, potentially just an earthquake in terms of the federal government case related to the power of federal agencies.

If you think about the possible scenarios that could result from this, I don't think it's at all likely that the Supreme Court wholeheartedly accepts Donald Trump's immunity argument and just dismisses the case.I think we're looking at two realistic scenarios that are so different from a legal and political perspective. One outcome is the Supreme Court could reject Donald Trump's immunity argument, in which case, the case goes back to the tribal court and we very likely could have a trial on Jack Smith's January 6th case happening in August, September, October of this election year. The other scenario is the Supreme Court could say, yes, there is such thing as presidential immunity, but it has to go back to the trial court to do further fact finding. If that happens, that will probably take too long and this trial probably will not happen before the election. So, you can see the enormity of the consequences if we just play out those scenarios.",

And with every passing day, they're more responsible for the problem you identify of getting this trial on the books.We'll see, at least right about the two forks in the road, we'll see which one they take.

Now, earlier, the judge had approved that Alex Jones personal assets will be liquidated to help pay off the nearly $1.5 billion that he owes the families of those Sandy Hook victims for defamation and emotional stress for his years of lies, claiming that Sandy Hook Massacre did not actually happen. But what was surprising was that the judge actually ordered that the company, the parent company of InfoWars, of his conspiracy theory platform, would not be liquidated. Now, this does not mean that everything is rosy for Alex Jones. This was a question of essentially economic reality, he said.Now, the families of the Sandy Hook victims were a bit split on this. Some of the families wanted liquidation immediately. They wanted everything to be sold off. This other families from Texas argued against it, and this was because they said that liquidation is a lengthy and costly process, and by not liquidating, by having the company be in bankruptcy court, they could get their money faster through state courts, and the judge agreed with them. In fact, the judge sounded very thoughtful and almost pained in some of it when he was making his decision, saying that he recognized that the timing of this was hard because Father's Day is coming up. He said it was one of the most difficult cases he has ever had, but he said this was in the best interest of the families.",

Now, Wolf, he was in New York at the time of that search. Now, here, his attorneys are arguing against any restrictions on his speech. They're making many of the same arguments that they have made many times related to other gag orders pointing to the fact that he is the leading candidate for the Republican ticket, for the presidency, insinuating that this is some sort of efforts to restrict his political speech. Now, these are arguments that have played out in New York. And in this case, the judge overseeing this case has already tossed this gag order request saying that the prosecutors did not sufficiently confer with Trump's attorneys before filing it. So they're once again litigating this issue and Trump's attorneys this time in addition to the usual arguments about his political speech and how it should be protected, there are also pointing out the prosecutors have not submitted, quote, any evidence, threats or harassment resulting from Trump's speech.",

She'll be traveling in a carriage of the road behind me, should be appearing on the balcony if all goes well, and all of this announcement really came today when they released a photograph as well, which is really poignant. She's there on her own. She looks well and she talks about not being out of the woods yet. So this is personal, is deep. It's a big test. We're going to see how with their kids all the time tomorrow.
