Now, he conditioned it, saying that that's when all the civilians are evacuated. And he has tasked the IDF with coming up for a plan to evacuate what we understand to be about 1.4 million people, displaced people in Rafah. That's right against the border with Egypt. Many of them have been displaced many times.So far, the IDF has not put forward publicly a plan to evacuate that many people. And it doesn't appear from what we understand that the IDF has been given orders yet to go into Rafah. But, I think the expectation is that this operation could be coming. Even if it doesn't feel imminent, it could still be very, very close. But, it does appear as if the IDF is still tied up in Khan Younis, and the fight there has been going on much longer than they anticipated, in part because of the many tunnel systems that are inside Khan Younis. But, for the IDF and for the government here, they see Rafah not so much as the last sort of safe place for 1.4 million displaced people. They see it as the last place of refuge for the Hamas leadership and potentially the place where many of the hostages are being kept and hidden. We know that two hostages were freed from Rafah just at the beginning of this week. So, from that perspective, it is still from the Israeli government perspective, a viable target. Now, is the Prime Minister doubling down on his language to put pressure on Hamas during the hostage negotiations, which is also pressuring Hamas by saying that they have to change their terms of what they want over the negotiations to release the hostages? Is it all just pressure? Well, I think we've seen until now that while it can sound like pressure on a negotiating position, it can also very quickly turn actually into action on the ground.",

It all began when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner announced the panel had information concerning a \"serious national security threat.\" Multiple sources familiar with the Intel say it's related to Russian efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space. In a controversial move, Turner announced that he'd made the information available to all members of Congress, and he is urging President Biden to declassify the intelligence. But, several senior members of Congress briefed on the matter say the intelligence does not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. or its interests.CNN's Katie Bo Lillis joins me now live from Washington. Katy Bo, what can you tell us about the capabilities of this technology, and whether or not that would pose a direct threat to the U.S. or its interests?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, here is what we know at this point. U.S. officials who described this intelligence to CNN say that it is about a Russian effort to develop a nuclear anti-satellite capability for use in space. Now, it's important to emphasize right off the top that it's not clear at this point whether or not the intelligence refers to a nuclear-armed capability or a nuclear-powered capability. Obviously, a big distinction here.But, what is clear is that this technology, in theory, could imperil America's vast network of both commercial and military satellites, to include the satellites that are vital to America's command and control over its nuclear arsenal. Also important to note, this technology hasn't been deployed yet at this point. And it's not clear right now, according to sources that we spoke to, how far along the development process actually is, right, how sophisticated or effective this technology has actually become. And at this point, right now, according to officials that we spoke to who reviewed this intelligence, this is more in the realm of a longer term strategic threat to the United States, something that is important, something that U.S. officials need to know about and need to be able to respond to over the long term, but not an acute national security crisis, as some U.S. officials felt that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner, made it out to be in that cryptic statement that he issued yesterday, urging all members of Congress to come down to the Intelligence Committee's classified spaces to view a matter of urgent national security concerns. So, a lot of questions, I think, on Capitol Hill right now about why the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee chose to at this moment sort of push this incredibly sensitive intelligence into the public eye in such a dramatic fashion. By halfway through the day, we were hearing from the House -- from the Speaker of the House, a Republican also, Speaker Mike Johnson, who was coming out publicly and trying to allay some of the concerns about this urgent national security threat that the Intelligence Committee Chairman had referenced. Now, Turner, at this point, urging the Biden administration to declassify and make public as much information about this threat as they can about this intelligence as they cannot clear that that's going to happen. We heard even from the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that making this information public could likely damage very valuable sources and methods that the intelligence community uses to acquire this sort of intelligence. So, at this point, we are waiting right now for a briefing from the National Security Advisor to key members of the House today. That certainly will focus, I think, on the question of what can or cannot be made public.",

Currently, there is a $5 billion monthly gap in the Ukrainian budget. They need money desperately. If that money doesn't come, that means that teachers will not get salaries. It means that pensions will not be paid. It also is meant to go towards humanitarian support.I believe it was CNN's Nick Paton Walsh who said, if that money doesn't come in, it's so crucial that within two years we could see Ukraine fully occupied by Russia. What people have to understand on that side of the Atlantic are two things. Number one, this is a real deal what the U.S. is doing. With less than five percent of the U.S. Military budget, annual budget, they've enabled Ukraine to disable about 50 percent of conventional Russian military capability. And, of course, the other thing it's going to do is prevent further bottlenecks happening in the Black Sea. We're already experiencing serious bottlenecks in the Red Sea. This could delay further people's Tesla's, people's appliances, furniture, this sort of thing. So, it's going to hit people everywhere.",

So, they're not expensive. And the other thing that's happening, I mean, before the war, Ukraine had a very robust high tech sector, especially in the field.

Just ahead, Israeli Special Forces enter Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza. We will have the very latest on this ongoing operation. Then, NATO defense ministers discussed support for Ukraine and more. It's their first meeting since Donald Trump's controversial comments about the alliance. So, we'll have a live report from Brussels on that. And Police in Kansas City are trying to figure out who opened fire at the Super Bowl victory celebration, and why, what we know about the ongoing investigation. Israeli Special Forces have entered Nasser Hospital in Gaza, the largest remaining functioning medical facility in the Palestinian enclave. A video from inside the hospital shows smoke, dust and debris, and people walking around with flashlights. The IDF says it's conducting a precise limited operation and has apprehended a number of suspects. Gaza's Ministry of Health says more than 1,500 displaced people are still inside the facility. Doctors and medical officials in Gaza say Israeli snipers have fired on several people as they try to flee. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing powerful action in Rafah despite mounting international concern about what that might look like. More than one million displaced Palestinians are sheltering in that southern Gaza city. CNN's Nic Robertson is following all of these developments and he joins us live now from Tel Aviv.

It all began when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner announced the panel had information concerning a \"serious national security threat.\" Multiple sources familiar with the Intel say it's related to Russian efforts to deploy a nuclear anti-satellite system in space. In a controversial move, Turner announced that he'd made the information available to all members of Congress, and he is urging President Biden to declassify the intelligence. But, several senior members of Congress briefed on the matter say the intelligence does not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. or its interests.CNN's Katie Bo Lillis joins me now live from Washington. Katy Bo, what can you tell us about the capabilities of this technology, and whether or not that would pose a direct threat to the U.S. or its interests?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, here is what we know at this point. U.S. officials who described this intelligence to CNN say that it is about a Russian effort to develop a nuclear anti-satellite capability for use in space. Now, it's important to emphasize right off the top that it's not clear at this point whether or not the intelligence refers to a nuclear-armed capability or a nuclear-powered capability. Obviously, a big distinction here.But, what is clear is that this technology, in theory, could imperil America's vast network of both commercial and military satellites, to include the satellites that are vital to America's command and control over its nuclear arsenal. Also important to note, this technology hasn't been deployed yet at this point. And it's not clear right now, according to sources that we spoke to, how far along the development process actually is, right, how sophisticated or effective this technology has actually become. And at this point, right now, according to officials that we spoke to who reviewed this intelligence, this is more in the realm of a longer term strategic threat to the United States, something that is important, something that U.S. officials need to know about and need to be able to respond to over the long term, but not an acute national security crisis, as some U.S. officials felt that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner, made it out to be in that cryptic statement that he issued yesterday, urging all members of Congress to come down to the Intelligence Committee's classified spaces to view a matter of urgent national security concerns. So, a lot of questions, I think, on Capitol Hill right now about why the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee chose to at this moment sort of push this incredibly sensitive intelligence into the public eye in such a dramatic fashion. By halfway through the day, we were hearing from the House -- from the Speaker of the House, a Republican also, Speaker Mike Johnson, who was coming out publicly and trying to allay some of the concerns about this urgent national security threat that the Intelligence Committee Chairman had referenced. Now, Turner, at this point, urging the Biden administration to declassify and make public as much information about this threat as they can about this intelligence as they cannot clear that that's going to happen. We heard even from the Republican Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, saying that making this information public could likely damage very valuable sources and methods that the intelligence community uses to acquire this sort of intelligence. So, at this point, we are waiting right now for a briefing from the National Security Advisor to key members of the House today. That certainly will focus, I think, on the question of what can or cannot be made public.",

It means that pensions will not be paid.

What people have to understand on that side of the Atlantic are two things. Number one, this is a real deal what the U.S. is doing. With less than five percent of the U.S. Military budget, annual budget, they've enabled Ukraine to disable about 50 percent of conventional Russian military capability. And, of course, the other thing it's going to do is prevent further bottlenecks happening in the Black Sea. We're already experiencing serious bottlenecks in the Red Sea. This could delay further people's Tesla's, people's appliances, furniture, this sort of thing. So, it's going to hit people everywhere.",

The IDF says Hamas terrorists are likely hiding behind injured civilians inside Nasser Hospital. Hamas has denied that it's operating inside the facility.The move comes a day after the IDF ordered hundreds of displaced Palestinians, who were using the facility as a shelter, to leave. Doctors and medical officials say Israeli snipers shot at some of those people trying to flee. Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office is rejecting talk of a Palestinian state, saying this is not the time to be speaking about \"gifts for the Palestinian people.\" Benjamin Netanyahu is also vowing what he called powerful action in the southern Gaza city of Rafah despite mounting international concern about that. CNN's Paula Hancocks is covering these developments from Abu Dhabi, and she joins us now live. Paula, there are evacuation orders and a corridor, if you'd like, in place, technically the IDF has outlined, although there is reports of sniper fire of people who are trying to use that. However, what are people, who are patients within the hospital who are requiring medical attention, expected to do in this scenario?",

We can see from the images that came through to us from some of those still in the hospitals that were filming Israeli strikes, just how difficult the situation is. There were bloodied patients, a very dusty area. The \"Doctors Without Borders\" saying an undetermined number of people have been killed and have been injured in this particular operation. Now, we're hearing from the Israeli side that they believe and they say they have credible evidence also from former hostages that some hostages were held in that hospital. They believe that could be the bodies of deceased hostages. And we're hearing from a doctor, medical sources within the hospital where IDF bulldozers are digging up some of the graves that have been formed within the compound itself looking for those bodies. So, an incredibly difficult situation, not just for patients, for doctors, also for the displaced, who may have been hiding in that particular area believing it was safer than other areas. The Israeli military saying they should evacuate. But, we have been hearing from eyewitnesses and from medical personnel within the hospital that there have been Israeli snipers that have taken out and killed some of those that have tried to leave.

We simply don't know if that is the case.But, what we are seeing is an incredible number of world leaders vocalizing their concern, using quite emotive language in many cases, warning Israel not to carry out this invasion. We've heard the UN aid chief, for example, say that it could be a slaughter of it were to go ahead. We heard Israel's leader saying that it should not go ahead, that it appears that Israel is not listening to any other country in the world, including the United States.

Now, Greece recognized civil partnerships 10 years ago, so same-sex parents could go into a partnership, but not a wedding. This is likely to change today, giving them more rights, putting them on an equal footing as other couples. The debate at stake here has been very much about parenthood and whether people can adopt. So, this is something that now they will be able to do. Same-sex couples will be able to adopt. But, it has stopped ahead of a surrogacy issue. This is something that they will not be allowed to do. This has been the most controversial issue along the way.The history of this battle basically has very much involved the church, the Orthodox Church of Greece. About 80 percent of the population of Greece are Orthodox. It's a majority Orthodox Christian country, and the church is very, very influential. The church has been extremely against all this from this very beginning. And now, it seems that it has taken a center-right government to come into this and try to vote this through. It is quite remarkable that this is actually happening. If you look at the public opinion, people are very much divided on whether they should or shouldn't. Most people seem to agree that, yes, to the weddings, but not necessarily to the parenthood. Well, the Prime Minister has said this as a matter of equality. It's something that puts Greece on the same footing as other European countries. 15 out of the 27 EU countries have already voted in support. But, the difference in Greece is that you're looking at a southern country, a country with more traditional values. So, it has taken a lot of effort and also a lot of support from the parties of the left to see this through. We expect the bill today to go through, but we expect that the Prime Minister will not enjoy full support from his own party, and it will take the parties from the left to come in and assist him. Meanwhile, activists are starting to gather around parliament, which is where I am, and now we also expect opponents to come later on as this battle continues and leads us to the vote later tonight, Bianca.",

Over 10 percent of its population is over the age of 80. Nearly a third of the country is 65 and above, which is very close to retirement age. Now, what this means for the Japanese economy is that it's less productive. You have less people working and making money in the country, which means the GDP gets smaller and smaller. According to the latest data from the Japanese government, the 2023 nominal GDP in Japan was $4.2 trillion. Germany, on the other hand, was $4.4 trillion in 2023, which means that Germany now has the world's third largest economy.Now, I've been living in the country for over three years now, and it's not hard to tell that Japan is a super-aged society. You don't have to go very far. Just a trip to the doctor's office and most other patients there are elderly people. But, it's not just the demographic crisis that's affecting Japan's GDP. It also has to do with currency movements. So, right now, the Japanese Yen is very weak against the dollar, and we calculate GDP in dollar terms. Last year, on average, the Japanese Yen was worth about 141 Yen to the dollar. 10 years ago, it was worth 80 Yen to the dollar. Now, the final factor affecting Japan's shrinking GDP is private consumption. We know that over half of Japan's economy is private consumption. But, in the last quarter, it fell 0.2 percent because prices in Japan were soaring, and people were less inclined to buy food, goods and other items. These are all reasons why Japan's economy is now the fourth largest in the world, not the third. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
