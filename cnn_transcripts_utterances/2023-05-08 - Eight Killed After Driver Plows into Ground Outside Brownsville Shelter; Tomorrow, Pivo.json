At least eight people are dead and several other people are injured right now. There are a ton of questions this morning still on why this happened. Hopefully, some answers will come in the next hour.But here is what people -- police say that we know so far. An SUV plowed into a group of people outside of the homeless shelter and the horrifying moment was caught on surveillance camera. The video we're going to be showing you, it was -- we're going to pause -- it will pause just before the moment of impact. But at the top of the screen, you are going to be able to see just how fast the SUV appears to be going when it jumps the curb. CNN's Nick Valencia is live at the scene. He is joining us now. Nick, you have new video that you were able to obtain of some of the moments after the crash. What does it show?",

      "sentences": "That is right. We have obtained it just about 24 hour since the incident happened. And the first large group of migrants was trying to get on this bus, the exact same spot where their friends, in some cases, were run over by this individual who was being investigated by the police.And we want to share with you this new video exclusively shared with us by an eyewitness named Cesar Romero. He's a Venezuelan national who saw what happened. He said some of those that were killed by this crash were among his friends. He said, as soon as this happened, the driver got out of the car, in his words, he said the driver appeared to be impaired and shouted obscenities at the migrants in Spanish. The driver, he said, tried to get away. The video you're seeing is those group of men who came, in some cases, from the shelter to try to restrain this individual, and that driver, according to Romero, shouting back at them not to touch him. But this is part of the police investigation. I talked to the Brownsville Police Department about that this morning. They are saying they're launching a separate investigation to look into potential assault charges on the men that appeared to be assaulting this suspected driver. They are also expected to host a press conference in about an hour-and-a-half from now, where we will be hear the preliminary charges against this suspected driver. The Brownsville Police Department not telling me what those charges are, only to say that they're looking at this crash three different ways. One, that this could have been caused by the driver being impaired, the second that it could have been a malfunction, or the third, that this act could have been intentional. And when I talked to the eyewitness earlier, he said there was no doubt in his mind that this act was intentional. We want to be clear, though, although police initially made reference to this being potentially an intentional act, they have not determined that with 100 percent certainty. We expect to hear more at this press conference, Kate, in coming hours, in the coming hour-and-a-half, all of this, of course, happening with just days left in the expiration of Title 42, that Trump-era COVID policy that shutdown the border, effectively shutting it down, stopping that migration flow. That is going to be lifted in a couple of days, making a lot of people and communities like Brownsville very anxious about what that means and the amount of people that are set to come. Kate?",

He had previously worked as a security guard. He received some type firearms training as part of that certification process. A source tells me that he was here in this area living in some type of temporary housing.I want to show you a photo that CNN obtained from someone who was there on the scene. This was the aftermath of that incident where you see the type weaponry that was brought to bear here during this shooting. You see the shooter there, he's dead. He was shot to death by a police officer. Next to him an AR-15-style rifle. But on his chest, you see multiple extra rounds of ammunition, magazines. And so, again, you have to wonder. But for that cop springing into action to take the shooter down, how many more people could have been killed here. Now, investigators are certainly looking into the motive, and I am told in talking to law enforcement officers that they are currently investigating whether the suspect was motivated by right-wing extremism. And that is because on the shooter's chest after he was found deceased, he had an insignia with the letters RWDS, which authorities believe stands for Right-Wing Death Squad. It's the same type of insignia that we've seen other extremists wear at protests over the past few years. Now, I'm also told that authorities are digging into the suspect's social media, trying to, again, get to that motive. He is deceased. They can't interview him, but they are trying to find out what it was that motivated him. And I'm told that he had extensive social media online presence, to include postings about white supremacist and neo- Nazi-type material that authorities, according to sources I'm talking to, they believe he posted that himself. So, again, there is a lot we don't know at this hour, but the investigators certainly believe that they are zeroing in on a possible motive simply by looking at this past communications, John.",

And it turns out, and this is a picture of one of The Proud Boys with that insignia, Right-Wing Death Squad is what it stands for colloquially in most of the time you see that. He was the first to plead guilty, I think, of The Proud Boys to seditious conspiracy. What does it tell you about this prevalence of this idea of a Right-Wing Death Squad?

But I think it is also a really good example of what many scholars and extremism -- folks who really track the extremism community refer to lately as the salad bar approach to extremist ideology.So, in the past, decades ago, you had what you have always had these extremists in this country, but they were very much kind of cabined into their own group. You had the KKK or you had the Aryan Nation or these different groups that largely stayed among their own. But now, with the ubiquity of -- the availability, I should say, of all of this extremist propaganda on the internet, what we are seeing in the extremist community is individual who kind of take from multiple pots, right? They share some symbolisms with other groups and then maybe have different ones that they have come to on their own. It is much harder to distinguish or label extremists group as a member one individual ideology, because they seem to kind of pick those things that they like across multiple groups and multiple ideologies, and that sort of fuels each of them in their own way. Very dangerous and also makes it harder for the law enforcement folks to stay on top of exactly who is doing what.",

There is just a ton of uncertainty on Capitol Hill right now about how exactly Washington will avert the first ever U.S. debt default, something that could have drastic economic ramifications across the globe, because the two sides are, in fact, completely digging in. And negotiations really don't start until tomorrow at the White House. That's the only thing that we know for certain, that President Biden will meet with the top four Congressional leaders at the White House.But what happens after that? What negotiations may take place, will they not take place, and will the battle lines continue to be drawn, and will the two sides continue to dig in? And in a significant letter over the weekend, 43 Senate Republicans signed onto a letter, including the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, indicating that they need conditions as part of any debt ceiling increase, which is the opposite position of Democrats and the White House. They write in this letter, our economy is in freefall due to unsustainable fiscal policies. This trajectory must be addressed with fiscal reforms. As such, we will not be voting for cloture on any bill that raises the debt ceiling without substantive spending and budget reforms. Now, six GOP senators did not sign on to that letter, but they would need nine Republican senators to break ranks from that position in order to raise the national debt ceiling because you need 60 votes to overcome any filibuster attempts. So, if Democrats were to get their way to have without any conditions, so-called clean debt ceiling increase, they would need nine Republican Senators. And this letter indicates that they do not have just that. And also, over the weekend, one independent senator, a former Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, made clear that that push, the White House's push for a so-called clean debt ceiling increase, would not have the votes to pass. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-AZ):  The reality is, the bill that Kevin and his colleagues passed to the House is not going to be the solution. The votes do not exist in the United States Senate to pass that. But what the president is offering is not a realistic solution either. There's not going to be just a simple clean debt limit.
