What health officials are saying today about the possible sources and the precautions being taken to stop this outbreak. Plus, a post claiming voter fraud in Pennsylvania goes viral, claiming 53 voters were registered at one address, but no one lived there. Here's the problem. It's the site of a Catholic church, and the voters are real, and they're nuns, members of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie, a monastic community. The Pennsylvania Secretary of State spoke with the nuns to clear things up. He's going to join us live to talk about this and how he's working to keep the Commonwealth elections free and fair. And leading this hour, all eyes today on the Lone Star State as both Trump and Harris take their campaigns to Texas, not a battleground state on the presidential level, but it highlights issues of concern for each candidate. Trump in Austin, talking about immigration, the southern border. Harris rallying tonight in Houston, highlighting Texas's strict abortion laws after the fall of Row. And with just 11 days to go until Election Day, CNN has some brand new polls giving us a look at the state of the race. Let's go straight to David Chalian of CNN, who's at the magic wall. David, you've been digging through the data. Why is this race so close? You think by now somebody would be breaking out one way or the other?",

      "sentences": "It has been close, and it has been remarkably stable for quite some time, Jake. I mean, it doesn't get closer than this. Our last final national poll before we get to Election Day, 47 percent Donald Trump, 47 percent Kamala Harris. And I asked the very same question you asked as I looked through it. So why?What is keeping this so tied? First, let's talk about some of the issues. You just mentioned the candidates are talking about on the trail today and you'll see why. Harris has an overwhelming advantage, a 21 point advantage when it comes to the issue of abortion and reproductive rights. Donald Trump's big positive advantage categories for him, immigration. He has a 16 point advantage. So just take a look at that. They're talking about their best issues today, that's not by accident. He's got a 13 point advantage of economy, 10 point advantage on foreign policy, Harris has a slight edge on protecting democracy. But this is the real challenge for Harris. It's the environment in which she's running as part of the incumbent party that has the White House. Nearly seven in 10, 68 percent of likely voters say that the country is going -- things are going badly in the country. That's a really rough number if you're representing the incumbent party. And this one's tough too. We asked people, are you better off or worse off or about the same financially than you were a year ago? Forty-nine percent of plurality, nearly half, tell us they're worse off than they were a year ago. Joe Biden's approval rating is also down at 36 percent. So, that's the environment, and that's why Harris, that sort of hangs around Harris' neck. But then you ask, well, then why hasn't Donald Trump run away with this? Well, I'm going to show you some qualities that we tested asking voters, is this a reason to vote or against -- vote for or against a candidate? So, demeanor and temperament, that's a big positive category for Harris. I just want to show you, Jake, that for Trump, he's underwater minus 32 on demeanor and temperament. When it comes to physical mental -- physical capacity and mental ability, again, a 22 point positive response, a reason to vote for Harris, people say. For Donald Trump, this number minus 11. So those are rough categories for Trump. And down here, where he does have a slight edge, your record as president or vice president, that is seen by two points as a reason to vote for Trump by people. But for Harris, this is a big trouble spot, because 20 points she's underwater as a negative her record as vice president. So you see here, between the qualities that people are concerned about Trump, but the environment that people are concerned about Harris, that is what is keeping this race so tight, Jake.",

They say, this is not the guy I want to get dinner with, but I like what he did in office. I felt better personally, particularly on economic grounds when he was in office, we saw that in the numbers record, he's at a two point advantage on that issue. They're trying to connect people's concerns with his demeanor while reminding them about his time in office.

Of course, this is the backdrop.Of course, she's going to start with January 6, the events and Trump's behavior around that day, but ultimately, she's going to make a hard pivot to sort of a turning of the page campaign speech that she's going to talk about how her candidacy, her campaign, really represents something different, that she herself, obviously, is supposed to be a new generation of political talent. And that really what she wants to present to the American people in this final week is, I am going to be turning the page on this era that we all remember as having been the Donald Trump era.

And my opponent, Mike Lawler is part of the problem because he's blocking it. He's joining Mike Johnson the speaker he said he proudly voted for. And saying it would be dead on arrival if it'll ever got to the House. It's a tough bill that would hire more border patrol agents. It would hire more judges to more quickly adjudicate claims of asylum. And it would even give new authorities to the President of the United States to shut down the border in the events being overwhelmed.",

And we've seen so much more enthusiasm to get out and vote in November among Democrats and Independents since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket.But at the end of the day, I'm running my own race. It is a race that has a lot at stake in it. We will decide in the Lower Hudson Valley whether Congress will be led by Republicans including extremist, all of whom will be voting for Donald Trump's dangerous Project 2025 agenda. We're talking a national abortion ban and cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Even the elimination of the Department of Education, which a lot of folks don't realize investigates acts of anti-Semitism on college campuses. By contrast, when you vote for me as part of a Democratic Congress next January and a Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, you get a guy who's going to vote to pass the Women's Health Protection Act, to restore the protections that were taken away under Roe v. Wade when that was overturned the Dobbs decision. You'll get somebody who's committed to making Social Security and Medicare solvent instead of raising the age retirement like my opponent, Mike Lawler, has said he wants to do. And as I mentioned earlier, you get a guy who's actually solutions oriented about securing our southern border. And certainly, someone who's going to stand up to Donald Trump, if he returns the White House the way he's poised to do.",

So Mandy from Atlanta wants to know, Sanjay. What is the best over the counter option without a prescription for treating allergies such as this?DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, luckily, I mean there's -- there's a lot of options nowadays. I mean, you see these things in -- in the store, Claritin, Zyrtec, Allegra. These are all going to be good choices. They are available over the counter. They're antihistamines. Histamine is what's typically causing the symptoms that people have. So, antihistamines are going to be what's going to provide you some relief. In the -- in the old days, you know, there was these antihistamines such as Benadryl which could be quite effective but would really make you quite sleepy. You don't see that as much with this -- these newer generations of antihistamines, so that's good. Couple things to keep in mind, first of all, most people's symptoms are actually going to be worse between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Right as you're sort of waking up or, you know, or -- or late in the night. So taking the medications the night before can actually be quite beneficial. And with these medications in particular, taking it throughout allergy season is really not a problem. You need to sort of stay on top of it as opposed to taking it after symptoms develop. And I will tell you there's also antihistamines plus decongestants. So it's got the D in there. That's to sort of take care of the symptoms of stuffy nose and sore throat, things like that, that sometimes can accompany the allergies. If you're taking the decongestants, that's not something you typically want to take the entire season. Take it just when you have some of the symptoms. And with those sprays in particular, typically, no longer than three days. You also don't want to take the decongestants at night because they can cause you to -- they can really disrupt your sleep, cause you to have nervousness, things like that that can affect you. So, keep that in mind as well.",

And its goal is to better understand early treatment of -- of kids who were transgender or -- trans or gender diverse with two different kinds of treatment, with a treatment to delayed puberty and also with hormone treatment to for gender firming care.And now the \"New York Times\" is reporting on a conversation they had with one of the lead doctors running this trial. Dr. Johanna Olson- Kennedy, we reached out to her and we have not yet heard back today. But she has published in her -- the group has published some of the results from this study. Specifically on the gender affirming hormones, they published that the beginning of 2023. Now they're looking at mental health outcomes and they were also looking at physical outcomes of using these medications. They have not yet published results on the mental health outcomes of when kids are treated with puberty delaying drugs. And that was the subject really of this story. The doctor according to the \"New York Times\" said that they have those findings and that they don't show an improvement in mental health outcomes among these kids. And they have not published those data yet in part she said, because she wants to be really methodical and careful with how she publishes those in this environment right now. And of course, we know that more than 20 States have enacted restrictions or laws restricting access for kids to get gender affirming care. And so that is the kind of environment she's talking about when she cites concerns about this sort of a research being weaponized. Now, we have reached out to her and we haven't seen these findings. We've talked with doctors in this space today. You know, one said that these absolutely should be published since we don't know what the findings are. It could even show that they've prevented the decline in mental health outcomes. We really just don't know what they show. Another doctor suggested this is a normal timeline for publishing these kinds of results and this is much to do about nothing, Jake. But one thing, most doctors agreed on is there is an environment right now that they understand there could be caution here and they're very concerned that that could stifle publication of research.",

They are opposed to anything that would get into the doctor-patient relationship, so these kinds of laws. These are -- are not things that doctor groups who treat kids who are transgender in need this kind of care. They don't agree with those kinds of restrictions. So, there's a lot swirling about this, Jake. But doctors are pretty much in agreement here in the United States about the safety and necessity of access to this kind of care.",
