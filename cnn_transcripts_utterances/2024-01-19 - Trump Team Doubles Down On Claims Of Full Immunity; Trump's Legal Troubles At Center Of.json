Donald Trump and his lawyers argue that, yes, the President needs to be above the law. What will his claims mean for the race for the White House? Plus, thousands gathering in Washington for the March for Life, an annual demonstration by those who oppose abortion rights. But, reproductive rights are an issue Democrats are eager to run on in 2024. We'll discuss that ahead. And I'll be joined live by New Hampshire Congresswoman Annie Kuster. What does she make of the fact that Joe Biden, the Democratic President, will not appear on the Democratic primary ballots in her state? Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington. It's Friday, January 19. There are just four days until the New Hampshire primary, and only 290 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Do U.S. presidents enjoy absolute immunity? The answer is central to Donald Trump's personal and political future. Listen to what one of his attorney said Thursday outside a New York courthouse. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You lookbehind me, you can barely see the Washington Monument, maybe a quarter mile from where I'm standing. And yet, there is a big crowd gathering right now behind me for the \"March for Life\". The organizers here said that they've been doing this event more than 50 years. They are used to massive crowds, 100,000 plus people. They say people turn out no matter what the weather is. We will see what type of impact it makes on the crowd size today. But, the program really doesn't get going for a few minutes. We're going to see several speakers, including the new House Speaker Mike Johnson. And it's really interesting, Kasie, to look at the messaging and the language around this event, given where we are politically when it comes to the issue of abortion. The theme this year for the \"March for Life\" is \"With Every Woman, For Every Child\", and that language was really intentional, putting the mother first, uh, given how successful women's reproductive rights, how successful of an issue it has been for Democratic candidates trying to energize voters to go to the polls. They have been organizers here, intentional about trying to say, we care about women's rights and mother's rights. We have not forgotten about the mother in their pursuit, their anti-abortion pursuit. But, look, it's coming as we have seen these very successful referendums in several states, including red states like Ohio and Kentucky and Kansas. And so -- as well as the Biden administration's initiatives that you mentioned, the President, Vice President traveling the country, trying to put women's reproductive rights really at the top of the ticket, saying this is going to be a critical issue in 2024. It's not just them. We heard Senator Elizabeth Warren just this week say abortion is on the ballot in 2024. So, that's a message that the organizers here and the people in this crowd are hearing. They are organizing around it. And it'll be interesting to see what the New House Speaker Republican Mike Johnson has to say about it, because, Kasie, there has been, as you know, very little traction around any sort of anti-abortion actions from this Republican House. Of course, I spoke with the head of one of the organizations, the anti- abortion organizations, that's helping to put this event on, and they say they understand there is very little they can do right now in this Congress.

And so, I wish the President was here in person, but we've got an amazing grassroots campaign. We're writing -- doing a writing campaign, teaching the voters how to go to the bottom of the ballot, write- in in Joe Biden. Luckily, it's easy to spell. And I think you're going to see a strong turnout for the President on Tuesday, and I think people are going to be talking about the 2028 presidential primary returning to New Hampshire for our first-in-the-nation status.",

Wade. 55 percent of New Hampshire voters consider this a top issue that will influence their vote on Tuesday. And I've had lots of calls from friends and neighbors who are asking about where would their anti-Trump vote be most important. I tell people, I wrote in Joe Biden. That's my plan. And I think he is a great President. And I think he has got a great vision for four more years. But, if you want to make a difference in the Republican primary, and voting for Nikki Haley is the way you think you can do that, I think the main goal for New Hampshire voters is to stop Donald Trump. He is not fit to be President of the United States. I certainly experienced that on January 6, 2021. They know my story well. And he was the key instigator to an insurrection to try to overthrow our government. And so, I think you'll get a strong message out of New Hampshire on Tuesday on both sides of the ballot.",

I was in on the ground floor a year and a half out with Barack Obama, or watching John Kerry or Pete Buttigieg, all of these people that have come here and mounted serious campaigns.

Your question is a different one, which is going forward, will Joe Biden be the strongest candidate? I believe he is. I think if you look at what's happening around the world right now, fighting for democracy in Ukraine, the situation in Israel and Gaza, thank God we have a candidate with experience in the Senate in foreign relations, knows foreign leaders around the world, had made these decisions.
