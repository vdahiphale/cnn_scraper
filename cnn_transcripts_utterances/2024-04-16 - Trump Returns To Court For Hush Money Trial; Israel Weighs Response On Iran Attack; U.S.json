That's how an expert on Iran describes tensions right now between Israel and Tehran. Israel's war cabinet met again today as it considers a response to Iran's attack, and their dilemma, how to decide between retribution as well as restrain. U.S. officials tell CNN, Israel's response will be limited in scope. Meantime, Iran's president is warning of a severe as well as painful response if there's action against Iran's interests. Our Jeremy Diamond is with us this hour from Tel Aviv. And Jeremy, I know I asked you this yesterday, but I think the question still stands really. I mean, do we have any indication of how Israel may respond? Would we even find out, Jeremy, if they go ahead before they go ahead with any sort of retaliatory action?",

One thing that we do know and what we've known over the course of the last couple of days is that Israel, the Israeli government is determined to respond regardless because they believed that this attack by Iran, even though the majority or the overwhelming majority of those missiles and drones were intercepted, they still believed that this attack cannot go unanswered, that a new status quo in which Iran feels comfortable to attack Israeli soil simply cannot stand. But the best indication we're getting of what this response will look like is coming from U.S. officials who say that they believed that Israel will carry out a measured response. That is the question, of course, whether or not they can actually thread the needle on this. Today though, Isa, I was able to go to a military base in Israel where I got to look at one part of one of those missiles, one of those ballistic missiles that was fired towards Israel. I want to show you what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on camera): This is just one piece of an Iranian ballistic missile that the Israeli military says Iran fired towards Israel over the weekend at 36 feet long. This is just the fuel tank for that missile. The Israeli military says more than 120 ballistic missiles were fired at Israel in this attack, only a handful of them actually making it through Israel's air defense systems. And the Israeli military believes this missile was likely intercepted. That you can see the holes in the sides of this fuel tank. This missile was actually found in the dead sea. It was recovered and it was taken to this base in southern Israel. But now, Israel says it must respond. It must re-establish deterrence. They say this attack cannot go unanswered. The only question now is how the Israeli military will respond and when. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I was told today that this missile typically has a warhead that weighs about a half a ton, a half a ton of explosives that could be landing on Israeli soil, if not for the aerial defense systems in Israel, as well as the cooperation with the United States and other allies in the region. And so, because of that destructive power that was target-fired at Israel, Israel feels compelled to respond. The top Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari, he was at this event today where they were showing us this missile. And he told us that again, the timing and the mode, modality of this Israeli responses yet to be determined. But he once again emphasized that it will come, Isa.",

But the Hezbollah -- while announcing the deaths of its people does not describe where, how or when they were killed. But what we've seen is that there were two drone strikes on two separate cars, about 30 minutes apart. And this was part of really what was a fairly intense day along the border between Israel and Lebanon. We're counting at least ten Israeli strikes on targets in Lebanon, and at least, nine Hezbollah strikes on targets in Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have fired several drones inside Israel aimed at military facilities beyond to the border. But it's hard to say if this is -- what's typical is you'll have sort of fluctuations in the amount of action on the border. Sometimes you'll have days where very little happens. Today was probably higher, well-over the average I'd say, of strikes and counter strikes between the two sides, Isa.",

These are being brought from the House side of the Capitol building to the Senate side. He was impeached in the Republican controlled House. Now, as per the constitution, those articles walked over to the Senate side where a trial will take place. Of course, the Senate side, unlike the House side, is controlled by Democrats. Democrats have not said explicitly how they will handle these articles. There's the possibility, as we were discussing earlier that they might be quickly dismissed. There's also the possibility that a trial begins, but it's a short trial, and Mayorkas is acquitted quite quickly. But again, what you're seeing here playing out on the Capitol is a step in the impeachment process. Our Melanie Zanona covers Capitol Hill for us. Do we know, Melanie Zanona, what happens next? What is Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, Democrat, how is he going to respond to these articles from the House side?",

Speaker Johnson had been sitting on these articles ever since the House passed them. Although we should note that it was a difficult route to get here because they initially tried and failed to pass these impeachment articles on the House floor. They eventually were able to do so, but only on a narrow majority. Now, this heads to the Senate where we are expecting Democrats to quickly dismiss this trial. But there is some question about whether there will be an agreement for Republicans to offer some motions and be able to make some speeches of their own. Now, as far as the timeline, the jurors are expected to be sworn in tomorrow. At that point, we could see this process start to unfold. But the bottom line here is that Democrats and even some Republicans have said they do not have the appetite to actually convict Mayorkas. So, no one is expecting this to actually result in him being removed from his position. But Republicans want to make an issue out of it. The border, of course, has become a big issue out of the 2024 campaign. They are eager to put some Democrats on the spot over this issue. And that is why you see this big push right now to at least have some votes, have some amendments. Republicans want to make a point here.

It does not amount to a high crime and misdemeanor, according not only to Democrats, but also to constitutional experts who we spoke with. Again, Republicans here just really trying to use Mayorkas as a punching bag for all of the issues that they have with the Biden administration. But there are some Republicans who say Mayorkas isn't the right target. That if you want to go after someone that it's Biden who's the boss in charge. And so, there is sort of this belief inside the GOP that Mayorkas was the easier target politically to impeach other than President Joe Biden. Republicans have been trying to impeach the president. Have not come anywhere close to having the votes to do that. So that is why you saw them sort of channel the basis, frustration and rage towards the Biden administration into Mayorkas, which they thought was perhaps an easier lift.

He had been wrestling with this question of how to addressforeign aid for Israel and Ukraine for weeks now, but that question took on a new sense of urgency and significance following Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend. So, Johnson finally outlined his plans to address foreign aid. And he announced yesterday to his conference and then publicly that he plans to hold four separate votes on bills for aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and other national security priorities, and some of the way that they're going to address aid to Ukraine are going to be structuring that aid as a loan, that is something that Donald Trump has floated in the past. So, clearly Johnson trying to get buy in from these skeptical wings of these parties who have not wanted to support Ukraine aid. But the issue here is that Johnson is interested in sending all of those bills together, merging them together into one package before they send it to the Senate. That would make it easier and quicker for the Senate to just take that up quickly and pass that. But Johnson has already started to get some conservative backlash for the idea. He's obviously trying to appease the hard wing, the hard right of the party who wanted to see separate votes on all of his issues, but they don't like this sort of procedural gimmicks in their mind. Of ultimately merging them together to send them over to the Senate. So, the question now is whether Democrats will step in and help Johnson here because he's going to need Democratic support to help get a procedural vote over the finish line in order to be able to advance these priorities. And meanwhile, hanging over it all is this threat to Mike Johnson's speakership. Marjorie Taylor Greene, as well as another Republican, Thomas Massie, have both come out and said they would support a motion to vacate the speakership. That means removing him from his job. Now, they have not forced a vote on that resolution yet. But they have warned that if Speaker Mike Johnson moves ahead with Ukraine funding that they might be willing to trigger a vote. So, Johnson again might need to rely on Democratic support to bail him out, including from the speakership. So, it's a very tricky balancing act for the speaker. He's trying to find a way to get foreign aid to our allies abroad while also keeping his gavel.",
