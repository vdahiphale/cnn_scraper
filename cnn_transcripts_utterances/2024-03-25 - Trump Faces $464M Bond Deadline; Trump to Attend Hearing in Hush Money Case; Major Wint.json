This case, in terms of the bond that he has to come up with today, worth nearly half a billion dollars, to stop New York state going after his assets, to make themselves good on the ill- gotten gains that were exposed in this fraud trial, is especially interesting, I think.Because if you go to one of Trump's rallies, if you hear him speak, it's never long before he talks about his beautiful buildings, how rich he is. This is something that's absolutely core, not just for his self-identity, but also to his appeal to his supporters. Even now, if you talk to Trump supporters, one of the first things they bring up is this guy's a great businessman. There's a lot of evidence that might question that assumption, but it's very the germane to what a lot of people feel about Trump and what Trump feels about himself.",

He's a businessman first, and then became a politician. And part of it is, one, he's been able to avoid a lot of these issues. For several years. He's been caught up and tangled with legal issues for his entire life, but he's always been able to avoid them until now. And again, a lot of this is personal, but it's also the public perception of it. Donald Trump does not want to be seen -- I mean, he likes to tout that he's a wealthy businessman. He likes to -- people to think that he has all this money, as we've seen him be, you know, sharing on Truth Social, on social media lately. And this is striking exactly to who he is. And that's really the concern behind the scenes. And even though he's showing up in that hearing in New York in the hush-money case, which he's also concerned about, because it's a criminal.

Perhaps the biggest possible -- political backlash apart from maybe going after Trump's resort down in Florida, Mar-a-Lago. So I think what they're trying to do is create this impression that, as Chip Roy was saying, look, Americans aren't interested in this. They're going after Trump.
