Very clearly, the President- elect continuing to show his support, bringing him to the Army-Navy game over the weekend. There is also this sense in Washington of basically how many times Republicans can say no to the President- elect, so that would -- in terms of his choices and his nominees, but when there are so many who are controversial, watching how that will play out, it's the RFK versus Tulsi Gabbard, who was not getting great reviews from her initial meetings, versus the Pete Hegseth's, is there a sense of where that stands, even though we are still a number of weeks out from confirmation hearings?",

We have live pictures for you of the Bundestag in Berlin. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier can now move, of course, to dissolve the legislature and then formally declare the already agreed upon Election Day of February 23rd. All of this coming after Germany's governing coalition collapsed last month. CNN's Sebastian Shukla is tracking the story, joining us now live with the developments from Berlin tonight.

What I have for you here is the outcome of the votes, which is, Scholz lost this vote of confidence in himself, the semantics around it are important, by 394 votes against him to 207 in favor of him. So, that's a sizable number who have said that, look, this country needs to adopt a new chancellor and needs to embark on trying to form a new coalition government.As you said, the process around this now is that Scholz will head to the President's residence, where he will then go and ask to formally dissolve parliament. But, the way that this whole process, including the build up to getting to this day, the vote of confidence, has been very regimented and controlled by the parties who have already informally agreed when that election is going to be, and it will be on the 23rd of February. Technically, the President has 21 days to decide on the day. But, it is almost a foregone conclusion, and Erica, the foregone conclusion is also being echoed by what was said in that chamber earlier today. I want you to take a listen to what Olaf Chancellor -- Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, had to say when he was on his feet in there earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLAF SCHOLZ, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (Interpreted): Democracy requires parties to compete against each other with different proposals, as we will do in the upcoming campaign. But, democracy also requires all those who believe in it to be prepared to work together for the good of the country after an election, to build bridges, to forge compromises. This is not possible without moral maturity, without decency and seriousness. It is only possible with a sense of responsibility for our entire country, for all our citizens. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You could hear in there too that he was setting up the campaigning that is about to take place that will start in earnest now. He was alluding in there to the polls, which show that the CDU, theconservative party here in Germany, are way ahead, and that his party, the SPD, the Social Democrats, are lagging in third, sometimes potentially even falling far back as fourth, and that has left open the door to what will be a seismic change in German politics, which would be that the AfD, the far-right populist party here, could come in second place, and though they will view themselves as potential kingmakers, that will create a very difficult dynamic when it comes to forming coalition, a coalition government here, because that is usually how Germany's governments are formed. And so, we will wait to see now, but it is clear pretty much, Erica, that Germany will have a more conservative chancellor and government come February.",

For now, all of the big parties, the CDU and the SPD, have said that they will, under no circumstance, collaborate with the AfD.

And Trump has already signaled that he is going to demand, in particular, of the Germans, that they do more on that front. People are now discussing three percent of GDP instead of two percent for defense, and the Germans have had difficulty even getting to the two percent mark.So, this is going to make life, I think, very difficult for this next government, because they're going to have to weigh the kind of social spending that many Germans have become to lie on (h) and expect with the security needs that the country has, and at the same time, they have a very rigid debt break in Germany, which is the reason that this last government collapsed, in fact, because the three parties in that coalition couldn't agree on spending.

Thank you.I want to take you back now to Florida where President-elect Donald Trump is speaking on American investments from Mar-a-Lago. Let's listen in. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL- ELECT: -- investment and technology companies anywhere in the world, one of the most successful investors in the world. And we've just concluded a very productive meeting, and today I am thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100 billion in America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum. And he is doing this because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election and many other people are also coming in with tremendous amounts of money. You probably noticed that the poll was just taken. Its business is literally, in 39 years, there has been nothing like it. It's been the biggest increase. Small business owners gave it a 41 percent jump. It's the biggest jump that we've had in 39 years. Nobody has ever seen anything like it, and it's just a very -- they're very optimistic. This historic investment is a monumental demonstration of confidence in America's future, and it will help ensure that artificial intelligence, emerging technologies and other industries of tomorrow are built, created and grown right here in the USA. One of the beautiful things about Masa is he is very much involved with emerging technology. He probably knows it may be better than almost anybody. So, it's a great honor. And some of you remember, after the 2016 election, also SoftBank committed to invest $50 billion in our country, and they did, and I'm pleased to say that they kept that promise in every way, shape and form. And now they're looking to do $100 million. And I've looked at their books. They do have the possibility of doing more. I'm going to ask them to do a little bit more. But, first, I'm going to ask him to speak, and just to say a few words. Masa, please. Thank you.",

This is double of last time, as President Trump said, because I say, oh, President Trump is a double down President. I'm going to have to double down $100 billion and 100,000 jobs. This is my confidence level, because that has doubled down.So, I am truly excited to make this happen. And of course, business is important. Technology is important. But, one more thing I'm really hoping is that this President Trump would make the world -- bring the world into peace again. That's my additional hope, and I think he will actually make it happen.

We're going to bring you some of that ahead.But, I also want to dig into a little bit of what we heard from the President-elect and from the CEO of SoftBank, Masa Son, about this investment coming into the U.S. Margaret Talev back with us now, of course, senior contributor for Axios, and also the Director of the Democracy, Journalism, and Citizenship Institute at Syracuse University. Margaret, as we look at this, I was struck by some of these comments, right? So, the President-elect talking about this $100 billion investment, which is also set to create some 100,000 jobs in the United States, saying it was a very productive meeting, he is optimistic, and that so many are optimistic about the U.S. since the election, and then the comments that we heard from the CEO of SoftBank really echoing that, talking about how excited he is to work with the President, and the President-elect even haggling a little bit to get him to double the investment in real time.

He talked about the phrase doubling down and about his confidence level, and of course, he is talking about in 2016, just before Donald Trump came into office for the first time, the same CEO made a commitment for an investment of about half that size and ended up putting in a little bit more. So, this time he said he is going to double down. And Trump said, why don't you double down on that? And he said, well, I'll try. I'll see what I can do.It was interesting, there was another part where he told the President-elect that he needed his support, and Trump said to him, you'll have my support. So, what does all of this mean? Where is all of this going? You'll recall, of course, that it was last week that the President-elect said he made a promise that anyone who invests a billion dollars or more in the U.S. will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, he said, including environmental approvals. What does that mean? What could the scope of that be? To be determined. But, he is in let's make a deal mode. And the SoftBank CEO also was in let's make a deal mode, and wants the good press. There are some complicating factors here, though, that I think are worth watching. We expect this investment to be in AI, right, in AI technology, AI infrastructure. The long term or the near-term impacts of AI, of course, are estimated to be to cost tens of millions of jobs because of the efficiencies or redundancies, the automation that they would create. Many of those jobs could be unskilled jobs. Some of those jobs could be skilled jobs. So, AI is going to, over time, create a lot of efficiencies in the workplace. But, what's going to happen to those people whose jobs are displaced? So, the creation of 100,000 jobs, if that were to come to fruition after an investment of $100 billion, could end up being offset by the elimination of a lot of jobs. So, that's one thing I think we need to ask. And another is, where is SoftBank going to actually get the cash influx? They have this venture capital fund. It's made investments in companies like Nvidia, Alibaba, Uber, DoorDash over the years. It's also had some major high-profile losses. So, do they have the cash? Where will they have the cash to front that $100 billion, and where will these investments actually be made in the U.S.? A lot we don't know, but for Trump, who is trying to build up steam and show that people want to invest in the U.S., this is certainly, at least at this moment, a good news announcement.",

So, we do have to caveat that this is allegedly by Bashar al-Assad. We're not really sure if it's him who is behind it, but it is on what used to be the official Telegram channel of the Syrian President.First of all, one of the things that's really interesting about it is that the dateline that's given is Moscow, indicating that possibly Bashar al-Assad is still here in Moscow. He has, of course, been given asylum by the Russians. But then, of course, the details are very interesting, because he does go into detail as to what exactly happened on December 8th, when the Assad regime collapsed. He says that until the early morning hours of December 8th that he was still in Damascus and doing his duties, as he put it, until it became clear that the situation became untenable. I want to read you a little quote, because I do think it's fascinating to hear what he writes. He says, quote, \"As terrorist forces infiltrated Damascus, I moved to Latakia\", which is, of course, the coastal area of Syria, and really the heartland of the support for Bashar al-Assad, or was for a very long time, \"in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations\", he says. And then he says, \"Upon arrival at the Hmeimim airbase, that is the Russian airbase near Latakia, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from all the battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen, in other words, that that situation had become untenable.\" He then says that the Russian base itself came under attack, and that it was then the Russians who made the decision to conduct an emergency evacuation of Bashar al-Assad and some of his closest confidents and members of his family to Moscow that it was not his decision. The Russians, of course, had said that it was actually Bashar al-Assad himself who had decided to cede power and indicate there was a transfer of power, and that the decision was not made by the Russians. He is now apparently saying something different here. There is another interesting quote that he put out as well. He said, \"At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual party.\" So, we're getting some interesting takes from Bashar al-Assad. He says he still feels connected to his Syrian homeland. Of course, absolutely unclear where he is here in Russia, but definitely an interesting take about how things apparently went down, from his perspective. At the same time, he does say at the end of the statement, he says \"When the state falls into the hands of terrorism, and the ability to make meaningful contribution is lost, any position becomes void of purpose, rendering its occupation meaningless.\" This seemingly is Bashar al- Assad saying that he understands that the Syrian Arab Republic is no more and the Assad dynasty is no more either.

He said again, as he has before, that he built more wall than he said he was going to. Well, on that 2016 campaign, he repeatedly said he built about a thousand miles. The actual total, according to official federal statistics, was 458 miles. And again, he claimed here it was 571. No, it was 458, and critically, that includes more than 300 miles of replacement barrier. So, only about 60 of those miles were new primary barriers in places no barriers had existed before.(END VIDEOTAPE)",

She could have run for the Senate in North Carolina. Ted Budd would be the first to say, and he wouldn't have run. Nobody would have run. And she just said, no, I want to really focus on my children. When the election and my family, she has a great family, when the election started getting closer, I asked her, would she go to Washington and work on the chairman of the committee, along with Michael Whatley, and they did such an unbelievable job, especially on cheating. They stopped it, or at least they stymied it, too big to rig, and we won in a landslide. We won tremendously. She did an amazing job. Now, Ron is going to have to make because Marco is -- has been really a star already, and we haven't started. But, we see signs of -- from some people, or very early, we see signs of start. I mean, Marco has done incredibly. He is sort of born for it. It was such an easy decision. The Marco decision was such an easy but he leaves a vacancy in Florida, and Ron is going to have to make that decision, and he'll make the right decision. I also know that Lara has got so many other things. I mean, she has got so many other things. People want her to be on television. They want to give her contracts.
