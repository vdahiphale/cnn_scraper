Sources telling CNN, Mr. Trump wanted to appear defiant in that shot. That as the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is asking for the trial of the former president and all 18 of his co- defendants to begin on October 23rd. That's an extremely ambitious schedule. Trump opposes that trial date.Let's get straight to our CNN justice -- senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. Evan, what is the latest on this case? An argument about the dates, what else now that Trump has surrendered?",

Well, John, we expect that now that the foreign president has brought on a new attorney, Steve Sadow, that we're going to start seeing a lot of legal activity pick up from the former president. For instance, one of the things we expect that he's going to do is try to remove this case from the state court, bring it to federal court.There's a couple of advantages there, obviously, a bigger, wider jury pool. But also, eventually, he's going to argue that this case should be dismissed, that he should be immune to all of this. And so all of those, of course, are going to be arguments that are going to be heard in the coming months. You also saw already some activity from his legal team. They are trying to sever at least part of the case because at least one of the former president's co-defendants asked for a speedy trial. And so that trial date has now been set for October of this year. And of course, that's not what the former president wants. He wants a trial date much, much further into the future. So again, you're going to see a lot of legal activity, especially Monday when Mark Meadows has been arguing to move the case. And we're going to get a little preview of coming attractions, so to speak, of that legal argument of how to move this case or whether to move this case from state court to federal court, John.",

He called it a sad day for the country, which I think all of us can agree on that.We already saw him post on Twitter and on his own social media platform later today, after he returned to New Jersey. You can see there he's fundraising off of it, which is something that we anticipated his campaign to start doing immediately after the mug shot. John, you remember, even after his first arrest in New York, he -- some members of his campaign had put out a fake version of this, now he has a real thing.

And will it go with all 19 defendants the way Fani Willis has said she would like to try the case?

COMMITTEE LAWYER: When you say any possibility, yes. I mean, I think if I think the Willis has had two and a half years to get ready for this moment. And I guarantee you that she's thought about all the different ways this could proceed. She's thought about her opening statements. She's thought about her closing statements. All that I think is going to be at least structured generally and ready to go. And I think the question is going to be is Ken Chesebro, for example, is he really going to want to go in two months. If you're going to two months, that means less time to review discovery. That means less time to make motions. And what our judge is not going to allow is saying, hey, I want to go quickly. And when the judge says, let's go, you say hold on, let's slow down. I need time for this event. The judge is not going to allow that. And frankly, I think it's to his own detriment sometimes moving that quickly in a complicated case. Your lawyers need time to get know the evidence to get to know the case more generally, to talk to the prosecutor to really craft a strategy that's going to hopefully, if you're the defendant, keep you out of prison.

So correct me if you think I'm wrong, I view that as clearly if I'm trying to raise money, let's go to where there are more eyeballs to do it.His former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has become a very harsh Trump critic, let's be honest about that, was on CNN earlier tonight. He talked about the mug shot and being asked in the context as our Kaitlin Collins and our other reporters say that they knew this was coming.

But there are such differences. And I keep coming back to it now that we're talking about Donald Trump. Stacey Abrams went through the courts. Yes, she did talk to witnesses, she did build testimony. But she was never accused of lying to the court of encouraging or trying to manipulate people to adhere to a certain narrative. And once she exhausted the courts, it took about two weeks. I was there. But once the court said there's nothing else you can do, you lost. She made a speech and said, I'm throwing in the towel. Now you can talk about whether she used -- she didn't use the word concede. But she met the definition of conceding the race and she has not continued to try to overturn the outcome of the race.",

Again, these are things that have been reported, so I'm not being salacious. The difference for his case is that he's on what's called a halt for another agency. I'm not sure that warrant is foreign, that someone would have to come get him from out of state.
