But as the war has gone on, it's become clear that what Zelenskyy really wants, and as you were discussing earlier, is to be in NATO, so that all of the NATO countries, all 32, once Sweden is in, are committed to coming to the defense of Ukraine with their own troops, if need be, in the commitments that all NATO members make to each other. And the fact of the matter is no one was really going to be prepared to let Ukraine in, in the middle of a war, because as President Biden has frequently said, that would then put us in direct combat with the Russians. And in President Biden's view, that's the way on to World War III. So, that's what he's been trying to avoid.

Because in covering this White House's administration over the course of the entirety of this war, there is the kind of public posture and how they interact with or discuss the relationship with Zelenskyy and his team. And I think there's the behind the scenes. And you see the tension spill out into public at times, but you also see when Zelenskyy seemed to back off a little bit. In that press conference with Stoltenberg, you saw that kind of rye grin on his face when he made clear we would really like a NATO invitation, which was the similar face he made when he was talking about getting more Patriot missile systems when he was at the White House visiting President Biden.And that back and forth, that dynamic and what we don't see publicly, what more do you know about that?",

Now, if she really issues a clunker and just does something that is just outside the bounds of law, the Justice Department could move to have her removed from the case.

      "sentences": "Yes. I think the big question behind the digital operation, in light of these controversies, they had the A.I. earlier this month, and then they had the pride video that they pushed out was, are they on the same page as DeSantis himself, because they are generating these, by and large, negative headlines. And the answer is, yes, they are.And DeSantis, in particular, is an operator who is very in tune with his campaign. He's not going to let a whole faction of his team run rogue and have these messages that are not in line with what he believes. And so the idea behind the political, the online operation is simply that they're sending out the same message as Ron DeSantis but in a more aggressive way. And they're targeting the kind of harder right, more online supporters and allowing DeSantis to then go on the ground and talk to these less online, more everyday Iowa, New Hampshire voters who might be turned off by that aggressive messaging.",
