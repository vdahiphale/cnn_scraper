On Saturday, Trump was criticizing Ron DeSantis. And this is also the first time I want to note that he's actually referred to the Florida governor by his real name instead of the nickname that he's given the Florida governor, which is Ron DeSanctimonious.But look, I think one thing that we should be watching for is whether or not this endorsement from DeSantis changes anything in the minds of Donald Trump. Already, it appears it has, given the language we heard him use on Sunday. But, you know, over the past year now, Donald Trump has really viciously gone after Ron DeSantis, attacked him very heavily in the lead up to the Iowa caucuses. And part of that was because the campaign was worried about DeSantis as a rival. But the other part was because it was personal. Donald Trump very much believes that DeSantis was being disloyal by running for president after Trump had endorsed him for Florida governor in 2017. And that's where a lot of those attacks stem from, according to my conversations with Donald Trump's advisers and his allies. But I think the question now is, will his endorsement change the game? Will you see Ron DeSantis become a potential surrogate for the Trump campaign? I know, as well from our conversations with Trump's team, that as of now, there are no plans for DeSantis to show up on the trail with them. But again, that could change in the coming weeks.

It is the economy and it is immigration. And Trump is doing well on both of those issues for Republican and moderate independent voters. And he seems to convey an image of being better at running the economy by 20 points compared to Biden, even though there's little evidence that the president can really control the economy. All of the things that are going on in the world right now, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza, things escalating in the Gulf, in the Middle East, with Yemen and Iran, none of this is playing well for Biden. He's sort of in a rock and a hard place that he can't appease more progressive people, he can't appease more conservative people. And it's not something that Trump would be able to handle any better. In fact, it could be complete chaos. But these foreign policy issues are affecting Biden at the margins, particularly with, for example, younger voters. 70 percent of younger voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the war in Gaza. So while we have these big meaty issues that are really important, you also have the foreign policy issues that could affect Biden negatively thus far.",

They are clearly not in a safe position.In terms of the talks, look, on the face of it, Netanyahu appears to be toughening, if anything, his stance, saying that he rejects outright the Hamas demands, which he says would be an end of the war, full withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the release of more Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Not a surprise, he's never been on board with any of those things. But privately, of course, we have this report from the Wall Street Journal citing diplomats who are familiar with the talks, people briefed on the talks, saying that at least Israel is engaging now with a framework. We're not close to a deal. Obviously, we've had a lot of things leaked out of these talks before, and it's not in any way ever guaranteed that we're close to a deal. But this is potentially, they say, a new approach that would involve a sort of phased release of hostages, but something more sustained in terms of a ceasefire. So that is what they're working on. The broker country is clearly heavily involved in trying to restart this, and apparently Israel is engaged with that. So that's slightly at odds with the sort of tough stance that we're seeing from Netanyahu on the surface, but it does potentially present a chink of light here.",
