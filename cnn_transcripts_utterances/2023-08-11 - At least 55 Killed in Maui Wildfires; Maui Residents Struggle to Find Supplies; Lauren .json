So, this will affect hundreds of thousands of people on this island.And right now the Camp Fire of 2018 in California which took 85 lives there in Paradise, California, is the deadliest in U.S. history. This probably will exceed that. They are worried that the number could reach into the hundreds because so many people were caught between this wall of flame and the Pacific Ocean. Those who did try to evacuate were stuck on the road in bumper-to-bumper traffic there. Many others we know went into the waves to try to find relief, spent hours there, others didn't survive either from smoke inhalation or taking by those choppy waves. You've got to remember, the wind at this time was 60, 70 miles an hour.

Right now, because we don't have other mechanisms to stop the phenomenon of hostage-taking, it's really a binary choice. Leave people behind to languish in prison for years and years, or potentially die or be murdered, or negotiate with their captors. It's that simple.And, you know, I'm not in a position to know if a better deal was available or not available, but administrations, going back to Thomas Jefferson, have negotiated for the release of Americans, including the Trump administration. So, it's really disingenuous for former Vice President Pence to come out in that way. I think, you know, there's still a lot of details that we don't know about that we'll get and made clear hopefully when these men and one woman apparently are ultimately freed. But in the meantime, I think Americans should rejoice in the fact that our citizenship still matters to our government because many countries do not negotiate for their citizens being held hostage.",
