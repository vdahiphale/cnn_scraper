The storm is now a powerful Category 4 and is expected to bring widespread destruction across Florida. Our other top story this hour, a top Hezbollah official says the group is open to a ceasefire deal. This as the Israeli military further expands operations in southern Lebanon. Get out now or you're going to die. That grave warning from the mayor of Tampa as Hurricane Milton bears down on central Florida. Forecasters say Milton will slam into the state's west coast as a major hurricane late Wednesday and they're warning residents to expect catastrophic damage. And this is happening as Florida is still trying to recover from the impacts of Hurricane Helene. Milton dropped to Category 4 intensity. But the key word there is dropped because it could build back up to a Category 5 later today after earlier reaching speeds of 180 miles per hour. That's 290 kilometers per hour. Officials are sounding alarm bells as the storm approaches. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Omar, good morning. So the folks that live here in Fort Myers, Florida in Lee County have been taking this stormserious because just two years ago, Hurricane Ian really destroyed a good part of southwest Florida, including Lee County. And so folks have that in mind as they get ready for whatever impact southwest Florida is going to get from this hurricane. They're really dealing with their experience with hurricanes in the sense that, again, two years ago when Hurricane Ian moved in, the storm surge out here, we're told, was about four feet. And so the folks out here know what these powerful storms can do. They've been putting up plywoods and sandbags and they've been trying to just get ready for Hurricane Milton. The current forecast calls for anywhere between 6 to 10 feet of a storm surge if Milton ends up tracking just to the north of here. So to give you a sense of where things were two years ago with Hurricane Ian, the waterline, we're told, was probably around here. If that storm surge holds, it's obviously going to be a little bit above this waterline here. The Caloosahatchee River, which is about two blocks over from where we are, is a prime area of concern. That river connects out to Lake Okeechobee in the central part of Florida. And when all of that water rushes through, when all of that rainfall in here in southwest Florida, between six to eight inches of it, when all of that kind of comes together along with high tide, that river is going to rise. It is going to crest. And based on where we are, all of that water is going to rush in. And so, Omar, the concern for the folks in southwest Florida right now, if this path holds, is the storm surge. It's going to be the tropical storm force winds that will move through the area. But the flooding is going to be the main concern out here. Yesterday, on our drive in from Miami, we ran into folks that are trying to evacuate going to Miami. And so Interstate 75, which connects both coasts, the western coast of Florida and the eastern coast of Florida, folks were driving over Alligator Alley. And then, of course, when you get further north, closer to the Tampa Bay area, the folks there are stuck in traffic because they're trying to evacuate either to go north in Florida or they're trying to get more into the central part of Florida, kind of the Orlando area. And so if it's not traffic and if it's not evacuation orders, the one other thing that's top of mind with folks right now is gasoline. It's becoming an issue across the state of Florida, especially along the west coast. The governor this morning said that the state of Florida is aware that gas stations are starting to run low on a supply. And so what they've decided to do is they're tapping into the Florida's gas reserves to get some of these shipments out so that folks, some of these gas stations are able to have a supply. But you can see here, Stu, if you can show it to my right, folks out here are just trying to take in today as probably the last day that they can get their storm preps in order, their plywood up on their businesses. And, of course, just hope that some of this is enough to keep some of this expected storm surge from hitting.",

This is the second time we hear from him since the killing of the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. And that first appearance really raised questions about morale within the group. But this time, it appears that he is putting on a much more defiant position there, saying that they are going to continue fighting. But at the same time, for the first time publicly, we are hearing him saying that they endorse these attempts and efforts to reach a ceasefire. And some would point out that he's not linking it to a ceasefire. And Gaza has been Hezbollah's position for the past year. But, you know, shortly after that address aired, Omar, you saw that large barrage of rockets targeting Israel, targeting Haifa, targeting the Upper Galilee. Much of the barrage was intercepted, but there were a couple of impacts, as we understand, from Israeli authorities. And some are looking at this and saying that perhaps Hezbollah here is using the carrot and stick approach, open to a ceasefire, yet still putting on this fight, still carrying out these attacks. And, you know, both sides at this point are very much intensifying their attacks. And it really leaves people wondering if there is room right now for a ceasefire. And a lot of people that you speak to here, officials that you speak to in this region, feel that the United States could be doing more and should be doing more. I've heard from senior officials here saying that it has the leverage and it should be using it.

And it does appear that they are facing some stiff resistance as well. There have been a number of casualties over the past week amongst Israeli troops. And, you know, this leaves people, especially in the south, when you talk about hundreds of thousands of people who have had to evacuate, leave their villages and towns, it leaves them with this real fear that this is not going to be a limited or targeted operation as it's being described by the Israelis.

But there are still thousands of people, we understand, who are trapped in some of these southern villages, some close to the border, who are running out of food and water, and they can't get out because no one can evacuate them. And you look at how many villages so far the Israeli military has ordered to evacuate, more than a hundred villages in a matter of days. And every single day, almost, in the past week, we have heard from the Israeli military putting out these warnings, telling people from these villages that they should not return until further notice. And it's really raising questions amongst the people of southern Lebanon and this country as a whole about what the Israeli plans are for southern Lebanon. Because if you recall, back in 1982, the Lebanese heard the line about a limited incursion by Israeli forces that turned into a full-scale invasion and many years of Israeli military occupation in southern Lebanon.

We're going to bring you bring that to you live as it happens. But, of course, the President was considering postponing this trip, given the immediacy of the impending hurricanes. And less than a month to Election Day in the United States, both the presidential candidates are in full campaign mode. A new poll from \"The New York Times\" and \"Siena College\" finds Kamala Harris is making some progress among likely voters. Harris listed here with 49% to Trump's 46% of those polled nationally. In that same poll last month, the two were tied, but both have really shown no clear leader here. Meanwhile, Harris appeared on the in-depth news program \"60 Minutes,\" where she faced tough questions on a number of issues, including immigration. This, as Trump once again stokes fear about undocumented migrants using heightened rhetoric. A lot to talk about. That's why we've got CNN reporters on the campaign trail. Alayna Treene and Priscilla Alvarez are standing by in Washington. So let's start with you, Alayna, because Donald Trump is once again leaning into that, that old playbook to demonize migrants.

That13000 number that he referenced is not just from the Biden administration or what he's arguing is Harris allowing these people to come into the country. This is a figure that has been tracked and is accounted for -- for several decades now, spanning several administrations. We also know that that figure does include some people who are currently in prison or have been released and -- have been released after serving their time. So I'd keep that in mind. But I think to take a step back and just give you a sense of how this fits into Donald Trump's broader language on this issue, we know that he has repeatedly received a lot of backlash and criticism for some of the comments he has made regarding immigrants recently. Of course, he has been touting, as has his running mate, J.D. Vance, this idea that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets. We know he said that on the debate stage back in September, but also has repeated that claim since something that is just completely not true. And we know from Republican officials on the ground that they say that there is no evidence for that. But he's also used this type of language regarding bad genes or immigrants, blood in the past. Last year, he argued that immigrants or illegal immigrants, I should say, are poisoning the blood of the country. Something we know has been tied back to language that Nazis used when describing Jewish people. So, again, very controversial. But I don't think Donald Trump is going to change this language as we look ahead to November, because they recognize that immigration is an issue that he's pulling better on.

You know, these candidates are doing what they believe will help them win, both Harris and Trump. And that mostly avoids, that mostly means avoiding tough questioning and going on more non-traditional unorthodox platforms. Trump is doing the same thing by talking to his friends on \"Fox News\" and going on very bro-ey influencer podcasts. Harris, you know, deserves credit for doing the \"60 Minutes\" interview because that was a tough interview with some probing questions about immigration. She had a hard time answering questions about the immigration surge of the southern border. And so she deserves credit for that interview. But today what we're going to see, Omar, is Harris going on friendlier platforms, \"The View,\" Howard Stern, Stephen Colbert, and really pushing a get out the vote strategy. These interviews are very specifically timed to voter registration deadlines and early vote efforts. She is trying to reach voters at a key moment in early October to say, get your vote plan ready.

When I see Harris going on \"The View,\" when I see Trump going on the Laura Ingraham show on \"Fox,\" I see them trying to reach their base audiences and try to make sure those voters actually turn out. But, you know, for all the critiques we're hearing from the Beltway media, from, you know, kind of journalists, the media elites about Harris and Trump avoiding tough questioning, I think we should recognize sometimes these non-journalistic interviewers actually make a lot of news. Remember, Harris went on Oprah Winfrey for a glorified fundraiser and talked about how she would shoot someone if they invaded her home. That was a news making soundbite. Same thing with Alex Cooper. There was a lot of news in that \"Call Her Daddy\" interview. If people haven't listened to the podcast, it's really worth checking out.

Clearly, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump choose these platforms, especially some of those shows, whether it's \"Call Her Daddy\" or Trump is on with Theo Von or something, are we in a world where the quote-unquote \"mainstream media\" is becoming less important for candidates to reach their voters, or at least they feel like they don't need to go through some of the quote-unquote \"mainstream media?\"",

Late night push notifications that the attorneys general say impacts young users' sleep. They also claim that the platform hasn't done enough to address TikTok challenges, which are these viral trends where users try to replicate videos created by other users that can encourage them to engage in dangerous behaviors. Omar, you'll probably remember earlier this year, a New York teenager was killed after riding on the outside of a subway, which is known as subway surfing. And the complaint claims that his mother found TikTok videos encouraging subway surfing on his feed after he was killed. And so the attorneys general say that despite the fact that TikTok has implemented features, made changes, done things like default time limits, screen time limits for teens and has incorporated parental oversight tools, that that is not enough to keep these young users safe on the platform.",

TikTok is fighting that law. So TikTok has faced a number of these legal challenges, including over children's safety.
