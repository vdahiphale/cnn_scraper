And I possibly have a bit of a new perspective on this. And I think people are going to have to see the movie. You know, Donald Trump hadn't seen the movie when he made threats against us and during the Cannes Film Festival. But what he did do is he deterred, you know, he threatened any distributor who would dare to put -- bring the movie to audiences. And that's why we're now -- we're bringing the campaign directly to audiences. We're asking them to partner with us through our crowd funding campaign on Kickstarter. So that's a really exciting step we're taking now. And in terms of a takeaway, it's honestly I think there's some things maybe he has to say about themes that are bigger than just the character whose named Donald Trump. There's this movie about the origin of a worldview that's, you know, at the center of the big discussion, traveling with ourselves in our system.",

A student at the school, allegedly 14-year-old boy, armed with an AR-15 style semiautomatic weapon, sent the school into lockdown and then, according to law enforcement and witnesses, he opened fire, killing four people, leaving nine others wounded.Authorities say they've identified the victims, two students, also 14- years-old, and two teachers, both taught math at the school, one an assistant football coach. The suspect, though, surrendered to the school's resource officer who's similar to a police officer trained in school-based law enforcement based at the school. Authorities now plan to charge the accused shooter as an adult. Authorities say he was questioned about a school shooting threat last year, but they found no probable cause to take action.

He and five other cabinet ministers have submitted their resignations Wednesday. So far, four of them were accepted.Kuleba is one of the most widely recognized members of the Ukrainian government. If his resignation is approved, his departure will be part of a major government shakeup which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says is needed to give the war effort some new energy. The Kyiv cabinet reshuffle comes as Ukrainian forces are deep in the trenches in Eastern Ukraine, as well as in Russia's Kursk Region. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Elite soldiers from Ukraine's Third Assault Brigade get out of their armored vehicle and right into a massive firefight. One of the soldiers is wounded, the other screamed for a tourniquet. But the unit keeps moving. While Ukraine's army has been losing ground in many areas, in this part of the Kharkiv region, they've turned the tide. Later, taking several Russian dugouts, the deputy commander says. The enemy has no results, he says, moreover, we have positive results. We pushed the enemy back and captured a battalion line of enemy defense. While the Third Assault Brigade says they'll keep pushing forward, Ukraine remains badly outmanned by the Russians. And the Third Assault Brigade wants ever more combat drones to be their great equalizer. This is their drone school they call the kill house. Drone technology is developing extremely fast on the battlefields in Ukraine. And the Third Assault Brigade believes in the future they will need even more drone pilots so they're training as many as possible as fast as possible to get them combat ready. (Voice-over): They've already trained more than 1500 prospective drone aviators here, not just to fly the FPV drones effectively, but to use them as lethal weapons capable of destroying even tanks and armored vehicles. The greatest effectiveness of a pilot is his or her desire, the school's boss tells me. FPV pilots are people of a special mindset. They know how to hit the target, what ammunition to use. The ammo is becoming more lethal as well. A different Ukrainian unit now acknowledging they're using a trial version of a fire spewing drone that drops an incendiary substance on Russian positions. But the Russians keep hitting Ukraine with much bigger munitions. Missile strikes killing several people in Lviv in Western Ukraine overnight. Search and rescue crews recovering the bodies for hours. Kyiv's leadership has vowed revenge for Russia's aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities, a driving factor also for the soldiers attacking Russian positions on the northeastern front.

And Pope Francis has been repeatedly emphasizing the importance of interfaith dialogue and cooperation. That was something that was top of the agenda on Thursday when the pope went to the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest mosque in Southeast Asia, for a interfaith meeting and to sign a declaration calling on believers of all faiths to work together to tackle issues such as climate change, the world's wars and conflicts. The declaration very clearly saying that religion cannot be manipulated to justify violence. The pope was with the grand imam of Indonesia and other faith leaders. Before signing the declaration, he went to a tunnel that connects the mosque to the Catholic cathedral opposite. The tunnel is known as the Tunnel of Friendship, and the pope went there and blessed it this morning. Francis is, of course, going after Indonesia to Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Singapore. The 87-year-old pontiff is undergoing the longest trip of his pontificate. I can tell you, it's very hot and humid here in Jakarta.

Because of the typhoon today we know that kindergartens and schools for children with special needs have been suspended. There have also been a number of flight cancellations. For example, Hong Kong Express. This is the budget wing of Cathay Pacific. They have canceled six flights. United has also canceled flights to Hong Kong. And meanwhile in mainland China, we know that Hainan's international airport is canceling all flights from 8 p.m. Thursday evening to Friday at midnight. Now, Southern China will feel the effects of this super typhoon, including the island province of Hainan. It's otherwise known as the Hawaii of China. It's known for its sandy beaches and its five-star resorts. And the provincial government there in Hainan upgraded its emergency response. We've learned that bus services, ferries, railways, along with flights, have all been suspended. And residents and tourists have been advised to not go outside unless necessary. We've also learned that fishing vessels have been recalled in both Hainan, as well as Guangdong provinces. Now, authorities across China are not taking any chances. You know, this summer, China has experienced a devastating season of extreme rainfall and deadly flooding, with hundreds dead or missing, over a million people relocated, devastating financial losses. Super typhoon, we're keeping an eye on this storm. It is on the move. And Yagi is expected to -- to skirt around 300 kilometers to the Southwest of Hong Kong tonight and tomorrow morning.
