We have just in the last hour already seen the number outlined in terms of thedeath toll rising now topping 73 at least, 170 at least said to have been injured after two explosions went off near the burial sites of Iranian Commander Qasem Soleimani. And of course, we are still seeing that dramatic video emerging now of many people running away from the scene injured being carried away to nearby hospitals. According to Iranian state media citing officials, two explosions went off the first just 700 meters away from the burial site, the second about a kilometer away. Important to remember of course, that there would have been hundreds of pilgrims gathering around Qasem Soleimani's burial site today. Today marks four years since he was killed at Baghdad International Airport in a U.S. strike targeting Soleimani carried out of course, under the orders of then President, U.S. President Donald Trump. There has been some concern around the potential for violence in Iran around the anniversary of Qasem Soleimani's death but we haven't necessarily seen that on past occasions. We are still waiting for more details. But state media citing Iranian officials is now characterizing this as a terrorist attack but no clear details just yet as to what caused the explosion or who cause explosion or what the motives may have been? But of course this will send reverberations across the region, we know of course, that Hezbollah, the Iran backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon, their Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is expected to make a speech later today that speech was scheduled at some time ago to mark the anniversary of Qasem Soleimani's killing will -- and it will remain to be seen what Nasrallah has to say later this evening with regards to that.",

This breaking news comes a day afterthe assassination of a Senior Hamas Leader elsewhere in the region in Lebanon, which has raised fears of an escalation in the Israel-Hamas war. Saleh Al-Arouri and several others were killed Tuesday in an apparent drone strike in Beirut. Now an Israeli government spokesperson says Israel is not taking responsibility. But a U.S. official tells CNN, Israel carried out what they described as the assassination. Hamas condemning the killing as cowardly and as a terrorist act, Israel is long accused Arouri of planning attacks against Israeli citizens. Look, there's an awful lot to unpack here. Elliott Gotkine joining us from Tel Aviv, let's start with the assassination as its being described by the U.S. by Israel of Arouri. What do we know about him? You know, we know he was a significant Hamas Leader. Tell us more and why this assassination could be so consequential?",

And I suppose this will only escalate or add to tensions or to concerns that there could be an escalation between Iran's proxy of Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon and Israel. And this could broaden the focus of the war which is currently of course very much concentrated in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas. Now certainly it's very, very early to start speculating as to who was responsible for this, what Iran is calling a terrorist attack? And let's not forget that it wasn't Israel that killed Soleimani in the first place four years ago, it was the United States. So you know we could suggest that maybe there would have been others of high ranks from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps who were there to pay their respects and perhaps for some they would have been seen or deemed as a target. But I think it's a bit early to suggest that you know there was some kind of responsibility for Israel. But I think that this will add to concerns that we are on the brink of seeing this as I say, simmering war between Israel and Iran's proxy of Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon that we are perhaps closer to seeing that simmering war you know move into our next phase of all-out war, Becky.",

And they said that the cell was financed by the Mossad and that they were on their way to blow up Qasem Soleimani's tomb.

He wasscheduled to speak about Soleimani as this is the fourth anniversary of his death. And you have suggested that we should watch to see how Hezbollah calibrate their response. Let's remind ourselves since October the 7th we've had at least two major speeches by Hassan Nasrallah. And although in both throwing an awful lot of Hezbollah's weight behind support for the Palestinians in Gaza and warning Israel if it didn't stop its assault on Gaza this thing would escalate. Warning but actually those threats not really become anything overtly aggressive on the ground, and to all intents and purposes many describing Hezbollah's response to Israel's war on Gaza as muted. And you've also seen Iran sort of step back physically as it were from the breach although we've seen this proxy support in the guise of the Houthis exercising their assaults from Yemen. I just wonder what specifically we should be watching out for today? I mean how do you believe Hassan Nasrallah will calibrate this response?",

I'm going to remind ourviewers that I'm normally based in Abu Dhabi with the CNN's Middle East Programming Hub there and work around the region a lot. We talk to an awful lot of sources around the region all the time and I've heard voice around the region accusing Israel of trying to draw Iran into this conflict. I mean, we heard from the Defense Minister Yoav Gallant recently who said we are fighting this conflict on seven fronts. We have addressed six and he was speaking there to Lebanon to Syria to Iraq to Yemen to Gaza making the point without actually naming Iran that Iran was not -- was the only front that they hadn't actually physically gone after. Now the Biden Administration the staunch ally of the Israelis at present has warned Iran in no uncertain terms not to get involved in this conflict. Do you see evidence that Israel is trying to draw Iran in and or evidence that Benjamin Netanyahu? And again this is talk around the region Benjamin Netanyahu is intent to a certain extent in widening this conflict in not seeing an end to it anytime soon. What do you make of that?",

They support him staying there. But once the conflict -- only 15 percent want to see him in power. So he has a real state in extending the conflict as much as he can. And that's part of the challenge today. I do believe that Israel has been trying at least based on the evidence that we've seen so far has been trying to drag Hezbollah more into a conflict and Iran via Hezbollah. You know goading the more and more into conflict they have exhibited some restraint for better or worse. But I think also in the process there I mean that in the same way that the concern with dragging Hezbollah and Iran into conflict there's been concerned with Israel trying to drag the U.S. into the conflict as well because should rockets start raining on Tel Aviv or on Israel. The U.S. is not going to stand by and watch this happen without getting involved. And I think that's another major concern in the region. So now we're counting today on the hope that the American administration along maybe with some European countries including France can exercise their influence with the Israelis not to escalate any further. While other regional countries work with the Iranians to also dampen things down and dampen whatever response is going to come in whether its Qatar, Turkey and others.",

You have what's going on in the Red Sea with the Houthis attacking ships in the U.S. just killing 10 Houthi fighters last week and now of course a potential for a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel. All of this however, actually can be prevented through one very important measure and that is a ceasefire in Gaza. We have seen for instance, that the attacks by Iraqi militias against U.S. troops dramatically increase after October 7th for the six days that there was a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza. There were no attacks by the Iraqi militias at all even the attacks by the Houthis dramatically reduced. So I think it's a bit confusing as to why the one step that could be the most effective towards calming down the situation avoiding the U.S. itself getting dragged into war is the one step that the Biden Administration is most disinclined to pursue.",
