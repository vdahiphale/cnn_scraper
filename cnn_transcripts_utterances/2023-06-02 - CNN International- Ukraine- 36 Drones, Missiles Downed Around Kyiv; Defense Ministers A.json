Just ahead, people in Kyiv took shelter in the city's subway after the sixth wave of attacks on the Ukrainian capital in as many days. The Leader of a Kenyan cult accused of convincing hundreds of people to starve themselves appears in court were live in Mombasa.And a deadly disease is killing an entire species of sea urchins in the Gulf of Aqaba, getting the existence of the Red Sea's unique coral reef ecosystem. The capital of Ukraine has been pounded by another consecutive day of strikes. Residents ran for cover, and took shelter underground as Russia launched some three dozen cruise missiles and Iranian made drones. Ukraine's air force says all the projectiles were destroyed, two people were injured. Meanwhile, Russia reports drone attacks in Kursk and some other regions, the Governor of the border region of Belgorod says two people were killed in strikes, there. CNN's Sam Kiley joins us live from Kharkiv in Ukraine. Is the pattern changing, Sam?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is, Max, very strongly. What we've seen over the last week is the Ukrainians prosecuting more and more attacks, whether they admit it or not inside Russia. So in these latest cross border sorties, there is reportedly Russian dissident groups working under the Ukrainian banner inside Russia conducting operations in border areas not very far north of where I am, in Kharkiv in that same area.There have been artillery bombardments, blamed on Ukraine killed two people. There have been massive evacuations of many hundreds of Russian civilians from border villages. And now we've also got this latest reporting of attack of some kind, possibly drones on Smolensk, an oil refinery there that's close on the heels of an attack on an oil refinery, way to the south in Krasnodar. And of course, just a few days before that there were these drone attacks inside Moscow all of these part, essentially of a Ukrainian effort to open up a new front, inside Russia using what in movies and novels are often called deniable assets. In other words, groups that they say aren't directly working for, but certainly achieving the ends of the Ukrainian government. But at the same time, of course, fighting continues in the East. But these are the effects of these attacks has been very profound with increasing level of alarm being expressed, including by Vladimir Putin, who just in the last few hours, has said that these destabilizing efforts must not be allowed to succeed indicating that they are having the effect that the Ukrainians one which is to with relatively low investment, destabilize the Russians in their backdoor, back garden, Max.",

Nigeria's government is clarifying his plans to end the fuel subsidies this after the country's new President made an apparent off the cuff remark that triggered panic buying which nearly tripled the price. During his inauguration speech, the President declared the fuel subsidy gone. Now the government says that won't happen till the end of this month.

It wasn't part of his planned speech. And it did send shockwaves a lot of panic, people started stocking up on gas, thinking that they would have to pay more, and they are paying more in some Four Courts.The price is nearly triple. And that price is not uniform across the country as we speak. Now the labor union, the National Labor Congress has criticized his decision, his statement as insensitive decision, and they asking him to withdraw this plan immediately. But it's unsustainable. The President has said Nigeria is currently spending about $867 million every month just to keep gas prices artificially low for its citizens. Many citizens feel that it's a right for them to have this as citizens of an oil producing country where there are a few perks to living here. But there was unlikely to be a turnaround on this by the President, but people are angry, and we've been talking to them, Max, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But there's no question that it's just a small dent in the 31 + trillion dollar debt that the United States clearly has here.But the headline from here this morning, at least, Max, is the notion that this averts a potential economic catastrophe. Remember that X date by which the United States would run out of money to pay its deal, its bills is coming up on Monday. And so this is really in the nick of time in order to avert that with the House passing this bill on Wednesday. The Senate passing it last night and President Biden expected to now sign this legislation as early as today. And in my conversations with White House officials thus far, there's really an exhale a sigh of relief at the fact that they were able to avoid that potential economic catastrophe of first ever default in the United States history. But there's also really a sigh of relief and a hopefulness looking forward at the rest of President Biden's term because this bill not only takes the debt ceiling issue off the table until after the next election until 2025. But it also helps to incentivize the government to pass key funding bills by the end of this year and avert the likelihood of a government shutdown. That's because if they don't pass those funding bills, there would be across the board on both defense and non-defense spending 1 percent cuts, which is just going to be completely unpopular with lawmakers over on Capitol Hill. So an opportunity for President Biden here to be able to refocus on his economic agenda to focus on implementing those pieces of legislation that he was able to pass in his first two years in office from infrastructure to the chips Bill led to the Inflation Reduction Act. And so I think that'll be part of the message that you'll hear from President Biden tonight, as he said to address the nation from the Oval Office at 7 pm Eastern Time, Max.",

And I say the details are still emerging because I don't think we fully comprehend yet the scale of tragedy and loss, when it comes to this call. I'm at Malindi hospital here at the coast from Mombasa, there's a refrigerated truck here brought in by the Kenya Red Cross where there are more than 200 bodies and remains of those who believed to have starved themselves.Under the sway of this pastor, Pastor Mackenzie, they say survivors and those who managed to rescue some people that he said the end of the world was coming and they should stop them. But there's emerging evidence that many children in fact, were not just stabbed, but then killed, potentially by their own parents to accelerate the track straight to heaven. At least that's what the pastor they say was telling them. This has shocked Kenya and the region and in the affidavit put in court today and inspector says at least 10 more mass graves are at that site. And in the coming days when they start examination again, we may begin to fully understand the scale of this tragedy. I was in court when the pastor is having a hearing. We don't know yet whether they will extend his detention under terror laws. I expect they will. I put the first question to him managing to grab some moments with him behind an iron grate. And I asked what, is he says about these allegations? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
