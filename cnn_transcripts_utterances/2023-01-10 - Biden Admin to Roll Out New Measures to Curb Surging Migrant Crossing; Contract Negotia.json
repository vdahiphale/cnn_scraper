      "sentences": "And it is always a big issue back here in Washington, at home, of course. The White House preparing to roll out a new plan aimed at curbing the surge of migrants at the southern border.CNN's M.J. Lee is traveling with the president and is in Mexico City. So, M.J., just refresh our memories, what are the details in this plan? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you both noted, this issue has, of course, been a very big one for President Biden back at home and now has been a major issue here in Mexico City at the North American leader's summit. Just in a little bit, we are going to see the president meeting again with the Canadian prime minister and the president of Mexico to discuss this and many other issues. And what we will be seeing is an announcement from the administration to roll out a virtual portal, this is being described by administration officials as sort of a one-stop shop for migrants and asylum-seekers who can hopefully go to this platform and figure out whether there are legal ways for them to enter countries, like the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We are also told that there are efforts being made to build physical resource centers, including in Southern Mexico. Again, the idea there, too, is to give a resource -- more resources to migrants to go to these kinds of centers and figure out how can I legally migrate to a place like the United States. All of this sort of goes to show that the U.S. believes that there needs to be a coordinated effort, that the U.S. needs to work with partners in the region, like Mexico, like Canada, to deal with the situation of migrants trying to cross the U.S. border at record numbers. And I think it is important to note that back at home, you know, there are going to be some mixed responses to some of these new measures being rolled out, particularly since we don't have the full details yet. We don't know exactly how effective they're going to be and there have been some concerns raised about the fact that oftentimes when these migrants, asylum seekers are coming to the border without first sort of taking the proper measures to try to apply for asylum, they are doing that simply because the situation back at home, the situation that they're trying to leave behind is so dire and so desperate. So, we will see how the three leaders potentially talk about this issue of migration when we see them later this afternoon. But certainly, as you noted, back at home for President Biden, this remains a huge political liability for him.",

Part of the Safe Zone Act that you're proposing, as I understand it, would change that, wllowing them to apply for asylum before they get close to the southern border.",

And what it does, it creates this zone in Guatemala as the first pilot program for migrants who are coming south of the border to come up and process at that juncture, very similar to what they do in my district. This would be done in partnership with other countries, have them process their asylum claim 1,500 miles from the southern border. It does two things. It takes the pressure off our border, one, and allows Border Patrol and law enforcement to do what their job and it takes the cartel element out of it as well.These migrants that show up to my border are paying between $6,000 and $8,000 a head to cartels to get to our southern border. So, cartels have made billions of dollars trafficking migrants to our southern border and we need to have a plan to eliminate that. This Safe Zone Act does just that. It is a bipartisan bill. I have a meeting with some Republican members today to discuss it. And it is very humane for people who care about migrants. Why should we force migrants to walk 1,500 miles and pay cartels and women and children to be pillaged and go through horrible struggles that they go through if we're going to allow them in anyway under the credible first standard, which is quite a low standard? Let's do it from another place.",

I had Eastern Europeans that were in Paris and Rome and Madrid before they got to my place. They had many other safe countries to ask for asylum. People coming north stop in Costa Rica and Panama, Mexico, which is somehow still considered a safe country, other places where they could ask for asylum and they should be required to do so.",

One nurse telling me yesterday that she didn't know if she was going to come back to work today because it was so unsafe for these patients.

So, this is one of the largest and longest studies to really look at the idea of dietary patterns and how that translates into your risk of dying. And so they looked at around a little over 70,000 women and a little over 40,000 men, they gave them food questionnaires every few years and followed them for about 36 years. And they found that those who had the highest adherence to four different healthy dietary eating plans or patterns had a 20 percent lower risk of mortality. They also looked across the diseased spectrum and they found that this lower mortality related to decreased cardiovascular mortality, decreased mortality for neurodegenerative diseases, respiratory diseases and cancer. So, once again, even more and more data to point us in the direction that nutrition really matters in terms of our health.
