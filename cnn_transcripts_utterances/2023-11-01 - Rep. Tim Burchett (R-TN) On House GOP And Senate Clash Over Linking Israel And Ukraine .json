Is there any way you would vote for an Israel aid package if it comes back to you from the Senate with Ukraine funding in it? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN) (via Webex by Cisco):  I don't think so. I made it pretty clear where I've been on Ukraine funding. Now, we've given them -- what is it, $120 billion now, basically unchecked -- that's Ukraine; not Israel. And the president characterizing this as an Israeli aid package is really kind of bogus.

But it's four different sheets of paper -- good gosh. You put a border package, which actually it's not really a border package. It's just a bureaucrat package allowing more illegals to get into our country -- the interior of our country -- which I'm still not understanding why the Democrats don't abandon.

Many have spent multiple -- made multiple trips to Israel over the course of their lives, including just last summer. And so, they consider it their second home.
