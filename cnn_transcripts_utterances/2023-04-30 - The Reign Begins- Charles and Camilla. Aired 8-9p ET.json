Final preparations are underway in the United Kingdom right now for the coronation of King Charles III and his wife, Camilla, the queen consort. It's a ceremony steeped in tradition with some of the rituals dating back nearly a thousand years. It's only been televised once, however, when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned nearly 70 years ago. She was one of the longest serving and most celebrated monarchs in British history but her son faces a different type of reign. The royal family is splintered and with a new and less popular monarch on the throne, many are questioning the role of this royal institution. CNN's Erica Hill traveled to London to meet with leading British scholars, journalists, and those close to the royal family to better understand what this moment and this man mean in a modern world. \"The Reign Begins: Charles and Camilla.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
