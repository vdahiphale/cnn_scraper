The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, initially called on both sides to observe a truce for orthodox Christmas, celebrated January 7.

Renewed COVID infections have been soaring in recent weeks. CNN's Ivan Watson has the very latest now, reporting in from Hong Kong. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hospital hallways crowded with sick people, patients treated on sidewalks, and lines of vans waiting for entry to busy funeral homes. A huge COVID-19 outbreak is battering China, the sure coming more than three years after the virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese state television says medical workers are stepping up to meet the challenge. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We have expanded the ward, added more beds, brought in more beds. We brought in experienced doctors to work with the young ones to get them up to speed quicker. WATSON (voice-over): But social media footage shows hospitals in China's wealthiest cities clearly inundated with patients, and a recent Chinese study projects infections won't surge in less developed rural parts of the country until later this month. Officially, as of Thursday, only 24 people in all of China died from COVID-19 since December 7, according to China's CDC, with only six COVID victims in Beijing. MR. ZHANG, BEIJING: That is totally ridiculous, not credible, you know. As far as I know, my close relatives, among them, there are four that died already. That is from one family. So I hope the government will honestly and credibly tell its people and people in the world what's really happened here. WATSON (voice-over): Last month, CNN journalists filmed bodies stored in containers awaiting cremation at one Beijing funeral home. The World Health Organization criticizing China for under-representing the severity of its outbreak and not sharing enough real data on the scale of the outbreak. DR. MIKE RYAN, WHO EMERGENCIES PROGRAM DIRECTOR: We believe that the current numbers being published from China under-represent the true impact of the disease in terms of hospital admissions, in terms of ICU admissions and, particularly, in terms of deaths. And we would like to see more data on a more geographic basis across China. WATSON (voice-over): Beijing's decision to allow citizens to travel internationally, ending years of self-imposed isolation, just as the virus spreads out of control, has triggered a global debate. A growing number of governments imposing travel restrictions ranging from the U.S., which requires pre-flight COVID tests to Morocco, which temporary banned all travel from China. Beijing is now threatening reciprocal measures. The growing international dispute of little concern to Chinese families that are struggling with the sudden loss of loved ones. Some statistical models predict China could lose more than a million people due to COVID-19. Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

His arrest produced clashes between cells of his criminal game and Mexican security forces. Mexican defense minister Cresencio Sandoval said that, after Guzman's detention, cells from his criminal group staged 19 blockades and armed attacks in different parts of the city, including its international airport and an air force base.
