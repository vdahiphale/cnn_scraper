The Israeli prime minister announces a delay to his controversial judicial overhaul that -- but will it calm the atmosphere on the streets? Plus, an elementary school targeted in the United States yet again. What we know about the multiple victims, including the children and the female -- and the shooter is female. Well, we begin with extraordinary developments unfolding tonight in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just announcing that he will halt his controversial plan to weaken the courts. It comes after widespread strikes and mass protests apparently forcing his hand. Mr. Netanyahu was trying to defuse a full blown crisis threatening to tear the country apart. For many in Israel, the last straw was his firing of the defense minister who opposed the judicial overhaul plans. Workers in virtually every major sector went on strike today, shutting down transportation, universities, restaurants and more. Protesters are still on the streets tonight, but Mr. Netanyahu is urging unity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator):  We're not facing enemies, we're facing brothers. I'm asking from you one thing, just be responsible and do not provoke. I'll raise the right one, and everybody in the public, they recognize the need for reform. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Who said to me those exact words that it's a small minority that are holding us back. She said, how is that democracy when they go on strike and stop the buses and disrupt the country with protests? How is that democracy? And this is very much a similar narrative to the narrative that's used by Prime Minister Netanyahu that we are the government. We have these judicial reforms that are planned. We believe that they're necessary, and we believe that it is -- it's as he describes a small minority that's holding them up. It doesn't look like a small minority to many people, but that's the narrative that the government is using. So I think when people believe that, that they're being held back by a small minority, then they're going to continue to want to challenge and continue to support the government, and continue to want to get those judicial changes that they -- that they think are fitting. So I -- my sense at the moment is that people are going to want to see those changes happen. And indeed, there's a tinged, I would say, the conversation with the young lady, tinged with the fact that she would like to see the changes now. But recognizing what the prime minister says that he doesn't want to tear the country apart. But there is, you know, within the political right of this country, and within the prime minister's coalition, a lot of pressure on him to keep track and keep on with those changes, and it's far from clear just what he's going to press for in the next session of parliament, and what that may -- and what that may look like. We could be back to exactly the same point come the intensity of the debate then.",

And the economic effect because of these things. And I think that Netanyahu was caught in between, on one hand, to try to deliver to his constituency, and on the other hand, to try not to tear the country apart, including former soldiers or reserve soldiers that said that they're going to -- not going to serve in the idea due to those reforms. But I think that it's way more to that now. I think that a big portion of the demonstrators are not doing it solely because of the legislation reforms or revolution as they define it. It's also because they just don't like Benjamin Netanyahu and what he presents and the way he behaves. His allies, you mentioned Itamar Ben-Gvir, the religious parties, et cetera. So, I think that this also added fuel to the flame. But my assumption is that gradually, all parties will coincide and try to adapt what the president move forward some kind of a compromise. So, on the one hand, they tried to balance the different powers, the judicial power, the parliament and the government, but not to the extreme as Netanyahu and his allies wanted to.",

And you're right that -- and the fact that he also combined some personal - - as we define personal legislation to this package deal did upset many people in the country. I'm quite surprised that Netanyahu didn't read the map. Accordingly Netanyahu is the most experienced prime minister in Israel, and even, I can -- it reminds me that it's not the first time that he didn't fire his defense minister. He did so in the mid '90s. I don't think that the fact that he fired the defense minister is the peak of this whole phenomenon. The bottom line is that Netanyahu realized that there is a limitation to his political power, and due to the fact that he faced it, he had to back down, and now offer a compromise which I quite doubt if the opposition will give them this letter to step down from the reforms that he wanted to conduct.",

And it's -- I think it's important to point out what President Putin is saying that they're going to deploy these weapons, not exactly clear when, but they're not going to be under control of the Belarusians. They're going to be under control of Russia. So he's making the arguments, well, this is just kind of what the United States does and NATO does with tactical nuclear weapons. But this is -- it gets really complicated, really fast. I mean, just about a week ago, when Xi Jinping went to Moscow, both Putin and Xi agreed that weapons should -- nuclear weapons should not be spread outside of the boundaries of a country. So I think what Putin is trying to do is essentially scare people. I mean, every time he uses the word nuclear, he gets a lot of attention obviously. And then, you know, read the fine print. When are they going to go into place? You know, he can drag this out, but I think it's a sign that he has a lot of problems, and this is what he resorts to when he has no other -- let's call them rhetorical weapons, and that is frightening statements about nuclear weapons.",

They're saying well, now we're -- we have nuclear weapons. Well, they actually don't because if we believe Putin, they're under control of Russia. But why is the President Lukashenko of Belarus agreeing to do this. I mean, in my book, I would say it's also a sign of weakness on his part. He is very dependent on Russia economically right now, and so you might, you know, surmise that Russia is putting pressure on Belarus to allow the stationing. We'll have to see how this plays out.

We cover these time and time again, but this is quite unusual to have a female as the shooter here. What more are you learning? AMARA WALKER, CO-ANCHOR, NEW DAY WEEKEND:  Yes, that is exceedingly rare, Lynda, that we are talking about a female mass shooter suspect. Here in the U.S., yes, mass shootings have become quite common, also with schools being targeted. But what we have seen time and time again, the shooter is in most cases -- in almost every case is a male. What we know about this female suspect, according to police, initially, they thought she might be a teenager, but now we're being told she's 28 years old. We don't have any more information about her. Police -- Nashville police still trying to identify her. We don't know what her connection is to the school if she has any. But what's so disturbing is knowing, according to police that she was heavily-armed, two assault-style rifles and a handgun. That is what she had on her. When she entered this little school, you can see the steeple there in the picture. This is a Presbyterian Church, inside this church is what houses this very small private Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee. We are told there about 200 students there on a given day, and about 40 to 50 staff members. So, you can only imagine what a small, tight-knit community, probably only a few classrooms inside this church. The suspect, the female suspect entering the church according to Nashville police from a side entrance, was traversing to the second floor, shooting when gunmen arrived -- excuse me when police arrived. About five police officers arrived, two shot at her and killed her. The police response is also remarkable. The call came in at 10:13, by 10:27, the gunman, or I should say the female shooter was dead. We know now that three children, we don't know their ages, but we know this is a school where little children, maybe as young as four because it's a pre K, pre- kindergarten, and perhaps as old as 12 attend this school. We know now that three children were shot and killed by the perpetrator. Three adults staff members, perhaps of this church or the school authorities are saying it's kind of hard to determine that right now, but three adults also killed in the shooting, a total of six victims, the seventh person being the shooter killed by police. No other injuries, except for a police officer who had some cuts from shattered glass. But look, I mean, this is still an unfolding scene. There is a location not far from the school at another church nearby, where parents have been told that they can head over there to find out if their child made it out alive. That is a reality here in the U.S. You can see some parents, perhaps staff members congregating in this location, you know, but -- and a lot of emotions obviously. I'm not very clear on the protocol, but from what I understand, when these parents arrive at these reunification centers, they tell the police their child's name, and they wait to, you know, be reunited with their child. It's for sure, excruciating scene for all the parents, who not only attend have their children attend this school, but all the parents in the U.S. thinking, God, could this happen to my child? So this is still unfolding, Lynda, it's an active scene. FBI, federal resources have also been deployed, and that is all we know right now. The Biden -- President. Biden has also been briefed on this, and we heard from the first lady, we saw the anguish in her face, she was giving a speech at an event where she said, this is happening way too often, and Congress, our lawmakers need to do something about it --",

So when things fall apart, when the negotiations don't go well, the unions are capable of calling out these very substantial mass strikes. So you've had some 400,000 transport workers stayed away from work today, 380,000 airline passengers affected, most of them had cancellation or postponed flights, only of the major airports, only Berlin was struggling to stay open. The rest either closed partially or entirely inter-city. Long distance, railway travel was suspended as were a lot of the commuter trains in the morning. So it had a very profound effect, and at the heart of this strike is an old fashioned wage dispute. The unions are asking for 10.5 percent, inflation is running at about 8.7, and the government and other parts of the economy and the private sector too are saying that we want to give you 5 percent. There have been earlier strikes earlier in the year, which resulted in from the strikers perspective, improved wage deals. And this is coming on the back, Lynda, of similar scale of strikes and disruptions that the United Kingdom has witnessed also over many months, because, of course, right across Europe, the inflation is biting, eroding into people's wages and interest rates are increasing, meaning that people are really struggling very often, particularly those that obviously at the lower end of the income scales, Lynda.",

Very often, and particularly in the Anglo-Saxon world, it can be 67, at least. So, it doesn't strike many people outside of France as that radical a change, but that is because the unions would say that that is -- the reason for this is that it disproportionately hits the people who go into work earlier in life, and people who don't earn a lot in the first place. The government is saying that by 2027, just on the pensions file, they'll have a 12 1/2 billion euro deficit annually. Against all of this, though, there have been demonstrations and strikes since the middle of January. It's really getting increasingly violent. Over the weekend, they were very, very violent, but separate protests, involving protests over an ecological issue and the building of reservoirs. But the local police here in Paris are saying they're having to increase the numbers nationally, but -- to 13,000 being deployed for these protests, 5 1/2 thousand.

The -- but the quicker much faster harder hitting lower to the ground storms like tornadoes, it's hard to make a correlation. They seem to be shifting eastward. The tornado alley that was sort of in the center part of the United States is moving, if you look at the trends to the east side of the Mississippi, where that that town is there in Mississippi to -- and a lot more population density is over there. Sometimes a tornado will hit a populous area, and the fatality numbers will be much higher than another year where there were much more tornadoes that hit in rural mountain out areas, for example. But we do know that tornadoes love warm, moist air and winds that change speed dramatically. That's the ingredients. And we know we're getting more of that on a warmer planet. But, again, it's going to take time to specifically attribute but it's sort of like loading a dice. You know, the odds are of these devastating events, there seem to be clustering more on fewer days.

You know, a shooter, in this situation, reported we had two assault weapons and a pistol, two AK-47. So I call on Congress again to pass my assault weapons ban.
