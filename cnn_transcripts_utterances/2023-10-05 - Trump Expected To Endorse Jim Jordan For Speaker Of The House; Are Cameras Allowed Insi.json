SOLOMON-SIMMONS:  It makes a huge difference and that's why I've been saying forever for the last 20 years I've been in this fight that Tulsa is the linchpin to reparations broadly for African-American people because in Tulsa, you have hundreds of pictures, you have video.

Mother Fletcher was seven years old at the time of the massacre. Mother Randle was six years old at the time of the massacre. So, it makes a huge difference.

Is the destruction, is it old? It's over the $200 million in property damage. It's something old. You talked about the historians are now saying, well, maybe 300 people.

We would never know that maybe to this day, but we do know that something is old. We do know that Tulsa is the lynchpin for all reparations throughout this country for Black people. And reparation is not a revolutionary concept. We do it every single day in our civil justice system. If you're hit from behind in a car, you break a leg, and you're out of work for a month, we pay for your car to get fixed. That's reparations. We pay for your lost wages. That's reparations.

He was the anchor of a defensive unit referred to as the \"Monsters of the Midway.\"And it's funny, \"Sports Illustrated\" put him on the cover and said he's the most feared guy in football. He had a teammate who famously was quoted saying, when he hits you, he doesn't want to just put you in the hospital, he wants to put you in the cemetery. But the thing that always struck me is that he represented so much more to the people of Chicago. He was born there. He grew up there. He went to the University of Illinois. So, for the Bears fans in the stands, he was one of them. And he epitomized to them who they wanted to be, right? He was strong. He was tough. And frankly, he was something special for Chicago at a time in the 60s and 70s where the mad men of New York and the flower children of California were kind of taking over American culture.",

They haven't just leaned into the Taylor Swift phenomenon, they've dived in and brought scuba equipment.I don't know if we have the social media accounts, what they were earlier in the week, but they were referring -- there you go. This is the NFL account for all 32 teams. It's not the Kansas City Chiefs account, right? And you have Travis Kelce jerseys going up 400%.
