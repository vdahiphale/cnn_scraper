Shaw is expected to apologize to the people of East Palestine, Ohio for the devastating impact of last month's derailment. Shaw will stress the company's pledge to provide more than $20 million to affected residents and its efforts to clean up the water and clean up the soil there.Ohio senators Sherrod Brown and J.D. Vance will also testify about a new bipartisan rail safety bill. Now to West Virginia where a freight train derailed early Wednesday morning injuring three crew members and spilling diesel into a nearby river. The railroad company CSX says the train derailed after striking a rockslide in a remote part of New River Gorge National Park sending fiery train parts into the river. The company says the train was not carrying hazardous materials and it will work to contain that spilled diesel. Turning now to a story that will likely amuse you but should also really worry you.

Well, we saw that the government reported a half-million jobs in January so the strength coming into the year should likely be sustained in February, though I doubt it will be that high given where we are in the economy right now. But overall, the labor market is incredibly tight. We're seeing robust hiring and that's good. Let's not question that. It's unequivocally good to see people with jobs and income.
