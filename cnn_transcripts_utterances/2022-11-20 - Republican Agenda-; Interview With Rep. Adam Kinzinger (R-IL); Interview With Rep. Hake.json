      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is thinking there is so much fresh content, and yet we're about to watch a rerun.This morning, President Biden celebrates his 80th birthday. He says he's planning to run for a second term in 2024. And his opponent could very well be Donald Trump, who just announced he's running for president. He will do that under the shadow of a brand-new special counsel investigation. And, if he wants, Trump can now tweet again after his ban was lifted. If all that sounds a little too familiar, there are changes coming to politics in Washington, D.C., specifically to the U.S. House. This week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the other two top House Democrats said they're going to make way for a new generation of Democratic leaders. Pelosi's decision brings to a close a consequential two decades of leading Democrats in the House. It also ushers in a relative youth movement. Pelosi, House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer and Democratic Whip James Clyburn, all of them are older than 80. The members on track to replace them, Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, Pete Aguilar, are in their 50s and, in Aguilar's case, 40s. Congressman Jeffries is currently running unopposed for the top job. In addition to being 30 years younger than Nancy Pelosi, he will be the first black American to ever lead a political party in the U.S. Congress. A former Brooklyn lawyer and the son of a social worker and a substance abuse counselor, Jeffries took office in 2013 and allied himself with Pelosi. He even nominated her for speaker in the last Congress. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The thing about us, Jake, is that, while we can have some noisy conversations at times about how we can make progress for the American people, what we have seen is that, under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, Jim Clyburn, we have constantly been able to come together, time and time again. Whether that was the American Rescue Plan, saving the economy, putting shots in arms, money in pockets, kids back in school, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, creating millions of good-paying jobs, fixing our crumbling infrastructure, gun safety legislation for the first time in 30 years that will save lives. Obviously, there's more that needs to be done. The CHIPS and Science Act, bringing domestic manufacturing jobs back home to the United States of America, as opposed to our jobs going in the other direction, and, of course, the groundbreaking historic Inflation Reduction Act, which is going to lower health care costs, energy costs and the high price of lifesaving prescription drugs. My point is, Jake, that, though people have doubted us, tried to create this frame of Democrats in disarray, we always are consistently able to come together, find the highest common denominator, get things done for everyday Americans, and make progress.",

I think it's also important to point out, Jake, that we have consistently fought against extremism on the Republican side, including when it manifested itself often during the former president's tenure, while, at the same time, being able to find common ground to make progress for the American people. We did it with criminal justice reform. I was delighted to be involved personally in trying to negotiate historic criminal justice reform with the Trump administration and working with my colleague former Republican Congressman Doug Collins from Georgia. Certainly, Speaker Pelosi led the effort to make sure that we could arrive at an agreement around the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement reform, the new NAFTA, in a way that benefited working families, organized labor, and people from the heartland and throughout the country.

The fact that he did it with a poll, of which however many percent of those could have been bots that aren't real people voting in that, secondarily, I don't know if that decision should be made by some poll. I mean, what happened, I -- remember, specifically, when this was all done, so, not only was he lighting and accelerating the fire on January 6, also before January 6 with his conspiracies, at the end of the day, he said, this is what you get when a victory is so unceremoniously basically taken away from the American people. So, not only when it was done did he have any remorse. He said, well, of course, you guys had an insurrection because that's what you get when you steal an election. I mean, I remember seeing that specific tweet and just being outraged at how, after all this is done, can you still do that? And so now this idea that he's going to come on and be reformed, everybody knows he won't.

(END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER:  Republican potential presidential candidates making their pitch to the Republican Jewish Coalition Convention in Las Vegas. Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION. My panel joins me now. Brad, let me start with you. President Trump, former President Trump's announcement this week does not really -- at least from where I sit, does not seem to have deterred a number of individuals who might run, at least based on those clips.

I do think there is legitimacy to some of these investigations, to Brad's point, but I did think it was strange that House Republicans came out of the gate saying, we're going to investigate Hunter Biden, when I think there are so many other issues that voters want to see them tackle, like the border crisis, like inflation, gas prices, you name it.
