At the same time, we are learning there are security preparations underway right now here in the Capitol for his possible third indictment in a separate case involving attempts to overturn the 2020 election.The special counsel is now charging the former president with three new counts. This in the classified documents case, including one additional count of willful retention of National Defense Information and crucially two additional counts of obstruction. Prosecutors say Trump along with two employees, Walt Nauta and Mar-a- Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, tried to alter, mutilate, and conceal evidence after trying to delete security camera footage. Why? De Oliveira has been added to the case as a defendant now. Prosecutors argue he told the IT director that \"the boss wanted that server deleted.\" We are just learning the identity of that IT director. Two people close to the investigation tell CNN his name is Yuscil Taveras. He is identified as Trump employee number four in that indictment. Trump is also now facing an additional charge for willfully retaining a top- secret document about military attack plans for Iran. CNN's Paula Reid joins me now. So, two categories are in effect in these new charges in the classified documents indictment. First, tell us about the obstruction one, about deleting potential evidence here.",

What specific preparations are you talking about and when? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, Jim. There's no sign of the grand jury today at the federal courthouse here in DC. [14:05:04] But we're learning that behind the scenes, law enforcement officials are still preparing under the belief that an indictment announcement could come sometime within the next week. Even, you know, agencies like the Secret Service, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the U.S. Capitol police are all coordinating with one another with the expectation that there could be an announcement from prosecutors in the coming days. And look, these are things like making sure there are enough officers staffed up to you know, counter any potential protests that may result from that. You know, figuring out what just sticks around a potential Trump appearance in DC once the indictment is announced. And now, look. We also know that Trump himself is still expecting a potential indictment to come down in the next couple of days.

It's going to be very unattractive to a jury that you have the former president, an extremely important individual who's really gotten his workers, average-working people into trouble. Juries won't like that. But John is going to make the government prove its case or cases, depending on the scope of his involvement in every step of the way. And there are going to be substantial issues. I think one of the reasons for the superseding indictment is because some of the evidence about that Bedminster conversation might have been tough to get before the jury until you added new count 32, the Iran document -- the Iran attack plans that were discussed there. So, there's going to be a tremendous amount of wrangling. But he raised this in the DOJ meeting on January 6, according to CNN reporting, and this is going to be a big issue here. Delay.

You understand why so many people across the country are interested in this case because, for 49 hours, Carlee Russell was missing. And people wanted to know, had she been abducted. When she said she saw a toddler on the side of the road, she pulled over. And when police arrived, all they found was a wig, a cell phone, and an Apple iPhone watch. And then, of course, her car sitting there. And then for quite some time, they were looking for this woman. But listen to the chief talk about this, just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And she had a story that she initially told detectives that she had been kidnapped by a man with orange hair, that she was able to get away from her kidnappers several different times before at some point breaking away, running through a weird line, finding her way home.Her parents talked to the media all the way through this. They were calling for people to help out in the terms of this investigation. Then they went on TV and talked about her getting away from these people. At some point, her lawyer then came forward to say this was a hoax. We also know that police were able to go through her phone and find very disturbing search histories. Whether it was the movie Taken or buying a one-way bus ticket. She also stopped at a Target and bought snacks. What we haven't figured out right now is where was she for those 49 hours that she was missing. Alabama Attorney General was actually showed up to this news conference as well to lend his support to the Hoover police department. So many questions about this case. Why did she decide to do this? What was going on in her life? But at this point, two charges, misdemeanors. And obviously, this has taken a turn that mug shot should be out sometime soon. Boris.",
