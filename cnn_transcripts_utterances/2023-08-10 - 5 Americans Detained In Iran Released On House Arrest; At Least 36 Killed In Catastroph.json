Leading this hour, four wrongfully detained Americans in Iran have been released from a notorious Iranian prison and are now on house arrest in a hotel according to one of their lawyers. In exchange, the Biden administration has agreed to unfreeze $6 billion of frozen Iranian assets. The three named and one unnamed Americans were moved from Tehran's notorious Evin prison to a hotel guarded by Iranian officials earlier today. CNN's Christiane Amanpour was first to break the story. She also spoke with one of the Iranian American detainees in an unprecedented interview from Evin present back in March. She joins us now.

And it's important to remember that the account from which money could be accessed by the Iranians is an account set up in the previous administration that allowed other countries to import non sanctionable goods. It's not something that the Biden administration created, but it is it's a series of accounts that Iran has pulled on before, they haven't been able to pull on one account. And what we're talking about is the possibility of making that one account that has been in existence for several years, more accessible to the Iranians, but it would be again, under the same level of limits, they can only pull from that account for humanitarian purposes. And there is a oversight mechanism that's already built into that process, so it's not ransom. And again, no U.S. taxpayer dollars involved here.

I hope that at the end of the day, everybody, no matter who you vote for, can understand how important it is to get these families reunited to get these Americans back home.

Successive American presidents have had to do the necessary to get Americans back, you know, from the beginning of the Reagan administration all the way through to this one, and for -- with respect, Vice President Pence to cast aspersions, remember, he was the vice president for President Trump who went to two such deals to get two Americans back. Before that, President Obama did too, you mentioned it as part of the Iran nuclear deal, and before that, and before that, the presidents did it.Right now, President Biden this year has entered a deal of reciprocity with the Russians to get back Brittney Griner and trying to get back others. These are the facts of life. And to protect American life, sometimes these have to happen. I'm not -- Kirby didn't say to you, and I'm not sure whether I've got this right, but from what I understand about the money, it is not even American money, forget taxpayers dollars, it's South Korean money. Apparently the money is the money that South Korea owes Iran for that amount of oil that Iran delivered to it, but because of the global sanctions regime, they were not allowed to return it. So, in this case, apparently that's the case.

Now, there is no business. So what the business was, according to Devon Archer was they were taking money from foreign nationals. And they were marketing Joe Biden. Joe Biden was the brand. So that is the first associate that came in implicated Joe Biden as being the reason they we're getting this money. And the money is from bad people. The money is from people who are either incarcerated in the countries where they wired the money or they are on the flee from being incarcerated. So we're concerned that the President is compromised, because of the millions of dollars in his family to proceed. And remember, Jake, the President hasn't been truthful with the American people. First of all, he said he never communicated with these people. Devon Archer testified that he has 20 times in fact, at least, and then he said that none of this money ever happened while he was vice president. We didn't know this at the beginning of that investigation. But what we know now is the overwhelming majority of the wire transfers happen while Joe Biden was vice president.
