She closely follows the White House, Congress and other political stories, as well. Leanne, thank you so much for being with us. And let's just talk about the State of the Union address tonight. There are quite a few issues, I would say, for the President to contend with. Number one, he's certainly not getting much credit for the economic rebound. There's, of course, a lot of division among liberals in this country in terms of the correct stance the U.S. should adopt when it comes to Israel. Of course, Republicans have really honed in on immigration and the crisis at the southern border in terms of making that a national crisis and making that sort of front and center. And of course, there are concerns about the President's age, as well. There's a lot of issues, a lot of hurdles here for the President to sort of overcome. Just give us your take on that. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, THE EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  That's a lot to accomplish in just one speech, right, Zain? But it is what President Biden has to do right now. The fact that he's been struggling in the polls now that the general election is officially underway against he and the former President Donald Trump. President Biden has to address all of the challenges facing him and his presidency. And one of those is his age. Some voters are concerned that he is perhaps too old for the job. It's important to note that Donald Trump has been talking about Biden's mental acuity since President Biden became the nominee in 2020. So, he has had more than four years to really hone in on this message. And it's something that Biden is having to struggle with in this sense. So, tonight is going to be really important. You can be sure that the President is going to lay the blame on a lot of policies on Republicans, saying it is Republicans who declined to fix the border when there was a path before them with bipartisan legislation. It is Republicans who are declining to fund Ukraine. And so you can see there's going to be an attempt to shift blame to Republicans, but also to take credit for what Biden thinks is due, especially on the economy.",

I want to get you to respond to a new \"Wall Street Journal\" survey that says 59 percent of voters say they would actually support that bipartisan package. Roughly equal percentages of Republicans and Democrats are in favor of that. The poll also found that 20 percent of voters now rank immigration as the number one issue, up from 13 percent back in December. But here's the issue that this administration and this President in particular still faces. A plurality of voters put more blame on Biden than on Republicans for developments in border security.

Approximately 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering in that city right now. So let's get to CNN's Alex Marquardt. And Alex, you've been covering these talks and it looks like they're not promising at this point. The administration at least trying to offer a stopgap measure in terms of addressing the humanitarian crisis by opening this port, also making clear that it doesn't require any U.S. boots on the ground. But this is only a temporary measure. As we know, walk us through some of the ramifications at this point.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Bianna, this is a pretty remarkable announcement from the Biden administration madejust moments ago. It's something that Biden that President Biden is going to speak about in his State of the Union tonight. And it really just underscores the desperation that Palestinians are facing in Gaza right now. Not enough aid getting into the Gaza Strip, not enough aid getting to where it needs to be, notably in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where we saw that horrific incident last week in which more than 100 Palestinians were killed, Israeli troops opening fire. So, now, you have the Biden administration saying that they are going to establish a port likely in the coming weeks. Shipments, at least initially, will be coming from Cyprus. And as you note, the administration making clear that there will be no American boots on the ground, that the Americans will stay in ships off of -- off of the coastline. But that port to be established on the Mediterranean Sea in Gaza, it will give aid agencies and other countries a capacity of several hundred truckloads, the equivalent of several hundred truckloads of aid per day, food, water, shelter, medication, that kind of thing. And so, again, it does underscore the desperate need in Gaza. But I think it also highlights the fact that despite immense American pressure on Israel to open up more land crossings, Israel is still resistant. So, what the U.S. has had to do is those airdrops. We've seen several of those in the past few days, American and Jordanian planes flying over the Gaza Strip, dropping food from parachutes into Gaza. And now there's going to be this maritime solution, a port to be established. And so, the Biden administration is admitting that it's much more efficient and cost effective to have those land crossings open up. But so far, the Biden administration has not, despite this huge amount of pressure, been able to convince Israel to do that. Bianna.",

If you look what happened in Ukraine for the last couple of months and weeks, let's take for example the seaport Odesa, which is being attacked almost every day by the dozens of drones. They are trying to block our infrastructure, to block the economy, but they are killing the civilians. Just a couple of days ago, 12 innocent civilians were killed and five kids, small kids, were killed. If you take the eastern border, eastern front line, so they have huge supremacy in the air. They are bombing the cities. And dozens of our military guys every day are paying their lives. So, we believe these are the strongest arguments. The lives of those people are paying that for the democracy and the values to convince the House today.",

Last year you had Ukraine's ambassador to the United States there as a guest of the First Ladies. If I could get you to respond to what seemed to be an unfortunate mishap from the White House, inviting both the First Lady of Ukraine and the widow of Alexei Navalny, equally important figures, but I know that there are some background and some, for lack of a better word, tension between the two. Both declined the invitation. If you could, A, respond to the reason. Is it because the First Lady didn't want to be seen with Yulia Navalnaya? And if not, do you think that that misses an opportunity to show to the world, to the United States in particular, a figurehead sitting there with the First Lady that the President could call out and address?",
