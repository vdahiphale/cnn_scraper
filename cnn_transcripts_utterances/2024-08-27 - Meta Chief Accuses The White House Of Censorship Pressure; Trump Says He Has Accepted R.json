On one hand, tech companies often reevaluate their content moderation practices ahead of elections and we could look at this as Mark Zuckerberg acknowledging where the company may have gone too far but in the past. Of course, he says that Meta felt pressured by the White House when it comes to these COVID claims, but ultimately the decision was still down to the company. And so we could see this as him sort of saying, you know, we are not going to behave the same way when it comes to future requests from the White House, because this comes in the context of the Supreme Court ruling that says the White House can still flag concerns, harmful content to these social media companies and make recommendations about it, but it is still really is up to the companies. However, I do think that the timing and the way they have communicated this information is really interesting. It plays directly into the hands of Republicans in this narrative that they have been presenting about the Big Tech companies censoring conservative voices. You see House Republicans already celebrating this letter as an example of the fact that the Biden- Harris administration was forcing tech companies to censor conservative voices, which is not exactly what this letter says, but --",

ROGER MCNAMEE, AUTHOR OF \"ZUCKED: WAKING UP TO THE FACEBOOK CATASTROPHE\": Yes. Richard, the whole notion that we are talking about a freedom of speech issue is just complete nonsense. Since 2016, internet platforms have consistently been factors for disinformation. They have amplified it and they have done so consistently in a way that has in fact, globally benefited the extreme right at the expense of all other voices. In Facebook's case, they have particularly been damaging not just to democracy, but also to public health through the amplification of COVID disinformation, and also public safety by harming young children. And so the notion that Zuckerberg has a leg to stand on here is just completely ridiculous, and I would argue that all he is trying to do in this letter is two things.

It has a duty toprotect democracy and public health and those are not topics that should be controversial at all. But the second part of the problem is that these companies have operated without any form of government regulation. They've been totally self- regulating and the consequence of that has been huge damage to democracy, the undermining of the response to COVID, and a lot of extreme harm to young children. And I look at this and I think the federal trade commission has the right idea. In their case against Instagram, which is part of Meta, they are arguing that there should be no collection of data on minors and no monetization of data on minors. I think that's the correct thing, which is the underlying problem is that these products are architected and the companies have cultures that guarantee bad outcomes and there is no regulation to prevent that from happening.",

Jack Smith now slimmed down the allegations against Mr. Trump. It follows the Supreme Court's ruling that gave broad immunity to presidents. In other words, rather than throw the whole thing out, Jack Smith has basically gone back to, taking the Supreme Court ruling, worked out which bits do not flow directly if you will from Mr. Trump's actions as president and has now reformulated that indictment, we will see if that will fly with the various judges and the courts. Meanwhile, Donald Trump says he has reached an agreement to participate in a presidential debate with Vice President Harris on September the 10th. According to those who know about this matter, the ABC debate rules will largely be the same as they were for the debate here on CNN. The microphones will remain muted when it is the other candidate's turn to speak. Donald Trump has added former electron rival and prominent vaccine skeptic, Robert Kennedy to his transition team despite the fact he doesn't belong to the former president's Republican Party. Kristen Holmes joins me from Washington. Let's do this bit by bit, if we may. This idea that -- well, they have all agreed, we are off to the races now, September the 10th.

That was the rule during the CNN debate with Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, and the Harris team said that that shouldn't apply to them as well. New candidate, new rules. They did not want those mics muted. However, Donald Trump's team said that they had agreed to that original debate rules with president Joe Biden, now, Kamala Harris and they wanted them muted. Now it appears and this is based on sources outside of the campaign as well as Donald Trump's Truth Social post that they have come to an agreement and those original rules will stick as they move forward. That also means no studio audience, no crib notes. But again, the big part here was those muted mics. Of course the question is, what happens next? We find out how they're preparing for the debates and then we see whether or not they actually show up on that stage on September 10th. We have no reason to believe that they are not going to show up on that stage for any reason.

His family had been waiting 326 days to receive the news they did today, but there are still 108 hostages whose families are still waiting. SCIUTTO (voice over): Israeli officials declined to release further details for fear of impacting the safety of other hostages, believed held nearby, but two officials tell CNN that the IDF found Alkadi alone without his captors. Alkadi, a 52-year-old Arab Bedouin and father of 11 was working in security at a kibbutz in Southern Israel when Hamas fighters abducted him on October 7th. He was among several non-Jewish hostages held by Hamas. His freedom is a rare moment of relief for hostage families in Israel.

A negotiated deal is the only way forward.\" (END VIDEOTAPE) SCIUTTO (on camera): In the last hour, I spoke to a friend of Alkadi who has spoken to him, saw him since his release, said that he is in good spirits.

The users, the people who are listening, don't love that. So what instead has happened is we've seen this massive shift from companies owning podcast rights exclusively to instead owning the rights just to distribute and monetize them exclusively. Essentially, they're saying we know that Travis and Jason Kelce's \"New Heights\" podcast is massive. And the way that we're going to get a return is taking a cut of the sales. That's a different strategy than we saw in previous years. Now, will that cut of sales add up over the three-year deal to $100 million? Not quite sure but even if it doesn't, Richard, what Wondery is doing is it's establishing credibility in the space of selling podcasts so that it can continue to build the business in sort of the podcasts and audio ad tech and distribution space, not necessarily just reporting it to itself exclusively.",
