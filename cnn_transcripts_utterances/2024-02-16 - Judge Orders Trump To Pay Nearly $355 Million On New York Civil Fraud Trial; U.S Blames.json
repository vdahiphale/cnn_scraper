And everyday Americans cannot lie to a bank about how much money they have in order to get a mortgage to buy a home or a loan to keep their business afloat or to send their child to college. And if they did, our government would throw the book at them.I want to thank the entire incredible and hardworking team in my office that tried this case, because the scale and the scope of Donald Trump's fraud is staggering, and so too is his ego and his belief that the rules do not apply to him. Today, we are holding Donald Trump accountable. We are holding him accountable for lying, cheating, and a lack of contrition and for flouting the rules that all of us must play by. Because there cannot be different rules for different people in this country and former presidents are no exception. This decision is a massive victory for every American who believes in that simple but fundamental pillar of our democracy that the rule of law applies to all of us equally, fairly, and justly.

So, a significant blow just in terms of the company, but also to their wallet. Now, the judge did step back from an earlier ruling where he said that he was going to cancel the business certificates of the Trump Organization. No one really understood exactly what that would play out and look like, but they knew it was potentially devastating. Judge walking the back saying he was going to have the monitor continue in place, and then also add an independent compliance consultant. He said that would make the canceling of those certificates unnecessary, but obviously a significant ruling here. And the judge really focusing in on Trump's lack of admitting any wrongdoing, either during the trial or to any of the issues that the Trump Organization has faced over the years. He wrote, Judge Arthur Engoron, in the scathing opinion, they are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money. The documents prove this over and over again. This is a venal sin, not a mortal sin. Defendants did not commit murder or arson. They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff, yet defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways. Instead, they adopt a see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil posture that the evidence belies. And you'll remember Donald Trump, Eric Trump, and Don Jr. all took the stand and testified in this case, the judge rejecting their testimony and rejecting the testimony of the expert witnesses they put on in this case. Significant though ruling against the Trump Organization and it's going to significantly shake up how they do business and how Donald Trump will come up the money to pay this bill. Brianna?",

And then, let's see, in the -- so she -- sorry, she began the investigation in 2019 before Biden and she filed the lawsuit that led to this judgment in 2022. That was before Donald Trump even launched his campaign for the 2024 election. So, not only is there no evidence, Brianna, the timeline makes no sense, whatsoever. Now, he repeatedly accused Judge Engoron of being corrupt and crooked, a serious charge against a judge, zero basis for that, whatsoever. Rather, he is a judge who came to a conclusion that Trump didn't like. Trump also claimed that Engoron ruled against him, he said, before even getting the case, didn't even know what he was ruling on. Now, it is true that Engoron found Trump liable for fraud before the trial began, which was a surprise to some people, but it wasn't before he got the case. Rather, he had received numerous written filings from both sides and came out with a detailed judgment about why he didn't have to wait for a trial to find Trump liable for fraud.

He actually quoted the famous Justice Potter statement from the Supreme Court on obscenity, saying kind of -- it's you know it when you see it. So, materiality is kind of you know it when you see it, even if you can't pinpoint an amount of difference in valuation that is material or not.So, I think that with some of that wiggle room there in the numbers, you may see the appellate court finding some places where they cut down the judgment award.",

So, in order to come up with the money, he might, I think, have to sell some of his properties. I don't know if he has enough liquid cash in order to cover it, you know, and I think as the others were saying, this is just a significant sum of money. And one of the other really important aspects of the ruling is that monitor. It's important because, first of all, that is one thing. The other things might be stayed, the other rulings might be stayed pending appeal, but that monitor is there right now and will remain there, and the second monitor, making sure that the compliance is in order, will also be there, and that's a blow not only to his pocketbook, but also to his sense of control and ability to control his company.",

And Trump repeatedly attacked the credibility of Michael Cohen, who was one of the state's star witnesses in this case. He was pled guilty to lying to Congress, by the way, but the judge had a very different reaction. Michael Cohen, the judge wrote, told the truth. The court found his testimony credible based on the relaxed manner in which he testified, the general plausibility of his statements, and, most importantly, the way his testimony was corroborated by other trial evidence. I wonder what you think of that, but also the fact that Michael Cohen is going to factor large in another case, which is the criminal hush money case in New York that begins next month.

They're going to see how his demeanor is, whether he's truthful, and that's the whole purpose of a jury system. And don't forget, in that case, the jury selection is actually picked by Donald Trump himself and the prosecutor. So, he's going to be judged by jurors that he picks.

And, in fact, he seems to be likely to be the Republican nominee.Now, the one thing about these various legal cases, and it's not just this one, but it is the several different trials that he's facing coming up, is that there are a lot of questions about what that means in a general election. What does that mean for independents, people who aren't necessarily going to back Donald Trump no matter what? He's trying to court different voters, and instead, he has all of these different legal issues looming over his head. The other part of this is fundraising. Just a reminder, Donald Trump has paid a majority of his legal bills out of a leadership PAC. That is a specific PAC. He spent more than $50 million on legal fees last year. Now, talking to campaign finance experts, they say that he could dip into that PAC to pay some of these bills, but that would be kind of hard since they ended the year after spending $50 million with just $5 million in the bank, coming nowhere close to what he owes in these various legal cases.",

And that was the time when Putin started to notice him, started to pay attention to him and eventually deciding that this is a person that wants to remove him from power and has become a threat and obviously decided to kill him first through poisoning attempts and then by eventually effectively signing his death warrant once Navalny returned and locked him up in prison that eventually killed him.",

And, unfortunately, he may be right, that the reality is that he's eliminated all opposition within Russia. Not only is the result of the election not endowed, but he is shooting for a very high percentage of the turnout and a high percentage of the vote for him, probably in the high 60s, if not 70 percent, to show the world that he's still in charge, that the Russians are still choosing him. Even if he has to rig that election to some extent, he probably could win it outright, but at a much lower number.
