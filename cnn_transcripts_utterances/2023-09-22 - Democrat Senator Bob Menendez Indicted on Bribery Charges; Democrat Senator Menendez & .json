Its Kevin McCarthy sense lawmakers home without a deal with prospects of a government shutdown growing by the hour. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash; let's go behind the headlines in Inside Politics. Up first, a stunning and diamond filed against a sitting United States senator last out of the Southern District of New York unveiled bribery charges against Bob Menendez. Menendez chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Prosecutors say he used that influence for the benefit of a foreign power, passing sensitive info, turning the screws on federal officials and even intervening in interrupting a criminal investigation, the alleged pay off cash and lots of it gold bars, ornate furniture and a luxury car. Menendez prosecutors they didn't even really bother to hide it. Federal agents found all of it, just look right here in his house. Now CNN's Kara Scannell who was in the press conference just moments ago with the prosecutors laid out the case joins me now. Kara, what are you learning?",

Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. STTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: The senator and his wife accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of bribes in exchange for Senator Menendez using his power and influence to protect and to enrich those businessmen and to benefit the government of Egypt. The indictment alleges that Hana -- and Davies provided bribes in the form of cash, gold, home mortgage payments, a low show or no show job for Nadine Menendez, or Mercedes Benz and other things of value to the senator and his wife.

Now, the U.S. Attorney said that this investigation is very much ongoing. We've gotten a statement from Menendez in which he essentially is saying that prosecutors are trying to criminalize his normal congressional work. He says for years forces behind the scenes have repeatedly attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave. Since this investigation was leaked nearly a year ago, there has been an active smear campaign of anonymous sources and innuendos to create an air of impropriety where none exists. And Menendez do remember was previously indicted on bribery charges went to trial, there was a mistrial. The judge threw out some of the case and the prosecutors decided not to retry him.

Among the defendants here, Menendez is why first and foremost dealing with all of these other defendants, talking about what Menendez was saying. There were meetings between and among all of these people. The fingerprint of one of the co-defendants was found on an envelope containing some of the cash that was found in the house. I mean, it doesn't get any more textbook than this as far as the scheme that was perpetrated and the evidence they've collected.

Just to give folks a sense of what Ford has put on the table recently, they're going to reinstate cost of living adjustments that workers lost in 2009. Increased profit sharing, getting temporary workers to become permanent workers in just 90 days instead of the years that it takes right now and job security. If a worker is laid off by Ford, they'll have income and benefits for two years.

We know that the last public offers from these three companies have been 20 percent in wage increases over four years. Manu from the very beginning, the union has been looking for a 40 percent wage increase. And this shutdown of all parts and distribution facilities by GM and Stellantis is going to have impact on new cars. It's going to have an impact on folks trying to get new parts.
