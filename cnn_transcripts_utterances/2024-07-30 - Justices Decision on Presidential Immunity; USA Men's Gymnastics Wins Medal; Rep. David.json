In a new exclusive CNN report, sources familiar with the deliberations tell Joan Biskupic, there was an immediate 6-3 conservative majority after oral arguments in favor largely of Donald Trump's immunity claims. Chief Justice John Roberts reportedly made no effort to sway the three liberal justices to the majority to try and come to a more unified decision.CNN chief Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic writes, quote, \"all told, Roberts appears to have reached a turning point. His vision for the high court became more aggressive, and he has perhaps shed the aura of ineffectualness that permeated some public commentary in recent years.\" My panel is back. I just wonder, let's set aside partisanship for a moment and I want to ask you, David and Kate, on this. Wouldn't it have been better for the court and the country had there been a more unified decision on this? Find some agreement so it wasn't seen as so purely partisan.",

And I think the American people recognize that too. I don't think the solving problem - the way to solve this problem is to go as far as President Biden is, which is term limits in expanding the court. I don't think that's the solution at all.

One, when you have a counter-sniper agency, you have people on the ground, also an intelligence group for the Secret Service. On Friday they should have had a complete walk through with all the local agents that they had involved and know where everybody is supposed to be to a tee. And the only thing that can really explain that 80 plus second delay in the sniper taking action was the fact that he didn't know if that was friend or foe on another roof. That - that cannot happen. And so it'll be interesting to see what happened on Friday, who was there, how it was laid out, and why this occurred on Saturday. As to how the suspect got the gun. It is apparent that he got it from - in a legal weapon that he received from his father. So, you know, the gun aspect of it, while sickening, is also an important part of the investigation. I think more is complete in after action to figure out what happened and why it - how it should never happen again. And that's going to concern what kind of training these folks got.

Of course, Donald Trump emerged from that primary. You said there - there were a lot of other good quality candidates out there. And I wonder, do you believe that - here we are, 98 days from the election, that Donald Trump is the strongest candidate, the best candidate for the Republican Party in this election?",

RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I am hopeful because of the big bipartisan majority that we have today for this bill. It is really just about empowering young people and parents to take back control over their lives online, to make choices that will enable them to disconnect from the evil that has been driven at them by social media. SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN): Once the Senate formally passes KOSA, our work is not done. We must ensure that the House quickly passes this bill and sends it to the president's desk. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCIUTTO: Democrats and Republicans united on this. I mean this is, back to the panel here now, a bipartisan issue. It's become quite a vocal one.",
