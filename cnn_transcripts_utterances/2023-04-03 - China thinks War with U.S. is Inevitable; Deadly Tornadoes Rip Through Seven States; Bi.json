And it's something that the chairman has been saying, essentially that China believes, according to the U.S. intelligence, that war with the United States is going to be, quote, inevitable. And that is because, again, according to Chairman Milley, there is a sense in the Chinese government that the Chinese president wants their military to be able to take over the island of Taiwan by the year 2027. And so what Milley believes and what the U.S. military tends to believe is that that is going to potentially take place, that the Chinese are going to try to absorb Taiwan militarily here.So what Milley has been saying is that the U.S. needs to prepare Taiwan for that possibility, right? And he added in those remarks that he believes the U.S. actually needs to speed up its shipment of weapons and arms to Taiwan in order to prepare them for that possibility. But, again, he is saying all of this as a hypothetical. He believes it is important to get Taiwan ready for this possibility, but that he does not necessarily believe it is inevitable. However, as the U.S. military has said repeatedly, and as Biden has said, the U.S., of course, is prepared to come to Taiwan's defense if China does try to make a move on it, Kaitlan.",
