And he's making this argument and he's giving a series of reasons for this.And, one, he had this lengthy post on Truth Social earlier today announcing that there would not be a third debate. He was criticizing Harris with a message that actually a lot of his allies thought he didn't deploy nearly enough in that debate this week on Tuesday night, which was essentially arguing that if she has all of these policies and these plans that she's running on, why not put them in place in the last three and a half years that she's been in office. That wasn't really something you heard Donald Trump emphasize until his closing argument in the debate, something that people I spoke to thought was far too late in that 90-minute debate that they had on stage. But Trump was just in Arizona, obviously a crucial state that he needs to win in this election. And this is what he told his supporters about why he is not going to do another debate with Vice President Harris.

Now, he is saying it is going to only be this one.And, Wolf, I'll tell you, I've been doing reporting on this and essentially, immediately after he got off stage in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, he started quizzing people about how he had done. A lot of them told him to his face that he had done a great job against her. Privately, they were not saying that. They were actually disappointed that he wasn't able to execute the case better against her, that he was on defense the entire time and that he took the bait moment after moment in a way that was clearly designed and telegraphed by the Harris campaign leading up to that, that they were going to try to get under his skin and then weren't successful at doing so.",

He'll likely say that he wants it to be on a favorable network. He'll likely ask for it to be certain moderators. But I could see him thinking if things get a little bit tighter in the final eight-week stretch, he might need a big moment to remain competitive against her.So, I wouldn't rule out that there will be another one. And I think it's incredibly smart politics that the vice president got ahead and was the one to first call for the second debate. It puts Trump on the defensive, a place he doesn't like to be.

No, it's not a function of being scared, it's a function of what are our priorities towards the end of the election. Our goal is to talk to as many voters as possible, and our goal is to paint Kamala Harris as a liberal. And I think we have better opportunities doing it through one-on-one interviews, through our rallies, through going into these states and having this impact than go in on a debate that's going to sort of stack the deck against President Trump, not do the proper fact-check against Harris, and sort of delve into that environment. Listen, our goal at this debate was to continue to paint Kamala Harris as a radical liberal, and that's what we did. She didn't respond to any of the accusations we made, and they're going to stick. And whether she had a strong performance or not, we feel we hit our goal of continue to paint this picture that she's radically to the left outside the American mainstream, which has been reflective in the CNN poll and which has been reflected in The New York Times poll.

If she can play to the center, talk about the economy, talk about rebuilding the middle class, that works.I actually agree though, abortion is an animating issue. We've seen red states, deep red Ohio, Kentucky, Kansas, where there have been ballot initiatives or constitutional amendments around abortion, and even Republicans have turned out to vote for some access.

Then he repeats it, then it becomes even more of a story, then it becomes a multiday news cycle that ultimately may hurt his campaign all because of the people that he chooses to either listen to on television, or in this case, hang out with on his airplane.",
