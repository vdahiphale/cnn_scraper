      "sentences": "Not good. And moreover, what's interesting is the manner in which the exchange of favors, if you want to call them that, plays out as often through his wife, the way the indictment is structured. There are a number of statements and communications made between Senator Menendez and his wife and alleged -- allegedly between the senator and his wife and some of the other people who were charged that that led to these actions that the prosecutors are saying that Senator Menendez engaged in.But it's incredibly serious when you are speaking of nonpublic information being provided to foreign actors. A point I noted in our earlier segment was you know the fact that at least one of these conversations that they recount is a phone call that happens to -- you know, to officials, I believe. It might have even been Egyptian officials directly outside of the presence of Senator Menendez and staff. Now, look. As a former Senate staffer, I can tell you. You can't always control what the boss is doing. Sometimes he'll pick up the phone and place phone calls and so on. This goes beyond that when you're talking about, number one, the seriousness of it, and number two, the allegation that he was being directed to do so or at least being compensated or reimbursed for his doing so. It -- that really jumped out to me and is itself something that prosecutors I'm certain would hammer in front of the jury as very suspicious conduct from someone, as you said Kate, has an official position and has people around him that ought to be protect -- or you know, probably were attempting to protect him from engaging in conduct like this.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, you know, one of the things that I think stood out in part of this indictment and what stands out from previous Bob Menendez investigations is this allegation that he was so involved in trying to help the government of Egypt, trying to get past their issues -- human rights issues, which was preventing some of the military aid. Millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that were being hung up because of human rights issues in Egypt.And according to prosecutors -- here's a part that I think, really kind of encapsulates what prosecutors are going after here. They're say -- they say that at one point, Nadine, his wife, passes on a request for the Senator to edit a letter that was going to be sent to other senators to lobby them to basically unstick some of the hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid that the Egyptian government wanted from the U.S. government. And according to prosecutors, Menendez did that. Now, look. We should just step back a little bit here. And Menendez is a guy -- is a Senator who looms large in a lot of this in New Jersey politics, obviously, but also in this relationship with the Justice Department. He's been under some kind of DOJ investigation for almost the entire time he's been in the U.S. Senate. As a matter of fact, when he ran in 2005 and he took first office in -- first took office in 2006, it was under the cloud of an investigation, which was later closed in 2011 just before his reelection. So, this is not the first time that this -- the senator has been under the scrutiny of the Justice Department. As a matter of fact, it's something that he has been -- he has complained about. He says that they're after him -- the FBI is after him. And yet, according to prosecutors, he's undaunted by the fact that he has been under a lot of scrutiny from the FBI for various alleged schemes. Again, he was elected under this cloud back in 2006 when he first took office. And it's continued -- almost continuously, I would say right after 2018, after the -- there was a hung jury in his last investigation, according to prosecutors, he begins this relationship with these businessmen in New Jersey that allegedly involved a lot of corruption, a lot of bribes, and money being passed through his wife, guys.",

I think there are people who are reading through this indictment and seeing the pictures which the prosecutors really did throw out there so everyone could see it, the gold bars, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash right there. And they see just that, and they say, well, wait a second, that's everything. I mean, if there's the gold bars in the $100,000, in cash, this must prove something.",

It is not illegal to have big stacks of even hundreds of thousands of dollars in your house. Now, it is suspicious in front of a jury. And frankly, in drug cases, you see this all the time, and narc narcotics that are said all the time where -- you know, when someone's got a big brick of cash. You know, it's not per se illegal, but it's something that triggers questions in a jury.You know, to your point, John, talking about that letter that Senator Menendez wrote that Evan was referring to, a few moments ago, another fact is that he uses his personal e-mail account to transact information about this letter. He has official channels by which he can engage with staff, engage with people outside of Congress, but for whatever reason, chose to use personal e-mail addresses for this back and forth, which again, is another instance of at least questions of a guilty conscience a guilty mind and probably could help to establish that there was some unlawful exchange happening. But you know to the broader point, and this is how conspiracies are built -- this is how circumstantial evidence in cases built on circumstantial evidence are built, individual things may not themselves be illegal but when you put them together -- you know, a sausage might itself taste good, but you put it with other ingredients and it becomes gumbo in a big pot. You need all these things together to establish the conspiracy to establish the chain of events, and each of them themselves does sort of like I said, there's no better way to put it, just look bad for the Senator.",

Vanessa?VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so 38 different facilities, just at GM and Stellantis across 28 -- excuse me, 20 states hitting the picket lines in just moments. This is obviously an escalation of the strike. However, notably, Ford is not involved in this portion of the targeted strike.

So, you're adding to the folks on the picket line, but not the huge escalation that we saw in the beginning in terms of how many folks were on the picket line.So, we know that from Shawn Fain who spoke moments ago that they're in a pretty good place with Ford. They feel like there's been substantial progress. That's why you're not seeing additional plants from Ford added to this targeted strike. But in terms of what Ford is offering, they are reinstating COLA, cost of living adjustments, that were taken away in 2009. Many people thought that they couldn't get there. They're getting that back from Ford. You're also seeing job security, the right to strike if there's any plant closures. And if there are layoffs, folks can receive up to two years of income and health care. And also, we're seeing profit sharing increase across the company and this transition from temporary employees to full-time employees. That will hopefully get those temporary workers' wages up. That's a lot of what the union has been asking for. Notably, we did not hear today at all about wages, though. If you remember, we were reporting that all the companies had offered 20 percent of wage increases, the union was asking for 40 percent, that was left out of today's announcement by Shawn Fain. And we heard from Fain and Ford, who said that there's still a large gap on those economic issues. Despite these really important things that the Union were able to get from Ford, the economic issues, the wages, not quite there yet.",
