This is after the Senate gave it the green light late last night in a 79 to 18 vote.The big winner here, U.S. allies, and congressional bipartisanship, because after, what was it, eight months of stalling by far right House Republicans, other Republicans and Democrats came together to get past this. There's a little something extra in this package as well. Included is the forced sale of TikTok. The concern is U.S. national security. And when the bill is signed, that is going to trigger the clock on TikTok's China-based parent company. They then have nine months to sell or have the app banned from American app stores.

      "sentences": "Yes. So right now, the last of protesters that we saw dissipated within the last few hours at this point, but that difference has been those protesters were outside the campus where we are versus the encampment-led protest that is happening on campus grounds as well.This is now the eighth day we have seen that encampment. And as you mentioned, the Columbia University president, Minouche Shafik, set a midnight deadline for an agreement to be reached on clearing these encampments. That midnight deadline came and went. And then, hours later, we got an update from a university spokesperson that actually conversations are now progressing, and based on those constructive talks, they are extending talks for another 48 hours. Now, some of those tent poles of negotiation that they say they've made progress on, dismantling and removing a significant number of tents, ensuring that those not affiliated with Columbia University leave the encampment, and taking steps to make sure the encampment is welcome to all and prohibiting discriminatory or harassing language. Obviously, a lot of the tension that has been there at the core of this protest, who they say they are for solely pushing Columbia University to divest from corporations, they say, support Israeli apartheid and genocide. But, of course, it has created an atmosphere of tension for some on campus. It prompted the school to move to hybrid learning because, as they said, it out of an abundance of caution and for safety being a priority. And some Jewish students we have spoken to say they felt intimidated by the displays on campus, while not all Jewish students have felt that way at this point. And it highlights sort of the back and forth that we have seen over how the university wants to handle this, because last week was when they sent in the New York Police Department to clear out this encampment, and it only seemed to inflame some of these protesters and they revived these encampments even more so. And now here we are a week later, and as you mentioned, Speaker Johnson has accepted this campus later today.",

He gave an interview to our CNN-affiliate WPVI in Philadelphia on a number of topics, but he used that time to rail again against one of the witnesses in this case, Michael Cohen, which he has been doing several times. But now it's probably something else that the court is going to consider. Take a listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michael Cohen is a convicted liar and he's got no credibility whatsoever.

And they even said they were going to file another motion about what he had said after court the other day regarding Michael Cohen. So, I imagine another motion is going to be filed regarding this interview. So, we'll see how that all plays out. We do not know yet when this judge is going to decide about this gag order.But in the meantime, as you said, a main witness, David Pecker, is back on the stand tomorrow. And a lot was covered yesterday. He sort of set the scene, like you said, about this catch and kill scheme, which is at the heart of the prosecution's case. And it all started with that Trump Tower meeting between him, Michael Cohen and Donald Trump, essentially David Pecker saying he was going to be the eyes and the ears of Trump's 2016 campaign, saying that if he heard any bad stories about Donald Trump, then he would, quote, notify Michael Cohen, and then he would be able to have them kill in another magazine or have them not be published or somebody would have to purchase them. Prosecutors asked him purchase the negative stories about Mr. Trump so that they would not get published, you mean? And he responded that they would not get published, yes. So, it really gives this foundation of how this whole scheme work, which is important, John, of course, because, yes, there are the charges for, you know, falsifying documents. But prosecutors are trying to make that link to the felony, which is essentially that they did that to conceal another crime. And so this testimony is very important for the jurors to hear. Now, Pecker was on the stand when court adjourned yesterday. It continues tomorrow with him back on the stand. And he was just getting into some spicy testimony, which involved the story of Karen McDougal, which is another Playboy playmate who alleged an affair with Michael Cohen in 2016. And really, he was just getting started about how he helped allegedly Donald Trump conceal that story from the public eye.",
