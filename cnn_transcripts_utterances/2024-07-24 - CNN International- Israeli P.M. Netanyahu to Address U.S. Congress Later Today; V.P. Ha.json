CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from London.So Nada, what can you tell us about the upcoming speech and what Netanyahu here expects to achieve? NADA BASHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, Omar, there is growing pressure from representatives and family members of those hostages still held captive by Hamas in Gaza for Prime Minister Netanyahu to strike a deal. They want that to be the focus of his address to Congress. In fact, we've heard from the Hostages Families Forum, which has said they want to see Netanyahu opening his address by saying there is a deal, and we have heard some optimistic notes from the Israeli prime minister. We've even heard some signs of optimism from U.S. officials as well. It's understood that there is a clear framework on the deal that they are just hammering out those final details and technicalities. But as you mentioned, there is growing criticism of the Israeli prime minister back home in Israel and from the family members and representatives of those hostages still held captive, saying that he should be at home focusing on the return of those hostages, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, securing that ceasefire agreement. Now of course, all eyes will be on his address. As you mentioned, we are already seeing backlash in Washington, D.C., not only members of the Democratic Party now choosing to boycott, to not attend the Congressional address by the Israeli prime minister, but we are also seeing protests as well. Of course, we saw protests yesterday, members of the Jewish Voice for Peace movement occupying -- staging a sit-in in Congressional building. We've also seen, of course, other protests taking place across the country and are expecting to see more today. But of course, that growing backlash is not only centered in Israel and in Washington, it is global backlash. And of course, the U.S. has been vocal in pushing the Israeli government for a ceasefire deal to be struck. Now, at this stage, we've heard from President Biden speaking on Monday, he believes that the parties involved in this negotiation are in his words, on the verge of coming to some sort of agreement. The State Department has said that the gap separating those two is narrowing, that there are still some issues which remain, but of course, pressure is mounting, and of course, the situation in Gaza is only worsening as well. If a deal isn't struck soon, we will be entering ten months of this war. That is ten months with hostages still held captive in Hamas, that is ten months with civilians in Gaza being killed on a daily basis. That death toll now topping 39,000. The U.N. warning that famine is spreading throughout the Gaza Strip and we are seeing the humanitarian situation worsen with now diseases spreading rapidly across the Gaza Strip. We are seeing continued airstrikes in southern Gaza as well. Of course, deadly strikes in Khan Younis, where hundreds, thousands even -- civilians have been ordered to evacuate once again. So, it is a deteriorating situation. We are seeing mounting pressure from U.S. officials. Many have been careful to clarify that the U.S. maintains its strong relationship with Israel, that Israel continues to be one of the United States closest and perhaps most important allies in the Middle East. [08:05:00] But again, we have seen those tensions mounting, particularly between President Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They are expected to meet, of course, on Thursday, Netanyahu now also expected to meet with Donald Trump former U.S. president and of course, also with Kamala Harris, so important meetings taking place. But all eyes will be on that Congressional address later today, expectations around what he might say and of course, the reaction crucially from the Democrats as well.",

Surely, Nada Bashir, thank you so much for the reporting.Now, the head of the opposition Labor Party in Israel is blasting the trip. Yair Golan posting on X saying, \"Netanyahu went to the U.S. for an extravagant show in the middle of the war without a deal to return hostages.\" I want to bring in CNN Global Affairs Analyst, Mark Esper. He was U.S. defense secretary under President Trump. Good to see you. Thanks for being here. Now, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken says they are inside the 10- yard line, driving toward the goal line in getting a ceasefire. That's his metaphor, not mine. But in getting a ceasefire and hostage agreement that would produce a ceasefire, how optimistic are you of a deal getting done at this stage? And what do you make of Netanyahu appearing before Congress without a finalized deal?",

Well, I was actually with Jake Sullivan, Antony Blinken this past weekend in Aspen and we talked about this, and both believe -- are confident that were within the 10-yard line, as you said, but they also note that often those last 10 yards are the most difficult. Look, I would say in some ways, we've been here before. There have been numerous proposals on the table for Hamas. At the last minute, they've raised the ante with asking for adjustments and amendments and so forth.So we'll see, I mean there is hope that there will be some type of agreement, but my view has been that Hamas is not going to be interested in any deal that does not call for a complete ceasefire and the removal of all Israeli troops from Gaza. And I see the Israeli government, Netanyahu unwilling to go there yet. If you look, the polling shows that a majority of Israelis want to see no more Hamas in Gaza and they are very concerned about what might happen if Hamas is not dismantled. So, I think they are probably further apart than we would like, but we'll see what happens in the coming days.",

And obviously, look, Netanyahu's speech and visit, it's not coming in a vacuum here, especially politically. For him, there have been protests back in Israel at home. There have been fragmented sort of perceptions in the United States politically over how to receive his visit. And I'm curious just from a political standpoint, how sustainable is this for Netanyahu when many believe that he isn't doing enough on the hostage front to bring some of those folks home? ESPERBut look, that said, Netanyahu faces some difficult challenges back home. He's wildly unpopular. But there are two threads among the Israeli population, one, they want the hostages returned rightly so. That is probably first and foremost. But secondly, they want an end to Hamas rule and end to Hamas to whatever -- however, we define that. And in many ways, those two threads are counter to what a ceasefire might aim to propose. So there is division there and this will take time. At the same time, Hamas is under increasing pressure, not just military pressure, but an increasing number of Palestinians are dissatisfied with how Hamas has conducted this conflict. So, that is another factor at play as well.",

He's set to deliver this speech in the Oval Office, a rare place for President Biden -- President Biden and other presidents to speak to the country. It will actually be the second time this month that he is doing so. Earlier, he had spoken about -- from the Oval Office about the assassination attempt against Donald Trump. For President Biden, aides say this will really be an opportunity for him to offer a more fulsome explanation for his decision to exit this race. But also, it'll give him a chance to lay out what he wants to accomplish in the coming months. Of course, President Biden is now heading into a lame duck presidency, a period of time where it is often difficult for presidents to get much done, much crossed over the legislative line. But President Biden has insisted that he will remain fully engaged at the White House. He still believes that there is work that they can do when it pertains to lowering the cost of childcare and elder care, trying to stop the proliferation of guns, also addressing climate change issues. These are all things that Biden could really lean into there. And then there is also the component of Biden insisting he will be out on the trail, campaigning for Kamala Harris, to try to get her elected in November. Advisers to Harris and Biden have already committed to holding joint events for them in the summer and fall; those plans are still coming into shape. But really for Biden, there is --as he is trying to further cement his legacy, of course, he wants to see his own vice president succeed in this Democratic contest as she prepares to face off against Donald Trump. So really, this will give Americans a more fulsome opportunity to hear from President Biden himself about his decision to exit this race, a very personal decision for he and his family, as he has said, that he did so in order for to protect the interest and in the interests of Americans and democracy as well.",

Now look, when Donald Trump steps back onto the campaign trail, it will be an entirely different race and an entirely different political landscape and one that seems it's destined to have him face off against Kamala Harris in the fall. And I can tell you, Omar, from my conversations with Trump's advisers, they are very closely watching what Arlette just laid out, which is the new surge in Democratic donations as well as enthusiasm in recent days.Now, this rally tonight will be the first Donald Trump holds since Biden stepped aside and ended his campaign over the weekend. Now, to discuss some of those lines of attack, I do want you to listen to what he told reporters yesterday. He kind of test drove some of those during a call with them and I should note that this is the first call of its kind that he has held in this election cycle. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Kamala Harris was appointed border czar, as you know, in March of 2021. And since that time, millions and millions of illegal aliens have invaded our country. And as weak on crime prosecutor in sanctuary jurisdiction of San Francisco, Kamala refused to seek the death penalty against anybody. I agreed to debate with Joe Biden, but I want to debate her and she'll be no different because they have the same policies. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One is a quick fact check, Biden never appointed Kamala Harris to be his \"border czar.\" He did task her with handling diplomatic relations and long-term relations with Central America, but the overall responsibility for the border has always been on the Department of Homeland Security. And then I also just want to point out that the end there, him talking about wanting to still debate Kamala Harris is very interesting to note, I think we should bookmark that and see if that actually ends up coming to fruition.I know there are conversations behind the scenes about whether or not that is a good opportunity for Donald Trump. But look, Trump's goal all is to really try and define Harris right now before what they think will be the entire Democratic machine starts giving her more momentum. Even though she is the vice president, in their minds, they argue that she isn't as well known and so they are trying to race against the clock to define her in their own terms. Now, I'm also told that they do plan to use some of the same lines that they had planned on Biden, which is going against her for crime, border, immigration, economy, all of the issues were Donald Trump polls better. However, they also recognize privately that it is very unclear what this is going to look like. They have spent an entire a year-plus sharpening their attacks, spending millions of dollars on data and modeling, all to go after Joe Biden, an unpopular 81-year- old. And so this is -- this new dynamic, obviously, throws a lot of uncertainty for their own campaign as well.",

A deluge of misinformation has been put out there in the past few days from crazy rumors, all the way up to doctored photos and that is where CNN's Donie O'Sullivan comes in. He's been tracking all of this and joins us now, live from New York.Hi, Donie, what have you seen? Give us a sense of how sophisticated these deepfakes and altered images are in this election cycle, maybe compared to years past? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Omar, yeah. Look, I mean, there has been such a huge explosion in how we use artificial intelligence in our lives and how available -- widely available it is online. It's really easy now to make doctored images and videos in a way that just really didn't exist in the last campaign cycle. So, we are seeing some of that. For the most part, it's still pretty crude stuff, but certainly the capability is out there. But really what we are seeing about Harris when it comes to conspiracy theories is, it's just everything. It's very clear that they're really trying to throw everything against the wall and see what sticks. Look, a lot of the folks that are pushing these conspiracy theories about Harris are hiding. They're trying to hide their racism better than others. There's even a birther (ph) conspiracy theory, a throwback to Trump and Obama where people are claiming that Harris, the current vice president, somehow isn't eligible to be president. But of course, that is false. I do want to show you one image that's been circulating, just to kind of give you a sense of what's out there. As you can see, there is a real photo there on the right which of the vice president and the second gentleman, and then the fake manipulated image on the left that shows -- that purports to show her with Jeffrey Epstein. Of course, that photo is fake. So that's the sort of thing that's going out there.

But this is not something that's exclusive just two Republicans. And I think one good example of that is the recent attempted assassination of President Trump. If you go on Twitter, if you go on Threads or the other platforms, a lot of folks who are supporting Biden or now Harris, who are Democrats, and even some people I've met at anti-Trump protests last week at the RNC, there are people sharing conspiracy theories on the left about Trump's attempted assassination, as saying that in some way, Trump tried to stage this to get a photo op. There is no evidence at all for that whatsoever, but that just kind of really I think gives you a sense where in this country, right now, people really don't know what to believe and a big part of this is because there's less trust in established mainstream media. But also, there's just so much misinformation online.

Now, as for Vice President Kamala Harris, while she is expected to meet with Mr. Netanyahu on Thursday, she will be absent from today's address. Now, her team says she has a previously scheduled event, but it is a decision being criticized by House Speaker Mike Johnson.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: It is outrageous to me and inexcusable that as the leader mentioned, that Kamala Harris is boycotting this joint session. This is an historic moment. It is an important moment for the country, for all the reasons we've said. The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated. And yet, Kamala Harris will abandon her seat. As you all know, as the vice president and as serving as the president of the Senate, she is supposed to be seated next to me at the rostrum. She will not be there because she refuses to attend. She needs to be held accountable for that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A lot of members of Congress who are going to be attending this address, including some Republicans, are going to be watching to see whether or not he has a clear plan for how to get the hostages home. That is something that I have heard from Republicans and Democrats in the days leading up to this address, they want to hear from him.I talked to yesterday to Republican Joni Ernst. She is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and she said that she needs to hear him clearly articulate a plan forward, not just to get hostages home, but also to start to bring this conflict to an end. Meanwhile, there are many Democrats who are not going to be attending this address at all. We know of at least 80 Democrats, more than that at this moment, who plan to boycott it, including Pramila Jayapal. She is the leader of the Progressive Caucus and here is what she said in a statement about her plans today. She said, instead of attending Netanyahu's address, I will attend a panel discussion led by the Center for American Progress and other organizations on the path to peace. This event will feature a Palestinian leader, a Jewish Israeli leader and a former IDF soldier, all of whom are dedicated to finding a path toward peace and security. We also heard yesterday on the Senate floor, a number of Democrats giving speeches about why they were not attending this address, including Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): It will be the first time in American history that a war criminal has been given that honor. Frankly, this invitation to Netanyahu is a disgrace and something that we will look back on with regret. I hope that for one second, the members who attend will focus just for a second on the starving children in Gaza. I hope while they applaud that they will think about the hundreds of aid workers killed, the dozens of hospitals bombed, the housing destroyed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Omar, the Republicans are really going to lean into immigration and the border when it comes to attacking Vice President Kamala Harris. It is something that they have been doing since 2021, but perhaps less so over the last year. Now, that was the year that the vice president was tapped by President Biden to tackle the root causes of migration in Central America. The reason he did that at that time was because, in 2021, there was an influx of unaccompanied migrant children and they were coming from those three countries.So, he looked to his vice president to try to help solve the issue and try to keep migrants from wanting to migrate to the U.S., instead staying at home. So the vice president over the last three years has been working, particularly with the private sector, to try to shore up investments to go to that region. And there has been some early success. When I have talked to sources both inside and outside government, they know that there are $5 billion of private sector investment that have gone to the region has helped create jobs and the federal data shows that the numbers from those three countries of migrants coming to the U.S. southern border has considerably dropped. Now, it is often too early to tell for sure what exactly causes those numbers to drop, but it certainly, according to the sources I've talked to you, has helped the situation in those countries. But that is often lost in the political attacks against the vice president because they have dubbed the border czar. Of course, she was never charged with the border exactly, but more so the broader region and it was the Department of Homeland Security, we should note, that is charged with border security. But, Republicans are going on the attack and that also includes former president Donald Trump, who in a very rare phone call with reporters yesterday, dedicated his time to attacking her and the administration's immigration policies.

MYOU CHOU CHOU, ASYLUM SEEKER (through translator): I'm still scarred by the bullying and discrimination that I experienced. It has brought me great trauma. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Fueled by anger at injustice, Myou joined now deposed leader, Aung San Suu Kyi's democracy movement at 16. Survival was a daily battle, but he left the fighting behind when the military junta repeatedly and unlawfully detained his father in his place, Myou says. He escaped in 2006. His father enlisted a broker who got Myou a passport and a one-way ticket to Japan, a destination Myou only learned about on the day he left. CHOU CHOU (through translator): I didn't even have time to say goodbye to my mother. I still can't forget that day. I've put my father through so much. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Since fleeing, Myou hasn't seen his family who are now in a refugee camp in Bangladesh. His only tie to Myanmar is through friends still fighting for democracy, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of persecution. They lamented how Myou, even after years in Japan, was still denied human rights. As one of nearly 14,000 asylum seekers currently in Japan, Myou is safe from political persecution, but assimilating into a country that's more than 98 percent ethnically Japanese has been a challenge for Myou, a reality underscored with three rejected refugee applications. But now, even safety is no longer guaranteed. He fears sudden deportation under Japan's new controversial immigration law.",
