New secret recordings from inside Fox revealing what Rudy Giuliani really thought about Dominion with the tapes. And the attorney for the woman who made those recordings is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in tonight for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, arrested. The suspect in the massive leak of classified intelligence documents is now in custody. We have video for you. You see it right here. This is the 21-year-old Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira being arrested at home in Massachusetts.

The documents included images of battlefield conditions in Ukraine, information about North Korea's ballistic missiles, the Chinese spy balloon.

Good to have all of you with us tonight. So, Colonel, if we start here as Kylie just laid out, the official job title for the suspect is cyber transport systems journeyman. Based on that that he's an IT specialist, and even what we know about his rank at this point, does it surprise you that he would have had access to these classified documents and that was able to leak them potentially over such a long span of time? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, AIR FORCE (RET.):  Erica, sadly, it doesn't surprise me at all. It leaves people, you know, the IT specialists that, you know, Kylie pointed out are -- have access to the entire networks on their bases and the key thing here, too, is that this unit, the 102nd Air Wing -- that Air Intelligence Wing -- that is an international guard unit, but it does intelligence work, and it is 24/7/365 tied into what something that's known as the distributed ground system. That distributed system is a feed from the drones and aircraft like the U2, which allows them to follow intelligence anywhere in the world. But boy and just so he would have had access to a lot of intelligence just based on the unit's mission, but also, of course, he was getting stuff from the Pentagon as well as we see in this document dump.",

He took on a role of giving them advice, sometimes castigating them and generally playing the role of an older person in their life. Of course, all of this generally is playing out online and part of his relationship with them was providing them with information that he thought they should have. He provided them with classified information first in writing and then late last year, we were told that he started to post the full images of classified documents.

Abby kept these records in the normal course of business as the de facto executive producer for Ms. Bartiromo.

And who were coercing or to give testimony that was put her in a false light and ultimately caused her to defame herself through a transcript that she wasn't allowed to review.And in any event -- she gave over those devices twice to Fox News in preparation for her deposition, and the second time she specifically -- very specifically alerted Fox News to the fact that the Otter program was on there. So when I said I want the record -- set the record straight and a lot has been said in the last few days, for instance, yesterday, Dominion's attorneys stood up in open court and stated something that I think is demonstrably false. Let me just read it to you. It's very brief. So this is the -- this is Fox's attorney, and he says. And so, Ms. Grossberg did not tell us that -- and so, Ms. Grossberg did not tell us that. Ms. Grossberg did not say that there were response -- responsive audio recordings from that relevant time period. And so that was not a thing that we knew to look for until the errata sheet came, which Mr. Grossberg provided on March the 20th. So I'll tell you why that is demonstrably false, and, frankly, it's the kind of word salad that gives lawyers a bad name. It may be technically true that Ms. Grossberg did not say to the Fox attorneys when she handed over both devices twice, in preparation for her coerced testimony, that there Otter recordings here from the relevant time period of X or Y.
