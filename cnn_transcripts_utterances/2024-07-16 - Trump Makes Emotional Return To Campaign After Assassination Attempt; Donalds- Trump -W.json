I'm Dana Bash, live from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Donald Trump was given a hero's welcome by his most ardent supporters here, just two days after surviving an assassination attempt.You can see that white bandage over Trump's right ear. A reminder of just how close he came to death, while the hall here was electric. The former president appeared subdued and even emotional as he stood with his new running mate, Ohio Senator J. D. Vance, who is now effectively the political heir to the MAGA movement. Vance spoke to Fox about what Donald Trump said when he got the call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He just said, look, I think got to go save this country. I think you're the guy who can help me in the best way. You can help me govern. You can help me win. You could help me in some of these midwestern states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and so forth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Audie Cornish, David Weigel of Semafor, Astead Herndon of The New York Times, and CNN's Kristen Holmes. Hello, happy day two of the convention to everybody.Kristen, and I know that you have been doing a lot of reporting on the kind of feeling.

When people cry, even in emotional settings.I spoke to a number of allies and supporters who that was the first time they had seen him in public since that shooting. They felt like they were looking at a different man. Obviously, all of this is with the caveat that Donald Trump could just be Donald Trump. And obviously, he is somebody who was just shot at and that is an emotional experience of whether or not this last. But I am told by a number of people around him that he seems changed in this moment that he has been talking about divine intervention. Again, this is not something that Donald Trump generally does. He's not a religious man. He's not even a spiritual man. He has been talking about constantly how he should be dead. How he is lucky to be alive.

But it's nominating a ticket that is not seen as maybe as religious as Mike Pence was.But if you listen to J. D. Vance's rhetoric, it's a piece where Republicans believe we're in a fallen world right now that the culture has declined, that gender norms have fallen apart, that people are getting sicker and less healthy because they're not getting married and they're not going to church. And this might seem like an awkward fit with Donald Trump. It's a less awkward fit with J. D. Vance. That's part of this, too. I think that's part of the same mix is that this is a president who needs to come and save, not just the country, not just the price of the grocery store, but the entire culture, which is not a role that Donald Trump had in 2016.",

D. Vance. A couple of things. First of all, just on the kind of raw numbers, Ohio. Now nobody thinks Ohio is in play at all. It is solidly Republican. Didn't used to be when I first started covering politics, but it is now. But just interesting note here. In 2022 when J. D. Vance won his one and only race. He's a very new politician. He won by six percentage point in 2020, two years earlier. Donald Trump, of course lost the presidency, won Ohio by eight points. Which leads me to the question of in the places where electorally the Trump campaign is perhaps hoping that J. D. Vance does help Ohio like pockets of the Midwest of Pennsylvania, of the state where we are right now, maybe less so but Michigan also.

This is a pic of someone who is looking ahead to continue the kind of ideology of the market movement.And I think also he's thinking about the Senate and Capitol Hill, and J. D. Vance is someone who has kind of led the undoing of kind of those norms in that place.
