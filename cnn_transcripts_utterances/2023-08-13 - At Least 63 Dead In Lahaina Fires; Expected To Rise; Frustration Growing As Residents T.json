We've also noted that three summers in a row, we start to see a surge in COVID, even though viruses are generally more prevalent in the fall than the winter.

So, it does confer some advantage and we start to see it becoming the more dominant variant in the United States and across, really, all of Europe. And so, we know it has some evolutionary advantage.

Make sure you, C, check with your physician or health care team. H, remember this is about your health. This is not a trick. Think about your health. A, always ask questions. And T, find a trusted medical resource, especially on social media and websites where people tend to follow their favorite chef or their favorite entertainer.

We're back in COVID. I mean, are you surprised by, perhaps, some of the feelings we've had as of late?DR. MORGAN: Yes, three years is a long time. And what we have to remember is the lessons learned from these long three years, especially when we're rolling out vaccines and we're rolling out information. We've got to go into the communities. Take the information to people. Remember, communication is important. That's where we saw the CDC falter. And that they had excellent scientists, excellent research, excellent data, but faltered with communication with the public. It needs to be clear and concise. We absolutely want people to make certain that they understand this is being driven by human behavior. The entire pandemic. And even this summer, what's happening? We have a heatwave. People are being driven indoors instead of being outside. If we're traveling in the summer, so we're carrying virus from one group to the next.

Take a look at a rendering of what happened.So, the plane took off from Maui and it climbed to 2,200 feet, then suddenly it plunged. 14 -- like a nosedive, 1,400 feet in 21 seconds. As you'd imagine, it really frightened passengers. There were screams heard in the cabin. Finally, reaching about 750 feet above sea level when it finally leveled off. So, they got that close to the ocean. CNN's transportation analyst and former inspector general at the U.S. Department of Transportation Mary Schiavo joining us now. That rendering is just awful to watch. And to imagine that you were a passenger -- being a passenger on that flight. Dirst off, tell me about this NTSB report that says the plunge was caused by an apparent miscommunication between the two pilots over the position of the plane's wing flaps. How did that happen?",

And so, the pilot took off, things were normal, and then as they were climbing, the air speed kept climbing more than it should. Well, that gives us an indication here in some wind shear and the weather is playing havoc on your plane.So, the pilot was concerned that the airspeed was too great for the flap setting, and they were, you know, going to go overspeed. So, he reduced the airspeed and put the nose down a little bit. But then at that point, you've got the flap setting corrected and then the plane is in a slightly nose-down attitude, and the flaps come off, so then you get into much greater speed. So, with the nose slightly down and then the flaps came off, which lets the plane go faster, it was in a dive.

It was, I think they calculated 2.77 Gs, which is almost three times your normal weight. So, it would have felt like you were three times as heavy.And that's comparable, literally, as the gentleman just said, it's comparable to a roller coaster. And it would have been quite a ride. Now, by the way, those g-forces are also something that you have to check when you land because airplanes and, you know, commercial passenger jets are only rated for certain g-forces, as are the flaps. And so, the pilot was worried about too much speed on the flaps. And they also should have checked out what the g-forces did on the plane. So, lots of things were on here. But in the end, technology, the aircraft was literally screaming at the pilots, terrain, terrain. Pull up. Pull up. Technology saved the flight. So, thank our engineers.",

ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGISTRight now, Kansas City, Omaha, these are the target points for this morning. But this is going to be multiple rounds of severe weather, potentially, for a lot of portions of the central U.S., spreading into the Ohio, Tennessee and Mississippi valley region. And that will even continue into Monday as well as most of that moisture begins to spread farther east. So, then the Ohio Valley, the areas of the mid-Atlantic, and southeast also begin to get some severe weather 24 to 48 hours from now. But for today, the main focus is going to be right here. From Amarillo over to Lexington, and then up into Des Moines. Springfield, Kansas City, the main threats will be damaging winds and the potential for large hail, but also some tornadoes are possible. Heat is the other big story, and that's really focused across the southeast, but also the Pacific Northwest. And the key point out there is that, remember, folks, not a lot of those areas have air- conditioning in their homes. So, that's going to be the bigger issue with prolonged heat. Along the Gulf Coast, the concern is not just the temperature but factoring in the humidity, that feels like temperature or the heat index, going to be pretty high. 113 for the feels like today in Corpus Christi, 111 in New Orleans, 107 for Montgomery. Then we talked about the Pacific Northwest. For a lot of these areas, it's also going to be the prolonged nature.
