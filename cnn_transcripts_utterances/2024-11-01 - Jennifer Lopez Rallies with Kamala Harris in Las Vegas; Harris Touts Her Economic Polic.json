And the reason it is because of the economic promise that President Trump brings. He's glad Kamala Harris is talking about no tax on tips. That was a policy that President Trump brought forward months before Harris decided to even talk about it or even the Biden campaign. So when we look at the issues that are going to affect the Latino community, which we know, it's going to be the economy, which we know they actually care about border security, you know, Kamala is not addressing that. And, you know, and you know J-Lo going to bring up a joke from a third party. But what J-Lo didn't bring up was the comment that Joe Biden said, you know, about, you know, Latinos, about Puerto Ricans, when he called them trash.

You have Mark Cuban, who insulted a bunch of Republican women today by saying, you know, no smart Republican women would be behind Donald Trump.

And they see President Trump as this successful entrepreneur, and they want to emulate that.

And that's something that they haven't received during the last four years of Biden-Harris but that's something that their parents received during President Trump. You know, Gen Z wants the same things that we want, the same things I want, the same one everybody else has. But they're further away from it from before. And that's because of the Democratic public policy that's existed at the state and federal level. And just to get back to the comment about Tucker referring to Doug Emhoff, it wasn't a joke. Tucker is referring to a real credible news story and someone who came forward who said Doug Emhoff slapped her. Let's remember, the Democratic Party is the one who said that women need to believe no matter what. And so a woman came forward with an accusation of Doug Emhoff that he slapped her in the Cannes Film Festival, and she's going around, and that's what Tucker is bringing it up because the media has ignored it. Whether that's going to move the needle or not, I don't know. But, you know, Tucker is a provocateur. We've seen that over the years. And he probably just brought that issue to be more provocative. But let's be clear, there is a credible allegation that Doug Emhoff smacked a woman in the Cannes Film Festival.
