Until now it seems the UK and the EU have agreed on how trade will be conducted in Northern Ireland.European Commission President acknowledged the lingering tension and so the new agreement to be known as the Winter Framework will allow both sides to make the most of their partnership. This new deal replaces the much despised Northern Ireland protocol, which was negotiated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson to prevent a hard border separating the Republic of Ireland on the EU side and Northern Ireland on the UK side. Under the Windsor Framework, trade will flow freely via green and red lanes. Goods from Britain destined for Northern Ireland will travel in a green lane subject to far fewer checks and less paperwork. Well products from the UK heading for export to the European Union and the Republic of Ireland will take the red light and normal checks and inspections. The British Prime Minister says he hopes the decisive breakthrough will resolve years of dispute over post Brexit trade. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The 20 meter long wooden boat reportedly took to sea from Turkey Thursday with perhaps as many as 250 people on board coming from, among other places Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Syria. Fishermen Luciano Vincenzo was one of the first on the scene before dawn. \"When we arrived, we found ten dead,\" he said. \"And as dawn broke, we found more and more.\" Only around 80 people survived the shipwreck. The rest perhaps, well over 100, either dead or missing. \"This type of tragedy should have been avoided,\" said the governor of Calabria, Roberto Occhiuto. Sunday, Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter's Square, \"I pray for each of them, for the missing and for the other migrants who survived.\" But thoughts and prayers won't save lives. Since 2014, more than 20,000 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean -- escaping war, famine, repression, chaos, and hopelessness. Increasingly Europe, including Italy, is taking a hard line on those in the global south fleeing their native lands. In a statement, Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed what she called her \"profound pain\" at the disaster. But Meloni rode to power on an anti-immigrant platform. And last week, the Italian parliament approved new laws making it ever more difficult for volunteer groups to carry out rescues at sea. What Europe can do for those in need has been made vividly clear by its embrace of millions of Ukrainian refugees. An embrace that doesn't extend to those braving deadly voyages such as these to reach Europe's shores. Ben Wedeman, CNN -- Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
