That's how UkrainianPresident Zelenskyy describes a Russian missile attack on a market in Donetsk that killed at least 17 people. This as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Kyiv. Then towns flooded in Greece as Storm Daniel lashes southern Europe following a Summer, of course, of deadly wildfires. We'll have the latest on what United Nations calls climate chaos. Plus, the Rolling Stones are back. The rock legends unveiling their first album of original songs in 18 years. We'll have a sneak peek for you. But first this evening, utter inhumanity. That's what Ukraine's president calls a devastating missile strike on a market in the Donetsk region today, saying, it shows why Russian evil must be defeated as soon as possible. Ukraine says at least 17 people were killed and that includes a child. Some cars and shops were incinerated, as you can see there in the flames. Surveillance cameras captured the moment of the attack, and we warn you, the images we're about to show you are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (EXPLOSION) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You're right, Isa, this is also about getting their messaging straight, that Washington and Kyiv can stand together, and what it is they have to tell the rest of the world when they get to the U.N. Because remember that, it is a 50-plus strong alliance that needs to be held together. That is no mean feat, 19 months into this war that the entire world has grown weary of, not least of course, the Ukrainians. But it is about holding together that alliance and convincing them by the time President Zelenskyy stands in New York not just of the need to continue standing firm with Ukraine, but actually to  keep going further, since that is what President Zelenskyy is asking for. The Ukrainian counteroffensive has made progress, it's proving extremely costly in terms of men. What we understand is happening down there is that, these are smaller assault units that are now trying to go in and move forward with that frontline in very difficult conditions ahead of bigger assault that might take place, and for that, they're going to need a lot more support behind them, Isa.",

At the Ukraine recovery conference held in London a few months ago I pledges the United States would invest more than $520 million in making Ukraine's energy infrastructure, more than half of which has been destroyed by Russia, cleaner, more resilient and more integrated with Europe. We are making new investments to enhance the transparency of Ukraine's institutions and to bolster the rule of law so that Ukraine's democracy is even more responsive to the needs of its people and can attract the private capital needed to rebuild. We are engaged in assisting the government of Ukraine on anticorruption efforts and on efforts to ensure accountability and full transparency. Of all of the assistance we are provided as well as the security of U.S.- provided defense articles and technologies. President Zelenskyy and I discussed these issues today and the importance to Ukraine's democratic future of continued reforms and the fight against corruption. A few months ago in Helsinki, I spoke to how President Putin's war in Ukraine has been and will continue to be a strategic failure for Russia. There is no better demonstration of that than seeing the Ukrainian people, whose national identity Putin sought to erase, stronger and more unified than ever before. As I said then, no one has done more to intensify Ukrainians' determination to write their own future on their own terms than President Putin. Now we have no illusions. The path forward will not be easy but this is a fight that we must and we will win. For any country threatened by bullies, who are the aggressors, for all who seek a future of security and peace, and my message today on behalf of President Biden and the United States to the Ukrainian people is, just as we have stood with you to ensure your nation's survival over these past 20 months, so we will stand with you as you determine your future and rebuild a free and resilient, a thriving Ukraine.",

And in that time, in the year since I was last here, Ukraine has taken back more than 50 percent of the territory that Russia had seized from it since February of 2022. In the current counteroffensive, we are seeing real progress over the last few weeks. As it happens, President Zelenskyy just returned from the front lines. So I was able to hear directly from him his assessment of the counteroffensive. And I think it very much matches our own, which is, as I said, real progress in recent weeks. We are doing everything we can to maximize our support to Ukraine as it pursues the counteroffensive. And ultimately, as I have said before, one thing above all other things will make the difference, I am convinced. Beyond the extraordinary work that Ukrainians are doing, beyond even the equipment, the support, the training that we and dozens of other nations are providing, the fundamental difference maker is that Ukrainians are fighting for their own country, for their own future, for their own freedom. Russians are not. And that gives me tremendous confidence that Ukraine will prevail.",

But I think the most important part of your answer was -- comes from the secretary himself, from his concluding lines, that Ukraine, as you said, should win and will -- must win and will win.

A lot to discuss. Principally it is the new aid from the United States for Ukraine totaling $1 billion in terms of assistance. Some of that will include go aid including assistance for demining. In terms of what we heard from Secretary Blinken, who thanked the moving moment he experienced this morning as he paid tribute to the fallen soldiers. He laid a wreath as he visited that cemetery, he said standing there with the graves, the falling photographs of each one was a reminder of the lives lost and the lives cut short. A lot in terms of the counteroffensive as well, discussion the progress has been made, a real progress; the counteroffensive is accelerating. But Antony Blinken saying he is under no illusion of the challenges, the fight he says, a fight that we must and we will win. Listening to that alongside me is our senior international correspondent, Sam Kiley, who has reported from Ukraine. We were talking about the counteroffensive. Let's start off with what we heard, that $1 billion in new aid, critical, of course, for this counteroffensive.",

This is a battle that we, he kept using the \"we\" word. That is very significant. Not \"they,\" not Zelenskyy, not the Ukrainians but we. We, the United States, are in this war together. That will be overinterpreted in Moscow. But I think in Ukraine it will be very, very important for the element that is supporting Ukraine in Washington. There are wobbles over the future funding, not least a recent CNN poll showed the majority of Americans were not in favor of these extra elements of spending that keep coming from the Biden administration. Very, very important spending though it is.",

Cameras were allowed for this hearing. They were not in Trump's other criminal cases. The hearing could determine how quickly the cases move and whether some defendants could separate their cases from others. It could also give us some insight into how much evidence prosecutors have. Michael Zeldin joins me now from Washington. He's a former federal prosecutor and served as Robert Mueller's special assistant at the U.S. Justice Department. He is also the host of a podcast. Michael, great to have you. Thank you for waiting for us as we got through that press conference. Give us a sense first of what you have heard today from the judge.",

So they want two separate, individual trials. The judge ruled that they can go to speedy trial and set that trial for October 23rd. But he ruled they must go together. He will not separate them into two individual trials. He has not determined yet whether, at that October 23rd trial, the remaining 17 defendants, including former president Trump, will also be required to go. I don't think that will be met. I think that the judge will have to have at least two trials. And that is where things stand in Georgia at the moment.",

The 17defendants and the two defendants would each have evidence presented to them about the entire enterprise of which they were participants. Think about this as a wheel with a hub and spokes. Each of these defendants are spokes doing specific acts. Each spoke does not need to know what the other spoke is doing or even who is the other spoke to be guilty under the RICO enterprise. So prosecutors have said we are going to present all of the evidence about all of the defendants, the hub and all of the spokes, because that is what we are entitled to. So they are saying four months as to any trial because we are going to present all the evidence of the enterprise, no matter what. So we've got two very lengthy trials proposed by the state. And the judge has to sort out how he's going to fit that into the court calendar.",
