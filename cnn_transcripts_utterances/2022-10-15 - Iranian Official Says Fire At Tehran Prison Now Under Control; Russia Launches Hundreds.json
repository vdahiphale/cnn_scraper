Of course, that prison that where many political prisoners, human rights activists, journalists, foreigners are kept in Tehran.Now, an hour ago or so, we started seeing video emerging on social media showing this large plume of smoke billowing over Evin Prison and according to the social media videos, we have also received, you could hear some gunfire as well, alarms going off, according to the activist group 1500tasvir that put out this video. They say that special forces were heading to Evin Prison. Now according to the government's account of what is going on, they say that this was a fire that was started by these rioters, thugs as they describe them who set fire to the clothing warehouse inside the prison. They say the situation is under control. The fire is being extinguished and they're saying that firemen are there and that these rioters have been separated from other prisoners. Now, in the last few moments, as well, Jim, we are getting information coming in from the pro-reform activist outlet Iran Wire that says that it has spoken to a source inside Evin Prison and according to that source, there was a revolt in the part of the prison and a fire ensued. We can't independently verify this report. We are still working to gather information. What I can tell you is there's a lot of concern right now for the safety of those political prisoners. I've been speaking to a human rights activist, Iranian Americans who are very concerned about what might be going on in Evin Prison. The secretary general of Amnesty International, Agnes Callamard, also tweeting out, saying, \"The notorious Evin Prison in Iran is reported to be on fire with gunshots heard. This must be terrifying. Let's recall that the authorities have the legal obligation to respect and protect the lives and well-being of all prisoners.\" So still unclear on what really happened, but a lot of concern right now, Jim.",

We appreciate it.Deadly missile attacks meanwhile so-called Kamikaze drone strikes and civilian carnage. This is the new reality in Russia's war against Ukraine which has erupted violently once again. Russia launched hundreds of strikes in the past week alone including yesterday and today in Zaporizhzhia where it rained down drones and missiles. And those are not the only weapons that Russia is wielding in this war. Rape and sexual violence are also part of Russia's military strategy according to a United Nations envoy. Ukraine, though, continues to fight back. After Ukrainian troops reclaimed parts of the Kherson region, Moscow announced they were pulling civilians out of that area.

Mark, it's an absolute thrill to have you with us. We appreciate it so much. The team is very excited. We're giddy. Let's be honest about it. But we got some important stuff to discuss here. And that is what is going on in Ukraine. If you can, take me back to that moment of speaking with Zelenskyy who has compared Russia to the Evil Empire. What was that conversation like? MARK HAMILL, AMBASSADOR, UNITED24: Well, like everyone else that follows the news, I've watched since the end of February when a sovereign nation was invaded by hostile foreign power. Something we haven't seen in my lifetime. I guess goes back to World War II. But when my business representative said that President Zelenskyy wanted to have a virtual meeting with me and I was stunned. I thought, maybe somebody's pranking me. I mean, let's confirm that it's the truth and once we realized it was, I was honored to be able to meet with him.
