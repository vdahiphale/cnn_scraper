A source familiar with the case tells CNN Rex Heuermann asked law enforcement just one question as they processed him in jail, is it in the news? Now, investigators in New York say they're still pouring over what they describe as a flood of evidence, including a vault in his basement holding hundreds of guns.CNN's Jean Casarez is live in New York this morning. And, Jean, what's been striking is, this is still very much an ongoing investigation. What sense do we have of the type of new evidence they've been gathering from Heuermann's house?",

And the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department is telling us that initially he was not, but the medical staff determined through their assessment of him that he should be put on that suicide watch. And as that continues at the sheriff's department and in the jail, the prosecution is going forward with their evidence on murder charges for three victims. But the police department, law enforcement, in all aspects, continuing that police investigation. Now, what we're learning, they have executed and continue to execute many search warrants for the residents, the office, also a storage unit. But at the residence, we are learning, a source is telling CNN, that they are looking for anything out of place. Anything that could be potential evidence related to the charges. And we are told that they found a doll at the residence. Not in the children's rooms, but in another location in the house, and that was a red flag to them. We believe they took that into evidence. And also they were expecting to find some guns but they found 200 to 300 guns, according to a source telling CNN, at Heuermann's home. And what they found were pistols, revolvers and semiautomatic rifles. They found them in a walled off vault behind a locked metal door in the basement. And, obviously, they collected all of those guns. They knew 92 of them were registered with the state of New York, but not 200 to 300 of them.",

You've kind of watched the evolution of him as both a president and I think as a leader in the country.

He was extremely popular when he came in as president. Ukrainians like change here. There's only one president in the history of modern Ukraine that's won a second election. You know, he was brought in to shake things up and was elected with more than 73 percent of the vote. But by the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of February of 2022, that popularity really had fallen quite a lot and he was struggling politically. And this war has really turned him into a hero, as not only a political leader, but as commander in chief. He's really earned the respect of Ukrainians, and I think also Ukraine's western allies.",
