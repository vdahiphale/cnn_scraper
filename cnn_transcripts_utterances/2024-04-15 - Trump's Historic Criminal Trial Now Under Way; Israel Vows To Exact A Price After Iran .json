One Israeli official tells CNN the war cabinet is determined to act, but it's still unclear where, when, and how the IDF might retaliate. The White House, meanwhile, urging calm in the region, as President Biden turns his focus to diplomacy and de-escalation. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin our coverage tonight in New York where Donald Trump's historic criminal trial is finally underway. The court adjourned for the day just a short time ago after getting started on the first order of business, jury selection. CNN's Kara Scannell has more on all of today's developments. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is an assault on America. Nothing like this has ever happened before. There's never been anything like it. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After weeks of delays and last-ditch legal maneuvering, jury selection now underway in the historic and unprecedented hush money case against Donald Trump. Following a series of rulings clarifying the evidence allowed in the case, 96 potential jurors passed through magnetometers to enter the courtroom with Trump. They were sworn in and questioning began. A few minutes later, at least 50 prospective jurors were excused because they told the judge they could not be fair and impartial. Of those who remained three questioned by the judge listed the New York Times and CNN as their sources of news. None said they had read any books by Michael Cohen or Trump, and none of them said they worked or volunteered for any pro-Trump or anti- Trump groups. Nine members of the jury pool were questioned and not dismissed by the time court adjourned for the day. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, says the former president attempted to cover up payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election, trying to stop her from speaking out about the alleged affair with Trump. Judge Juan Merchan started the day by denying a motion from Trump's lawyers to recuse himself. As attorneys debated, Judge Juan Merchan said he would not allow the infamous Access Hollywood tape to be shown or video of Trump deposition in the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit that found him liable for defamation. Karen McDougal, a model who says she had an affair in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet about it, will be allowed to testify. Attorneys also argued about how much the jury can be told about Michael Cohen's crimes. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I did it at the direction of, in concert with and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump.",

I think he knows it's going to take a very hard time to pick a jury here. And if you can weed out as many people as possible, people who raise their hands and start from the position of saying that they can't be fair are a good folks to see him off the top.

I'm not suggesting the former presidents could all of a sudden say this is a totally fair trial, but I think it robs them substantively of this point that whatever gets seated is somehow skewed against them.

A lot of times, even things like what's your education, what zip code do you live in, what magazines do you read, are little ways of teasing out, number one, how might this person work in a group, how -- is this person a leader? Is this person going to buck tradition or leadership or anything like that?

Will it heed you know the forceful cries from some elements of the government here, particularly part of that right- wing coalition that Netanyahu has, who are calling for a forceful attack to re-establish a deterrent? Will it be a direct tit-for-tat, hitting some kind of a military installation? Would it possibly be an asymmetric attack focusing on one of Iran's numerous proxies in the region?

Joining me now, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, he's a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, thank you so much for joining us. What's your reaction to this latest plan by the House of Republican leadership to pass four separate bills, decoupling aid to Israel from Ukraine aid, that may potentially bundle these before sending them to the Senate, but is that something you could support decupling all these bills? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, I haven't read any of the details of these four different proposals, so I certainly can't comment on how they would fare in the Seante, whether I'd vote for them. But it's a disturbing development. The speaker of House has a bill in front of him right now that is passed to Senate with 70 votes, a huge bipartisan majority. It funds Ukraine, it funds Israel, it funds important humanitarian relief, and it helps Taiwan defend itself. That bill is supported by the majority of his members, and he is still continuing to refuse to call it up for a vote. That could be on the president's desk tomorrow if Speaker Johnson just called for a vote. So, every two days, he seems to have a new plan as to how he is going to avoid doing the right thing, just taking a voting, letting his members decide on what they feel about the Senate proposal that funds Ukraine. This new plan, I don't know how it will fare in the House. I don't know it how will fair in Senate. What I know is that it inevitably just delays getting funding to both Israel and Ukraine.

I think everyone knows by now that the United States is counseling Israel to engage in a strategy moving forward that doesn't escalate this conflict any further.

That's why he's used a written questionnaire with so many probing questions. That helps to move the voir dire, that is the questioning of the jurors along, because you can read those answers.

And that's what's unusual here. The other crimes that underlie it are election fraud. And we have to see if that can hold up as an underlying crime, both federal and state election fraud or election interference. And the third crime is tax fraud. So there are three underlying crimes. Now, they don't have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Not at all. The three has to just find that the intent of the filing, the false business records or making the false business records was to further the underlying crimes and then it becomes a felony. So, you know, it is unusual, but I think other people have many people have been prosecuted for the misdemeanor filing false business records.

The question is exactly what is the nature of that response is going to be. The Israeli war cabinet for several hours today, they've had a number of meetings since this attack. Obviously, we're told the times it was has been very tense, discussed questions inside -- inside that counsel. We don't know if a decision has been made, nor do we know what exactly the nature of response will be. Obviously, there's a number of factors involved both the nature of the response, whether it be diplomatic or military, which would be more are likely, and also that the timing of it, is it something that needs to happen quickly? There's some thought that the quicker the better as far as Israel may see it, because they want to still try to maintain the international support. They've gotten in the longer they wait to respond, that any kind of support or sympathy for Israel may diminish in terms of a response.
