It`s anelection that will be closely watched around the world, particularly by its communist neighbor, China, and even here in the United States. Now, there are a ton of specific details to this crucial election. So let`s head straight to our correspondent in the region Will Ripley, who explains why this matters to those outside Taiwan`s borders. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There is a lot at stake in this election. It`s being closely watched by the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing and by U.S. lawmakers in Washington. Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it. And it does not rule out the use of force to bring this island under its fold at some point. Beijing, openly lows, the ruling party, the DPP, and they`re framing this election as a stark choice between war and peace, prosperity and decline. From Taiwan`s perspective, the election will decide whether this island will continue to prioritize its relationship with the U.S. or perhaps recalibrate that relationship and choose to mend ties with China. Given that Taiwan is the largest source of tension between China and the U.S., which happens to be the Island`s main international backer and arms supplier. How China responds to the result of this election will be a big test. Can Beijing and D.C. manage tensions or will they move closer to confrontation or even conflict? Why does this matter beyond the confines of Taiwan? Well, the location, of course, it`s important strategically for both China and the United States being right there on the first island chain. Taiwan is the world`s number one manufacturer of semiconductors. Those priceless chips, that power all of our tech and the supply chain disruptions for any cross-rate conflict would be catastrophic around the world. And from the U.S. perspective, Taiwan is a democracy and this Island`s leaders have said that this election and this overall clash between China, the U.S. and Taiwan over democracy versus authoritarianism could actually define the future of the free world.

If you said 1896, put your hands up. According to scientific American that`s when a Swedish scientist first argued that burning fossil fuels such as coal could add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere leading to a rise in Earth`s average temperature. 2023 was the hottest year on record with the latest data showing that global warming hit 1.48 degrees Celsius. We are now extremely close to the warming limit that nearly 200 countries sought to avoid when the Paris agreement was signed in 2015.  Our Bill Weir explains what this latest report means.

Most Northern latitudes, you can see on the map there, up in Canada, there are good three and four degrees warming, warming much faster than the rest of the world. So it is not even if we look at the global surface temperatures going back 57 years, it goes back to 1967. My birth year, this is my life and temperature graphs here. And 2023, you can see how that bar on the right is so much higher than anywhere else. Usually these records are broken by just hundreds of a degree because you`re talking about so much area, so much mass, so much time, but `23 was, oh, deadly special in so many ways. And then as we look at the -- the, through the year as the temperatures bounced around that 1.5 line there, we dipped above in March came back down. But as you can see the temperatures around the world hit that 1.5 threshold and stayed there for most of the back end of the year. Even going above two degrees of global warming for a couple of days in November, that has never happened before for the first time ever. You can lay 2023`s calendar over a calendar of `19 or 1850 to 1900. And every day was a full degree warmer than those before. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And so, as I was washing my hands, I thought maybe I`d try something. The last option we had was for me to sing.
