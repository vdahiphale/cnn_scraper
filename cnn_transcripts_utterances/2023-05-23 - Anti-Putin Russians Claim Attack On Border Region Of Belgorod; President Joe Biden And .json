The facility has been occupied by Russian forces since the first weeks of the war, and has been a constant target of artillery fire, and other attacks. According to the Reuters news agency, a plan to safeguard the plant and avoid a nuclear disaster is expected later this month after U.N. brokered negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

The Sudanese armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces had agreed to the truce starting Monday night to allow humanitarian aid to reach thousands of trapped civilians.

      "sentences": "Well, with just 10 days until the United States could potentially default on its obligations, President Biden and speaker Kevin McCarthy emerging from their meeting on Monday both calling it a productive meeting. But no specifics in terms of what kind of progress was actually achieved during a meeting that lasted more than an hour in the Oval Office on Monday.In fact, both sides are clearly still very far apart on some of the major points of discussion here in terms of the spending caps, for example, how long and at what level will those spending caps be set. Both sides so far appear to be very far apart. And I also got to ask the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy about something that President Biden raised at the beginning of that meeting, and that is that the President wants revenue increases to be on the table, closing tax loopholes for example. I asked the speaker if that's on the table for him, the speaker was very direct. And he said, no, that is off the table for him in terms of discussions, he wants to cut spending and that's where he thinks the focus should be. He also said that cuts to defense spending are off the table, something that the White House had also raised. And so, it's clear that there's still a very big gulf between these two sides. Nonetheless, the speaker saying that the tenor of the meeting was more productive and more conducive to reaching an agreement than at any point in the discussions that we've seen over these last three weeks. But the clock is clearly ticking and the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, on Monday, reiterating her assessments, that the United States default would likely come in early June. She says, \"We estimate that it is highly likely that Treasury will no longer be able to satisfy all of the government's obligations, if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the limit the debt limit by early June and potentially as early as June 1st\". The Secretary said in the letter last week to congressional leaders that she viewed that timeline as likely, so moving that confidence level up to highly likely only increasing the pressure on the White House, and those Republican lawmakers were negotiating this deal to actually get there.

That saw the country's GDP shrink by a quarter. People have clearly voted with that in mind. They have voted for growth. The prime minister has said that this is a clear indication that they want him to continue on his path of reforms. Well now, what we expect is that so new elections will be called.
