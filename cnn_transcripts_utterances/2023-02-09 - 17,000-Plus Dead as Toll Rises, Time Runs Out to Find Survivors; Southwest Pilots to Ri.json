The staggering death toll now has topped 17,000 victims. Imagine that. You're looking at drone video now of a mass burial in Syria. This is a region that had already suffered unimaginable horrors after more than a decade of brutal civil war. The Syrian man that you see right here says that 18 of his family members were killed in the quake. He is holding a white -- holding white body bags and waiting outside their collapsed home as rescue teams dig through the debris.

So, now, they are looking, they're observing, they're trying to make he didn't have another stroke. Can you explain to us what doctors are looking for? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. I mean, this is obviously one of those things because of his past medical history. If someone complains of lightheadedness, you have to be pretty diligent. There's lots of things that can cause lightheadedness. But as you put up there, I want to just reiterate sort of his past medical history. It's pretty significant. It was back in 2017 that he was first diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. And then it was May of 2022, May 13th of 2022 when he suffered Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and doctors used a thrombectomy to remove a blood clot. And he had a defibrillator and a pacemaker placed at that time. That was a long hospitalization. He was in the hospital for nine days at that point. What we know is that he's had this significant past medical history, but in October of last year, the doctors released this note, this was just a few weeks now before the election, basically saying he has auditory processing issues. But other than that, he's pretty much ready to go in terms of return to work, do the sorts of things that would be required of him as a senator. And now you fast forward to this point, where he has this episode of lightheadedness, two things. One is that it could just be lightheadedness, which does occur in people. It can be for all sorts of different reasons. But also given his past medical history, they have to be very diligent about this. If they're saying there is no evidence of stroke, one thing to sort of point out from that standpoint is that it does take some time sometimes to figure out if someone has, in fact, had a stroke. What they're saying is he doesn't have symptoms of stroke right now, but I'm sure they're doing scans, they're looking at his heart to see if there's any other problems that are manifesting.",

We were told we aren't allowed to walk over and talk to them. So, Don, it just gives a sense of the confusion that Southwest crews were dealing with and the pilots union says they've been warning about problems with Southwest's system for years and those warning signs, they say, have been ignored. Now, the airline's chief operating officer also set to testify is likely going to dispute some of that, even though the airline is apologizing. We've obtained that testimony and they're expected to tell senators three keywords, we messed up. They've been handing out those refunds, hundreds of millions of dollars.

But when Dr. Mayer says this, it portends a few things. First of all, there is all sorts of different tests which he likely had done in order to figure out the status of his heart. And based on those tests, tests such as EKG, echocardiogram, heart C.T. scan, stress test, all these sorts of tests, you get the idea that there is no persistent problem with his heart, number one, but also the idea, was there a pre-existing problem with his heart. And what those -- given what the tests are presumably negative because of Dr. Mayer's comments, it doesn't sound like there was a pre-existing condition with his heart either. So, that is really it. We did dig into this a bit yesterday when I heard the comments. And the American Heart Association, as rare as this condition is, Kaitlan, it is a really rare condition, they also say that if someone has no pre-existing conditions and all the heart tests come back normal, then even with the diagnosis commotio cordis, they can return to play. So, yes, I mean, it's a strong statement. The American Heart Association says you can return to play. But that is, I think, what is driving Dr. Mayer's comments.",

What I will say is there have been situations where players have returned to play even at the professional level after having a diagnosis of commotio cordis. So, yes, they can.And I think the second part of your question is, really, what is the likelihood that it would happen again? And, again, based on limited data, it is very unlikely.
