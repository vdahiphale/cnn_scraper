It has been surrounded by Israeli forces for days. We will have the latest details on the thousands of people still trapped there. Plus, the U.S. Supreme Court says, yes, but an appeals court says no to a controversial Texas immigration bill. What this means for Border States and those trying to get into the United States. And royal controversy, why a U.K. watchdog is investigating a possible breach of private medical records. Israel is pressing on with an operation against Hamas at Gaza's largest hospital for a third day. Some 3,000 Palestinians are taking shelter in the Al-Shifa Hospital complex. The IDF accuses Hamas of using it as cover and says it has killed 90 terrorists so far and has questioned over 300 suspects at the compound. Officials in Gaza are describing a dire situation inside the complex saying water and other necessities have run out. A doctor trapped inside is calling for urgent intervention saying the hospital could turn into a mass grave. Civilians in Gaza are also facing starvation. A U.N.-backed report says northern Gaza could descend into famine imminently. While the U.N.'s Human Rights chief is warning Israel that continuing to restrict the entry of aid supplies may amount to a war crime. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLKER TURK, U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: The extent of Israel's continued restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war, which is a war crime.

It really does seem to be growing more desperate with each passing day and we are hearing those warnings from the World Health Organization as well as medical officials on the ground saying that they are seeing an increasing number of newborn babies who are being born severely underweight.A number of children, the increasing number of children now severely malnourished. And, of course, we are hearing warnings that many pregnant mothers are also severely underweight. But this is all coming, of course, at the back of that troubling and startling U.N.- backed report showing that much of the population in northern Gaza is now facing catastrophic levels of hunger. Much of the population in southern Gaza now categorized in phase 4, just below that catastrophic level, emergency level. But, of course, the projections right now suggest that Gaza could be declared to be facing an outright famine in the coming weeks if not in the coming days. And we are hearing those repeated warnings from aid agencies from the U.N. that more needs to be done to prevent what they have described as a manmade catastrophe in Gaza, namely pressure is being put on the Israeli government to allow more aid in. Now we have seen those airdrops taking place. We have seen the declaration, the establishment of a maritime corridor and now to allow more humanitarian supplies into Gaza. But this simply isn't enough. And the message that we keep hearing is that more needs to be done to allow aid in through land crossings. This is the most important, most effective way of getting aid into Gaza. But at this stage, aid agencies are still facing obstructions in getting aid across the Rafah border crossing, which separates Gaza from Egypt and the Kerem Shalom crossing, which separates Gaza from Israel. And, of course, we are hearing as well from some of Israel's closest allies, including the United States calling on the Israeli leadership to allow more aid in. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel is in favor of allowing more aid and that their policy is one of ensuring that enough aid is getting into Gaza. But that stands in contrast with what we've been seeing on the ground. Israel continues to accuse Hamas of looting aid, but again, that claim, as made by the Prime Minister of Israel speaking to CNN on Sunday, has been denied and rejected by many aid groups also speaking to CNN. So there clearly is mounting international pressure on the Israeli leadership to ensure that more aid is getting into Gaza to prevent a famine from being declared there. But we're also at the same time hearing continued warnings of a ground offensive now in the Rafah area in the south, which is not only a crucial gateway for aid, but of course, an area where some 1.5 million people are now displaced and sheltering.

Turning now to a high stakes political battle between the U.S. government and the state of Texas. It's volleying back and forth between the Supreme Court and an appeals court at issue is a new Texas law that would allow state police to arrest and even deport illegal immigrants, a power that's ordinarily reserved for the federal government. The Supreme Court allowed the law to go into effect on Tuesday, but then that situation lasted only a few hours when an appeals court put it on hold again. So that court will have a hearing on the law in the next few hours. Critics of that law say it will lead to racial profiling and chaos in law enforcement at the border. U.S. President Joe Biden will be in Arizona and Texas today. He is sure to address this controversial effort by Texas to police the border. Let's go now to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez at the White House for the latest. I mean, it has been a bit chaotic trying to keep up with this legal back and forth, really a whiplash.

Because this crime is a misdemeanor, which means that it would be adjudicated in county courts.And I can't tell you how many leaders around the state of Texas have complained about this because they say that this is an unfunded mandate by the Texas Legislature, and they say that this is going to clog jails. It's going to clog the courts. In fact, the Texas Conference of Urban Counties which represents Democratic and Republican counties from across the state of Texas, representing about 78 percent of the state's population. They say that there's about 6,000 to 7,000 jail beds in the state of Texas and that those would be filled up in days if this measure actually goes into effect. Now, it did go into effect for a few hours yesterday. We have no knowledge that this -- that anyone was arrested under S.B. 4 before yesterday for that specific period of time. And we reached out to the Texas governor's office asking if the governor was going to push for immediate enforcement. We didn't get a response about that. But that is what local county governments are very concerned about because they say they don't have the jail space, they don't have enough prosecutors, they don't have enough judges and that they don't have enough jail space and it would cost them millions upon millions of dollars. Now let's talk about the actual language of the law because this law says that it's a crime for someone to enter the state of Texas illegally and that somebody's illegal presence in the state is also a crime, which has created a lot of controversy. That's why civil rights groups and human rights groups are very concerned about racial profiling because how do you define -- and this law does not explain it. There's -- the language is very vague. How do you define somebody's illegal presence and how do you tell police officers that somebody has an illegal presence? It's very confusing. Now, the other part of this law is that it gives judges the power to deport migrants back to Mexico, which would require cooperation from Mexico. And Mexico's foreign ministry fired back yesterday during this short period of time when S.B. 4 was actually in effect, saying that they condemn the law, Mexico rejects the law, and that they do not plan to participate. In fact, they issued a statement saying, in part, quote, \"In this regard, Mexico will not accept, under any circumstances, repatriations by the state of Texas.\" Mexico maintains that it has a bilateral relationship with the United States of America, not with the state of Texas, and that it plans to maintain that relationship with the White House. And, Amara, as you mentioned moments ago, there's another hearing today in the Fifth Circuit, and what we could see from that hearing, the outcome could be that this law is on hold again, or that it could go into effect, which means we could go right back to the whiplash, right back to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

So a real breach on many levels.The British health minister has been out today saying -- describing how serious this is. And the information commissioner who's the watchdog for data privacy in the U.K. has confirmed that they are assessing this report. It will be the police to prosecute. They say they haven't had it referred to them yet. Although the government says they have referred it to the police, but, you know, we're trying to tie up some of these loose ends as we have done all week.

The state of Texas and the federal government will be in a U.S. appeals court in the next few hours arguing over that very issue.

I really appreciate your time. Look, I know you've been following this very closely. And your organization, as we said, works to empower and to welcome immigrants into this country. And, of course, Texas recently passed a law that does exactly the opposite.

KRISH O'MARA VIGNARAJAH, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO OF GLOBAL REFUGE: I think legal whiplash is a great way to describe the past 48 hours. The law was in effect for a brief moment before, obviously, the Supreme Court weighed in and then the 5th Circuit got involved to pause the policy. It's unfortunate because we think that it is crystal clear that this law is not just illegal but unconstitutional. And it's difficult when you understand the human toll of how it impacts immigrants because we know the chilling effect it will have.

This is their argument to the Supreme Court of the United States as they prepare for oral arguments.So they've written this all in a court filing submitted to the Supreme Court. It is a filing that asks the Supreme Court justices to dismiss the criminal case against Donald Trump related to the 2020 election, the obstruction conspiracy charge he is accused of violating the law around. In this filing, they write, \"Once our nation crosses this Rubicon,\" of a president being prosecuted, \"every future president will face de facto blackmail and extortion while in office, and will be harassed by politically motivated prosecution after leaving office, over his most sensitive and controversial decisions. That bleak scenario would result in a weak and hollow president and would thus be ruinous for the American political system as a whole.\" They say that this would be the end of the presidency as we know it if there is not a bubble of immunity around the U.S. presidency. That even if you commit a crime to stay in office as president, you should not be able to be charged with a crime after you leave office for what happened when you were the president. Now, the appeals courts have already said no to this. The U.S. Supreme Court will look at it on their own. But previously, the courts have said quite clearly the reason that there are laws in the country, even for someone serving in the presidency, is that it discourages people from breaking the law. And past presidents knew that, that's why they weren't operating in this lawless, powerful mode of the presidency and they were following the law. Donald Trump is an anomaly.

DREW ECHOLS, CO-OWNER, JAEMOR FARMS: We have 18 acres of strawberries and they're tucked in up under some pretty heavy blankets and then what that does is it keeps the frost off the top of the plants and keeps the blooms from freezing but it also traps that ground heat. RAFFA (voice-over): Drew Echols is a fifth generation farmer. His family has been farming since 1912 with nearly 600 acres full of peaches, strawberries and pumpkins. But in the last 100 years, climate change has been shifting seasons.",

And they kind of bloom sporadically.RAFFA (voice-over): As winters warm in the peach state, pitted fruits have been losing chilling hours below 45 degrees since 1970, a key ingredient for a healthy bloom. Warmer winters like this past year means spring is springing sooner. Much of the lower 48 has spring fever of 2 degrees warmer since 1970. This adds two to four weeks to the growing season, putting budding crops at risk to seasonal freezes. Last year, Echols lost 70 percent of his peach crop to a warm winter.",

A rocket carrying a relay satellite bound for the far side of the moon was successfully launched earlier on Wednesday. That is according to the China National Space Administration. Not only is China the first country to successfully land on the mysterious far side of the moon, but it's also the next unmanned mission, which is expected to bring back the first samples ever collected from the moon's far side. Police forces in some parts of the world are looking for a different -- looking a little different these days. Take a look at these new hires. In Spain, police took a robot dog for a test walk through the busy city center. It's designed to help spot traffic violations with remote image analysis and will soon use artificial intelligence to sniff out danger. It looks like even the dogs are curious about those robot dogs. Also in Tokyo, the top brass are hoping this new police chief's reputation makes criminals think twice. Godzilla himself was made -- has made Tokyo police chief -- was made Tokyo police chief, I should say, for a day last week as part of an event to promote traffic safety, but we're guessing it isn't long until he returns to the big screen.
