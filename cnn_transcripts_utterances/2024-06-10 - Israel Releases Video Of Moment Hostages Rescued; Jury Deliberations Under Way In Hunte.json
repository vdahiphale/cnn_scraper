The Hunter Biden case is now in the hands of a Delaware jury. The historic trial against the president's son potentially nearing an end as the panel weighs three felony gun charges. Plus, Donald Trump is taking the first step toward his sentencing on 34 felony convictions. The former president holding a virtual meeting with a probation official this afternoon, and that interview could be a key factor as Judge Juan Merchan decides on potential punishments for Trump. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to our top story tonight, the daring, bloody Israeli raid inside Gaza, that operation successfully rescuing four hostages, but exacting a heavy toll on Palestinian residents nearby. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, is standing by live. We'll have a lot to discuss. But, first, let's get all the latest developments from CNN's Paula Hancocks in Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): New video from the Israeli military shows the rescue of Israeli hostages from central Gaza. It says hundreds of personnel were involved in this rare daytime operation. Three hostages locked in an apartment in one multi story residential building, another held in a flat 650 feet away in a densely populated neighborhood. Models of the buildings were built weeks before to train forces. This is how Israel's hostage rescue mission looked from the ground, airstrikes, explosions, residents running to find safety that does not exist in Gaza. Hostages were flown by helicopter back to Israel and two emotional reunions with family who had dreamed of this moment for eight months, families who only heard about the mission once their loved ones were safe.",

Israel has accepted the deal. The president has said that. And now all we need is to have Hamas accept this deal, release hostages that they are required to do in phase one, and move forward on an extended ceasefire.

But to gather the kind of background that they could put in their report, the PSR, pre- sentencing report to the judge, so he can consider their findings about whether Donald Trump would be a better candidate to be sentenced to jail or prison, or whether he would be a better candidate for probation given his crime.So, they go into things like his personal life, his financial background, education, family situation things like that.

They're going to explain why their actions are bad.They're going to use that time as advocacy to tell the judge probation through -- the judge through probation, why they should be giving a more lenient sentence. I think it's not unexpected that today's interview was very short because the former president wants to maintain his Fifth Amendment right. He's going to appeal. He is going to maintain his innocence. So, I think today it was just simple questions. He was not going to go into the conviction. Todd Blanche was there with him.

In the federal system, the probation officer does their own investigation. They color their own understanding of the facts, and they use that as the basis of their recommendation. It's my understanding that that's not the same here. So, given the relatively short duration of the interview, and the fact that Judge Merchan presided over the entire jury trial in his bid, He's very aware of the facts and the defendant's behavior, I think while it might be helpful, I don't think it's going to impact his ultimate decision-making.",
