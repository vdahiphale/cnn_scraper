Trump has still not been sentenced in that case. His legal team is expected to appeal Merchan's latest decision.

But really, that event on Monday was supposed to be about his announcement with the SoftBank CEO about $100 billion being invested into the US over the next years with the hope that it would create 100,000 jobs.However, Donald Trump then used the stage to give somewhat of a campaign speech and tried to paint this very optimistic picture of America under his leadership. But the real news came from that question and answer with reporters. One of the things he discussed was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s skepticism over vaccines. He said that he believes RFK Jr. is far less radical than he has been in the past. These comments of course notable given that it marked the start of RFK Jr.'s meetings on Capitol Hill with crucial senators, who will be deciding whether or not to confirm him. He said that he does believe in some vaccines, specifically pointing to the polio vaccine. But then talked about this idea of wanting RFK Jr. and the Department of Health and Human Services to look into whether there's any correlation between vaccines and autism. This is something we know from study after study has been debunked. Now, he also talked about the drones flying over New Jersey that many people have spotted, and he claimed at one point that the government knows what they are and should be able to identify them. I will argue though, however, and we've heard this from many officials over the weekend, that they are still trying to investigate that. That they do not believe that these drones are a national security risk, something that Donald Trump seemed to nod to during that press conference. But also added -- but these officials added that they are looking into this. They are not concerned, but they still recognize that they have to get to the bottom of it. One other thing I want to mention is what Donald Trump said about TikTok. This is going to be a huge issue given that there is a ban, an impending ban coming on January 19th if Donald Trump chooses not to act on that. Donald Trump said that he's warned to TikTok, noted that he believes many young voters were responsible in part for his election victory and that he was going to be considering whether or not to handle, or reverse I should say, that previous ban on TikTok Alayna Treene, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida.

The two had been bickering for some time over a financial mechanism and Germany's economy. But what resulted in this was Schulz leading a minority government. That meant he had very few other options left to him, apart from calling this confidence vote.

That animosity was very clear to see on the floor of the Bundestag today, with all parties leveling accusations at one another. Schulz took another opportunity to remind the German people that the reason this government collapsed in his mind was because the liberal partners in his coalition were not prepared to agree with his policies and timetables.
