What we know about how he's doing? And his message that he's delivering today. CHRISTOPHER LAMB, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, yes. Good morning Kim. What you're seeing now is the conclusion of the Easter Sunday mass. It's coming to an end. Pope Francis has been presiding at that service which is attended by thousands from across the world. It's a day of great celebration and festivities and you can see that there are -- St. Peter is decked out with greenery and flowers, flowers that are transported in from Holland each year to really give a celebratory feel to the Easter Sunday mass. Francis has been taking part in virtually all of the Holy Week services apart from the Good Friday Service at the Colosseum, which he pulled out for the last minute in order to preserve his health, but last night he presided the liturgy, the Easter vigil liturgy in St. Peter's Basilica. And later today, he will give his Urbi et Orbi Easter message, whereas he expected to address the various conflicts that are going on in the world. Kim.",

Trump posted that video to his social media site, \"Truth Social\" on Friday. On Saturday his campaign defended it, telling CNN in a statement, quote, \"That picture was on the back of a pickup truck that was traveling down the highway. Democrats and crazed lunatics have not only called for despicable violence against President Trump and his family, they are actually weaponizing the justice system against him.\" The Biden campaign, meanwhile, wasted little time responding to this. They told CNN in a statement, quote, \"This image from Donald Trump is the type of crap you post when you're calling for a \"bloodbath\" or when you tell the proud boys to stand back and stand by. Trump is regularly inciting political violence and it's time people take him seriously, just ask the Capitol Police officers who were attacked protecting our democracy on January 6.\" These kinds of violent images are commonplace among some Trump supporters and you can find them often at his rallies certainly online and yes even on the back of vehicles. But it is still striking to see them coming from a former President and someone who is seeking the White House once again. Of course this has become commonplace for Trump going all the way back to his 2016 campaign for president and through this week when he has repeatedly attacked one of the judges who is overseeing his case in New York.

The Biggest problem for them is that this election is expected to be extremely close, I mean Americans have become very, very polarized. And also, with that they've become -- it's been something called negative partisanship where Republicans really distrust democratic politicians, democrats really distrust Republican politicians. And so nobody is really moving.So there's this very small movement of the vote and since 2000 it has been very close. So that's your first issue. The -- the second issue, though, is that with RFK it's -- and with actually most of these other candidates, we don't know where those votes are going to come from. I mean even though taking even a small percentage of votes could shift the election. It's really not clear which of the candidates that they would -- would be pulling votes from.

Now, we're not talking about anywhere near the levels with where third parties were maybe 100 years ago when Teddy Roosevelt completely, you know, crashed the political system in 1912.But we're still seeing them moving their way up. And what we're especially seeing is -- is the republican party moving farther and farther to the right and in many ways abandoning the traditional moderate conservatives. And so, what you're seeing here is a -- is a gaping hole, a real problem that they're leaving for themselves. But at this point, there's no sign that the libertarians are actually going to grab hold of this or any other moderate party. So in a sense, it's not an issue so much with -- with the third-party movement -- as a movement as it is a problem with the strategies right now that here is an ideal moment for -- for third parties and independent candidates.

And then now year later, you have these local elections taking place all across the country.We are in the cultural and economic heart of Turkey. And I'll just show you out the window just to set the scene. So this is the Beyoglu district of Istanbul. And it's significant because this is actually where President Erdogan himself was born and grew up. And as you mentioned this is very much a referendum on the state of affairs in Turkey right now and on the president himself. Inside this polling station, there's no one voting at the moment. But I'll just show you what will happen here. Each voter is going to get three of these very long ballots. One is blue, one's gold, and one is white, and the white one is the one that all eyes are on. This is the mayoral race for Istanbul. There are 49 names on that, some from parties, some from Independent candidates, but really there are only two who are widely considered able to actually win. One from President Erdogan's more religious conservative AK Party and one from the opposition more secular leaning CHP Party, the party of the current, incumbent mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, you can see one person just stuffing their envelope with all the ballots into the -- into the box. And this could be a watershed election for turkey. Obviously, you don't normally say that about normal -- about local elections. But in this case, Imamoglu is one of the few maybe the only opposition party politicians who has the strength and the popularity to actually take on President Erdogan in a head-to-head presidential race. And so that is why Erdogan is pouring so much energy and money and attention on this race. You see his face on banners everywhere. He has been around town at rallies in the waning days of this election to try to rally his voters. Because if Imamoglu wins, it means that Erdogan undoubtedly his grip on power will have loosened and he will have a strong challenger. If he loses, it's really back to the drawing board for the opposition parties. There are some complicating factors in all of this, Kim. One is the fact that technically under the constitution Erdogan isn't allowed to run for another term in office, but there are plenty of pundits who figure that there are enough loopholes that could allow him to run one more time. And there are also criminal charges hanging over Imamoglu that stemmed back from the last election, the last local election in 2019 where he had this upset victory over Erdogan's party charges of insulting public officials widely viewed to be politically motivated but could still come back to bite him down the road as they are still yet unresolved.

He was in Cairo meeting with the foreign ministers of Egypt and France. And a short time ago, planes dropped more aid into Gaza. On this video, as you can see, the pallets of aid with parachutes attached falling to the ground. Several countries, including the U.S., have been flying airdrop missions. Earlier this week, Hamas asked countries to stop airdrops, calling them offensive, useless, and not the best way to bring in aid. Nearly 400 tons of food is on its way right now to Gaza by sea.

It comes as an Israeli delegation prepares to head to Washington. It's possible that could happen as early as Monday in order to meet after the canceled trip last week with American officials. What the United States is hoping to do is urge them to find ways of avoiding the full-scale assault, the ground offensive on Rafah that Israel's been threatening to carry out. Shortly, we heard again from Benjamin Netanyahu this week explaining that it was necessary in order to flush out those last four Hamas battalions that are believed to be holding out there. It is the fate of the 1.2 million Gazans currently huddled in and around the city in desperate conditions, in tents, and what their fate would be should such an assault went ahead that weighs heavily on the minds of the outside world. It comes, of course, as there is a glimmer of hope for the hostage negotiations. We understand that Israel will be sending its negotiators back both to Qatar and to Cairo in order to pick up those negotiations where they left off. The hope that Hamas can be convinced to make concessions on a couple of the most outstanding points, the most difficult points in these negotiations, the question of the return of civilians to the north of the Gaza Strip and the question of the continued presence of Israeli soldiers, and, of course, the question of the long-term fate of the territory beyond the six-week cease-fire at the heart of a potential deal.

And they have partners, spouses, who have cancer, so they're having to care for them as well. So I think the big challenge for the palace right now is showing that the monarchy is strong, showing they're active, and reassuring the public that they are still able to carry out their roles, even if they're not allowed out to meet the general public. But if you imagine that the monarchy is a brand in many ways. They don't say that much. They don't communicate that much. But the way they do portray themselves is through public events like this. So they're going to try and do as much as possible. William and Kate, without putting too much pressure on -- sorry, Camilla and William, without putting too much pressure on Charles and Kate.",

They are at their best when they're hot from three-point range. They've impressed a lot of people this season. It didn't look like that was going to happen early against Clemson.Crimson Tide guard Mark Sears started out the game 0-for-7, including 0-for-4 from beyond the arc. He scored his first points of the game with just over four minutes left in the first half. But then in the second half, the floodgates really opened. Sears draining shot after shot, finishing with a game-high 23 points with seven threes. Clemson had only allowed 14 threes in its first three NCAA tournament games combined. And 'bama coach Nate Oats cutting down the nets after the 89-82 win, sending the Tide to the Final Four for the very first time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
