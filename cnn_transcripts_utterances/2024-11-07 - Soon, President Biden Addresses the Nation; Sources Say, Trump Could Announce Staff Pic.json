What we are learning about Biden's message as the Democratic Party tries to figure out what went wrong.Plus, preparations are ramping up for Trump's promised mass deportation of migrants as his allies are now jockeying for cabinet positions, new CNN reporting coming to you on the behind the scenes strategy of the Trump transition. Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. All right, let's begin over at the White House. It's going to be a busy day over there. CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us live. Arlette, in the next hour we expect the president to address the nation on Trump's election victory. What do we expect the president to say?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, this will be the first time President Biden is speaking publicly since voters decided to send Donald Trump back to the White House next year. The president is expected to offer some reflections on the results of the election and talk about the way that the country needs to come together to move forward.The president also is expected to talk about the transition process. Aides have insisted that Biden remains committed to ensuring that there is a peaceful transfer of power because that is something that Trump did not afford to Biden back in 2020 when he had thrown up many roadblocks in the transition process and did not concede the race to the president. Now, Biden yesterday did speak by phone to congratulate Trump and invite him here to the White House. And sources say that meeting could potentially happen as early as next week. Now, Biden yesterday, in a statement, he praised vice president Kamala Harris saying that she ran a historic campaign under extraordinary circumstances. And the call last night also said that she was the best vice president that he could have asked for. But there will be a lot of questions going into the speech about whether the president will address what exactly went wrong for Democrats. In the last 48 hours, there has been a lot of soul searching, a lot of questioning about the messaging and strategy in this race. And many Democrats are pointing the blame directly at President Biden. Many frustrated with the fact that he decided to pursue a reelection bid at the age of 80. And then once he did drop out, that it left very little time to mount a campaign against Trump. So, these are all questions facing Biden in this moment. But it is clear that the loss of this race to Trump could very well impact the president's legacy. There is also Trump has said that he wants to undo some key initiatives from Biden's time in office. And Biden is now facing this new reality where his predecessor, the man that he once to beat in 2020, will be returning to the White House next year. These remarks today, hoping to provide the country with some advice on the way forward following these election results.",

President Biden is scheduled to speak during the next hour. What do you want to hear? REP. RITCHIE TORRES (D-NY):  I mean, hoping that the president can just give us hope, because it's going to be utterly despairing and depressing to live through the cycle drama of Donald Trump of a second Trump presidency. And I worry that Donald Trump is more emboldened than he's ever been and that a second Trump presidency is likely to be more vindictive than the first. And one of the fundamental differences between his first presidency and his subsequent presidency is the fact that he now enjoys absolute immunity, and he seems to be intent on exacting revenge against his political enemies.",

Donald Trump out on the campaign trail, he attempted to distance himself from Project 2025.But if Russ Vought becomes the White House, chief of staff, what do you think that means?

He made gains among Latinos in places like the Bronx back in 2020 during the public backlash against defund the police, and he built on those gains decisively in the 2024 election.If you were speaking to the far left, then you could be forgiven for thinking that defund the police is a popular movement in America. But if you're speaking to working class people of color, then you would realize that there was never a mass constituency for a movement like defund the police. And so we should be taking positions that aren't mine with the majority of Americans. Now, I want to be crystal clear, the majority of Democrats never endorsed a movement like defund the police.",

So, they see that that is not affecting them, and that's why they actually did support closing the border. LULAC took a position two years ago.
