If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories of this hour.Jury selection begins in the coming hours in the tax fraud trial of Donald Trump's company. The Trump Organization has been charged in a scheme that allegedly made off the books payments to executives. The company's former CFO Allen Weisselberg will testify as part of a plea deal. And we're just two weeks away and a day away from election night in America. Democrats are hoping to hold on to a majority in both the House and Senate as Republicans use inflation to reel in voters who are feeling the impact of rising prices. And we want to touch on Asia markets briefly. One standing out is Hong Kong ended the day down more than 6 percent. Shanghai lost 2 percent. And here is a quick look at how markets in Europe are doing right now. Shares have been mostly mixed. Meantime, in the U.S., Wall Street is just hours away from the opening bell. And here is a look at where futures stand right now. All three indexes are looking to open in the red just below nearly half a percent. Well, let's look ahead to a crucial U.S. economic report coming out this week. The Gross Domestic Product report card for the third quarter comes out on Thursday. And despite the volatile stock market rising interest rates, high inflation and a housing market that's losing steam, economists are predicting decent if not spectacular growth between 2.1 to 2.9 percent and that's because Americans are still spending despite rising prices and inflation. The GDP is largely based on consumer spending and according to government figures, retail sales were up more than 8 percent in September from a year ago. So, the economy has become a focal point in U.S. midterm elections with some blaming President Joe Biden for failing to turn things around. And with Mr. Biden's low approval ratings his own party appears to be keeping him away from the campaign trail. CNN's Joe Johns report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, here in London, all eyes are fixed on the Tory leadership race. And today we could find out who will become the next leader of the ruling Conservative Party and the new Prime Minister. Former finance minister Rishi Sunak and House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt are in the running. The Conservative Party will announce which candidates have received the necessary 100 nominations and whether a vote will follow.Joining me now from Oxford is Anand Menon, the director of the initiative U.K. in Changing Europe. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. As we understand it, Rishi Sunak is out in the lead. We know that he largely predicted Liz Truss's -- the failure of Liz Truss's mini budget and as chancellor he steered the U.K. economy through COVID. But is Sunak going to be skillful enough if he is to be the next Prime Minister to navigate a fractious Conservative Party on the one side and financial markets on the other side who are going to demand fiscal discipline? ANAND MENON, DIRECTOR, U.K. IN A CHANGING EUROPE: Well, I think you put your finger on problems that Rishi Sunak faces. We don't know what he's going to do. One of the curious things about this leadership contest, because it has been all about MPs, nothing's been said publicly about what the different candidates will do. So, Rishi Sunak's economic policy at the moment amounts to saying, I will fix the British economy. Now, no one knows what that means. So, the first thing is he has to spell out his plans. After that, as you quite rightly say, it's not just a matter of whether he can calm the markets. It's also a question as to whether or not he can bring the Conservative Party with him. Because, yes, he has got the support of almost half of Conservative MPs at the moment, I think. That means he hasn't got the support of another half. [04:40:00,] And with the majority of 80 he needs to bring the bulk of those MPs with him if he tries to pass legislation, for instance, raising taxes or if he tries to cut spending. So, there are real hurdles ahead for him even if he sort of has a coronation today around mid-day today.",

And we're hearing as well that Jeremy Hunt has given Sunak his endorsement. In the broader scheme of things, how important is that that Hunt has come out and endorsed Sunak ahead of this budget we know will be announced on Monday. Is this, you know, Britain's stability potentially getting back on the right track here?",

      "sentences": "Well, I suppose it's important in two ways. It's important one in terms of helping get other undecided conservative MPs to back Sunak if Hunter is backing him. And two, I suppose it will act as some sort of reassurance to the markets.But bear in mind all that Jeremy Hunt has done to date is say I'm not going to be a maverick like Kwasi Kwarteng was. I'm going to do things, you know, the old way, using the office of budget responsibility, taking forecasts seriously, bearing in mind the need to balance the books in the medium term. So that has reassured the markets. What Jeremy Hunt absolutely hasn't done yet is give any indication of where -- of how he's going to address what he himself calls these terribly difficult decisions that face him. Are we going to pay for our debts by raising taxes? Are we going to pay for them by cutting public spending? Those are the real political decisions that we're going to have to wait for his budget to see how he intends to address.",

One of them of course is the war in Ukraine. Is he going to -- is Sunak or Hunt going to have to recommit to the ongoing commitment spending on defense for Ukraine? We know that in the past, for instance, Defense Minister Ben Wallace has come out and said that is absolutely necessary that, you know, they continue with that. Can we expect Sunak to keep that position?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think back in the days a few weeks ago where money seemed to come freely and promises could be made with no thought of their implications for the public finances, Liz Truss said we're going to raise defense spending to 3 percent. Ben Wallace is very committed to that 3 percent number. Subsequently Liz Truss rolled back slightly by saying we will reach 3 percent by 2030. So, it's unclear where we are on that.Rishi Sunak, I think, is quite reluctant to pledge 3 percent to defense at a time when other budgets are going to be squeezed. So, for instance, the National Health Service already in crisis. If there's talk of cutting the budget of the health service, that's going to be politically very, very difficult indeed. So, Sunak is holding off the promise of 3 percent. One of the interesting see, is whether Ben Wallace, if he's offered the defense post will decide to keep it absent that promise. Because he has hinted if that 3 percent promise is watered down, he might walk.",

RSV case numbers in the U.S. are at their highest level in two years. This, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. RSV is a common cold- like virus but can make younger children seriously ill. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says parents should remain vigilant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: For parents who have children who have an upper respiratory infection, many times they're testing them, finding out it's not COVID and feeling relieved. I think they still need to be vigilant that it could be RSV, it could be early flu. So, if you see progressive symptoms seek out help from a doctor. There are treatments that are available that could help children with RSV. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
