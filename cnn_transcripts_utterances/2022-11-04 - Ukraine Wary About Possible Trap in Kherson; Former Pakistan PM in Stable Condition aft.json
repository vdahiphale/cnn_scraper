A flagpole with no flag has raised questions about a possible Russian retreat. So, too, talk of a troop withdrawal on Russian media from Kremlin- appointed city leaders. Tens of thousands of civilians have been evacuated from the city and surrounding areas. And while Russian troops have been digging in and fortifying defensive positions, there seems to be no sign of a mass troop pull-out from the region. All of this raising Ukrainian suspicion that, perhaps, the Russians have laid the groundwork for an ambush. And, right now, it seems the Russians are waiting, waiting for the harsh cold temperatures of the coming months. The E.U. foreign policy chief referred to General Winter coming to help Putin and its beleaguered army. Ongoing airstrikes have damaged or destroyed around 40 percent of Ukraine's electricity infrastructure. Millions have been left without electricity. And rolling blackouts are now part of daily life. More G-7 nations have promised to help Ukraine survive a brutally cold winter from a Russian assault the E.U. foreign policy chief said was a war crime. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, E.U. FOREIGN POLICY CHIEF: They are destroying the country systematically. They are bombing, destroying the civil infrastructure. Millions of Ukrainians have no longer access to electricity.

The issue that we were worried about so much a few weeks ago when Russian officials were calling their American and European counterparts and charging that the Ukrainians are about to set off a dirty bomb. So that's the situation we find ourselves in in the winter. It's hard to sort of believe that we're going to see serious negotiations this winter.
