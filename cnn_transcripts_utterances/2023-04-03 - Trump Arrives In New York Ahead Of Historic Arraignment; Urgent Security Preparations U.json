He was tweeting that this -- or he was posting on Truth Social that this was a witch hunt, proof that the country was, quote, going to hell, the once great country, that's what he wrote on Truth Social.He's using this also to energize his base, Wolf, because his political advisers, as they were flying up here, were tweeting that they have raised some $7 million, according to their claims. I should note not some FEC report that we have seen, some $7 million, though, since Thursday night when word of this indictment came down, so certainly using it to try to energize his base to try to rile round them up and essentially make this argument that he believes he is being targeted, and this is a political prosecution that is happening. And that is why he is going to be appearing before that judge tomorrow. And while he is -- yes. And while he is continuing with that, Wolf, I should know that this comes as what we're hearing from them internally is that, obviously, he does not want to be indicted, that this is something that is bothering him, that he does not want this, especially when it's a set of case as sensitive, as politically and personally sensitive as this one when it comes to allegations of an affair and whatnot. And so that is all playing a factor into this. Of course, the question of how they are going to use the images that you saw today of him getting off of his plane, making his way through the streets of New York, going into the courthouse tomorrow, they plan to use all of that for campaign purposes as well as they're watching it very closely.

Do you say, Mr. President, I'm Detective Jones, you're under arrest? Do you call him, Mr. Trump?You then have to do the electronic fingerprint scans and his prints to Albany, wait for them to come back, and then you're escorting a former president of the United States. At the arraignment, the indictment will be on sealed. If it is not unsealed before that, presumably, they will waive the reading of the indictment, having scanned it. They want to get their not guilty plea in there. They want to reserve all their rights to have motions to dismiss the case once they study that indictment and tell the judge that they're going to be back and that they need a hearing date. But, really, what they want to do is get out of that courtroom and get back to the airport and back to Mar-a-Lago, where Trump can do two things. One, actually go through those charges with his lawyer and see what it is they're facing, and, two, determine, strategy-wise, how they're going to face off against that with the public appearance that's scheduled for Mar-a-Lago that night with a friendly crowd and what's going to be a strong fight back message.",

Is the misdemeanor charge of falsifying books and records, here you have that because they booked Trump and others booked hush money payments as legal fees. They weren't.

And some of the reasons that they may try to get the case thrown out are, number one, making an argument that perhaps the trial should be moved somewhere else, as opposed to Manhattan, or, number two, like Norm was saying a moment ago, trying to dismiss the case on the basis of it was a federal charge or something like that.

But tomorrow morning, we'll start seeing some of the roads shut down, more barricades will be out and this street here, at some point, will get closed while the former president is inside the courthouse. The concern here is obviously supporters and protesters who may come here. Some are expected to gather here in this park tomorrow, Wolf.

And he argues that something like this is a witch hunt, and he can point to that as proof.We saw that as he was trying to pressure the district attorney here when it came to saying that, you know, he was going to be arrested and saying that people needed to come out and protest, as he did over two weeks ago, which has given the city quite amount of time to prepare for this. But one thing I am told is that Trump has been calling Republican lawmakers you wanted to see a significant showing here in New York. We know Marjorie Taylor Greene is a congresswoman who is leading those efforts. We will see if maybe a George Santos or others who have mold showing up actually come tomorrow, but he wanted to have that significant public showing of support here in New York.

They're trying to nail down through those witnesses how Donald Trump himself was handling classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after the presidency and specifically after the Justice Department was seeking to get back all of those records that he may have had and that he did have until the FBI searched the premises. We also know that they are collecting emails, text, notes, photographs. Kaitlan Collins was able to confirm yesterday that Molly Michael, an assistant to Donald Trump, she also provided notes showing what Donald Trump was doing, who he was meeting with on a regular basis.

As you might suspect 94 percent of Democrats, nearly universal on the Democratic side, approve but 62 percent of independents, that's a big number for the critical voting block in the middle there, and even one in five Republicans approve of the indictment.

Take a look. 37 percent of Americans say it's illegal what Donald Trump has done here, 33 percent say it's unethical but not illegal.

Only 10 percent of Americans, Wolf, say Donald Trump has done nothing wrong at all in this case. And then sort of along the lines of Donald Trump has been arguing to his supporters, do Americans see this as a political matter? Overwhelmingly, they do. 76 percent of Americans say politics played a role in Bragg's decision in the grand jury's decision to indict Donald Trump.
