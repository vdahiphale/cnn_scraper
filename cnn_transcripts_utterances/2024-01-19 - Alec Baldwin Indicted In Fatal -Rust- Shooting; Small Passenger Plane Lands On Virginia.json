      "sentences": "Yes, for our viewers, if this sounds familiar, it's because it is. This is now the second time that actor Alec Baldwin is being criminally charged for his alleged role in that fatal shooting back in October 2021 on the set of the movie \"Rust\" in New Mexico.Now, to reminder our viewers that after that initial incident, authorities conducted their investigation, prosecutors ultimately determining in their view that Alec Baldwin was criminally responsible for being the person holding that weapon when it went off, fatally shooting cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Now, interestingly and importantly, those charges were ultimately dropped. Prosecutors at the time said that that's because new evidence had come to light really raising questions about a piece of evidence in that case. A law enforcement source told me that the evidence in question was the gun itself and whether over some period of time it had been modified, which, of course, would raise all kinds of questions about it being presented as evidence. But authorities said at the time that they will continue their investigation. And if they ultimately do determine that they believe Alec Baldwin is responsible, they will seek additional charges. That is what happened we're learning today. A grand jury in the state of New Mexico returning an indictment. I'll read you these two charges. Count one, involuntary manslaughter, negligent use of a firearm. Count two, involuntary manslaughter without due caution or circumspection. Now, this is a bit of legalese, but although these are two counts, the way that this is being charged, if Alec Baldwin is ultimately convicted, a jury will only sentence him on one charge or the other. So not both charges, but nevertheless, he is now criminally charged once again. As far as how this investigation came to light and what authorities found, I want to play just a short clip here. This was from our exclusive interview with the initial prosecutor in the case who told CNN what they found as they went through their investigation and why they thought charges were applicable at the time against Baldwin. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, NEW MEXICO'S FIRST JUDICIAL DA: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set that there were live rounds on set. They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those or at least they weren't checking them consistently. And then they somehow got loaded into a gun, handed off to Alec Baldwin. He didn't check it. He didn't do any of the things that he was supposed to do to make sure that he was safe or that anyone around him was safe and then he pointed the gun at Halyna Hutchins and he pulled the trigger.

It's my job to understand what a firearm does. And these are kind of a weird kind of cowboy gun. It's not your standard revolver, so I'm very mixed on the - on this indictment, I have to admit.",

There's a story of Jon-Erik Hexum, an actor in the '80s, and he picked the gun off a prop table, put it to his head in a joke and ended up sending about a quarter-sized piece of a skull into his brain. And that was just loaded with blanks.And it's kind of changed the way things have done. And nobody is allowed to touch a firearm on my set unless I authorize it. It goes from my holster to the talent's hands. And then once that's - once cut is called, it goes right back into my holster.",

I do think it sets a very difficult standard and at what point does an actor have reason to believe that what he's told is what he's told, that that information could be relied upon? And I think to Scott's point, you're going to have many jurors when they assess whether or not Alec Baldwin was negligent to the degree that it rises to a crime.What was his responsibility? Did he have the right to take into account what someone told him? What are the protocols? Were there breakdowns prior to the gun even getting into his hands? Was the gun modified in any way such that it went off without him having to exert any power or pressure, as he indicated he didn't do? And so to Scott's indication, he, in essence, right, in his statements, it's sort of - I'm envisioning what they'll be saying if it gets this far in a jury room in terms of who's responsible. Yes, there's someone dead here. That's very significant. A meaningful, precious life has been taken away. The issue is whether it was his negligence that was the result of that and that's what a jury will have to determine. But it does, Boris, set a very, very difficult precedent moving forward.",

Schools were closed today in north of Virginia because of the snow, not a lot of people out driving at the time, don't really need to intermix an airplane with the traffic.The one risk here of an engine failure after takeoff of an airplane that is a single engine like this, so just one propeller is you can't really go back. You can't really turn back for the runway. It's known as the impossible turn. It can be very dangerous. So you have to make a little bit of a turn left or a little bit of a turn right and commit to something and land. And that is exactly what this crew did. Typically, these flight on these commuter flights are relatively new to aviation, getting their feet wet in commercial flying. Give this pilot a promotion and maybe a job at a mainline airline. They did a tremendous job of getting this airplane on the ground and really not all that much damage. You can see the propeller curled there a little bit. Of course, that'll be something investigators will want to look at. Maybe the question is whether or not this airplane was still producing a little bit of power instead of a complete power loss. I would be speculating there. Of course, that'll be something that investigators will want to look into. But this was an incredible job done in really challenging conditions. And they had to react very quickly, only at about a thousand feet above the ground. Not a lot of time to react.",

On the tail, it's only a part of the tail.Now because the pilots are going to be able to tell the FAA and the NTSB exactly what happened and that he was losing power and things like that, they won't have to wonder if it was tale icing or an icing problem. But whenever you have weather like we're experiencing today, and I'm in Pennsylvania where the flight was headed, the weather's terrible here too, they always look at that. They want to make sure that that didn't have anything to do with it if all those systems were working well. And then, of course, you have to know if your plane can take the weather before you take off. But that does not seem to be what happened because the pilot said they didn't have sufficient power.

How significant is it that the A.G. weighed in on this election subversion case against Donald Trump? NICK AKERMAN, FORMER ASST. SPECIAL WATERGATE PROSECUTOR: I think it's pretty significant. The problem, of course, is that Donald Trump and his minions have been doing everything they can to denigrate this case, call it a witch hunt, say it's uncalled for, that it's election interference. I think it's very important that somebody weigh in and talk about the importance of this case and what it means and certainly the attorney general is the proper person to do that. Keep in mind that normally the Justice Department really can't talk much about a case and Attorney General Garland didn't say much about this case. But there is that kind of problem where you've got Donald Trump and his group just lobbing lots of grenades at this case, all of which, are for the most part, lies.
