And Republicans when they look at the map, this is the house map right here, Republicans increasingly confident heading into these final 13 days. Let's walk through it.Right now the state of play in the House 220 Democrats, 212 Republicans. Republicans need only a net gain of five to take control of the House. A couple of weeks ago, it was eight to 20 maybe Republican predictions. Now some Republicans think they actually could get higher than 20. Some are talking even 30. Why are they going there? Let me just show you this. We won't go too deep into detail. But look at the map of competitive House races. CNN working with inside elections as 78 competitive seats. You'll see these numbers add up to only 75. That's because three of these competitive seats are brand new house districts drawn up after redistricting. Look at all the blue on the map, Democrats on defense. 53 of these competitive seats currently held by Democrats, 22 currently held by Republicans and look where you see the blue. Republicans think they can pick up seats in New Hampshire, in Rhode Island, in Maine, traditionally, blue states and then come across the country out in California, even in Oregon and Washington State places that have been democratic blue for quite some time. Republicans believe they are in play heading into the final 10 days or so. Democrats have some opportunities as well. You see them there, but the Democrats are defending pretty easy to map. They're defending more seats in the Republicans. That's the House. Now let's flip over to the Senate. And you look at the battle for control. You don't need me to say a word the numbers at the top lay out the stakes 50 to 50 for the Democrats. The Vice President currently breaks the tie. You have the toss up race in Pennsylvania and in Georgia right there. You have backup races, you might say to watch North Carolina and Wisconsin, a big race out in Nevada and in Arizona. Here's one scenario for you. Why do the Democrats think picking up this seat is so important, currently held by Republican Pat Toomey not running for reelection. The Fetterman-Oz debate was last night. Democrats believe it's critical that they take this because they are nervous. Let's say everything else stays the same until we get out here. Democrats increasingly nervous about this one, and they fear the Republican candidate could win in Nevada, which would keep it 50-50. If the Republicans can hold on in Pennsylvania, and the Democrats pick up Nevada, if those were the only chances then Republicans take the majority. There are other races as well. But that's a narrow debate about how far the Senate will go in the final days. And out in Nevada, the number one issue Adam Laxalt the Republican candidate has spent more money on ads about inflation than any Republican candidate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Democrats wish that the election was early September. They would have felt much better than they do now. There's been a lot of interesting moves. There's a lot of attention on the Senate. But there's been a lot of interesting moves in the House where Democrats are having to retreat in districts that they thought that they were going to be able to pick up. They're completely on offense, trying to hold on to seats, the fact that they are working they're fretting about New York, and California and Oregon traditionally, I believe say Rhode Island. And I'm told by some Democratic sources that some of the problem in these traditionally blue states that have Democratic governors is that there are some sagging support of these democratic governors that is flowing down to these House races. And that's why you're seeing these polls tighten in New York with Kathy Hochul and Lee Zeldin, that no one expected.",

The question is, who wins the ad war at the end?LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, I mean, look, it ultimately comes down to as many midterms do base turnout. So Democrats clearly view based on what you just showed there, John, that abortion is what is going to motivate the key pieces of their base, whether it's young voters, whether it's voters color, as well, as women, you know. We've seen women, particularly white women kind of go back and forth between the Republican and Democrats. And so ultimately, you know, in 2018 for women, it ended up being gun safety and health care, is abortion going to be enough there for Democrats to defy history, because it's the first midterm under a Democratic president, or whatever president ism whatever party is ultimately in power, it tends to go the other way. And so again, they're really trying to defy history and Dobbs gave them an opportunity to try to do that.
