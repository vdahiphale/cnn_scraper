A short time ago, officials said areas around the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Nikopol were hit with dozens of shells and rockets. So far, there are no reports of casualties. The attacks came as Ukraine races to repair its power system, which came under a wave of Russian strikes on Wednesday.Officials say the country now has about half its usual power supply. More power plants are slowly coming back online, but Ukrainians say the process is taking a while because Wednesday strikes left much of Ukraine in the dark, and for the first time in decades temporarily took all of its nuclear power plants offline. Have a look here. These satellite images show you how much Russian attacks are hurting Ukraine's power supply. So, the image on the left, that is from January, showing lights all over the country, and then the on the right is from this month with most of Ukraine, as you can see, in the dark there. Now in Kyiv, doctors had to perform heart surgery by flashlight after their hospital lost power halfway through the procedure. This video shows them doing the surgery on a child while waiting for generators to kick in. President Zelenskyy spoke about power outages Thursday night. Here he is.

He said that artillery attacks have been ongoing since that withdrawal. And I can tell you as well, this morning, Kim, that we are seeing more reports of Russian shelling. Apparently, according to the head of the regional military administration in Zaporizhzhia, there was a rocket attack just on the outskirts of that city, also further west down the Dnipro River and near the cities of Nikopol. Apparently, 70 Russian shells -- at least 70 Russian shells hit towns and villages there. No casualties are reported yet. That coming also from a local Ukrainian official.

When I just look outside of my window, it is really a ghost town here in Beijing in the middle of a work day because most people have been told to work from home and many commercial office buildings have closed their doors and the authorities have shut down most shopping malls and other public venues like gyms and restaurants, not to mention schools. Now they, of course, have switch to virtual learning, but that's really comfort for many parents, including myself, with very young children. But remember, just two weeks ago, the central government here announced a series of new protocols in terms of relaxing certain aspects of the enforcement of the zero-COVID policy, the thing being to minimize economic and social disruptions. But instead what has happened is now many local officials, including here in Beijing, are simply doing it without saying it in terms of implementing very draconian rules because they do not want to be seen to contradict that new directive. So, that, as you can imagine, has even created more chaos and confusion, not to mention more anger and more frustration on the ground. We have seen those violent clashes between workers and security forces at that Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou. There are other instances like this in other parts of the country as well. The other problem, of course, is supply for many people who are under lockdown, including here in Beijing. The authorities, of course, insist that there is plenty of food and supplies available, both in store and online.

It calls on the M23 rebel group to withdraw from occupied territories of the DRC. But Agence France-Presse reports that the rebels say the agreement doesn't concern them because they weren't part of the summit. Zain Asher reports on the regional force that couldn't be deployed if diplomacy fails.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN ASHER, CNN ANCHOR (voiceover): Soldiers with the Kenya defense forces arrive at Goma airport in the Democratic Republic of Congo. These members of the East African Community regional force are part of an operation hoping to stabilize the region as fighting between the DRC army and M23 rebels intensifies. As the M23 advanced closer to the eastern city of Goma, the KDF military commander says that his priority is both diplomacy and disarming the rebels. MAJ. GEN. JEFF NYAGAH, COMMANDER, EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY REGIONAL FORCE: We have over 120 armed groups within DRC and they have instigated a significant degree of insecurity. If these two trucks fails, then we'll automatically transit to the third truck. That is military action.",

Amnesty begins next week.\"The waters off eastern Cuba are teeming with sharks and the island nation is letting visitors swim with them so they can learn how important they are to the food chain and to help boost tourism. Patrick Oppmann takes us underwater for the story. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Usually, they are the last thing you want to see in the ocean. But sharks are the reason why we have come here to the waters off eastern Cuba. We're hoping to see the predators up close and with no cage. Local guides say this is the only place in Cuba perhaps one of only a handful in the world where divers can safely swim alongside bull sharks. We are taking them at their word, praying the sharks had a big breakfast. Bull sharks are considered some of the most aggressive in the world. For the ones we see, seem mostly curious, swimming around me for a closer look before gliding away. Guide Lazaro says they want to teach visitors to respect sharks and to protect them.",
