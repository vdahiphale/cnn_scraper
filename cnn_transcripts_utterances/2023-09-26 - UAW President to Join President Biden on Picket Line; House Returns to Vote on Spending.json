And that's perhaps why the president is choosing this moment now to go there.But it also shows this potential contrast with former President Trump, who is going to Michigan tomorrow to address current and former union members. Now, the White House officially denies that there is any connection between the president's visit and the former president's plans to deliver a speech in Detroit tomorrow. But, look at this White House fact sheet that the White House released just this morning, talking about the fact that former President Trump talked a big game but did not deliver in the way that President Biden has for union workers. Contrasting President Biden's economic record, his record on manufacturing and his record specifically with unions with that of the former president. Talking, for example, about bringing manufacturing back to the United States, policies that incentivize union work to be done with that manufacturing, comparing that to the Trump tax cuts, which the Biden administration says did not benefit the working class. But this will certainly be one of our first signs of a preview of this potential 2024 matchup as both of these candidates have repeatedly tried to vie for that working-class vote. President Biden has called himself the most pro-union president. He has racked up a series of union endorsements. The one endorsement he has yet to secure, though, is that of the UAW's. And that is, perhaps, a part of his visit today, is to do the work to try and get that endorsement. Shawn Fain, the president of the UAW, is expected to be with President Biden as the president goes to the picket line today in Wayne County, Michigan. We don't know exactly where that will be. But once again, an opportunity for President Biden to tout his pro-union bona fides. But whether or not he supports everything the UAW is doing here. The White House press secretary said simply the president is standing with union workers, but she would not say whether he endorses all of their positions in these negotiations -- Phil, Poppy.",

Because that is the piece of legislation that, if it can get passed out of that chamber, could potentially stave off a shutdown on Saturday at midnight.The Senate negotiators, between Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's staff and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's staff, they continued to work into the night last night, trying to find a path forward that would fund the government for just a matter of weeks at this point. It would not be a one-year spending bill but just a short-term stopgap to get them over that deadline. The expectation is that bill may not be able to include the full supplemental funding for Ukraine aid. That is because you have warnings from conservatives, like Senator Rand Paul, who are arguing they will slow down the process to get this bill moving through the Senate. And given the fact there are time constraints, because this deadline is coming Saturday night, that is a big consideration here for Republicans and Democrats. Even though there are plenty of members in that chamber who would like to include disaster aid and Ukraine funding. So those pieces are still being negotiated and worked out, but given the fact that we don't have many -- much time left, Phil, you may see a situation where that bill may be unveiled as soon as today. Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, there still is not a clear path forward. There is still not consensus among House Republicans on what a short-term solution would even look like. That is setting up the scenario that, if the Senate can pass their bill quickly and out of their chamber, they could potentially put McCarthy in a position where he would be jammed, as we say, in congressional speak, by the United States Senate. And then would have to make that very important and impactful decision: Does he put this negotiated piece of legislation on the floor?

They have to determine at that point if these individuals have a legal basis to stay in the United States. If not, they are deported. If they're able to stay, they get something called an NTA, a notice to appear. That's a notice to appear in immigration court. These individuals have to go through immigration proceedings, and in essence, they have to defend themselves. Tell the court that they have a right to stay here. A lot of them in many cases do seek asylum. Now, where are these individuals going? According to this analysis, they're going to all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
