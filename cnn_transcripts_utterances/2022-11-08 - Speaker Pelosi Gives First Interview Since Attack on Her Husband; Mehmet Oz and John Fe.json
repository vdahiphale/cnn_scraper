They've decided, the Senate race they decided the primary or there were attempts to try to make this the Republican primary. So there's been a back and forth in the courts. The state court has gone one way, the federal courts have gone another. What the federal courts did find is that, you know, a 2021 case over these ballots, is that there's actually no proof that the dating actually prevents fraud or any sort of misuse. And also I think it's worth noting that most of the reporting that's been done finds that people who are misdating them are usually older folks who, you know, this is their best option for voting is to fill out mail-in ballots than going to the polling place and they just forget to put the date or they put the wrong date because they got confused. And the universe maybe like we're not entirely sure. But I think the most recent count we've seen is about 7,000 ballots of these are out there. And, you know, it will be decided.

The International Legion in Ukraine identified the man killed as Timothy Griffin and called him a brother in arms. Both the State Department and the International Legion said that they were in touch with Griffin's family. They have asked for privacy. At least five other Americans have been killed in action, fighting alongside Ukraine forces since the Russian invasion began in February.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it is interesting. In a sense, of course we all know it's true, that Russia has been meddling in elections in the United States and elsewhere around the world as well. But this is the first time the man or one of the men who has been accused of spearheading those interference activities has come out and sort of basically sort of said that, yes, we did it.I mean, he was being ironic. He was being sarcastic. But take a look at what he said. It's quite compelling. He said, \"Gentlemen, we interfered. We interfere and we will interfere carefully, precisely, surgically, and in our own way.\" He went on to make other sort of references to the surgical operations that he's carried out. But, Poppy, I think it's important to remember as I've just said, he was being sarcastic, he was being ironic. This is not a change of Russian government policy or position on this issue. Everybody who's spoken about this in the Russian government in the past 24 hours has stuck to the Kremlin line that there was no meddling, and if there was, Russia was not involved.",

I think he's just trying to sort of do what the whole purpose of Russian meddling is in the first place. Remember, and I think this is important, you know, the whole purpose of Russian meddling isn't necessarily to change the outcome of the election in the United States.They don't have the reach, they don't have the power to do that. But it's to sew anxiety about the institutions of the election, about the democratic institutions. And Russian meddling has been very successful in doing that. This is another attempt to push that agenda.",
