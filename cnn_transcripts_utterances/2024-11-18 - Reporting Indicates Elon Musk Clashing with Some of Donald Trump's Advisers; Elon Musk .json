The policy and posturing among world leaders now after Donald Trump's decisive victory and Biden's major announcement on Ukraine as he's headed for the exits.And there's new pressure today to publicize details from investigations into one of Donald Trump's top cabinet picks, that man, Matt Gaetz. What really is in that House Ethics report into allegations of underage sex and drug use by the Florida Republican, and how hard are Republicans and Democrats ready to fight over it? Sean \"Diddy\" Combs being accused now by prosecutors of trying to obstruct their investigation and taint the jury pool, all from behind bars. I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner and John Berman, and this is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR:  All right, developing this morning, reports that new first best friend Elon Musk is starting to irritate President-elect Trump's advisers. During a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, \"Axios\" reports a heated confrontation between Musk and Trump adviser and attorney Boris Epshteyn. They write, quote, \"At one point during what the sources described as a massive blowup, Musk accused Epshteyn of leaking details of Trump's transition, including personnel picks, to the media. Epshteyn responded by telling Musk that he didn't know what he was talking about.\" This comes amid new reports that Musk is also becoming a source of infighting in the Trump transition team surrounding the choice for Treasury Secretary. Musk is backing Trump transition co-chair and fellow billionaire Howard Lutnick for the job, while Trump's advisers are pushing for hedge fund CEO Scott Bessent. The billionaire not only putting his two or ten cents in, but also asking his more than 200 million followers to weigh in. He posted to Twitter, quote, \"Would be interesting to hear more people weigh in on this for @realDonaldTrump to consider feedback. My view, for what it's worth, is Bessent is a business as usual choice, whereas Howard Lutnick will actually enact change. Business as usual is driving America bankrupt. We need change one way or another.\" With us now is national political correspondent for \"Politico\" Meridith McGraw. You know, it's pretty interesting. So Musk is in the room where it happens a lot of time, but he's also tweeting from outside the room trying to influence things. MEREDITH MCGRAW, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"POLITICO\":  Well, it's not just Musk who has inserted himself into the transition. It's really Trump's whole early kitchen cabinet here, advisors, people, Mar-a-Lago members, friends that are weighing in. But Musk is spending a lot of time with Donald Trump since he got elected. He's been an ever-present person at Trump's side at his club. He's sitting in on meetings. He's traveling with him like he did this weekend to the professional UFC fight in New York City. And he is spending a lot of time with Trump. He's giving his insight and input on some of these picks, including most recently, treasury secretary, which is one of the last really big remaining cabinet picks that Trump has yet to announce. And there's already been some infighting behind the scenes and jockeying between different potential candidates, including Howard Lutnick, who is currently co-chair of Trump's transition, hedge fund CEO Scott Bessent, and some other dark horse candidates who have now, their names have come up because of this back and forth and different people getting involved in the process.",

And you know, that's what I've always focused on. And I think we need to get back to basics a bit here. Obviously, always fighting for Jersey values and making sure we protect things like reproductive freedom and stand up for clean air and clean water and commonsense gun safety. But we also have to make sure we communicate to people that we're about getting their backs and getting their costs down.

And so far, that group involves, like, the governor of Illinois, of Colorado, California. So the question to you is, do you think that you would join that group? GOTTHEIMERsaid, is you want to stand up and fight for Jersey, and whether that's fighting President-Elect Trump or fighting anyone who messes with Jersey, when the time is right and making sure we protect things like reproductive freedom and stand strong for the environment and making sure our climate is safe. But also you want to work together when it makes sense. You know I co- chair this group called the Problem Solvers Caucus with Democrats and Republicans. And my feeling is always if it's good for Jersey and the people I represent, the families here and leads up to our values, we should work with folks. But obviously stand up to him when we need to protect the families of Jersey. And I think that's the approach any governor should take, or, frankly, any elected official.",

Gaetz was investigated over sexual misconduct and illegal drug use allegations. Gaetz has denied those allegations. Let's get right to CNN's senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz.

      "sentences": "Yes, so some of what the House Ethics Committee has learned, John, comes from a lawsuit in Florida where witnesses, young women were making statements under oath. The same women who also participated in the criminal inquiry against Matt Gaetz.These women were at a party in 2017 where an alleged sexual encounter with an underage girl took place and they've never spoken publicly about what was happening, including potentially with Gaetz. But in a deposition of a man who brought the lawsuit. This is a friend of Matt Gaetz, attorneys asked him about what the women were saying in their depositions about a then underage girl having sex with Matt Gaetz while his friend watched, about an array of drugs at the party. The friend of Matt Gaetz, Christopher Dorworth, suggested in his testimony that the women were making up their stories. And of course, Matt Gaetz is denying any wrongdoing, and he was never charged with any crime. But a source familiar with these Congressional Investigations told CNN that if the House Ethics Committee's work includes information from this litigation, presumably the part that's still secret, what the women were saying it would be \"highly damaging\" for Gaetz. Of course, the House wasn't able to get access to records from the Justice Department's criminal investigation. So now, there's pressure mounting in Washington on the House Ethics Committee. Their work ended whenever Gaetz was announced as Trump's nominee for the Justice Department last week, and then resigned from Congress meaning the report's release, it's now in jeopardy. But here's Speaker Mike Johnson assessing the situation over the weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): My understanding is that the report is not finished. It's in a rough draft form, was not yet ready to be released, and since Matt Gaetz left the Congress, I don't think it's appropriate to do so. There have been I understand, I think, two exceptions to the rule over the whole history of Congress and the history of the Ethics Committee, but I wasn't the speaker at that time. I'm the speaker now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He wants peace and he's going to find a way to make it. The open question is whether it will be a just peace, whether President Trump can pull this off. And we know that he wants to do it.
