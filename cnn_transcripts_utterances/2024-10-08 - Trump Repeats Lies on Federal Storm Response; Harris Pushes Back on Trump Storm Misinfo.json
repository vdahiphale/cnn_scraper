Tonight, a mass exodus in Florida, many residentswho had only just returned from Hurricane Helene are now fleeing once again as extremely strong Hurricane Milton threatens the state. We have the very latest for you. This as Donald Trump uses misleading comments to politicize storm aid. Details on what he said and what the truth is. And Israeli forces hoist their flag on the outskirts of the Lebanese border village as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu   issues a stark warning to Lebanese citizens. We'll have more from the region in just a moment. But first, tonight, Hurricane Milton is on track to pummel Florida's central Gulf Coast as soon as Wednesday evening, while it is expected to make landfall as a Category 3 hurricane. Meteorologists warn it could be one of the most destructive storms on record. And take a look at this time-laps we're showing you here from NASA, and you can see Hurricane Milton's massive size as it moves across the Gulf of Mexico. Hundreds of thousands are evacuating, you can see there, highways in Florida clogged and some gas stations are running low on fuel. Milton's arrival comes less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene, which made landfall in Florida's Big Bend area in the north part of the state. U.S. President Joe Biden is urging people to get out while there is still time. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Here in Fort Myers, business after business after business has put a plywood, they have sandbags out, all in anticipation of what we expect to be some significant flooding. This one business here behind me has just started in the last couple of minutes inflating a water dam. What they're doing, what you're taking a look at right there is an inflatable dam. They're filling it with water all in an effort to try to keep some of the flooding out of this business. I'll tell you though, not really sure how much this is going to work considering that the storm surge that is being forecasted for this part of southwest Florida is anywhere between 6 to 10 feet. And so, if that does materialize, that water is going to be well above that inflatable dam here behind me. Part of why this part of Fort Myers is a part of an evacuation zone is because there is a rather sizable -- a major river, about a block and a half from where we are. It's called the Caloosahatchee River, it goes out into the Gulf of Mexico, and it also goes into Lake Okeechobee, which is in the central part of Florida. What's going to happen -- what the forecast is calling for is that as the storm continues to make its way north and makes landfall, as it stands right now, just to the north of us, we are still going to see all of that storm surge, we're still going to see all of that rainfall anywhere between 6 to 8 inches over a 24-hour period. And then when you add in high tide, the fear is that, that river, the Caloosahatchee is going to overflow, it is going to crest. And so, it is going to have to end up going somewhere, and that somewhere is where we are standing. This area is known to flood, two years ago, Hurricane Ian just pretty much destroyed a good part of Lee County and flooded a great deal of Fort Myers, where we are and a large part of the damage was the flooding brought on by the Caloosahatchee River. And so, these folks are taking the storm serious, they're trying to do everything they can to try to keep some of this water out. But I've got to tell you, if the storm-surge predictions hold, I'm not entirely sure that, that inflatable --",

And the last thing you want are pieces of furniture and cabinetry and water tanks, you know, being thrown around in 100 and 125-mile per hour winds. As for whether or not folks are getting out, I can tell you, having a crossover from south Florida last night, people are hitting the roads. They are trying to get over to south Florida on the eastern side of Florida if they live north of where we are, they're trying to get more inland into the Orlando area. And then if they're not going to the Orlando area, they're just trying to get farther north from where they live in the Tampa Bay area, because as you noted, the forecast track, if that holds, we're looking at a very powerful storm that's going to hit the Tampa Bay area over the next couple of days.",

That is not actually true, but a lot of people apparently believed it. It's just a down payment which you can get, use to buy food and shelter, et cetera, in the immediate aftermath, then you can get help up to about $40,000 afterwards.

You know, he's got a 50-50 chance of winning now. More broadly, Trump uses falsehoods as a way of imposing power on his party and his voters. If he says something is true and people buy into it, he, therefore, gets power over them. It's like in 1984, George Orwell, when the party declares white is black and black is white, and everyone has to buy into that narrative. In a deeper sense, also, Trump tries to delegitimize sources of accountability. The Justice Department, the federal government, Congress, the media, in order to break against the constraints that constrain his power, if you like. We've seen this, for example, in places like Hungary with Viktor Orban, where institutions are devalued, and that leaves a vacuum where the strongman can come in and say they're the only legitimate source of authority.

The National HurricaneCenter says landfall will happen overnight from Wednesday into Thursday. And the powerful storm has already lashed Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, as you saw there. Milton could end up being one of the most destructive hurricanes on record. For the latest, I want to bring in our meteorologist, Elisa Raffa. And, Elisa, what is clear, you know, you and I have been talking the past kind of 48 hours, we have seen how quickly Milton has built up in magnitude and strength in such a short period. I remember you saying that you went to bed, I think, on Monday, it was Category 1 and you woke up, it was a Category 3 or 4. Do we have a sense, though, at this stage, what is likely to be the most dangerous? Is it wind speed that was, I think, 180 miles per hour, or is it storm surge or was it -- I mean, was it both?",

I actually was just talking to a storm surge expert and he said, you can always hide from the wind, but you need to run away from the water. You cannot face 15 feet of ocean just coming in. The storm surge definitely is deadly. The wind, though, that will knock out power and can also cause problems with a lot of trees down, too, and it amplifies that storm surge problem. 155 mile per hour winds in this hurricane right now. That eye, it is wide, it is clear, it is perfectly circular, classic signs of an incredibly strong hurricane. We are teetering on that Category 5 strength. We are a half a step away there. So, this is incredibly strong hurricane still. And again, you can see where that eye is just continuing to be so wide and so clear. It teeters in straight a little bit as it heads towards the Florida Coast, but it gets fatter, it gets wider. So, those winds will expand from coast- to-coast. Hurricane warnings from the West Coast of Florida all the way to the East Coast. We're looking at hurricane force winds even in Orlando. You have that purple area, Tampa, 110 plus mile per hour winds down to Sarasota. And again, hurricane force winds stretching to the other side of the state as the storm just becomes so wide. Tropical storm force winds over the entire peninsula. And then you see the red, that's the hurricane force that goes from coast to coast to coast, that's going to cause your problems with the power. This is the storm surge, the unsurvivable part, why the evacuation orders are in effect, and it's for that up to 15 feet of storm surge from Tampa down to Fort Myers, even up to 10 feet around the Fort Myers in Naples area. Again, you cannot -- you just can't survive that. We'll find these impacts starting to come in through the day on Wednesday, landfall happening in the middle of the night going into Thursday, Isa.",

Here's the latest from FlightAware. The cancellations and delays just keep on climbing. 700 cancellations in the U.S. so far. Today, 1,300 delays nationwide. Still pretty early, though, and the FAA says there could be ground stops in Miami and Fort Lauderdale today, which could cause these numbers to rise. Really pales in comparison for the numbers for tomorrow. FlightAware reports more than 1,500 flights have already been canceled on Wednesday. Here's what's driving this. So, many airports are closing or have already closed. Tampa International Airport, the first on the list to close, shuttled -- is shuttered to commercial flights and passengers at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. Sarasota Bradenton closing at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. St. Petersburg Clearwater closing after the final flight today. Southwest Florida in Fort Myers closing after the final flight today as well. And then, Orlando International Airport, one of the busiest in the state, closing at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight time on Wednesday. You may be asking why these airports are closing so early since the storm isn't set to make landfall in Florida until late on Wednesday, maybe early Thursday. Tampa International Airport says there is really little doubt that it'll be thrashed by the storm surge since it's right on Tampa Bay. And right now, workers there are chaining all 58 jet bridges to the ground. I want you to listen now to the head of airport operations, who says that workers will do a damage assessment after the storm passes, but there's really no telling when the airport could reopen.

The White House declined to comment, only saying the relationship between the United States and Israel is as strong as ever. In the book, Mr. Biden also reportedly told advisers that Russian President Vladimir Putin was, quote, \"the epitome of evil\" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Woodward writes that at one point Biden's national security team believed there was a 50 percent chance that Russia would use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Enlightening indeed.
