President Joe Biden, though, facing pressure at home to ease those restrictions, even as a number of U.S. officials remain concerned such a move could, in fact, escalate the conflict. This topic sure to be a part of the discussions today, when the UK's Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, meets with President Biden. The two also expected to discuss efforts to secure a hostage release and ceasefire deal for the war in Gaza.And while the U.S. and the UK debate allowing Ukraine to launch long- range missiles further into Russia, the reality is they're already at use inside Ukraine. CNN's Clare Sebastian has a look here at the potential targets, though, if Ukraine does, in fact, get that go ahead. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This believed to be a British Storm Shadow, a long-range stealth cruise missile hitting Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Crimea last year, but Russian territory has been off limits. Now, a major reason for that is, of course, Western fears of Russian escalation. But, recently, the U.S. has also been arguing that actually lifting those restrictions wouldn't make much difference on the battlefield, because it claims many high-value targets, including aircraft that dropped those deadly glide bombs, are out of range.But, what exactly is in range? Well, this map from the Institute for the Study of War suggests that there are well over 200 targets still in reach of U.S. ATACMS. Those are the red dots you see there. Now, among them, there is also the headquarters of Russia's southern military district in Rostov and dozens of command centers, storage depots, weapons production facilities and military regiments, including, for example, the 52nd Guard's heavy bomber regiment believed to be responsible for a deadly cruise missile attack on an apartment block in Dnipro last January. President Zelenskyy warning that any further delay may mean the U.S. is proved right. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (Interpreted): Delaying this process leads to Russia moving these military targets deeper into the territory of Russia. So if our partners lift the restrictions, I really want it to be a strategy for Ukraine's victory, not a political strategy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Thank you.Well, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says that Russia has, in fact, launched counteroffensive actions now inside the Kursk region. It comes more than a month after since -- rather, since Kyiv launched its surprise incursion. The U.S. Defense Department acknowledging that counteroffensive, a spokesperson described the efforts as marginal, however, adding that the U.S. has not yet seen Russia using ballistic missiles delivered from Iran. At this hour, in the United States, virtually all production of new planes at Boeing has now stopped. More than 33,000 workers walking off the job overnight. Their union called for the strike after its members overwhelmingly rejected a new four-year contract proposal with the company. This is the first strike at Boeing in 16 years. That contract would have given raises of at least 25 percent over the life of the agreement, but 95 percent of the membership voted against us. With me now, CNN Business and Politics Correspondent, Vanessa Yurkevich, So, Vanessa, there are the questions about why? And you talk about overwhelming, 95 percent of the members said, no, this doesn't work for us. First, talk to us about why.",

But, for the membership, it was simply not good enough. And we don't have sort of one single issue in terms of why folks voted to go on strike. It's really sort of a holistic look at the deal. They simply believe that because of concessions that they've made in the past, because of rising inflation, wages simply haven't caught up yet, they wanted to get their traditional pension back. Instead, Boeing offered additional money into their 401(k). So, really just a mismatch of what membership wants and what ultimately resulted in the deal.And as you mentioned, they wanted 25 percent -- excuse me, they were offered 25 percent as a wage increase. They wanted 40 percent. So, you just see how far apart they are. We've asked both sides when they're getting back to the negotiating table. No answer quite yet. But, this is certainly something that Boeing, in particular, probably can't afford right now. They've had a string of bad press. They are $33 billion in operating losses. This looks like it might drag out for a while, because union leadership now has to go back to the table and figure out what membership is willing to vote on. That could take some time, Erica.",

I just want to say, though, this will not affect passengers. Everything is OK. You're going to get on your Boeing airplanes of your respective U.S. aircraft carriers.

You wrote a great article, a great piece for CNN back in March, so long before we got to this place and the strike, of course, that was OKed overnight, and you said at the time that Boeing's excessive focus on financial returns is what led to the company neglecting its two greatest resources, its people and its suppliers.

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, what it means moving forward is there are likely to be some reforms in the way that Israel gathers its intelligence, uses its intelligence, and makes definitive or best possible decisions about actions it should take having that intelligence, because this military investigation that Brigadier General Yossi Sariel is responding to is to the massive intelligence failure that allowed Hamas to have that huge, brutal attack on October 7th.His unit, the 8200 intelligence unit, had staff around Gaza who were monitoring activities in Gaza, monitoring what they were seeing Hamas doing, and it's been widely reported here in Israel that many times the junior staff members, the information they were seeing that was telling them something was different, there was perhaps a rehearsal, a planning, a practice by Hamas that they were watching, wasn't getting up the sort of organizational food chain and being acted upon by senior commanders. So, when you say what could change here, one of the things in the resignation letter that the Brigadier General says is that there needs to be some organizational changes. Whether he is referring to the fact this information wasn't either taken seriously, passed up or acted upon, isn't clear. But, he is also saying very clearly he is responsible, apologizing to the country, apologizing to his junior staff members, apologizing to his commanders. But, there is a lot in this letter that offers mitigating circumstances. But, I'd say one -- take one step back from this. This resignation has come because of the internal military investigation. They wanted a fast investigation because they're still fighting a war. There has been no broader investigation that would pull in people like the Prime Minister at a political level for their decisions, and that's something the Prime Minister has been pushing off. So, the military is making its changes and adapting and trying to learn from a massive intelligence failure. The politicians, on the other hand, are not taking that accountability as yet.",

It was only in June that the Iranian hackers allegedly broke into the email account of longtime Trump operative, Roger Stone, and used that access, as CNN, as previously reported, to target other members of the Trump campaign. And shortly after that, we had this mysterious anonymous email account using an AOL email account, emailing reporters, trying to get them to publish internal Trump campaign documents that apparently weren't that terribly interesting.So, this is a playbook from -- that we saw in 2016 that the Russians used to try to influence the election then, and the Iranians have learned from that, and they're trying to replicate that, according to our sources. But, going back to the timing, it's really quick. Usually, it takes a long time for the Justice Department to -- or longer time to build a case of this magnitude. But, I think what they're trying to do is disclose this information well before the election, to try to blunt the impact of this influence operation, and say to Americans, this is what's going on behind the scenes.
