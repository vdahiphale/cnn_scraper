KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, this is called the Washington Declaration. And it is a key new agreement aimed at deterring North Korea. The U.S. has pledged to give South Korea more insight into its nuclear planning to be involved in tabletop exercises. And also it offered a commitment to deploy a nuclear armed submarine in South Korea for the first time since the early 80s, which is a very symbolic show of force. Now, in return, South Korea has agreed not to pursue its own nuclear arsenal. I want you to listen to what the South Korean president said about the deal.

And analysts say it remains to be seen whether or not they're going to be satisfied with this agreement. And, of course, the other very critical question, will it deter North Korea? Last year, North Korea fired a record number of missiles. It's continued to fire even more this year, including that new solid-fuel ICBM. Biden did repeat the U.S. offer to North Korea to hold talks about its weapons program, but he also offered that stark warning to North Korea, vowing the end of whatever regime that launches a nuclear attack on the U.S. or its allies. And we are awaiting comment from Pyongyang. Now, the two leaders I should add, they also announced deals on cybersecurity, on E.V.s and batteries, as well as economic investment. And looking ahead, John, we know that President Yun will soon be addressing Congress to mark 70 years of the alliance. That address will take place 11 a.m. Eastern time, John.

And you know, we can't have a country that refuses to acknowledge that Ukraine is a country, be the arbiter of Ukraine. Of course, Zelenskyy knows all this. He knows that China is on Russia side, but he has to take the call. He has to play along and sort of pretend that China could be a good actor because it's worth it to keep China in the discussion. It's worth it to prevent China from going full on and support military support of Russia.
