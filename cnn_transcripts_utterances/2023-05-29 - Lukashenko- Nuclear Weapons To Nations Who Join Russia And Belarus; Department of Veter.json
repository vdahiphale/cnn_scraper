He made the statement during an on-camera interview with Moscow state media, but it's not clear how wide his invitation actually is and he didn't offer specifics.CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us live from London. So, President Lukashenko said just last week that Russia had transferred some tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus. How legitimate is this offer that he's making?",

      "sentences": "I think it's less about whether this is rhetoric or not rhetoric and just the wider context here, Omar, of what's going on.Yes, as you mentioned, over the course of the last few days, the Kremlin has started to transfer tactical nuclear weapons to be stored in Belarus, a country that's essentially been used as a satellite state by President Putin throughout this conflict. Now, Russia says that this transfer is legitimate because it would retain control over those tactical nuclear weapons, but the U.S. and its allies simply see this as a violation of international law. And now, just the other day, these comments from President Lukashenko to Russia state television -- and I just want to read it to you directly so you can understand why it is so chilling. \"It is very simple,\" he said. \"Join the union state of Belarus and Russia. That's all. There will be nuclear weapons for everyone.\" In these comments, of course, he is referencing former Soviet states like Kazakhstan. Again, this could simply be rhetoric. But when you look at the wider context of Russia threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons throughout this conflict in Ukraine -- of the proliferation of those tactical nuclear weapons being transferred to Belarus -- then you begin to understand the concern here for global security, especially at a time when the U.S. is saying the Kremlin is behaving irresponsibly.",

He's being treated for undisclosed illnesses during the campaign and in recent weeks. So, many are questioning does he have the strength -- the vitality to carry on. His supporters say yes. That he will be a president who hits the ground running. He's a technocrat. He will get to grips with the issues. Now, key among those is reuniting a fractured nation. Nigeria is typically polarized but the elections that brought Bola Tinubu in led the country to be even more polarized. And he's coming with a mandate -- the lowest mandate of any elected president since democracy started in 1999 in this country with just 37 percent of the vote. So he has a hard job really there to bring the country together. He's vowed to do that. And then, moving on to the issue of the economy, Nigeria has $103 billion in public debt and the economy is, some say, on life support. He has to work very quickly to get to grips with that urgently. And then, we're moving to insecurity and kidnapping for ransom, which became a criminal enterprise under President Buhari. These are formidable challenges. Just one of these would be a formidable challenge for any president, but all three at the same time for a president some say is past his prime -- it's a challenge of a lifetime -- Omar.",

He would hit the wall and as he spins out, he just nicks Kyle Kirkwood. Kirkwood flipping and his rear left tire going soaring over the fence -- thankfully, over the stands -- before landing in a parking lot. But that was the really scary part right there. No injuries reported. Kirkwood was also OK. Still, an absolutely terrifying moment. The race was stop-and-go the rest of the way. Red flags three times in the last eight laps because of crashes. In the end, it was Nashville native Josef Newgarden getting the jump and passing defending champion Marcus Ericsson on the restart on the final lap, taking the checkered flag and becoming the first American to win the Indy 500 since way back in 2016.

Fifty-year-old Robert Bowers is accused of killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018. He faces 63 counts in a federal indictment, 22 of which carry the potential death penalty. This is just the second death penalty cast to take place under the Biden administration.So let's bring in criminal defense attorney Lexie Rigden, who is joining us this morning. Now, the Justice Department, under Biden, did issue a moratorium on federal executions but this case began under Trump's administration. Prosecutors rejected several motions by the defense to take the death penalty off the table. So why do you think no deal was actually made there? LEXIE RIGDEN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Skype):  Well, the prosecutors -- the defense was actually going to enter into a plea deal. In exchange for pleading guilty he would agree to life -- you know, life in prison, and the prosecutor said no. And Merrick Garland's office had come out and said that was based on, in part, the fact that this was an especially heinous crime. It was a hate crime. And also, it was carried out in a place of worship. So they just were not going to negotiate with Bowers and his attorneys.",

There's really -- I never say -- I always say there's no such thing as a slam-dunk case but this is as close as it gets. And so the focus of this trial is going to be on the penalty phase. And the jurors are going to have to weigh the aggregating factors of how many people were killed, the heinous way in which they were killed, the fact that it was premeditated. His blatant antisemitism with the fact that he had a bad childhood. He had -- his father was accused of raping a woman and killed himself. He has said that he has schizophrenia. So they're going to have to weigh all those things in determining whether he should be put to death. And in Ted Cruz's case, the mental health issues and his bad upbringing were what saved him.",
