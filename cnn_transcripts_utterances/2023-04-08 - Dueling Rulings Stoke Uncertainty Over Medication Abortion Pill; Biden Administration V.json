I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin the hour with two dueling lawsuits in two separate states, putting the national spotlight back on the issue of abortion rights. In Texas, a federal judge has ruled that the FDA's more than two- decade-old approval of the drug mifepristone should be halted. This is one of the most trusted and widely used drugs for medication abortions. The court did pause the ruling for one week so that an appeal which is already underway can be filed. President Biden vowed late Friday night that he will fight the ruling in Texas. Meantime, in Washington state, a federal judge moved to protect access to that very same abortion medication across 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia. CNN's Rosa Flores is in Houston for us. Rosa, walk us through both the judge's order and how we got here. This is a very big story down in Texas where you are.",

      "sentences": "You know, it absolutely is. And this judge, Judge Matthews Kacsmaryk really didn't hold back in the 67-page order. He ripped apart the FDA's approval of this drug mifepristone, saying that the FDA approval was flawed, that it didn't consider the risks to women and girls.But let me take you through some of the specific language that this judge used in this order. This judge saying that the FDA's refusal to impose certain restrictions on this drug, quote, \"resulted in many deaths and many more severe or life-threatening adverse reactions.\" It goes on to say, \"Due to the FDA's lax reporting requirements, the exact number is not ascertainable, but it is likely far greater, far higher than its data indicate.\" It goes on to say, \"Whatever the numbers are, they likely would be considerably lower had the FDA not acquiesce to the pressure to increase access to chemical abortion at the expense of women's safety.\" Now there have been many medical organizations that have been issuing statements about this, fact-checking what is in this judge's order and also criticizing and pushing back on the judge's safety analysis of this drug. One of those organizations is the American Medical Association. The president of that organization issuing a statement that said in part that this ruling, quote, \"flies in the face of science and evidence and threatens to upend access to a safe and effective drug.\" It goes on to say, \"The court's disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allocations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation.\" Now it's important to note about these two orders issued by these two judges in two states is that at the center, the center question of these two lawsuits is not the question of whether women have the right to abortion. That was the question that went before the U.S. Supreme Court last summer and the U.S. Supreme court overturned Roe v. Wade. What's at issue here and the questions that are going before these courts are administrative in nature. In essence, it's a statute that allows the FDA to regulate medications, in this case regulation of the medication mifepristone. So what is going to happen next? As you mentioned, Jim, the judge here in Texas paused his order for seven days. Now what that means is that there is no impact to access to mifepristone at this moment in time. Now, the U.S. DOJ on behalf of the FDA has filed notice that they will appeal, and they also say that they are reviewing the order issued by the judge in Washington. As for the plaintiffs' attorneys, they say that they're still digesting the order that was issued by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk here in Texas. And Jim, and they're also reviewing the order out of Washington.",

They were demanding gun reform after the school shooting in Nashville that killed six people, including three 9-year-old students. The two expelled lawmakers Justin Pearson and Justin Jones are black. Gloria Johnson, who was white, she kept her seat by just one vote. That fact, though, has only added to the anger in Tennessee and across the country in response to these expulsions. CNN's correspondent Isabel Rosales joins us with more details. Isabel, it sounds as though the Tennessee Three, they're not taking this lying down and they're making some moves to get back in the statehouse.

And to get answers into what's next, we look to the Tennessee constitution, which demands that a special election must happen because we are over a year away from the general election of November 2024. But in that gap between now and the special election, it also indicates that the local legislative government for the expelled lawmaker's county has the power to also appoint an interim successor.So right now really the focus is on filling these two vacant positions in the statehouse and the districts for Pearson and for Justin Jones, they are exploring these next steps, and that could also mean reappointing these same people and sending them back to the chamber. Now we've seen on Friday support from the White House in the form of Vice President Kamala Harris, meeting privately with the Tennessee Three, also speaking before a crowd, calling for gun reform, for making the laws tighter when it comes to perhaps background checks or red flag laws, and also criticizing the Republican dominated House.

Now they will need a supermajority, according to Jeff Syracuse, a council member, he says that's 27 out of 40 council members will have to approve Jones.

What's your take on these leaked intelligence documents? This does not happen very often.

GEN. BEN HODGES (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. ARMY EUROPE: Yes. Great reporting by Kylie. Obviously, this is very damaging. You know, you never want your enemy to know what you know or how you got it, so this will reveal the depth of penetration and a lot of information that we had. And of course, one of the keys to good intelligence is being able to share with other allies, other organizations, and so this will damage some of the trust, you know, that's necessary to have this good intelligence sharing. I expect the investigation will eventually sort of figure out, you know, where did it come from, or how did they get out, but it does once again remind us of the vulnerabilities we have and probably some holes in our systems.

And, you know, let me explain why we have a pension system in France that is intergenerational, where distributed, basically, current workers pay for current pensioners. It's a welfare system that we're very attached to, but we want to preserve it. And when you have changing demographics, when people live longer, then the best way to balance it, to be able to save it in the long run is for people to work a little longer. This is what all of our European neighbors have done. And this is what we're doing this year. We know it's an effort to ask for people to work longer. So we know it's always been unpopular to reform the pension system. But it is necessary. It's also necessary to be able to pay for other major aspects of our social system, such as health or education. And this is why the president campaigned on this.",
