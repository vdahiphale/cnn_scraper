Moments ago, we had an update on Hurricane Milton, which, once again is, I'm not happy to tell you, has strengthened to a Category 5 storm. It was Category 4. Now it's back to five. It has 165 mile an hour sustained winds. It is expected to double in size before making landfall in Florida. Nearly 20 million people in the United States are currently in the path of Hurricane Milton. Its effects are already being felt parts of the Tampa Bay area are going to lose access to running water starting today. Gas stations are running out of fuel as evacuees fill up their cars and try to flee. Those riding out the storm are stocking up to power their generators. Let's get straight to CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers on hurricane headquarters. Chad, it doesn't sound like this new forecast is what we wanted.",

      "sentences": "It is not. It is we saw all day, and I talked to you about this at 4I heard you say double in size. That doesn't mean double in speed. It means double in size of how big this thing is. So when it does get to Florida, it's going to impact a larger area. So still, likely a Category 3 making landfall, losing some steam here for a while as it makes its way and probably somewhere around 35, 36 hours from now is when this thing actually makes landfall. And people ask all day, where's it going to hit? It's going to hit everywhere. Look at -- this is the size of the Category 3 or higher wind speeds all the way from well north of Tampa, all the way south of Fort Myers. And then the rest of the state gets hurricane force. There's your hurricane force ball all the way across to the east side. So, Daytona, Orlando, you're all going to see power outages. You're all going to see wind gusts, likely between 90 and 100 miles per hour. But then the surge, this is what all the mayors are talking about. Get away from this surge. The surge from Helene was six feet, seven feet. This is going to be 15 so if you got wet at all in Helene, you're going to get over topped in this storm, and then it's going to rain. And there are going to be places across the Florida peninsula that could get 10 inches of rainfall and make flash flooding when it comes to the rain event, the fresh water flooding, not the salt water flooding. So here it comes. It is going to come right into the Tampa Bay area. Now, the latest advisory, the latest forecast, has nudged a little bit farther to the south than it was, but all the way from Port Richey, all the way down to basically almost Naples, you're still very close to the cone. You cannot take your eyes off this, because they do wobble, and when they wobble, they catch people by surprise. Please do not be caught by surprise. We got this rapid intensification two days before it's going to hit. Please pay attention, because when they rapidly intensify six hours before they hit, that's when you get really caught off guard.

And we're especially concerned about this area here from just north of Tampa, say, Pinellas County, Hillsborough, Manatee, Sarasota, this purple area here, someone in here is going to see 10 to 15 feet of inundation above ground level, likely near and just to the right of wherever the center of Milton crosses the coast. But Milton's Winfield is going to be so big that even farther south, hundreds of miles south, down to Naples, there's going to be the potential for life threatening inundation from surge.And then we're going to have the wind field from Milton extend across much of the central portion of the Florida peninsula, bringing hurricane force conditions to places like Orlando, Melbourne, Tampa, up to even closer to Jacksonville.",
