The outcome of the NATO summit in Vilnius is very much needed and meaningful success for Ukraine. And I'm grateful to all leaders in NATO conference (ph) for very practical and unprecedented support considering the case of our relation support for Ukraine. Today there are security guarantees for Ukraine on the way to NATO, an important package of security guarantees. Today we are coordinating with our G-7 countries, the framework for security guarantees that shall be further extended through arrangements with our key partners. Bilateral and multilateral agreements. And Ukrainian delegation is bringing home a significant security victory for the Ukraine, for our country, for our people, for our children. It opens for us absolutely new security opportunities and I thank everyone who made it possible. Thank you, dear colleagues. Thanks you. Thanks, Lithuania and Jan Stoltenberg. Thank you very much.

So, it's interesting to see that said over and over and over again because they don't yet have a very fast path to NATO membership.Let's bring in lots of our folks to discuss with us. CNN's Arlette Saenz, and Nic Robertson, as well as Kim Dozier, all here with us. I want to start with you, Arlette. President Biden made very clear that, look, this joint declaration is all about a long lasting future of security for Ukraine that the U.S. and other NATO allies will be involved in. Tell us about the significance of this, even though they're not getting NATO membership at this particular summit.",

      "sentences": "Yes, really what President Biden and these leaders are trying to do is put behind some of the tension that arose coming into this summit about the fact that Ukraine would not be offered a concrete timeline into NATO. And, instead, they are trying to show what they can offer Ukraine in the here and now and also long-term down the road. This declaration that was announced today by the president and G-7 leaders will essentially jump start talks between each of the countries to have these bilateral, long-term security commitments. President Biden saying that the support will last long into the future.And what officials - and you also heard the president there stress -- is that they want to ensure that Ukraine not just has the ability to defend themselves now, but can also deter and defend themselves against other future aggression. And so much of this is trying to send a message directly to Russia. That is what this entire summit has really been about for President Biden as he's been trying to show the strength and unity of NATO, especially as we've also learned that NATO could soon be expanding. Sweden could join the alliance. And what the president has repeatedly tried to point to is that the U.S. is one of the strongest backers of Ukraine as far as sending military aid to the country. And now they're going to try to extend these long-term security commitments to them into the future. And so in just a short while we will also see President Biden and Zelenskyy sit down one-on-one face-to-face for a private meeting. We expect reporters will be allowed into a portion of that. Which will be another show of unity that the president can demonstrate against Russia as Vladimir Putin continues to wage this war against Ukraine and as officials here at the summit have been arguing that the shows of strength, the shows of unity and support for Ukraine and within the alliance show that Putin's war is backfiring against the very thing that he had hoped against.",

I want to ask you about NATO itself and where it's at right now because back when Donald Trump was president it was no secret that at one point he discussed pulling the U.S. out of NATO and trying to sort of weaken that alliance. How does what happened in this particular very important summit strengthen NATO? You've got one more country that is now going to be allowed in, and does this put a lot of pressure on Vladimir Putin?",

Of course Hungary's got a - Hungary's parliament has to ratify that first, as well as Turkey.But what it does is send a powerful message to Moscow, that combined with these new security guarantees towards Ukraine, that this is a marathon for NATO, not a sprint. That if you thought that you, Vladimir Putin, could wait us out and use the mass of your population, four times the size of Ukraine, to grind them down, we're going to be here the whole time keeping them supplied. And we're also going to be a -- we're going to be doing a -- we're going to keep sanctioning you, we're going to keep putting you under economic duress. So, the combination is NATO's stronger. Bringing Sweden and Finland in, they both actually have pretty advanced defense industries. That strengthens NATO militarily. So, overall, this is a win-win for NATO and lose-lose for Moscow. And one last thing, Biden aligning himself in this way with Ukraine will make it really hard if there is a change in U.S. presidents come the next election for any future president to back away from this support.",

The rain has finally stopped. We've been seeing these really incredible pictures from the capital there in Montpelier. Can you tell us what your biggest concern is this morning? JENNIFER MORRISON, COMMISSIONER, VERMONT DEPT. OF PUBLIC SAFETY: Yes, ma'am, I can. Thank you for having us here. Yes, Montpelier, and the capital region, have probably seen the worst of it. However, we are actively still rescuing people in the Lamoille County area. Overnight we had 32 people and numerous animals that we rescued with our swift water assets. And that brings our total number of rescues to over 200 across the state during this disaster. And our swift water rescue teams and air assets have also facilitated about 100 evacuations. So, we are still in an absolute crisis in Lamoille County. That being said, there are parts of the state, the capital region, as you saw, Andover, Londonderry, Ludlow, Weston and surrounding communities that were so brutally hit early in this disaster that are starting to turn the corner to impact assessments. Our biggest fear, as you asked, is the weather, the impending weather, and if we will reach flood stage again. But I'm just here to say that this disaster is not over in the state of Vermont. We still have many rivers that are in moderate to major flood stage, and we're not out of the woods yet.",

CNN's Marc Stewart is live in Tokyo with the very latest. What are you hearing? There's a lot going on in the region right now with regard with this, Marc. What are you hearing about -- first and foremost about this missile test? [09:55:02] MARC STEWART, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I would say, Kate, to sum it up this way, there's certainly awareness of what happened, but I wouldn't say that there is alarm because for years we have seen tests like these with frequency, with regularity. However, this test in particular is noteworthy. First of all, that missile was in the air for about 74 seconds. That is seen as a marginal gain compared to some of the other tests that we have seen this year. The other distinction is that this test involved an intercontinental ballistic missile, otherwise known as an ICBM. It has the potential to possibly reach U.S. soil. Of course, this is getting a lot of condemnation from South Korea and, of course, from Japan, including the chief cabinet secretary. He made some remarks about what Japan may do, its view toward all of that, just a few hours ago. Let's take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HIROKAZU MATSUNO, JAPANESE CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY (through translator): Such ballistic missile launches violate relevant United Nations security council resolutions and are a serous security issue for our citizens.
