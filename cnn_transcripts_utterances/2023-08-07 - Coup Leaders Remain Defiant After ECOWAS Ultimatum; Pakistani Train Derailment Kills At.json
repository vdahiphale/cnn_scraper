Coup leaders there are moving reinforcements from around the country to the Capitol. And they've closed Niger's airspace until further notice, citing the threat of military intervention from its neighbors. That is according to a military source. Well, this comes just a day after a deadline set by the West African regional bloc ECOWAS was passed over over the weekend. The bloc had given Niger's coup leaders a week to reinstate President Mohamed Bazoum or facie potential use of force. Let's get you bang up to date. Let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo. The ECOWAS grouping and its deadline has come and gone. No action as of yet. What's next?",

So that's a big decision that these leaders have to decide on Thursday when they meet in Abuja. But in Niger, the WHO leaders have been beating the drums of war. They have gotten support from a large part of the population. These coup leaders fill the stadium in Niamey, the capital, keen to show friends, keen to show especially ECOWAS that they have the support of the people. And that's this coup, even though the international community has condemned it, the people of Nigeria support it because they are tired of the old order and they want new things. This is the mood from some of the people who showed up to this protest.

They said there was other information apparently coming from a Russian handlers telling her to get information on the electronic warfare equipment, locations of it that Ukraine has. And of course, this is equipment vital for Ukraine to know when cruise missiles, when drones that Russia is firing at Ukraine to attract them when they're coming in so they can have countermeasures that she was also tasked with finding out information about weapons stores, ammunition dumps, those sorts of things vital in the war effort for Ukraine.

It has to be set in that Mykolaiv region. We were there, you know, over the past -- over the past year or so. There's a huge suspicion, whenever there's an airstrike on a building or a target that perhaps the military have been using or the local governor feels that there has been Russian operatives or those sympathetic to Russia scouting out buildings in those areas. Mykolaiv is a point in case just last year, that they feel that that there's a real pressure on them to track down these informants. So, this is not just a passing thing that's happened. The intelligence services in Ukraine put a lot of effort in trying to figure out who gives away vital information about Ukrainian military installations.

And they released a statement on Saturday, saying that it was their understanding that roughly 11 Chinese and Russian ships had been operating there. And they called it an incursion. They said that they had received multiple classified briefings about the incident in recent days. And Senator Dan Sullivan, who is one of those senators, he actually said that it shows that we have entered, \"a new era of authoritarian aggression, led by the dictators in Beijing and Moscow.\" Now, notably, this is not the first time that Russia and China have done these kind of joint patrols in that kind of same area. They carried out a similar exercise last summer. And at that point, that exercise was really only met by a single U.S. Coast Guard vessel that was operating a routine patrol in the area. So, Dan Sullivan, that U.S. senator, he said that he was very pleased to see that the response this time around was more robust. And he noted that a U.S. Navy or four U.S. Navy destroyers, I should say did respond to track their movements as well, of course as reconnaissance aircraft.

A sort -- order that essentially puts limits on how evidence in the case can be disclosed to the public or not disclosed to the public.

Now the Justice Department, they are in their filings, they seem to be asking for what they believe is quite a reasonable provision. The same sort of provision that's used in any type of criminal or even civil case.
