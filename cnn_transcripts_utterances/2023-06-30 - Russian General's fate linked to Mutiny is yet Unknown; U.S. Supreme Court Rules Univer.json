Confrontations flared between protesters and police in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, where the 17-year-old named Nahel was killed on Tuesday.President Emmanuel Macron is set to hold a crisis meeting in the coming hours. That's according to a CNN affiliate, BFM TV. Chaotic and violent scenes played out around the country late Thursday into early Friday. France' elite police force was deployed to Bordeaux, Lyon and other areas to quell the unrest. The mother of the slain teenager tells French media she holds the accused officer responsible for her son's death and she doesn't blame the entire police force. The teen's killing which was caught on video has sparked anger across France particularly among young men and women of color who feel they've long been discriminated against by police. CNN's Melissa Bell has the latest from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A night of flames. Cars, town halls, schools set on fire across France has raged over the police shooting of 17-year-old Nael continued enough to force the French president to call an emergency ministerial meeting. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): The last hours have been marked by violent scenes against police stations, but also schools and town halls, and basically against institutions and the republic. It's absolutely unjustifiable. BELL (voice-over): The deployment of some 2,000 police officers on Wednesday to the Paris suburbs did little to quell the anger with 150 people detained. It's not the republic that was in custody. It was not the republic that killed this young man, pleaded the government spokesman Olivier Veran. Another appeal in vain to calm the violence, as Veran described some of the attacks on government institutions as organized, almost coordinated. In response, a massive deployment of police forces on Thursday, some 40,000 across France, including 5,000 in Paris. But even before nightfall, a protest led by Nael's mother turned violent. Emotions still raw, even as the police officer accused of shooting the teen was placed under formal investigation for voluntary homicide. With questions on the racial undertones of the tragedy.",

LGBTQ activists say without an anti-discrimination law in South Korea, it is almost impossible to fight for their rights. CHA HAE-YOUNG, MAPO-GU COUNCIL MEMBER (through translator): The constitution may say that no one should be discriminated against, but the anti-discrimination bill clarifies what discrimination is and there could be legal penalties. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Cha Hae-young is the first openly LGBTQ-elected official in South Korea. She says her sexual orientation was used against her by her rivals when she entered politics. HAE-YOUNG (through translator): In the political or public realm, revealing one's identity as a sexual minority is a handicap. Some people said that I should not be in politics because I'm a sexual minority. They made my identity my weakness. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Since 2007, lawmakers have proposed 11 anti- discrimination bills. Five have expired, two were withdrawn, and four are still pending in the National Assembly. Lee Jong-geol went on hunger strike last year with another activist to try and push the government to move one bill forward. LEE JONG-GEOL, GENERAL DIRECTOR, CHINGUSAI (through translator): I believe our society should be ashamed that there is no law that protects the principles of equality, even though it is one of the most basic laws out there. No matter how much our country has developed economically or socially, we should be ashamed. HANCOCKS (voice-over): Lee's hunger strike ended on day 39, when he was taken to hospital. A survey conducted by the National Human Rights Commission in 2020, shows that almost 90 percent of the 1,000 survey participants said an anti-discrimination law is needed.

He has landed their airplane with European citizens on board and capturing hostage from their opposition journalists.Then he has organized the attacks, storms of borders of E.U. and NATO countries in Lithuania, Poland and Latvia, as you said. And we don't know, we can be sure that now they won't add there some soldiers of Wagner who would be using weapons into it to attack the border so it's, I mean, they can be ruled out completely. And at the same time, yes, I mean, no one what Wagner as being doing in Syria in Ukraine that before no balance and can feel safe, I know that the people who are very critical to Lukashenko, they can't say publicly but they still have some shows of communication with various independent media in exile, they're now saying that they are threatened, they are depressed, they are very much afraid. And obviously this is nothing good to the Belarusian people and we can be sure that Lukashenko will use it in his own interest.",

Prigozhin's main online network was an aggregator of news and social content. The company's app claims it had more than 11 million users, although few were actually registered. It's not clear what will happen to Prigozhin's other media interests.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to project strength after Prigozhin's mutiny. The leaders say there is still something he lost in the process, his aura of invincibility. Nick Paton-Walsh explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What's a strong man when he's no longer that strong? Just a guy on a horse who needs a shirt. We've been so accustomed to these images of Vladimir Putin as some sort of Superman, manipulating the known world in a genius game of five-dimensional chess, and wrestling his opponents to the mat intellectually. Now, the world is coming to terms with a completely new concept, a weak Putin, who seems almost to play the clown, here today at a trade fair, making a sketch, living in a parallel reality from the near collapse of the weekend. While the weekend's armed rebellion by his former confidant, Prigozhin, failed, it had one catastrophic success, bursting the bubble of Putin's impregnability. The Kremlin head didn't even appear in public for two and a half days, popping up only outside the Kremlin Tuesday to deliver a surreal thank you to the military who'd step back and let Wagner march on Moscow. Putin is now in a place he's never been before, hunting for traitors in his inner circle. He was said to have isolated himself so much during the pandemic, keeping visitors at a distance, that perhaps he no longer can find his way back down the table to reality. The Moscow elite's gentle bubble of assured autocracy has also been burst. It is a place where riches were earned through unquestioning loyalty. But now, after the Ukraine invasion, contends with drones attacking luxury suburbs and even the Kremlin. None of this was meant to happen. None of this is what Putin sold Russia. And none of this can be easily answered by a strong man who no longer seems strong. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kyiv, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A former Donald Trump campaign official is cooperating with specialcounsel prosecutors in an ongoing criminal probe related to overturning the 2020 election or attempts to overturn them anyway. That's according to two sources familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, we're learning the former president showed classified material to a current senior campaign official during a meeting at his New Jersey golf club. CNN's Paula Reid has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN SR. LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: One of the most surprising revelations in the Trump indictment was an allegation that the former president had showed a classified map to a representative from his political action committee. A surprising, not only because it's suggesting that he showed classified material to someone who did not have a clearance, but there was also a suggestion that someone in his inner circle may have shared this information with investigators. A source tells CNN that representative is Suzy Wiles. She's one of his closest advisors. She's effectively running his third campaign for the White House. Now she was interviewed multiple times by special counsel investigators. She was asked if she was ever shown this map or any other documents related to General Mark Milley and it's unclear what she told investigators. Now we are told that the Trump camp was quote \"blindsided by this news\" and as of right now there is no plan for Wiles to step back from her role at the campaign. This is not the only news on the special counsel front. CNN has also learned that the grand jury down in Florida investigating the possible mishandling of classified documents is still active. They are still inquiring after witnesses and investigating. It's not unheard of for a grand jury to continue its work after charges have been filed. And we know from our reporting that there are some loose ends here in this investigation. For example, gaps in the security footage that was given to investigators. Also, questions about exactly how documents were stored up at the former president's Bedminster Golf Club. But this point is unclear if the grand jury will bring additional charges or a superseding indictment against those already charged. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
