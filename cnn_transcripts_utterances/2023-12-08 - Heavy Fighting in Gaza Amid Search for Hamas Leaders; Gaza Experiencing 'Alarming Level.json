U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. The White House says he emphasized the critical need to protect civilians in this ongoing military operation in Gaza. CNN's Alex Marquardt has more now on the latest military developments. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This video of Hamas fighting against Israeli troops, which was released by the militant group, shows not only how intense the battles are, but is a propaganda message from Hamas that they are still fiercely resisting, two months into this war. Israel's stated goal of eradicating Hamas has driven Israeli troops straight into Khan Yunis, where they believe the most senior Hamas leaders may be, including Hamas's top official in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, who remains on the battlefield. Mohammed Deif, the shadowy head of Hamas's military wing, is also believed to still be alive. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims Israeli forces surrounded Sinwar's Khan Yunis home, though the IDF admits they believe he's hiding out underground. Two months after Hamas carried out the deadliest attack in Israel's history, the response has led to a colossal humanitarian catastrophe. Experts and officials say Hamas has been degraded, but Israel still has a long way to go to achieve its goals.",

Israel claims to have killed other senior and mid-level commanders, as well as several rank-and-file militants, which is just a fraction of what the IDF estimates is 30,000 fighters. [00:05:03] LT. GEN. MARK SCHWARTZ (RET.), U.S. ARMY: I think there have been some successes, but my point is, there's going to still be a lot more ground combat to come. And I think you'll see over the coming weeks more precision targeting going after Hamas leaders as they, you know, show themselves. MARQUARDT (voice-over): In the next month or so, U.S. officials say Israel is expected to lower the intensity of its operations, which have killed thousands of civilians, so many of them children, and displaced more than 80 percent of Gaza's population.

And the problem for Lebanon is the government is weak, and Hezbollah is much stronger than the government. So the government and the political system cannot really tell Hezbollah what to do, what not to do. And Hezbollah has some kind of loose agreement with the government, but basically, Hezbollah and the Israelis do what they want in the South. I think neither of them want the war, but they're both very strong. They have a kind of deterrent system now, a truce, because they both know that any future war, because of Hezbollah's advanced capabilities and the Israeli army's willingness to kill as it's doing in Gaza, totally indiscriminately and destroy everything, the damage would be enormous.
