And we begin with a city and a nation in shock just hours after Memphis police released videos of the brutal killing of Tyre Nichols. The full videos released last night show five former Memphis police officers repeatedly beating the 29-year-old. And I want to warn you, what we're about to show you is extremely graphic. The videos document Nichols being pulled over earlier this month for alleged reckless driving. Police are then seen yanking him from his car, chasing, kicking him, using pepper spray and batons. Nichols, who is unarmed, crying for his mother at one point. He died from his injuries three days later in the hospital. And those videos are sparking largely peaceful protests all across the country overnight and into today. Earlier this week the five officers involved were charged with second- degree murder and now after this video has come out, two officers from a different department who were also on scene that night have been put on leave pending an investigation into their conduct. CNN's Boris Sanchez breaks down the newly-released videos. And again, a warning for you, the video very graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They have come out in a way that is in conjunction with what the family has asked for. They have been peaceful while they protest. But they are very, very disturbed by what they've seen. And not just disturbed, but hurt by what they've seen because they know that this could have been prevented. They believe that, you know, in the past if things had been done differently in the past and officers had been held accountable who have been complained about to internal investigations in the past, we would not be here today. That's what they have been telling us. So they feel like there is more accountability that needs to be, and more reform that needs to be put in place. I want to let you hear from one of the young ladies that we spoke with last night. This is her hometown and she is part of the activist community as well. And she was really saying, look, I know a lot of people are praising the police and the police chief, particularly -- not the police, but the police chief -- for swiftly firing these officers and the district attorney for swiftly charging these officers with murder, which is what the family had asked for, but many in the protest community and many of the residents who have come out to decry what has happened in the past say that's just not enough.

That there has to be more going forward. So that is what we have heard from the community. We've also, by the way, we heard that from the family and their attorneys. They believe that this Scorpion Unit that was involved in this, the undercover crime suppression unit, needs to be disbanded right now because several of the members who are indicted now or who have been charged now were a part of that group and they said that they have heard from others who have had real serious problems with the way that they were treated by that unit.

Joining us now is civil rights attorney Areva Martin and CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia police chief Charles Ramsey. Good morning to both of you. Thanks for being with us. Areva, let's start with you. There are still so many questions left to answer in all of this, including kind of this basic one, which is why Tyre Nichols was stopped in the first place. We know that the Memphis police chief is saying there was no evidence that he was driving recklessly. Why did any of this happen?",

And we now know that there have been complaints about the very men who've been charged with murder. There have been complaints about them from other residents in terms of their aggressive behavior.So it's unlikely that those five men woke up on the day that they killed or the day that they brutalized Tyre Nichols and said this is going to be the day that we cast aside all of the training that we have been taught. It appeared from that video, from the videos that we were able to see, that they were very comfortable with the brutality and the way in which they treated Mr. Nichols. It seemed to be something that was very familiar to them. So I think there are lots of questions about what has been going on inside that police department and if there should be others who lose their jobs because of the policies of that particular department.",

Then you see the ensuing chase, the beating. It is a very rapid escalation there on the part of the police officers. You advise police departments around the country as a consultant. It's my understanding police are trained to de-escalate situations, not escalate them. Is that correct? And to Areva's point, why do you think something like this happened, because it didn't seem like this was the first time something like this had happened, they went right there, escalating the situation.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean it is true that officers are trained in de-escalation. But in this particular case, there was escalation on the part of the officers from the very beginning. I mean they were far too aggressive.And even if they legitimately thought that this individual engaged in reckless driving or some other traffic violation, there is no excuse for the way in which they behaved. If anything, Mr. Nichols was the one trying to de-escalate the police officers instead of it being the other way around. So they were acting outside of their training, outside of policy, outside of anything that even makes sense from the very beginning. And it only got worse from that point forward. And so, you know, that's the problem. If you start off at that high level, where do you think it's going to go, you know? It becomes very difficult to de-escalate when you start at the top and then have to pull back, which is why de-escalation is so important. You know, you don't start at that level. You can always escalate. That's not a hard thing to do. De-escalation, not so easy.",

And one big question is where was the supervision on the ground?As we watch those five men and we now know that there may have been up to eight or nine officers at one point involved in this altercation with Mr. Nichols, but we never saw anyone that appeared to take control of the situation. And I think that's going to be a big question for her. And as she called out the behaviors inhumane, I think the question she is going to have to answer is how is it that they were allowed to be in that position to use those aggressive escalation tactics that the chief just spoke about without anyone there causing them to pull back to restrain themselves and to respect the rights that Mr. Nichols has, as all citizens have.",

You know, do they have excessive force complaints and so forth?The supervisors, you have to pick the best supervisors to go into that unit because your span of control in a unit like that has to be tighter than in a normal patrol function. And so that way you can avoid problems and avoid issues. You have to have units that are flexible, that can go into areas experiencing upticks in crime. But you can police constitutionally and reduce crime at the same time. One is not sacrificed for the other. And so you have to have people with the right mental attitude, the right supervision, and take strong action if they operate outside those boundaries.",

Second-degree murder in the state of Tennessee is a knowing killing and clearly those officers were trained and they know that when they kick someone in the head and they kick them repeatedly in the head, they know that the chances of that person dying is great.So they understood the consequences of their actions but yet they continued to engage in those actions. The kidnapping, again absolutely correct charge. They had no probable cause of what we're hearing to even stop Mr. Nichols in the first instance. And they definitely didn't have any probable cause to continue to detain him. The aggravated assault, the obstruction of -- well not obstruction of justice, but the failure to follow policy that has been put in place by that police department -- all of those charges -- I think are dead on and I would not be surprised if we didn't start seeing some of these ex-cops starting to give evidence against the others and start turning on each other, trying to cut deals with the prosecutor to lessen the time that they could spend in jail because they are all facing what could basically be life in prison.",

Now, a \"Washington Post\" reporter was in the room while President Biden made that call, so we were able to see a rare glimpse into something that folks tell us all the time, that President Biden when trying to console people who are grieving, uses his own trauma that he's experienced, those loved ones close to him that have died over the last years to really try to connect to Americans' trauma.

They say that video also shows that it took many crucial minutes for medical help to arrive. At this point we still don't know the specific cause of death.CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more on the possible injuries. And again, a warning to you that these images are graphic and disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It is just horrific to watch, even as a trauma neurosurgeon myself. I have never seen anything quite like that. You don't -- you often see patients who are brought into the hospital, but you don't see that sort of just horrific beating that he took over those several minutes. When you look at this sort of thing there is obviously so many different injuries that he could have sustained at the time. I think one of the areas that people probably paid a lot of attention to was just all these blows he took to his head and to his face. He was restrained at one point, taking fists to the face and he was being kicked in the face when he was on the ground. What can happen sometimes is that the brain is the one organ in the body that when it's starting to swell, it really has no place to go because it's encased by the skull. Every other organ in the body can swell a little bit more easily. Brain swelling can start to take place and one can start to lapse in and out of consciousness as seemed to be happening with Mr. Nichols. I watched the videos alongside medical examiners from around the country, and that was the area they really pointed to was these blows to the head. But it's also worth noting that he is a pretty skinny guy from what we understand, and there were kicks to the body, to the torso, to the chest as well. And any of those organs may have actually sustained damage and started bleeding as well. Could have been suffering from internal bleeding at the time that all of this was happening. And that brings us to the next point which I think is critically important. When you look at sort of the timeline of what was happening, around 8:33 or so -- 8:34 when you see this last kick that he sustained and then he is handcuffed and dragged over to the car. And then it's eight minutes later before we see EMS even arrive. But it's not until around 9:02, so 20 minutes after that, 21 minutes after that -- almost half an hour in total before you see a gurney arrive. So you have a critically ill man who's lying on the sidewalk, sustained all these injuries. Hard to say the extent of the injuries or even how serious they are at that point. Obviously they are serious but what exactly is the most serious is difficult to ascertain. And it's a full half an hour before he is really assessed. You hear at various times that it's going to take a while for the ambulance to get there and that's, obviously, very problematic. He needed to be in a hospital, whether or not it would have made a difference ultimately, that's hard to say. And we will get more information, you know, probably over the coming few days as to exactly what caused his death. We don't have a firm cause of death yet from the county medical examiner. But watching that video, looking at that timeline, you can really get a sense of what happened to him and what happened to him in the days that followed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

At this point a motive for that shooting is unknown. Former vice president Mike Pence now says he is responsible after classified documents were discovered in his Indiana home this week. About a dozen documents marked as classified were found at Pence's home after he directed his lawyer to search his home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Along the way we determined that there was a small number of documents marked classified or sensitive interspersed in my personal papers. Upon making that discovery, we secured those documents immediately. We alerted the National Archives. We turned them over to the FBI and soon thereafter, communicated to Congress. Now while I was not aware that those classified documents were in our personal residence, let me be clear. Those classified documents should not have been in my personal residence. Mistakes were made. And I take full responsibility. And I directed my counsel to work with the National Archives, with the Department of Justice, and with the Congress to fully cooperate in any investigation. Our national security depends on the proper handling of classified and sensitive materials. And I know that when errors are made, it's important that they be resolved swiftly and disclosed. And my only hope is that, as the American people look at our conduct in this matter, and that they see that we acted above politics and put the national interests first and I pledge to each and every one of you and to the American people that we will continue to do so. So help me God. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One, was these -- was the removal these documents inadvertent or intentional as he says it was inadvertent. They could verify that.Two, once they were mishandled and taken to his residence, were they shared with any third party, were they altered or destroyed. And then finally, once they were discovered, what did he do about returning them? And he said they promptly returned them. And all of that stuff, if verified, is good for Mike Pence and I think it bears comparison to both Biden and to Trump. Biden seems to have done the same thing, though there was a bit of a delay between notification of the American public of these findings, but not to DOJ and the Archives. Trump, on the other hand, seems to have resisted notification of anybody and then when the documents were requested appears to have obstructed the request for their return.",

I think in the case of Mike Pence, this is something that the DOJ can look at by itself and determine whether there was any wrongdoing along that three-part analysis that I just laid out. And I think that they will determine he didn't do anything that was criminal and that mistakes happen and then what has to happen Jessica, is they have to figure out why all of this stuff is happening. What's going on with these documents? Why do we have so many paper documents? Why do we have electronic documents that we don't have good -- you know, controls over. That's the bigger issue because I expect that if the chairmen of the Intelligence Committees over the past years went to their files they'd find documents there, too.",

My years in government showed me that there were so many documents that were classified that there was no need for classification.So the default here in the government is classify if uncertain and that leads to overclassification. They have to figure out why that is the case still and what they can do to mitigate that problem. And then secondly, they need better chain of custody controls of these things. They need to have a person in charge in each office who is responsible for the chain of custody of classified documents who can certify that as documents are removed, they are returned and as people change office in the end of an administration, that this certified security officer has made himself or herself a thorough investigation and that these documents are all in their safe place.

So he is going to talk about this.So what he says will determine whether he is putting his foot in his mouth legally or not. I expect that he's going to continue his mantra of he did nothing wrong, he declassified, they belong to him and that he was entitled to them and that the search of his residence was, you know, part of the ongoing witch hunt that he has been subject to all these years. I think we will hear that. Whether the prosecutors investigating this think that there is some admissions or other things that impact negatively his legal liability remains to be seen. I think that they will make that determination quite apart from what he says on the campaign trail because I think he's already said everything that needs to be said from his point of view, which is I did nothing wrong, I declassified before thinking about it or otherwise, and they are mine and you can't have them back.
