And you'll notice, 45 mile-per-hour winds, very much an unorganized complex of storms right now several hundred miles away from the Bahamas.And I want to show you exactly where this system's forecast ends up. Because it does kind of meander over the next couple of days. When it comes to Tuesday, election day, it does look to remain 500 miles offshore. So, the impact certainly not going to be there. But as we transition from late Wednesday into Thursday the system could intensify to possibly a tropical storm there. Winds around 70 miles per hour across the southern tier of Florida. Of course, hurricane season doesn't end until November 30th. Again, notice on Tuesday, still well offshore. Wednesday and Thursday we began to see some impact across portions of Florida. Gusty winds certainly going to be possible on Thursday morning. We get some heavy rainfall there Thursday into Friday. Across really much of the state of Florida and possibly parts of the southeastern U.S. as well as the system makes landfall later on into the week. Now when it comes to weather later on today into election day, generally quiet conditions across a large area of the Eastern U.S., maybe a few showers pop up around portions of the southeast, the Carolinas as well but around parts of the battleground states of say Pennsylvania very quiet weather right now. Looking at mild temperatures in place going in from Monday afternoon and then cooler temperatures expected as we transition into say Tuesday afternoon. Temps there drop off by about 20 degrees as an incoming front that comes in on the dry side. And again, cooler air is expected but dry weather also remains in place. Same thing can't be said around the Western U.S. We have multiple systems coming in with significant power, significant rainfall and high elevation snowfall across parts of Nevada, certainly California into the Pacific Northwest as well. So, when you look at statistically, studies have been done, guys, that kind of look at the wet weather pattern and how that plays out on election day. You know, Republican voters typically turn out in higher numbers than Democrat voters when it comes to rainy weather conditions. That is based on 2007 study and also the same study found that voter participation dropped by about 1 percent for every inch of rain fall that was observed. So certainly, parts of California, parts of Nevada will see a decent amount of rainfall in the coming days. Maybe they'll be some impacts across those regions with the wet weather in place and snowfall also played a role with an inch producing about a half a percent drop in turnout. Now warmer temperatures they do seem to play a more significant role. Mind you parts of the Eastern U.S. will be plenty warm. You know, voter turnout did increase by about .14 percent for every two degree increase in temperatures. It keep in mind, parts of the Eastern U.S. are about 15 degrees warmer than what is typical. So, it certainly could see an impact there. Warmer temperatures also increase the likelihood that voters kept the incumbent party in power. So, that's another thing to keep in mind here as well with extreme warmth if this does play out. Certainly, the weather will be plenty warm across those regions of the U.S. to support this -- guys.",
