I'm Rosemary Church.Qatar's foreign ministry says it will announce in the next few hours when the truce between Israel and Hamas will begin. A diplomatic source says it's likely to start Friday midnight local time at the earliest. The news comes after Israel said on Wednesday that the expected release of hostages and a pause in fighting with Hamas were delayed. Both U.S. and Israeli officials pointed to logistical details for that delay. Ahead of the expected truce, Israeli forces continued ground and air operations, striking parts of northeastern and central Gaza, though Palestinians say areas further south were also hit. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed confidence the deal would soon go into effect and made clear the war against Hamas is far from over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Citizens of Israel, I'd like to be clear, the war continues. The war continues. We will continue with it until all our goals are achieved. To bring back the hostages, to demolish Hamas and ensure that The day after work, there is no source that educates terror to children and pay terrorists. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, right now what we know from the sources on the ground at Rafah border is that there is more activity than they've seen in the past few weeks. Lots of trucks lined up, aid trucks ready and in anticipation of this four-day truce to try and get in as much aid as possible. Look, the U.N. agencies, international organizations have all reiterated this point that there is a dire need for medical supplies, for food, for water as well as fuel. 1.7 million people currently displaced.And we've heard from these aid agencies just what people are going through, running fast out of food and water. And these stories are coming in very fast from the organizations. The Norwegian Refugee Council says that they need more than just this four-day pause. They're calling for a right-out ceasefire. And they say that neither hostages nor access to humanitarian relief should be a bargaining chip for military negotiations. They've also reiterated the points and we've been covering these stories, Rosemary, that hospitals have run out of medical supplies, have run out of anesthesia, doctors having to take very tough decisions to embark on surgeries without any anesthesia and also amputations without anesthesia. Imagine what that's like for not only the patient but for the doctors themselves and these stories have really been -- been amplified over the past few weeks. We also heard from the U.N.'s Martin Griffiths yesterday and he was talking about the negotiation and what it takes to get aid into Gaza. And while he says they negotiate with the Egyptians that all the agreements about fuel, the number of trucks, the opening of new crossings and safe passage, they all come out of negotiations with Israel. So we know that Israel is at the center of this in terms of allowing more aid into the Gaza Strip. So we're waiting to see what will happen at the Rafah border. We know there are a lot of trucks, but I just want to give you a bit of a snapshot in terms of the people I have met here in Cairo. The hotel that I'm staying in is hosting dual national passport holders as well as foreigners that have just been evacuated out of Gaza. We met one family that was talking about not having bread, not having food, not having anything available to them for such a long time that everything was scarce. They were eventually trapped at the Rafah border waiting for their names to get on the list so they could evacuate. This was a family of five, I mean with three little children and one can only imagine what they'd been through because they've just been displaced from one area to the next. The international agencies have been very clear about just the untenable scenarios that are playing out because of the food and water situation and then fuel is another issue because that keeps generators running for the hospitals. The U.N. has also categorically said that 68 percent of people that have died in Gaza right now are women and children. And the fact that children are stuck in the middle of this, frankly, Rosemary, on both sides has become really a symbol of the suffering that we're seeing playing out over the past few weeks. This truce is going to be absolutely pivotal. The hope is that it can be extended to get more aid in, to get more humanitarian relief over the coming days.",

Israeli law allows Palestinian prisoners to be detained indefinitely, without trial or stated charge.

Children badly injured, barely breathing. Medical staff overwhelmed, struggling to cope with the mounting casualties and growing humanitarian disaster. In the south, more unbearable grief. Bodies wrapped in white. Members of the Calusa and Abbas families, old and young, killed in a strike on their building in Khan Younis. Their lives cut short, buried just hours after Israel's cabinet agreed to temporarily pause fighting later this week in exchange for the release of 50 hostages. The truth will be a crucial window to get much-needed aid into Gaza. But for those who have already lost so much, the news has brought little hope. What kind of truths are they discussing? A truth just to allow some aid in? Maysara asks. We don't want that. We will manage with bread. What we truly want is not a truth for aid. We want our homes back. We want to return to our streets. What is the point of a truth if I can't return to my home, if I can't check on my children, my parents or our businesses? Saddam says. This truth is pointless. We've been sleeping on the streets for 45 days. We have no shelter, no home, nowhere to seek refuge. In the south, the very place people are told to evacuate to, to seek refuge, more buildings are turned to rubble overnight. Countless graves being dug each day, the death toll now topping 12,000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, citing data from Hamas-controlled Gaza. Another desperate plea to God, another child killed, relatives struggling to cope. Their grief, feared to only get worse. Israel's prime minister vowing the war will continue after the truce ends.

This gives you an indication of the intensity of the firefight.ROBERTSON (voice-over): More than 300 at the Nova Music Festival. A rocket shelter there, where some were mercilessly killed in cold blood, had the biggest impact. Six weeks later, we happen to be passing, as Israel's recovery specialists clean it out.",

And I'm looking inside, and it seems, I don't know, worse. The grenades splatter. The gunshots that are in the wall here, they're bigger, they're worse. I'm just looking at it. That night I was really emotionally beaten by what I saw here.I don't know it's clean but I don't think I'll ever forget it and that feeling. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Equally unforgettable, the scale of suffering and death inside Gaza, an average of 2,000 people a week killed, two- thirds of them women, children and the elderly, the worst I have ever witnessed while covering a wall. My only access to Gaza with the IDF, revealing an apocalyptic landscape, where every building appears crushed, collapsed, shot up, burnt or blown apart, nothing untouched by the war. Destruction on a scale I've never encountered before.",
