The controversial CEO of Tesla and Twitter the first to lose a $200 billion, billion with a \"B\", According to the Bloomberg's billionaire index, Musk is now worth a paltry $137 billion.Good enough to make him second richest man in the world, but also means that his net worth has fallen by $203 billion since peaking at $340 billion in November of 2021. Tesla's sinking stock prices largely responsible for that drop. And his $44 billion purchase of Twitter hasn't done much to help either. Sure there are a lot of people willing to take some of his cash. Today is the final day of business and final day of existence for the January 6th House Select Committee. Moments ago, the panel released more stunning text messages and put out a new statement summing up their work. They wrote, \"We overcame many hurdles including efforts to conceal, obstruct our work. And more than a dozen lawsuits, many witnesses hid behind claims of privilege, including Donald Trump himself who initially blustered he would be willing to testify then sued so he could actually avoid facing our questions.\" Let's break it all down with Tom Foreman at the wall for us. Tom, walk us through some of these new text messages just released. Pretty interesting.",

Trying to start a fight in the car trying to make his car go to the capitol. Another aide, Trump told he couldn't go to the capitol sort of shrugged it off. Same moment? A different moment? Somebody's testimony not entirely true? We still don't know. Still many, many questions what happened that day.

And he is with his family and that he is receiving \"excellent care\" at the hospital. But there are a lot of questions. Jeremy is known to own and utilize these snowplows. He posts videos of himself frequently on Instagram of him clearing the snow and in his long driveway and nearby streets of others. So he is used to being around this heavy machinery. So unclear exactly what happened. Did he fall off of a snowplow? Did it roll back on him? A lot of speculation on social media what could have happened. We are expecting to potentially hear some more details later today from his team. But, again, this is a very tough situation for him, for everyone involved. And, again, he is in critical condition. This was a very traumatic incident that took place yesterday morning near his home. You know what a way to kick off the new year on new year's eve for him.

Looking at serious adverse side effects including brain swelling andbrain blooding seen in a small group of participants in clinical trials. What we know about the drug and how it works. It's similar to other Alzheimer's drugs seen in development where it uses antibodies to clear amyloid plaque, a hallmark of the disease. You see on the screen here, in a clinical trial the drug appeared to reduce cognitive and functional decline by 27 percent when researchers looked at potential risks, we saw in a group of participants given Lecaneman, serious adverse effects compared with 3 percent of those given a placebo. FDA officials will discuss that this week. What we know about the drug, clearing amyloid plaque, hallmarks of the disease include plaque, tangles, chronic inflammation. Loss of neural connections. All of that part of these discussions, and we are keeping an eye on the FDA and what it may decide by this Friday -- Abby?",

      "sentences": "Yes. First of all, he certainly has, Abby, and I think that's certainly something that in certain ways might taint his legacy.But I think for many people that some of the things that happened with abuse in the Catholic Church are a bigger problem than Pope Benedict and certainly span a lot longer than Pope Benedict was actually the pope. It's certainly something that he took note of and apologized for as well. One of the things he did in the last months of his life is he acknowledged there were mistakes made not just when he was pope. But also, for instance, when he was the archbishop in Munich as well, so it's definitely something that will influence the way people view Pope Benedict. There's two different ways to look at this. On the one hand, you have the Catholic Church as a whole around the world and Benedict might have been seen as an interim pope after John Paul II and before Pope Francis. He was certainly a lot more quiet than that. But I do think inside the Vatican, inside the power center of the church there's pretty much no one that had more influence than Pope Benedict XVI and before that when he was Cardinal Ratzinger. Inside the walls behind me, people are saying this is the end of a massive era in the Catholic Church -- Abby?",
