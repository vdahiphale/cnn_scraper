Democratic Tennessee lawmaker Justin Jones is now back in his State House seat after Republicans kicked him out last week for protesting on the chamber floor. Nashville City Council voted unanimously yesterday to return him to that seat he was sworn back in on the steps of the state capitol surrounded by supporters there. He's one of three Democratic lawmakers who did face expulsion over the protest. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, they were kicked out. Gloria Johnson was not.CNN's Isabel Rosales is in Nashville. Representative Jones has his seat again. What does he say he's going to do with it now? ISABEL ROSALES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): John, good afternoon here. Before I get into what Representative Justin Jones is doing now with his newly established seat again at the State House, let me first tell you that we did hear from the Governor, Bill Lee, here in the last hour. And he is announcing that in response to the shooting at the Covenant School that killed six including three nine-year-old students, he is now going to sign an executive order aimed at strengthening background checks when it comes to gun purchases. He's also calling on lawmakers in a general assembly to essentially pass a Red Flag Law. This is a law that would allow judges to seize firearms away from people who are deemed to be a threat to themselves or to others. Now, Justin Jones, he tells us that he plans to file legislation on gun reform that because he's a new member, he can now file 15 bills. And every single bill will deal with gun reform. He intends to file those bills by the end of the week. Now, shortly after that council vote to give him back his job yesterday, he gave a fiery speech. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Deja Taylor has been charged with felony child neglect and misdemeanor recklessly leaving a loaded firearm so as to endanger a child.That is the legal verbiage there. That's according to prosecutors who say. This comes after a thorough investigation by the Newport News police and the Commonwealth's attorney's office. Joining me now for more on this is defense and trial attorney Misty Marris. Misty, can you give us a sense of the charges? There's a lot of -- sort of legalese there. But what are we looking at here? MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE &amp; TRIAL ATTORNEY: Yes. And this is interesting because remember, the person that pulled the trigger is a six-year- old. And it's very difficult under the law to hold parents culpable for the acts of their children. However, in this case, it's a bit of a different argument. The first felony charge is a child neglect charge. It means that the mother had an act or omission relating to the care of her child that resulted in reckless disregard for human life. Now, the second charge is a misdemeanor charge. That relates to how the gun was maintained in the home, and it was accessible to this six-year-old. And it resulted in a risk of life or limb to a child under 14. So, a couple of things here. Virginia, that statute is a bit different than you see across the country because it doesn't specify how the gun has to be maintained. It doesn't say locked in a safe --",

So, I want to ask you about a lawsuit that's being brought by the teacher. She was shot. I mean, it had to have been a terrifying moment, not only for her, but she's trying to also save her children. She is now going forward and saying, look, this isn't just about, you know, the mom in this case or even the child in this case, but I was not protected by the school administration.

Now, the civil suit says that there were actually three opportunities where there were warnings that this child had a gun and the school failed to act, the school failed to search and didn't call the police, didn't remove him from the classroom. They had ample opportunity to, they failed to do so.So, this is really what we call a negligence case, meaning that they failed to act. And that would result in liability. And I think from the teacher's perspective, not only does it relate to this particular classroom but it's a lesson learned on the broader sense about how to handle these types of cases to call in law enforcement when there's even a question mark to avoid a tragedy. Luckily here, it stopped with just this horrific injury and obviously the fear but this could have been a much worse situation.

We have also learned that he purchased the weapon used in this tragic incident on yesterday, on April the fourth. He purchased the weapon legally from one of the local dealerships here in Louisville. We have executed a search warrant on his residence and we have recovered items. And we cannot get into specific details on what we recover at this time because again, the investigation is ongoing. And we want to make sure that we're providing accurate information. The family deserves that and the community deserves that. We also would like to share that later on this afternoon, we will be releasing body-worn camera footage of the incident. And so that information at the time will be released to you and the location, so everyone will be privy to that information. Thank you.",
