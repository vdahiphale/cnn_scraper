Basically, what he was able to do over the course of the last two days here in Beijing was really effectively engage his Chinese counterparts, something that he hasn't done here in Beijing to date. This was his first visit to China as secretary of state, the first Biden cabinet official to visit China.But we really should note that they didn't make progress on one of the key issues that the Biden administration was hoping to push the ball forward on. That is military-to-military channels of communication between the U.S. and China. As you heard in that introduction, the secretary told me that that was something that he raised repeatedly with his Chinese counterparts here in Beijing. He said it is critical to establish those channels. But it's not something that China agreed to do on this visit. He said that is something that the United States will continue working on. And I asked him why the United States would be sending other U.S. officials to China in the coming weeks if they wouldn't agree to these military-to-military channels, because he did say that there was the expectation for further administration officials to visit Beijing. He essentially said that there needs to be engagement between the two sides. Diplomacy, talking to one another is more effective than not having those conversations. When it comes to the war in Ukraine, the secretary said that China has said that it will not provide lethal aid to Russia to be used in the war in Ukraine. He said that isn't a new position, necessarily, for China, but he reiterated concerns to his Chinese counterparts about Chinese companies providing that lethal aid to Russian. And then, it's also important to note when it comes to issues of economic stability. He said that he really sought to make sure that the Chinese knew that the United States isn't trying to contain them. They're trying to make sure that they take actions that protect the United States in the realm of national security. And that is leading the Biden administration's policies that have angered the Chinese counterparts in some areas, specifically on semiconductors and the like. He also mentioned human rights, the Americans who are wrongfully detained here in China, among other issues. And of course, we'll watch to see what happens over the course of the following days as this meeting is really kind of digested in Washington.",

      "sentences": "Well, frankly, they're worried about getting caught in the middle, right, between two superpowers, as they are, and as was made clear by this meeting between Blinken and Xi and other senior Chinese officials. It's good that they're talking, but there is still a great distance between the U.S. and China on the Taiwan issue.Taiwan taking the threat of Chinese military action very seriously. They're preparing every day. I watched military exercises. They're preparing for the possibility of a Chinese invasion. But they're deliberately trying to avoid provoking China. They prefer the status quo. They don't want it to escalate. And they, of course, have a hand in that, their own actions, but they also worry about the hands of other superpowers, China and the U.S. here. It's good that China and the U.S. are talking about this issue, but in their public comments, you see there is still great distance. Secretary Blinken accused China of provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, placing the blame on China. For instance, we saw a Chinese jet fly close to a U.S. surveillance aircraft recently, a Chinese warship sail close to a U.S. warship recently. And then you have China on the other side, basically warning the U.S. away from any upset to the One China policy, as it's known. So big picture, on the issue of Taiwan, good that the super powers are talking here, but those talks show that there's still a lot of distance there. And one specific point, as Kylie was noting, the U.S. wanted to come out of these meetings with an agreement on military-to- military contact so that those incidents, as we've seen recently, don't escalate into something bigger. They didn't leave with an agreement on such contacts.",

Based on what we heard, what we learned from Secretary Blinken, calling this healthy, candid, constructive, saying to our own Kylie Atwood that he had raised the matter about communication channels, specifically, those military-to- military communications channels, raised it repeatedly, there's no movement on that front. What is your main takeaway, based on what we're hearing from both officials in terms of how you would classify this meeting and this trip?",

      "sentences": "Well, first, how I would classify it would be positive. The main takeaway, which I haven't heard anyone mention yet, is the fact that President Xi Jinping decided to meet with Tony Blinken. Tony's not the head of state. He's secretary of state.That is an intentional and symbolically important move by the Chinese government to show a desire to continue to work constructively on the relationship. And I firmly expect on the back of that that Xi Jinping will be coming to the United States, absent any sudden crisis, to the Apex Summit in San Francisco this fall where President Biden intends to be for a couple of days. So that's what everyone is going to be focusing on and talking about for the future. But as you suggest, the reality is that we do not have any high-level military-to-military ties. We don't have arms agreements with the Chinese as they are dramatically expanding their nuclear capabilities, their advanced defense capabilities, their A.I. capabilities in national security. And as we've seen in the past few weeks, there have been a couple of near-miss intentional provocations/accidents in the Taiwan straits and in the South China Sea. And if the Americans and Chinese end up directly in conflict by mistake, we don't have the level of trust or engagement on the defense side to try to bring down those tensions. So the relationship is incredible important, and it's also becoming more dangerous.",

And of course, when you talk about the defense sector, Chinese owned -- state-owned corporations and state-linked corporations are the most important in the space. So the government does have a lot more control and ownership than the U.S. government does or any sort of free market democracy. Also keep in mind that this is not just about believing the Chinese.It's about verification and deterrence. The United States found out that there were Chinese government activities to provide support militarily. That was never executed on, but there was such engagement. The Americans not only called the Chinese out on that back in February, but they also made it public, as did the U.K., as did NATO. That embarrassed the Chinese, but it also made it very clear that there would be direct secondary U.S. sanctions against Chinese companies if that were to pass. That would be a radically worse U.S.- China relationship than we presently have. China's having a hard time with a strong growth this year. They're thinking about stimulus on the back of their end of zero COVID policy. They don't need that kind of an economic fight with the Americans. So this is less about trust, this is more about capabilities.",

We even spoke with former Defense Secretary Esper earlier this morning, who -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- but basically was saying, there is concern that the U.S. looks a little too eager in this meeting in sending Antony Blinken over, in having this meeting with Xi. We know that what's behind it in many ways for China is economic, in terms of what they're concerned about. Could that also, could you flip that? Does that give the U.S. a little bit of an upper hand in terms of certain relationships, certain meetings if this is about economic interests and perhaps what the U.S. could control there?",

So if there's greater leverage for the Americans, I think it comes from that.But I agree with you that the Americans look eager. And by the way, I don't put that primary on the government. I actually put it primarily on the American CEOs, who have been working hard to get back over to China and get their business going. And in that regard, we should recognize that most American bankers, technology sector leaders, manufacturers, they look a lot more -- they're more aligned with European and Asian governments than they are with Washington. They're the ones that were a lot faster to go to Beijing than Tony Blinken was, frankly. And so I do think that the level of interdependence between the two countries matters an awful lot.

Three-quarters of Republicans say in polls that discrimination against Whites is now as big a problem as bias against minorities, over three-fifths say White men are the most discriminated group in society. There are virtually no Republican leaders who challenge that belief despite substantial evidence to the contrary on wealth gaps and poverty and concentrated poverty in schools. And especially, I think, for Republicans of color, that it is very hard to get hurt on anything else if you challenge that bedrock belief within the coalition that the real victims of discrimination in society now are conservatives, Whites, Christians, conservatives, and you just don't see anybody in the party challenging that.
