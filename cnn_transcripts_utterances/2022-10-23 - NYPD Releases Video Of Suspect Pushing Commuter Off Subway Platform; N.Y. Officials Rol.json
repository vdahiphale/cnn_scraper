The suspect, on parole and wearing an ankle bracelet.Plus, a pledge to keep the student debt relief program moving full speed ahead, just a day after a court ruled to hit the brakes on loan cancelations for now. And which major retailers won't be open on Thanksgiving Day? You're live in the CNN Newsroom. Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. We begin this hour in New York, where officials say they are working to tackle the rising crime on the city's subway system. The city has seen a wave of crimes like this one. Police releasing new video today of a man pushing someone off the subway platform onto the tracks. The victim was not hit by a train but was injured. Police are still searching for the suspect. The NYPD says subway crimes have skyrocketed 41 percent from the same time last year. Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul announcing new plans to address the problems. CNN's Gloria Pazmino joining us live now. Gloria, what are officials say?",

You can see that that man who was pushed onto the subway tracks was completely caught off guard. And there have been several incidents similar to this one, including ones that have ended in fatalities.So both the mayor and the governor trying to get together to announce a plan to increase subway safety. Now, they are acknowledging that even as a transit ridership increases in the last couple of months, they need to do more about safety. And so here's a little bit about what they're going to do, they're putting together a plan to increase the number of police officers that are patrolling stations. They are also going to be increasing the amount of overtime shifts, 1,200 of them in order to increase those patrols. And they will be creating two new units at psychiatric centers creating 50 inpatient beds for people who are mentally ill. Now, Fred, that last part is such a crucial part of the plan, because there has been an acknowledgment that there is a mental health crisis unfolding in the city. In fact, the mayor spoke about this yesterday saying that nine of the homicides that have taken place in the subway system, so far this year, involved people who had a history of mental illness. Now, we did press the mayor about this idea that increasing police officers will lead to more safety and that people will feel like it's safer to ride the subway. Some of these incidents have happened at stations that were being patrolled. This is what the mayor and the governor had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: We have to look at the totality of public safety. And what we have found in our analysis is that when that police officer makes that quick apprehension, he's prevented the repeated crimes. There's a small number of people who are repeated committing these crimes. GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D), NEW YORK: The MTA is going to be ensuring that there are security guards at the turnstiles as well. So they can monitor situations that if someone sees something, hear something, they have one more person they can speak to while they're in the station, but also to determine -- (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He should have been incarcerated. He should be locked up.He's out on parole. He's wearing an ankle monitor and he commits a double homicide. I mean, what else do you need? And this is being repeated in many cities across the country. We have to find the right balance. And I believe that we've just gone too far over and I realized that, you know, people were talking about police reform. I believe that there is a need for reform, criminal justice reform, period. There's a need for that. But at the same time, we've got violent people among us, and some of them need to be locked up. They don't need to be in society. And we're giving people second, third, fourth, fifth chances. At some point in time, you got to realize that some of these guys are unsalvageable. There are others that are, and I'm all for alternatives to incarceration. But we need to think that through and we need to have systems that are robust enough to be able to track people and keep them on the straight and narrow.

It's not just a policing issue. You've got mental illness, you got homelessness, you've got all these things going on. Again, consequences for people that do commit crime, and these things have to be taken very seriously. And you can't wait until it gets out of control in order to put in place strategies. You have to be consistent, you know?New York had, at one point in time, one of the safest subway systems in America because of the actions that were taken. I don't know what happened. I'm not in New York, but they need to be consistent. They need to come up with a strategy that can be sustained long term, because, again, you know, this is a complex problem.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): As the crow flies, the front line is only a few 100 yards away in Bakhmut. Ukraine's forces are both outmanned and outgunned here but holding on because they say they're outwitting the Russians.

It helps us to save lives during both the assault and the withdrawal. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Ukraine's army says the Russians have around five times more troops here than Kyiv does.

Usually, support for basically every kind of gun restriction goes up after a horrific shooting like that. But this time around was a little bit different.But you still saw Democrats pass the assault has been through the House, even knowing that it wasn't going to go anywhere in the Senate. And you haven't really seen a lot of races where the issue has been the main issue, the forefront. You know, better work in Texas, you know, the Ohio governor's race have really featured it more. Stacey Abrams in Georgia, to some degree, has also made this a marquee issue. But a lot of those candidates aren't really doing well in their races. And so I think there's probably a tendency, this time around to shy away from the issue on either side, really. And we've seen this from the gun groups as well, they're still raising and spending tens of millions of dollars in this election. But you've seen a shift to where they're incorporating other issues into their messaging. It's not just gun control for every town, it's now abortion and now they're spending in state secretary races that don't have really anything to do with gun policy, or at least --",

While Xi Jinping is all about one man rule, and those closest to him all men. For the first time in at least 25 years, there's zero women in the 24-member Politburo, the second most powerful group in party hierarchy. Since Xi took power, he's purged rivals, crushed dissent, reasserted communist party control over every aspect of China. He's only expected to double down on his iron rule in his third term and beyond. Xi's next five years may see more tense U.S.-China relations, more intimidation of Taiwan, with the world dealing with an ever more authoritarian and aggressive China. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
