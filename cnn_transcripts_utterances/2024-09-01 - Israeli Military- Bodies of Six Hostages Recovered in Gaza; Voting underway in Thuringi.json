The Israeli military says it recovered the bodies of six hostages from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area on Saturday. The IDF has now identified all six saying their families have been notified. They are Ori Danino, Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, and Alex Lobanov. Israel's defensive minister -- defense minister says the six were killed just before troops could reach them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON (through translator): According to the initial assessment at our disposal they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short while before we reached them. They were abducted alive on the morning of October 7th by the Hamas terror organization. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.\"The news had led to protests in Israel and new calls for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal. The group Missing Families Forum issued a statement saying, \"Netanyahu abandoned the hostages.\" On Saturday, protesters said Netanyahu is putting the war with Hamas ahead of the hostages' lives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZAHILO SHAHAL MOL, PROTESTER: In order to stop this and to save lives, there is one thing that must be done. For lives to be saved, Netanyahu must be immediately replaced. For the hostages to return home, Netanyahu must leave now. Members of the coalition, step up and take action or be recorded in history as the full accomplices in the execution of the hostages.

They were discovered in a tunnel underground in the Rafah area during fighting above ground.The bodies were taken back into Israel, were identified in the families of those six people that were kidnapped on October 7th. Five of them from the Nova Music Festival that was taking place just outside the Gaza Strip and one of them from Kibbutz Be'eri as she was visiting her parents, both of whom were murdered that day. This is the information that has been put out. Now, you gave the statement there from the White House. There's also been a statement from Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has put out a statement, and we've heard from Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has also just, in the last hour or so, put out a statement saying, \"During this painful and difficult time, my thoughts and my heart are with the families of hostages who were killed.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to put out a statement, so far as I'm aware, unless it's happened in the last minute or two, and that is -- and I suppose that silence is something that is irking the families of loved ones who are still kidnapped or who have been killed even more so. Now, we know who the six victims were, who the six people killed were. I suppose the most high profile is Hersh Goldberg-Polin, the 23-year- old Israeli-American, who we, you recall, on October 7th, we saw with half of his left arm having been blown off, being herded onto the back of a truck and taken into the Gaza Strip. Hamas releasing a video of him when he was in captivity a few months ago. His parents, very vocal advocates for his release and the release of all the hostages, they'd met with President Biden. They even spoke at the Democratic National Convention about 10 days ago, and earlier today, they put out a statement saying how the entire family was devastated at that loss. [02:05:03] There's also Eden Yerushalmi. She was working as a bartender, 24-year- old, at the Nova Music Festival. She was on the phone to her sisters when she was captured, as she was trying to hide from the militants. Her last words to her sister, Shani, were, \"Shani, they caught me.\" Then there's also Carmel Gat, 40-year-old occupational therapist, was visiting her parents at Kibbutz Be'eri. Both of her parents were killed on October 7th. She was described by hostages released back in November during the first and only ceasefire deal as a guardian angel. There was Almog Sarusi, who was with his girlfriend who was mortally wounded at the Nova Music Festival. He stayed behind to try to help her, only to be kidnapped himself. There was Alex Lobanov, 32-year-old Russian-Israeli. His wife gave birth to their child five months ago while he was in captivity, so he never got to meet his second child. And then there's also Ori Danino, a 25-year-old man who took a number of people from the Nova Music Festival to safety in his car, only to turn around to go back to try to help more people and then be kidnapped himself. Those are the six Israelis who were -- whose bodies were discovered on Saturday by the IDF. And, of course, as you say, further angering and upsetting the families who have been calling for a hostage deal to be done. They've been saying for weeks, for months, that time is running out, that if a deal isn't done, that their loved ones will have little to no hope of being brought back alive. And this, sadly, is the fate of those six hostages whose bodies were discovered on Saturday and have now been returned to Israel.",

What details are you learning about the operation in which these IDF soldiers discovered these six hostages? MARK MACCARLEY, U.S. ARMY MAJOR GENERAL (Ret.): I think what I've learned is consistent with what your reporters have already discussed. It was, of course, a very difficult and treacherous recovery of the hostages within this subterranean environment. As I've stated multiple times, subterranean warfare is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors for ground soldiers. And in this instance, and unfortunately, tragically, while the Israeli, the IDF, discovered these hostages, they were found dead. And that certainly does not contribute at all to any resolution of this conflict. Of course, there are multiple questions that we can pursue about whether or not the actions that have been taken or the suggested actions, such as the establishment of this Philadelphi Corridor by the IDF, by Israel, would do anything to contribute to the hopeful resolution of this conflict.",

Well, let's bring you up to speed with breaking news out of the Middle East. The IDF says six hostages, whose bodies have been recovered in Gaza, were killed a short while before Israeli troops reached them. The statement says they were found in an underground tunnel in the city of Rafah on Saturday. Israel says Hamas is still holding about 100 other hostages, and about one-third of them are presumed to be dead. Meanwhile, a group representing hostage families is now blaming what it calls delays, sabotage and excuses for the failure to reach a deal to free their loved ones. The group has also called on the public to mobilize, as they accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of abandoning the hostages. Well, let's return to journalist Elliott Gotkine in London.

And they entered parliament in substantial numbers in 2017, which had been the first time in 60 years that a party like that had come into that building.And what we've seen them do is kind of grow incrementally. And just 2023, already in the area that we're watching for the electoral outcomes tomorrow, they won an administrative district. And just a few weeks ago, months ago, in the June E.U. elections, not only did they come in second, but they came in ahead of the entire coalition groups and parties that are currently in power. So I think as one looks ahead to just the 2025 federal elections that are coming up just about a year's time from now, there's a very strong indication of not only how well they will perform, but how well their policy agendas are likely to shape the political debates going into that election, Anna.",

EU-sceptic, climate denialist, you know, against sanctions on Russia, certainly against providing ongoing infrastructural and military support for Ukraine. They're very much on the wrong side of so much of global politics. But I think that where this political party has been especially skillful is tapping into so much of that sense of being left behind and some real genuine grievances in those five states that are located in the east of Germany and that were formerly part of East Germany where unemployment levels are higher and when there are still lingering disparities with Western Germany. The problem is that they have used and instrumentalized the kind of scapegoating of migrants to kind of capitalize around those votes. You know, and as so many people have pointed out with regards to, say, the Brexit vote or far-right politics in France today, it's not as if all of the supporters of the AfD support these anti-immigration, anti- Islam views. But what we've noticed is that the overwhelming majority of people that do support those views have gone to the AfD.

President Vladimir Putin recently visited Beslan in southern Russia to pay tribute to those who died during the attack and subsequent military operation. On September 1st, 2004, armed Chechen separatists took some 1,200 people hostage, holding them in a school gym rigged with explosives. The siege ended on September 3rd when Russian security forces stormed the building. More than 330 people were killed and more than 700 injured. Defense officials say seven U.S. troops are in stable condition after they were injured in a raid that killed at least 14 ISIS militants in western Iraq. U.S. Central Command says the raid was a partnered operation with Iraqi security forces. The U.S. says 15 militants were killed, but Iraq put the number at 14. The ISIS operatives were said to be armed with grenades and explosive suicide belts. The U.S. says there is no indication of any civilian casualties.
