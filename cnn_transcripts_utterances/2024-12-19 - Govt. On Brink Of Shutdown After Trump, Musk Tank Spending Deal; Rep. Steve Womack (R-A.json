And that is what the House speaker, Mike Johnson, is now trying to deal with behind the scenes.There have been a flurry of meetings to try to get Republicans on board behind one plan. There is no consensus yet, which is why there are major fears right now in the capital of a government shutdown, a potentially prolonged one as well -- guys? KEILAR: All right, that sounds dire. Manu, thank you for that report from the Hill. With us now is Republican Congressman Steve Womack of Arkansas. He serves on the House Appropriations Committee. Sir, thanks for taking the time with us this afternoon. Is there going to be a shutdown? REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR): Well, I pray not. I don't think that's wise on anybody's part, particularly at this time of year. In fact, any time. There are people out there that believe government shutdowns don't affect them, but they do. And it's -- it rolls off the tongue pretty easy to, you know, just say advocate for a shutdown. But that ignores the reality that a lot of very important federal workers, a lot of important federal duties just become very, you know, jeopardized, threatened. And -- and we don't need that at this time of year. This was a bit of a surprise yesterday, as I was quoted early this morning, I woke up yesterday not knowing that the debt ceiling was going to be part of this deal. And then by the afternoon, the debt ceiling was part of the deal. So I'm assuming that's what's being negotiated right now. How do you thin down, you know, pare down the 1,500-plus page C.R.. By the way, less than 100 pages of it is actually funding the government. How do you pare that down? Keep some provisions in there that are critically important, like disaster, like farm aid, those kinds of things. And at the same time deliver on a demand by the president- elect. And that is to deal with the debt ceiling before his inauguration.",

And this didn't come up until, as I say, the 11th hour yesterday. As you mentioned, I'm a senior appropriator. This -- this -- all this began back in September. Here we are on the eve of Christmas, you know, on the eve of a government shutdown, because we run out of money tomorrow. And the appropriators got their work pretty much finished, at least on the House side, and prepared to move these all across the floor, get into conference with the Senate and get it approved and signed into law. But we keep kicking this can down the road. This is the new norm for Congress, and that is to --",

They've promised people back home, they'll never vote for a debt ceiling.And look, is the United States government going to default on the paying of its bills? I just can't fathom a circumstance that would cause that to be the case. And -- and that scares the markets and that turns the economy upside down. We don't need to go there. On the left, on the on the Democrat side, I understand their reluctance to want to support any new deals because we had a negotiated plan that they we're willing to support. And now the tables have been turned. So we're in a chaotic situation right now. And I've been looking at a blue screen on my monitor all day long, and that's never a good thing the day before you lapse in funding.",

And -- but here's the -- here's the problem with shutting the government down is eventually it has to be reopened. And under what conditions would it be reopened? If you are able to extract concessions from the other side, then that's one thing. But if they're dug in and they're not going to give, then before long you're going to see the real impact on everyday Americans that a government shutdown actually proposes. And the results of that, I think, would be disastrous to both the new majorities in the House and the Senate and the incoming president.",

SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: So we are waiting on him, on Luigi Mangione and his attorneys to appear in court. We're told by our team inside that prosecutors are inside the courtroom. So we're waiting for the judge. We're waiting for him, and we're waiting for his attorneys. We believe, according to our Kara Scannell, that he is meeting with his attorneys currently. He has two attorneys here with him, a husband-and-wife team, Karen Agnifilo and Mark Agnifilo. We saw them coming here a couple of hours ago. And now they are meeting with him and we hope to get started here soon. This will be his first appearance. It will be a presentment where they're going to tell him -- the judge will tell him what he's charged with. He'll see a magistrate judge. And then we go from there. They will set a future date. But I think what will happen here, obviously, will be our first chance, really, to hear from his attorneys. It will be our chance to hear -- sort of hear anything they may say about the case. And then we hope, once they're done, they'll come down and speak to reporters. Coming in, they said they didn't want to make any comments. But I think, given the sort of last-minute surprise here with the FBI swooping in and charging him and sort of taking him away from the state court proceeding that we all expected today. The way in which he was brought over, helicopters and planes and that very long walk surrounded by dozens of law enforcement officials with -- with the mayor and the leading law enforcement officials from the NYPD. Quite a spectacle and something that certainly not many of us here have ever seen in any case. So it's going to be curious to see if there's going to be any kind of response from his attorneys once they wrap up in court, which we expect should be soon. We hope.",
