And OpenAI put out this safety report where it said it's concerned that the tool is so lifelike that people might become over-reliant and emotionally dependent on that tool.I want to read from you - for you a part of this report. OpenAI said, \"users might form social relationships with the AI, reducing their need for human interaction, potentially benefiting lonely individuals, but possibly affecting healthy relationships.\" They said, \"extended interaction with the model might influence social norms.\" So essentially what they're saying is that people might pull back on their human relationships to spend more time with ChatGPT. And this sounds kind of like science fiction, but even with the older version of the tool, this is already starting to happen. I spoke with a college student, Lisa Li, last month who said that she considers ChatGPT to be her boyfriend. I want to play for you a section of that interview. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You said, \"I was re-elected as Montana's governor in 2016 at the same time Donald Trump took our state by more than 20 points. It's never easy for Democrats to get elected in Montana because Democrats here are running against not only the opponent on the ballot but also against a conservative media and, at times, our own typecast of the national Democratic brand, coastal, overly educated, elitist judgmental, socialist, a bundle of identity groups and interests lacking any shared principles. The problem isn't the candidates we nominate, it's the perception of the party we belong to.\"That was in 2021. Do you think that is the problem Democrats still face today?

When he passed his child tax credit, when he passed his paid family medical leave, when he allows lunches for kids in schools, like those are sort of those bread and butter issues that the economic issues that I was talking about in that op-ed and I think that will resonate with people, because the Democratic brand at times, look, and you see - you see Trump and Vance trying to do that on a daily basis, change it into something that is a heck of a lot worse.

What's new in the last 48 hours is a major ground offensive across the border into Russian territory. Just over the northeast border of Ukraine, into the Kursk region, which we haven't seen before since the start of the full-scale invasion two and a half years ago, but even going back to ten years ago when Russia first invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine. And they're still there. And they're advancing. And they seem to have caught Russian forces off guard. There have been surrenders by numerous Russian forces. And you're starting to see members of the public in social media saying, what's happening here. You know, they're clearly fearful. I've been told by U.S. and Ukrainian officials that these forces are a mix of regular units as well as special operations units. And that's notable, Sara, because previous operations behind Russian lines inside Russian territory have often been small groups, sometimes Ukrainian sympathizers in Russia.
