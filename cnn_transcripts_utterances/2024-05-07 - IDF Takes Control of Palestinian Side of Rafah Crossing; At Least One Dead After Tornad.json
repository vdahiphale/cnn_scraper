IDF tanks are seen moving into that critical entry point as the IDF also conducted new airstrikes in an effort for Israel, as Israel says, to keep pressure on Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal. Israeli troops captured the crossing as Israel has long viewed this main crossing as a main route for Hamas to smuggle arms. This does raise fears, though, that humanitarian aid could come to a halt, stop moving into Gaza all together. Aid workers now telling CNN there is no safe place to go and no way to get there for the 100,000 Gazans told to evacuate.At the very same time here in the United States, President Biden is about to deliver a keynote address to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day, during which he's going to speak of the horrors of October 7th and the following rise of anti-Semitism. CNN's Becky Anderson is in Abu Dhabi following all of it this morning. And there is a lot going on. What is the very latest that you know of what's happening at the Rafah crossing right now, Becky?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's been a very, very, very busy 24 hours and a complicated one. Let's get you what we know. Israeli forces, as you rightly point out, have taken over the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, the IDF referring to it as having operational control of the area. You've been showing video there and we'll show it again of soldiers rolling in with their tanks replacing Palestinian flags with Israeli flags.This crossing has been the main entry point, of course, for aid into Gaza over the last seven months. Eyewitnesses on the Egyptian side of the border have said that all the aid trucks that would normally be waiting on that side to get in have gone and border officials on both sides have been asked to leave the area. And aid agencies are warning that the interruption of aid entry will halt what is this critical humanitarian response across the entire Gaza Strip. Israel also targeting Rafah with airstrikes overnight, and into this morning, killing at least 23. And I think it's important to note that Rafah has been hit with airstrikes for days and weeks now, killing hundreds of people. Many residents have now been told to evacuate to an area that many on the ground say does not have the basic needs for survival. People are terrified. Let's just point out what the Israeli perspective on this is. Rafah was necessary, they say, the foreign minister, Israel Katz, saying. And I quote in the past few hours, the entry of the IDF into Rafah promotes the two main goals of the war. That is the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas. If not for the hostages, he says, and I quote him here, dear to our hearts for those for whose release we are bound by a supreme obligation and we'll do everything to bring them home. He said the Hamas gang would have long ago been crushed and thrown into the dustbin of history. And he just went on at the back end of that to say that effectively, despite the political pressure on Israel, they will continue with their strategy. Kate?",

Behind me a residential home, the parts that were built out of stone still sort of standing, but a lot of this no longer livable. The family will have to find another place to live.As we walk over here, this was a garage structure that also was a part of this property, and that tornado, the direct hit here, flattening this structure. I don't know if you could see it behind me, but over there is a pickup truck. It just gives you a sense of the scale of this destruction, and further behind me, storage units. So, you see a lot of the items that were there, boats, personal possessions strewn about, completely destroyed. I mean, there is nothing to come back to there, and that is just a small glimpse of the destruction that took place overnight in this area. Barnsdall is a population of about a thousand people. We actually haven't been able to access the inside of the town because we are hearing from the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management that there is a natural gas leak. There's also so much debris that roads are blocked, and the priority right now, Sara, is on those search and rescue efforts. We mentioned, as you mentioned in the intro, at least one fatality confirmed so far, but right now, teams are going house to house or what's left of the house to make sure that there is no one still stuck or trapped beneath to make sure that they can account for everyone in this area. Now, the Osage Nation reservation is also nearby. We understand there are search and rescue efforts underway there, and also Bartlesville, another town nearby, taking a direct hit. In terms of historical tornadoes in Oklahoma, this isn't as massive as, thankfully, it could have been, but obviously, for the residents of areas like this, there's not much to come home to. Sara?",

Staff Sergeant Gordon Black was arrested last week for suspicion of theft, according to the Russian court, while he was traveling in Russia from his station, where he was stationed in South Korea. Officials say he was not AWOL, but the reason for his travels still not known, his arrest, though, very clearly adding to the tension between the United States and Russia that is already at a boiling point.CNN's Natasha Bertrand is bringing in more details and getting more on this.

Now, it's unclear at this point just whether the U.S. has had any luck getting in touch with him in terms of getting consular access to him. The U.S. embassy in Moscow, we're told, has been trying to get in touch with him. But, look, I mean, he is being charged, according to officials, with theft and criminal misconduct. And so he joins two other Americans, of course, who have been deemed wrongfully detained by Russia by the State Department, Paul Whelan, who is also a former Marine, as well as Evan Gershkovich, the reporter. So, it remains unclear here just how much access the United States is going to be able to get to him. But the State Department is reiterating at this point, don't travel to Russia. They're issuing a stern warning to American citizens saying there is no reason for you to be going. They said in a statement yesterday, quote, we have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. We reiterate our strong warnings about the danger posed to U.S. citizens inside the Russian Federation. U.S. citizens residing or traveling in Russia should depart immediately. We know there have been a number of discussions, a number of attempts by the U.S. to get some of these wrongfully detained Americans out of Russia, but with no luck. And so we're just going to have to wait and see what happens to this staff sergeant. He is going to be in pretrial detention, according to officials, at least until July 1st. Kate?",
