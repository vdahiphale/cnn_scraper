It's Thursday April the 25th, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Washington, where in the coming hours the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump should have absolute presidential immunity, including for his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump maintains the acts were part of his presidential duties.In their filing, Trump's attorneys argue, quote, a former president enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for his official acts. Criminal immunity arises directly from the executive vesting clause and the separation of powers. While judges have rejected those claims in many instances, the Supreme Court isn't held to their rulings. CNN's Brian Todd breaks down what's at stake today.

They have to be allowed to do their job. in arguing that he has presidential immunity.

Now there were seven key swing states that were targeted by the Trump campaign and the Trump team in that push. And this indictment points the finger directly at members of Trump's inner circle for helping orchestrate that effort. That includes people like White House -- former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. That includes people like the former president's one-time personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and conservative lawyer, John Eastman, who has been labeled the architect of the fake elector scheme. And that's really what's at question here in Arizona at the center of this indictment is the effort and the alleged conspiracy to put together these 11 fake electors and have them sign a fraudulent certificate that was ultimately submitted to the U.S. Congress. And the indictment alleges that the scheme only failed because Mike Pence declined to participate at the end of the day on January 6, 2021. Now we'll have to see how this criminal indictment plays out. Well, the next steps are initial court appearances. We could see some plea deals after that. But prosecutors in Arizona joining those in Georgia and Michigan to bring criminal charges for this fake elector scheme, and especially at a time when the federal case against Donald Trump has largely stalled because of the Supreme Court challenges. Now, the prosecutors here in Arizona are bringing these charges almost three years after these alleged actings took place. But Donald Trump himself is listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in this case. They joined Michigan as listing Donald Trump as sort of at the top of this alleged conspiracy.

The Hamas continues to insist on free movement of people within Gaza, a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and a ceasefire that will become permanent at some point in the future.Three things that the Israelis would be very hard pressed to actually agree to and really have made no indication that they actually would be willing to agree to because, of course, the Israeli government and the prime minister continues to insist that this war only ends when Hamas is completely destroyed.
