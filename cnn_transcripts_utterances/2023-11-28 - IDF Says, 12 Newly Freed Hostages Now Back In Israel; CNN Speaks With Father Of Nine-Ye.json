This is the first group release since the temporary pause was extended for two additional days.Also tonight, a CNN exclusive, a chilling new account from an Israeli father describing how his nine-year-old daughter survived for weeks as a hostage and the joy of being reunited after originally believing she didn't survive the October 7th terror attacks. Plus, another CNN exclusive, stunning new revelations from former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney revealing what her former GOP colleagues really thought about Donald Trump and his election lies.

This is the second night in a row that we have seen those hostages board helicopters and go directly to hospitals. But tonight, Wolf, they crossed through that Rafah crossing into Egypt, driving that very short, less than two-mile drive to the Kerem Shalom crossing and then putting their feet firmly on Israeli soil for the first time in more than 50 days.This now puts the total people released to 61 Israelis and 24 nationals over the course of these last five days. But, Wolf, now as we head into the final day tomorrow of this two-day extension of that initial four-day pause in the fighting in order to allow for the release of these hostages as well as those Palestinian prisoners, there's now major questions about whether or not that truce can be extended further and whether or not groups beyond women and children could potentially also be released. And that's where the CIA director, Bill Burns, comes in. We're told that earlier today he was in Qatar, in the capital of Doha, meeting with his Qatari, Israeli and Egyptian intelligence counterparts, all of this aimed at trying to see whether or not an additional deal to try and extend this truce further can be made and whether or not men in particular and Israeli soldiers could be included in this deal. But there are major questions about whether or not that is something that Hamas will agree to, whether Israel and Hamas can reach terms on that. As it stands, Wolf, ten additional hostages are set to be released tomorrow as part of this initial extension. But if there is no deal beyond that, Wolf, the war could very well resume.",

And all of a sudden, the door opened up and she just ran. It was beautiful, just like I imagined it, running together. I squeezed. I probably squeezed too hard. And it's only when she stepped back a little, I could see her face was chiseled like mine, whereas before she left, it was a chubby, curly, young kid face. Yes, she's lost a lot of body weight. And the color, I've never seen her so white. The other and the most shocking, disturbing part of meeting was she was just whispering. I couldn't hear her.

More hostages were, thankfully, freed today, but, again, not the two American women the White House strongly advocated for. There's still one day left of this temporary truce, but is it a failure that, at this point, at least until now, the Biden administration has not secured their release? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, every release is really important. And, well, we obviously place a priority on Americans, we know that it is important to get every single one of those hostages out of captivity and back home to their loved ones. So, we will continue to press for the release of all Americans and all Israelis. I hope that Hamas accepts the fact that they can continue to release hostages and, in return, save the lives of their own citizens at the same time.

I hope you will see an extension of this ceasefire. But let's also be clear, Israel is not done. Israel is going to destroy Hamas' military capability. I believe they have a moral obligation to do that. I believe it's in the United States' strategic interest for Israel to destroy Hamas. So, these are temporary pauses necessary to get the hostages out.

The picture we're looking at right now, Cheney writes, she thought it was a fake when she saw it, and she writes, she said to Kevin, Mar-a-Lago, what the hell, Kevin? McCarthy, they're really worried. Trump's not eating, so they asked me to come see him. Cheney, what? You went to Mar-a-Lago because Trump's not eating? McCarthy, yes, he's really depressed. As for Johnson, Wolf, Cheney writes -- she wrote this book, we should understand, before Johnson became speaker. But what we find out is that Johnson played a critical role in helping Trump behind the scenes, and she writes, quote, when I confronted him with the flaws in his legal arguments, Johnson would often concede or say something to the effect of, we just need to do this one last thing for Trump.

House Republicans have long been clamoring for Hunter Biden's testimony, and last month, the committee issued a subpoena to Hunter Biden for him to appear for a closed-door deposition in December.However, Hunter Biden's legal team has already rejected that offer. They say they believe that Hunter Biden should be able to tell his own story and that they are worried about potential leaks from the committee. So, we've already heard from Chairman James Comer. He is the head of the committee, and he said he is rejecting that offer and still is insisting on that closed-door deposition. Let me read you part of his statement and his reasoning here. He said, Hunter Biden is trying to play by his own rules instead of following the rules required of everyone else. We expect full cooperation with our subpoena for a deposition but also agree that Hunter Biden should have the opportunity to testify in a public setting at a future date. Now, Republicans had hoped to wrap up their impeachment inquiry into the president as soon as possible, even though they do have yet to establish a link between the president and his son's business deals, which is a focus of their committee investigation.
