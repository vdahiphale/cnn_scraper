Boeing struck this deal with the Department of Justice this summer, in part, to avoid a public trial where they could have faced harsher -- they could have faced harsher penalties, both financially and also in terms of charges. But here's what the deal looks like. They pled guilty to defrauding essentially the FAA because they did not disclose a software system update that ultimately resulted in these two crashes. They also are paying out a sizable amount of money, but not as much as maybe they could have paid out if this went public to a trial and close to $1 billion in fines. But the families saying this really does not go far enough. They were asking for close to $25 billion in penalties for Boeing. And they were also asking for executives to be held personally accountable for these fatalities, for the loss of their family members. Ultimately, today, the judge could do three things. He could choose to accept this deal. He could choose to reject it, which means the two parties would have to go back to the table and figure out a more suitable deal. Or he could listen to arguments today from both sides. But then say, I'm going to take a little bit of time to figure out exactly what I want to do here. But obviously, Boris and Brianna, for these families, this is excruciating. This is now years of having to relive what has happened to their loved ones. For Boeing, in part, they're on very shaky financial footing since these two plane crashes in 2018 and 2019. They've lost $33 billion. There's currently a strike going on with their union. They're losing potentially up to $1 billion a month. So they do not want this to go back to the table. They do not want to have to pay out any additional money. But the DOJ and Boeing saying this is a fair and just deal, asking the judge to say that, too. But the families arguing this morning that this does not go far enough to make up for what happened to their loved ones -- Brianna, Boris?",

They we're only expecting to be there for about an hour. The 12 people who were trapped were there for nearly six hours, a harrowing ordeal that resulted in one person losing their life after an elevator malfunctioned. We do know that by 8:00 p.m. last night, all of the people were safely aboveground. The sheriff says that they asked for pizza. So that was waiting for them upstairs. They were in good spirits, according to officials. And one official actually described it as a big happy ending to an otherwise tragic day. Now, according to the sheriff, all this began to unfold at around noon. That's when they got reports about one of the groups -- there were two groups in the mine. One of them got stuck about 500 feet below the surface in that elevator. That group included 11 adults, two children. That group also included the person who lost their life. Now we know that four other people had minor injuries. They we're pulled up in that elevator almost immediately. And then the officials didn't want to use the elevator anymore because they didn't know if it was safe for use. The other folks were stuck there for hours. They did have blankets and water and chairs. They had a tour guide there who was a mining experts, so he was keeping them calm. And they didn't know about the death. The sheriff, though, tearing up when describing the trauma of the incident. Take a listen. JASON MIKESELL, SHERIFF, TELLER COUNTY, CO, SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT: It really is a big concern of ours is to make sure everybody is -- especially at a traumatic like this with children. You know, it's one of those things, you threw up a little bit when you're dealing with the kids that have to go through these types of things. I'll tell you that's one of the things that touch my heartstrings. But they're safe and that's -- that's all we can hope for right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
