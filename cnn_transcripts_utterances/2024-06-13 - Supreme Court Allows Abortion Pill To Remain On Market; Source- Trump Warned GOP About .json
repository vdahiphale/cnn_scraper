The United States Supreme Court has issued a very important ruling on reproductive rights. The justice has unanimously rejected a challenge to the medical abortion pill mifepristone, allowing the drug to remain on the market. The ruling comes two years after the court took away women's constitutional right to an abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade.I want to bring in our panel to assess what's going on, dramatic developments indeed. I want to start with our Senior Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic. Walk us through this ruling, Joan. Tell us what it means.",

      "sentences": "Sure. It was really high drama in the courtroom this morning. This ruling actually came a little bit earlier than we were expected in this month of June, but I think there was a clear reason why. They were unanimous in striking this down.And let me just set the scene. You know, the justices all take the bench, all nine of them, and I noticed right away that Ashley Kavanaugh, the wife of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who announced this decision, had come in and taken a seat in one of the special guest sections. And the chief justice turned to him right at the start and said, Brett Kavanaugh has our first opinion of the day and to have announced a case that was argued on March 26. So that's a pretty narrow time frame. But what it shows is how emphatically this court nine to zip reversed what the Fifth Circuit had done that would have dramatically limited access to a medication that is the main way that women and their pregnancies today. Here's how the case got up there. A group of anti-abortion physicians had claimed they had actually been injured by the Food and Drug Administration's approval of this drug and its expansion of access to the drug. In 2016 and 2020-21, the FDA had said that this drug could be available at 10 weeks of pregnancy, not just only at 7, and had also given more access for women to obtain the drug by mail. And these anti-abortion physicians who do not perform abortions, they do not handle abortions in any way, they said that nonetheless, they were injured by this policy because, first of all, they might, in emergency room settings, have to conduct abortions. Brett Kavanaugh went through all of the reasons for why they should be able to sue, rejected them all out of hand during a 10-minute dramatic rendition of his excerpts, you know, saying, look, you say that your consciences would be injured to have to perform abortions. He said, federal law already has a conscience clause that says that no physician who doesn't want to perform abortion has to do it. Then said that, you know, insurance costs, money costs, advocacy. And bottom line, he said the federal courts are available to people who have real injuries. There's no reason for people who want any kind of policy change, policy or political. Those people should turn to the executive branch of the legislative branch to get their way. As I said, all nine justices signed on. So for now, access to this drug that has become the major way that women and a pregnancy will be available as the FDA had said was safe and effective.",

With regard to the future of mifepristone, that's still undecided. And I think it's still undecided because there could be other plaintiffs. It's still undecided because there could be other challenges. You could have a future Republican president who actually takes a different approach to an old federal law called the Comstock Act, which, you know, I don't think could fairly be interpreted, but which Republicans argue could be interpreted to ban mail-in mifepristone. So, you know, Wolf, I think this is a very much a sort of short term victory, but there's still quite a lot to play for when it comes to access to mifepristone in states that allow it.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R), HOUSE SPEAKER: President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy and excitement and enthusiasm this morning. That is what we're seeing in the party throughout the country. There is something happening in the country. That's the phrase I used to introduce the president this morning, and he repeated the phrase a number of times in his own remarks.

The fact that a couple of weeks ago, Marjorie Taylor Greene tried to oust the sitting speaker, Mike Johnson. According to Marjorie Taylor Greene, who I spoke to just a few minutes ago, Donald Trump addressed that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R), GEORGIA: I really found his speech to be one of my favorite speeches. He came in, talked to the conference, was very honest. He was funny. He was joking around constantly with everyone. He was really sweet to me. He said to Speaker Johnson, he goes, OK, you got one more seat. You need to be tougher. He saw me -- I was sitting back a little ways. He saw me in there and he was like, hello, Marjorie. He's always so sweet and recognizes me. And he said, are you being nice? He was joking.

Just really bringing you back to the fact that Donald Trump in these forums likes to have a discussion, likes to feed off the audience, doesn't want this just to be him delivering a message to the conference.
