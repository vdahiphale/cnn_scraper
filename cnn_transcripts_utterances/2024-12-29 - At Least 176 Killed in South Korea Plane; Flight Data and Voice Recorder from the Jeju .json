This is CNN Newsroom.Of course, we're kicking off with breaking news. Investigators have recovered both the flight data and voice recorders or black boxes from the Jeju Air flight that crashed in South Korea, 181 people were on board the Boeing 737-800 when it crash landed at Muan International Airport on Sunday morning. Officials have confirmed the deaths of 149 people. Two crew members were rescued. The officials say the rest of the passengers and crew are presumed dead. This video we're going to show you now shows the plane dragging along the runway with no landing gear in sight, no wheels at all. Moments later, the plane bursts into flames. We're not going to show you that moment. South Korean officials say the jet made a mayday call shortly after the control tower warned about birds in the area. Well, CNN Correspondent Mike Valerio is following all of this breaking news from Seoul. Mike, thank you for joining me. This is obviously horrible news, and at a time when so many families would be celebrating the holidays. For anyone that's waking up just now, just tuning in, could you just tell us what is the latest, please?",

The CEO of Jeju Air, for what it's worth, saying that there were no anomalies or any instances of accidents in this aircraft history that could lead anybody to think that, all right, well, this aircraft may have a problem in the next few days and weeks. Jeju Air founded in 2005, and it has been the largest budget air carrier in South Korea. So, it's known throughout Asia. A good, if not great safety record, up until this point, the worst air disaster involving a South Korean airline since the late '90s when a Korean airliner crashed into a hill in Guam, killing upwards of 220 people, Ben.",

We want to make sure that we double, triple check and verify everything. We should have some lines of reporting on that front in the next few hours, as Europe and the rest of the world begins to wake up. But at this moment, it's unclear the conditions that they are in.

Hundreds of emergency workers are on the scene You Hours after the Jeju Air jet crash landed in Muan, South Korea, the death toll has officially risen to 149 people. Two crew members have been rescued. The remaining passengers and crew are now presumed dead.Russian President Vladimir Putin has apologized for the fact that an Azerbaijan Airlines flight crashed after entering a Russian airspace on Christmas Day. But he didn't say that Russia was responsible during a phone call with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev. Putin called it a tragic incident. He said Russia's air defense systems were active at the time, which a U.S. official has suggested may have mistakenly shot down the jet. Aliyev told Putin that external interference led to a complete loss of control before the plane went down in Kazakhstan, killing 38 people. The Kremlin says Russia's investigative committee has opened a criminal case. An investigation is now underway in Florida after a train collided with a fire truck on Saturday. Here you can see from the footage from the train itself, you can see it moving along on the tracks, heading toward a fire engine that appears to be moving slowly through a traffic crossing. There it is there. We've stopped the footage just before the moment of impact. Officials say three firefighters were transported to a nearby hospital, 12 passengers sustained minor injuries, but no fatalities were reported. This isn't the first incident involving the train operator Brightline, which provides passenger rail service between Orlando and Miami. The Federal Railroad Administration says 34 people were killed in incidents involving Brightline trains between September 2023 and June of this year.

      "sentences": "Well, Ben, you're exactly right. So, the death toll stands at 176 people, which means that three people are unaccounted for. So, if you imagine the tableau, that's happening about three and a half hours south of where we are in Seoul, there are myriad families, a whole multitude of people who are gathered in a conference room who are just waiting to see if the remains of their family members have been found, if they've been put into a temporary morgue. And this is a situation where the cataclysmic that I'm just checking my notes here, it seems as though 11 victims authorities have not been able to tell if they're a man or a woman yet because the bodies and the remains were so badly damaged.So, it seems as though we're waiting to see if three people or three sets of remains can be found. And again, that would lead to the deadliest air disaster involving a South Korean airline. We're already there since the late '90s when a Korean airliner crashed in Guam, killing upwards of 220 people. So, the question is essentially, what happened with the landing gear here, what series of events cascaded that had the landing gear fail in the front and the aft portion of the aircraft. So, we know that just before 9:00 a.m. local time, control tower signaled to this aircraft, the 737-800 manufactured by Boeing in Washington State, that there could be a risk of bird strikes happening in and around the area very close to the approach of this airport. So, two minutes later, the cockpit sends a mayday signal after that warning, and then four minutes later, the plane crashes. It remains unclear, though, what if any connection, a potential, and I stress the word potential, bird strike might have had on why the aircraft wing flaps were not deployed? Flaps that slowed the plane down? Why the plane touchdown, it's underbelly scraping the pavement of the runway very close to the end of the runway? And why exactly the landing gear would not have been deployed when one thing necessarily does not lead to another, a problem with engine two does not necessarily mean that there will be a problem deploying the landing gear? So, the hope is that one or both of the crew members who survived this crash in concert with the voice data recorder -- the voice recorder and the data recorder, the two components of the black box system can be used in concert to figure out what exactly happened here. And if this was a problem that was just specific to a fluke series of events with this one aircraft, or if perhaps there's some problem that the wider fleet of 737-800s needs to concern itself with, Ben.",

But thank you for now.Aviation experts are weighing in on the possibility of a bird strike while looking at what may have caused this crash. Here's what I told CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT HAMILTON, AVIATION INDUSTRY CONSULTANT, LEEHAM CO. OF CHICAGO: Well, even if there was a bird strike that disabled the right engine, or if it was disabled because of mechanical issues, the 737 can land perfectly fine on one engine and the pilots are trained to do that. Now, was there a series of events? As I say, where there were multiple emergencies going on? If there's a general hydraulic failure, that could affect the controls, the stick, the control yoke in the airplane, in the cockpit. If there was a general hydraulic failure and an engine failure that caused flaps not to come down, that caused the slats not to come down, caused the gear not to come down. It is easy to see how all of those emergencies could combine to overwhelm the pilots, but that's all part of going to be part of the investigation.",
