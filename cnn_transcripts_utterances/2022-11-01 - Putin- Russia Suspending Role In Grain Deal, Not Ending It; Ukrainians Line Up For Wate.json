The Russian air offensive on Ukraine's critical infrastructure appears to have widened, from the targeting of the electoral grid now water facilities are under fire with devastating effect.In Kyiv, a city with a pre-war population of 3 million people, 80 percent of residents no longer have access to running water according to the capital's mayor. Well, Ukraine's military says 45 of the 35 Russian cruise missiles fired Monday was shot down, at least 10 hit their mark. Along with the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv in the East and the Zaporizhzhia region to the south have both reported heavy damage. There appears to be no other reason for these ongoing airstrikes, which of course, water shortages and rolling power blackouts nationwide, other than to make the coming winter the worst ever for Ukrainians. And Putin has warned there could still be worse to come.

All over Brazil, there have been these kinds of protests going on on roads and highways from one end of the country to the other. We are in Sau Paulo. This is a major highway leading into the downtown area and through to the airport. Have a look here.

It seemed as if he spent the last few hours trying to get his head around the result on his path to slowly accepting it, urged by allies, who do not want to endanger the strength of the conservative movement, which, despite Bolsonaro was lost comes out of this election very strong. That is Bolsonaro allies will occupy key positions and governors' houses, they'll run Brazil's three largest states by population. They're also all over Congress.

The problem is, is that as we've -- as we saw in the United States, in the wake of the 2020 election, when a president casts doubt on an electoral process, even if he doesn't prevail, even if he's not over -- even if he's not able to overturn the result, that still leaves damage, it still leaves scars.

It is going to come at a price though, reportedly of about $20 dollars, U.S. dollars, a month. And may not go down so well with people who already have those blue badges. What we're hearing is they may have to pay $20 a month to keep that badge. So, all sorts of change happening at the company.
