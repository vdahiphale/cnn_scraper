I think you've got a real institutional problem. That is not a government that works. That is chaotic.

Because we can get into the kind of nitty-gritty, in the weeds of the speaker's race and what's going to happen and what delegations are meeting, how they're actually going to try and play this out, but to start, to pull back a little bit, this was a week House Republicans were supposed to start moving on two more spending bills, which is at the crux of this entire problem. Instead, the institution is completely paralyzed.

He had a hard time getting there in the first place.And we should have known then -- we didn't know that it would happen within 12 months -- but that he would find himself in a state where someone would bring forward a motion to vacate, based on disagreements with him on policy, procedure, behavior, ideology. And we're here. He had a hard time keeping this party together for -- for various reasons, various ideological diversity. There are also some petty grievances. And this is what happens when you have those issues. KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR/NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: So, Phil, I go back to -- and I know you have known Kevin McCarthy over the course of your career, and I've been in a lot of different situations with him, public, private, listening to how he talks to people. When you are listening to him, he is almost always telling the person across the table from him what they want to hear. That is how he got into this position in the first place. And when your job is primarily to recruit candidates and raise money, it works really well. I think the challenge here, and part of why you're seeing so many of these hardline members talk about personal reasons they're upset with McCarthy, is that once you actually have the gavel, once you're in power and you say things, there are actually consequences when you don't deliver on them. People do not forget. And, you know, I think he kind of got himself into a little bit of trouble here, in that the way he has always done business, the way he rose, just simply didn't work once the responsibility was on his shoulders.",

Gaetz obviously heard what he thought he wanted to hear from the former president. McCarthy's team didn't seem to send any signals that they were unhappy with what the former president was doing. And on the campaign side, it seems like he's just like, man, this was -- I'm going to kind of stay out of this. I don't know that he necessarily needs to have a dog in this fight, as long as he's not unhappy with whoever the choice may be. I mean, I do think it's going to be interesting if he weighs in and says, you know, I want Jim Jordan to be speaker of the House. That could obviously change the conversation up here pretty quickly. But you know, I will say, I think there was a lot of speculation and, you know, when we covered this when he had those 15 rounds, when McCarthy was trying to get the speaker's gavel. And then you tie that back to what happened on January 6th and the way McCarthy really switched. You showed that photo of him at Mar-a-Lago just days after the Capitol was attacked. I think there was a perception that Trump was going to try to prevent McCarthy from ever becoming speaker. And that did not come to pass here. So you know, I do think, also, Trump is -- like, he knows how to affect what they do here by throwing bombs into it. Right? The number of times that Paul Ryan had to get on the phone with the White House and say, Hey, I really need your help here. Please fix this. So we'll see if he continues in that vein.",

As we join you from the nation's capital this morning, a live look at Trump Tower in New York City.In a few hours, former President Trump says he's going to go back to court. Day three of his civil fraud trial will begin this morning. For the first two days of trial, Trump has repeatedly attacked both the attorney general, Letitia James of New York, and the judge, who is now imposing a gag order on Trump for targeting his clerk in a social media post. Meanwhile, Trump is saying he plans to testify, but it could be several weeks before he is called to take the stand. Our Brynn Gingras following it all live outside the courthouse with more. There are so many things to get to, Brynn. The fact that the judge decides in this case. Now he's got a gag order on Trump. Trump says he's going to take the stand. I am dying to know what his lawyers think about all of that. But walk us through this mandated order, on a very serious note, to keep Trump quiet after this -- after what he posted about the judge's clerk.",

And everybody was kind of wondering what was taking so long.But when the judge went to the bench, he issued this strong rebuke right at the defense table, where the former president was sitting with his attorneys. And it was in response to a Truth Social post that Donald Trump had posted, with a picture of Judge Engoron's clerk and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. And in the post claiming, without any evidence, that she is Schumer's girlfriend. Now there's no clear connection of the relationship, if anything, past that picture at this point. But the judge, someone who has been attacked by Trump many times throughout the course of this trial and before, this was a bridge too far. He essentially said that he asked it be taken down. It was. But he says that was before it was sent to millions of people via email. And he said, \"Personal attacks of any member of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate, and I will not tolerate them.\" He says now that the defense cannot talk publicly, cannot email, cannot post about anyone on his staff, or there are going to be serious sanctions as a result. Now, listen, it's very unclear exactly what he means by that, because he didn't issue a formal order. However, when court was over, everyone was called back in the courtroom, as far as the defense and the state's attorneys, without the press in there. And there was a conversation to be had before the president [SIC] left -- former president left for the day.",
