      "sentences": "A caravan made up of thousands of migrants is headed north to the U.S.-Mexico border. Authorities at the southern border are already struggling to deal with an unprecedented search of migrants. And CNN is just now learning more than 11,000 people are waiting in shelters on the Mexican side of the border, hoping to get into the U.S. That's according to community leaders. The challenge is being acutely felt in Eagle Pass, a city in Texas on the U.S.-Mexico border.And joining me now is CNN's Rosa Flores. Rosa, it was your reporting, you've been in Eagle Pass. What is the latest on the southern border and what are the conditions for people that are arriving there?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Phil, the situation here in Eagle Pass has definitely improved. I spoke to a senior CBP official who says that while the picture behind me looks better than it did last week, because last week there were thousands of migrants who were waiting in line to be transported to immigration processing, that the agency is not out of the woods yet.There are still smuggling organizations that are pushing migrants to cross illegally into the United States. Now, the Biden administration has been surging resources. They have been suspending operations at several ports of entry in several states to redirect those resources. But here's the bottom line of what the American people need to know whenever there's a surge on the U.S. southern border. This creates gaps in border security. Why? Because while border patrol agents are very busy processing migrants like the ones that you see behind me. We saw a group just arrived earlier, and these are moms and dads turning themselves into immigration authorities. The gaps in border security are created because these border patrol agents who are normally patrolling other parts of the southern border can't do that. They are instead doing this, what you're seeing behind me. And from talking to U.S. Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens, he says that that's what the cartels capitalize on. That's what smugglers do. They use these gaps in border security bill to then redirect drugs and criminals to the southern border, and have that flow enter illicitly while Border Patrol is busy doing what you see behind me.

      "sentences": "You know, we do see that decompression works, and what that means is that while Eagle Pass is saturated, overcapacity, Border Patrol agents transfer these migrants to other areas on the border, to the Rio Grande Valley, to Laredo, to Del Rio to make sure that those migrants are processed swiftly.But what the Biden administration is also trying to do is to impose legal consequences for the illegal entry into the United States. And what we're talking about there is the processing of migrants under Title 8, enhanced -- expedited removal, deportations. And DHS reports that since May, about 445,000 migrants have been removed or returned. That number is big and it's significant. It's more than the total number of individuals who were removed in fiscal year 2019. That's when President Trump was in office. But Phil, here's the key. Whenever there is a border surge, it's very difficult for any administration to impose legal consequences because that takes time. And that tests, the border holding infrastructure on the U.S. Southern border. And right now, we know that it has been backed up because of the ongoing surge that has been going on for weeks. Phil?",

I know you've basically been the one to explain everything to me about what's been going on at the border for the better part of several years now.

GDP is growing, inflation is down, the jobless rate near a 50-year low. Gas prices, they're falling. The stock market, strong, hitting records.And despite the many warnings, we are still very much not in a recession. And yet Americans say they don't feel good about the U.S. economy. Is that going to change in the year ahead? Joining me now to discuss this, CNN Global Economic Analyst, Rana Foroohar, and our Eva McKend is back with us. Rana, we've talked about this quite often over the course of the last couple of months, and I think the biggest question that I have at this point in time is, is this just a something where the leading indicators, it's more of a tail effect on the people on the ground? Or are there elements here, and I'm thinking primarily housing costs, or kind of the stickiness of just lodging in general, where people live on rent as well, that are -- that's really driving the disconnect?",

I mean, you know, anybody who has been filling their car, going to the grocery store, paying a mortgage in the last couple of years has felt some pain, right? There has been rising inflation and it's something that we haven't really seen in decades.So there are generations of Americans that just haven't been in a situation like this, and it's been alarming and concerning for a lot of people. Now, that said, inflation has been coming down. So why hasn't consumer sentiment, voter sentiment, you know, caught up with that good economic news, that tends to be a trailing indicator. So it takes a while. It takes a quarter, two quarters, maybe even a year of good news, particularly after all we've been through, you know, a pandemic, a couple of hot wars, trade tensions for people to really feel like, OK, things are secure. I can relax. We're back to normal. And I do think that we're probably going to start getting there in 2024.",

And eventually stocks rise and then you capitulate. I think we are going to see some capitulation in the year ahead.I think that as long as you see a pretty robust job market particularly if we see three-rate cuts in the new year, which is what the fed's been talking about, that's going to lower borrowing costs. That's going to make people feel better about home mortgage rates. I think that you are going to see a better sentiment. Now, that said, I don't want to deny that there's a lot going on in the world right now. You know, I mean, we're -- as I say, in the middle of two hot wars, you know, you could see more trouble in the Middle East, a heightening of the situation in Gaza that could, you know, raise oil prices, let's say. You could see more supply chain disruptions. And also, even though stocks are really high, and that's great, stocks are high. You know, by some measures, they're overvalued. So it's possible that you could also see a correction in the New Year. And that would not be something unexpected or unwarranted. So, steady as she goes, but don't get ahead of yourselves. And I think in some ways, I think the markets may be getting a little bit ahead of themselves with all the excitement at the end of this year and stocks going up so much.",
