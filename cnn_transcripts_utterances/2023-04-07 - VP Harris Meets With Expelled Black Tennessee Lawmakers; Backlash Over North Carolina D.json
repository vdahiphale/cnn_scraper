Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.Vice President Kamala Harris went to Nashville, tonight, to meet with the two Democratic lawmakers, who were expelled, from the State Legislature, for speaking out of turn. They say, they were simply protesting gun violence. The expulsion has thrust these two young Black lawmakers, into the national spotlight, President Biden inviting them to the White House. But what happens next, for them? Well, in a moment, we're going to hear how they could be right back, in their old seats, as early as Monday. And, Actor Jeremy Renner, talking about his recovery, after that seven-ton snowplow nearly crushed him to death. His doctor will be here, to explain, how Renner was able to survive.

If it happened to be two White players or two Black players, some people would view it differently.What Jill Biden said, was ill-advised. But no fair-minded person could think that there was any ill motivation behind it. She sat at the game, with Billie Jean King, and with other female athletes, who kind of represent the Title IX generation, and the progress, made by women athletes. And in the afterglow of that she tried to say some inclusive thing. But, of course, it's silly, because only the champions go to the White House. And what Iowa's coach said made more sense. \"If the Bidens would like to come to Iowa, and visit us, we would love to have that happen. But this spotlight belongs to LSU.\" With regard to Angel Reese, she's obviously very bright. She obviously has a strong sense of herself. But sometimes, when people have a certain sense of themselves, they can easily take offense, and they think they're incapable of giving offense. When she said, \"I don't accept her apology?\" Wow! You can't go back on a simple little well-intended statement. I don't -- \"This is unacceptable, completely unacceptable, now and forever?\" Luckily, she changed her mind within a couple of days. It wasn't a good look, all the way around. But because of the racial angle, it's amplified more than it needs to be. People misspeak. People get caught up in the heat of the moment. Trash-talking is part of basketball, more so than other sports. Michael Jordan trash-talked, but so did Larry Bird. Larry Bird was one of the great trash-talkers ever. So, I don't have -- really have a problem with people trash-talking in basketball. And in fact, Caitlin Clark did this thing, in an earlier game, against Louisville, but it was more directed at the entire squad. Where, very clearly Angel Reese was looking, right at Caitlin Clark, the best player on Iowa's team, and giving it this repeatedly. So, she was kind of taunting her. Now, that's not outrageous in basketball. But it is different than what Caitlin Clark did, earlier. Now I'm trying to judge this, as we all should, on an individual basis. Angel Reese is not representative of all Black people. Caitlin Clark is not representative of all White people. You try to look at them as individuals. I respect them both. And I think that Angel Reese had to recalibrate what her reaction was. Caitlin Clark has played it perfectly, as it happens, as an individual, not as a White person.",
