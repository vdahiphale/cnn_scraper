Ambassador Nikki Haley in a state famous for primary surprises. As Haley attacked Trump over his age, last night, he offered an eye- popping closing message for New Hampshire voters, praising Hungary's authoritarian leader, Viktor Orban. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And take a look how this has changed since our poll in early January before the Iowa caucuses. You see a lot of growth for Trump from 39 percent support to 50 now. You also see growth for Haley, 32 percent to 39 percent. They're both benefiting perhaps from some of the candidates that dropped out, Chris Christie, lion's share of his supporters, maybe going to Haley here, Ramaswamy, a lot of his supporters going to Trump.

I mean, look how much better he is seen by this electorate than Haley, who's at 36 percent fave, 40 unfavorable, overall minus-4, and DeSantis even lower than that. And if you look at the enthusiasm for Donald Trump if he's the nominee, 46 percent of likely Republican primary voters would be enthusiastic if he's the nominee. Only 25 percent say that of Haley; 17 percent say that of DeSantis. We also asked, what is your feelings if Donald Trump is the nominee among each set of supporters? So, of course, 89 percent of Trump supporters would be very enthusiastic if indeed Trump is the nominee. But, Dana, look here; 23 percent of Haley supporters would be dissatisfied if Trump is the nominee; 61 percent of Haley's supporters would be downright angry if Trump is the nominee. That's 84 percent that would be dissatisfied or angry. That would need some healing in the party if indeed he is the nominee. And we also asked the most important issue. Border, immigration, probably not surprising to you, is the top issue; 29 percent of Republican primary voters say so; 22 percent say democracy and Constitution. And, by the way, Nikki Haley's winning these voters. So they're coming at it more from the sort of left perspective than the right perspective on this issue of democracy and Constitution, if there is a left and a right to those issues.

This is not a sanctioned event.There are no delegates here for the Democrats. But, still, Biden, without being on the ballot is getting 63 percent of the vote of likely Democratic primary voters, 10 percent for Dean Phillips, 9 percent for Marianne Williamson. You can see Phillips and Williamson making a little bit of advancement since early January, maybe a tick down from the Biden write-in number. But this is still an overwhelmingly favorable electorate to Joe Biden. And if you look here, we asked about favorability ratings here. Joe Biden's at plus 40, 60 percent fave, 20 percent unfavorable, obviously, his opponents here, Phillips and Williamson, deeply unpopular with likely Democratic voters. And in terms of Democrats and whether or not they think Joe Biden is putting their best foot forward, have the best chance to win if he's the nominee, only 46 percent of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that Biden gives them a better chance for the nominee; 39 percent say someone else would give them a better chance; 15 percent say unsure. So, less than a majority of Democrats, Dana, say Biden is their best foot forward here. That is going to be a number of concern for the Biden team going forward.",

He claimed that the economy was better under former President Trump. In fact, the stock market hit an all-time high on Friday. We have unemployment below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years. President Biden has presided over the creation of 14 million new private sector jobs.
