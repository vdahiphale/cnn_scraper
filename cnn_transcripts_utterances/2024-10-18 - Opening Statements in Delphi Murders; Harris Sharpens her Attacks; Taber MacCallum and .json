She also called out what appeared to be Trump supporters heckling her at one of her rallies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with - with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did as he intended. Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally. No, I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, I think there are a lot of folks, such as myself, who think that Donald Trump's unpopularity is baked in. But here's the deal, if you believe that Donald Trump has somehow become less popular over time, let me change your mind about that.In fact, he is more popular at this point in the campaign than he was at this point in the 2020 campaign, or the 2016 campaign. Look, he's still underwater, right, with a negative nine point net favorability rating, but that is higher than he was in 2020 at minus 12 points when he nearly won, and it is way higher than the minus 27 net favorability back in 2016 when he did win. So, I think there's this real question in Kamala Harris' mind, in the campaign's mind, why is Trump more popular now than he was at this point in 2020 and 2016? And I think that is why you're seeing the sharpening attacks because they want to put him back down to here -",

Look, she was at minus 15 points back on July 17th, then minus four points on August 17th, then one point on September - plus one point, she was actually in positive territory a month ago, but she has fallen back down to minus one. The momentum of Kamala Harris has stalled. And I think they feel like they have to change something that's going on in their campaign because they were seeing a rise and now it has stalled out.Look, she's still more popular than Trump. But look, Joe Biden was more popular than Trump, much more and barely won. And Hillary Clinton was more popular than Donald Trump and lost. Being more popular than Trump isn't enough.

So, with us now, Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, and further co-pilot for Space Perspective, Taber MacCallum, the company's co-founder and co-CEO. Taber, let me just start with you first very quickly. What exactly is the stratosphere and why go there in a balloon? TABER MACCALLUM, CO-FOUNDER AND CO-CEO, SPACE PERSPECTIVE: So, we're going to above 99 percent of the earth's atmosphere. So, we're sort of floating on top of the earth's atmosphere like an ice cube floats on water. And that's what's defined where we are is the stratosphere. At that altitude you can see the curvature of the earth, the black sky, the thin blue line in the atmosphere. So, it's an amazing, majestic experience. It's really unique to ballooning, which is such an honor to have a legend in ballooning, Sir Richard, to be the copilot. We're really excited.",

We experienced zero gravity, and we were in space and had the most spectacular view of the earth.With this project, we'll rise very gently at ten miles an hour off a boat. It'll be like a five to six hour round trip going up to 100,000 feet. So, three times higher than an airplane. And it's going to be the most magnificent, beautiful experience. And so both experiences are unbelievably wonderful. And I just love - love challenging myself. I love challenging -- being able to challenge others.

We've already sent up one unmanned flight to 100,000 feet. And we'll be sending up a number of other unmanned flights before we actually get in and go up ourselves. Obviously, you know, the early - the people who have, you know, book early, we - we are going to be all test pilots. And we'll be awning - awning out the flights for the future.
