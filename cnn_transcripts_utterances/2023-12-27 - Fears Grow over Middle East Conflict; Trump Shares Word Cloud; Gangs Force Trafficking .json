We've seen a number injured, three injured, one critically on the last couple of days, which is what prompted the Biden administration to go after those Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Iraq.

And one of the things to keep in mind here is, when you look at the kinds of things that occurred, the initial attack against U.S. personnel occurred up here in the north at Erbil Air Base. So, with that critically injured service member, the U.S. basically responded by going in after this attack here and making sure that they could go after the Houthi -- excuse me, the Kata'ib Hezbollah forces. This is an Iranian proxy. Kata'ib Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy.And what they decided to do was go after this at three different points. So, there were three different attack areas in Iraq. And they accelerated the process here because it became really important for the U.S. to actually make a statement. And so we're risking ratcheting things up, Poppy, because there are so many different U.S. forces, about 3,500 in both Iraq and Syria. And the very fact is that these areas here are important for the fight against ISIS, which is not completely dead. And that's why we have U.S. personnel in this area. But anytime an American service member is injured, the U.S. feels it is necessary to respond. And that's why the administration did what they did.",

This is a very difficult area for us to go after. And there is still a possibility that there may be counter strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. One of the reason that that hasn't happened yet, the intelligence picture on the Houthis is not as good as it is against the forces in Iraq, the Iranian paramilitary groups, the Iranian associated paramilitary groups. And that is one of the reasons why the Houthis are not being attacked right now.Also keep in mind, when Saudi Arabia had their war with the Houthis, they didn't do so well.

And I think it's especially important given that the chaos of really not just the last five years but like the last eight years has been so prevalent in American lives. So, they're looking for that person who ran on the grounds of saying, I'm going to be the adult in the room. I'm going to bring order back into the American, not just economy, but the American population, into society. I'm going to be a boring president. I don't know if anybody remembers that, but Biden was like, I'm going to be boring. You're not going to hear about me.And I think part of that, though, part of the problem that we're running into as we move into campaign season is that Donald Trump doesn't want to play on those grounds and the American people are also realizing that perhaps this idea of having a really boring president or having a president who is not in the news or not in the - not in kind of the headlines is not necessarily what they want. And I actually think that it's not Trump who benefits from this, although certainly with Trump loyalists and the Trump base, but it's, again, it's somebody like Nikki Haley and it's somebody like Nikki Haley who can step in and say, I can be the adult in the room, I can be competent, I'm young, I'm quick on my feet, I have the experience. Oh, and I'm not an angry demagogue and I'm not trying to gain revenge on the country. And so there's this interesting space that's being carved out between the candidates for somebody like a Nikki Haley to put her foot in and make an impression with the country.",

That's because he was charged in Los Angeles, where this investigation began, instead of Nebraska or Washington, D.C., where he allegedly lied to those agents.
