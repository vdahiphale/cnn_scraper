A warning. Now, the next image we are about to show you is disturbing. It has been widely circulated online, supposedly showing the body of Sinwar surrounded by rubble and Israeli soldiers. The source of this image thus far is unknown, but CNN has investigated it and determined that it shows no clear signs of manipulation.",

Can you tell us a little bit, Major, about the timing between when they -- the strike occurred, which was, as we understand, a tank mortar. And correct me if I'm wrong on any of these details, and then the details of what happened from that, that there was some sort of drone that was used? Was that because this area was booby trapped? What did the drone show? And also the photos that we are seeing, is that the state of thebuilding at the time or was there some debris removed to verify the identity of Sinwar? Can you take us through all of that?",

      "sentences": "Sure. So earlier today, again, our forces have been operating in southern Gaza looking for terrorists. Now, we have to understand the landscape here. This is the landscape of an urban setting. There are buildings and shells of buildings in which terrorists pop still out of tunnels and fire at IDF troops. So there is a great concern for the lives of our troops. We use a lot of different surveillance methods and try to prevent, obviously, any harm coming to our troops. There was -- we did come on fire from this building, at which time, using a series of technology, we identified the three terrorists inside. We did not know with certainty that one of them was Yahya Sinwar. And then we returned fire, the tank fired. And then there's a period by which you cannot just walk into a building in ID. You have to clear the area. There could be multiple terrorists. It could even be an ambush.And so, very carefully, our troops moved into the building. These are special troops who've come under fire from Hamas terrace, operating in tunnels for over a year. Eventually, when they identified that the building was safe to enter, they came inside and they saw him in the rubble, at which point they saw resemblance. But as we know, it's taken a number of hours. We matched both dental records and his DNA. And if we want to try to remember how we have these, Brianna, as you know, which is that Yahya Sinwar set in Israeli jails for more than 10 years. In fact, he was operated on a life-threatening brain tumor by Israel. Israel saved his life, and then he was released in a hostage deal in 2011. And the only way of course, that he paid back Israel was carrying out this terror attack. If I could just add one more thing, the whole goal of our operating in this area has been to force Sinwar and other commanders out of their bunkers using very precise intel in certain areas, we were trying to force them. In this case, it worked above ground, moving so that they would make a mistake. And today, Sinwar made his last mistake, which, of course, is a great thing for the people of Israel. And I think for people around the world, as a symbol of evil has truly been brought to justice.",

      "sentences": "To the point you just made, Major, and something you said a moment ago, that this was near where six hostages were recently executed in a tunnel. Do you have any indication as to what his origin was, where he came from, and where he might have been headed, and why he was traveling with such an apparent light footprint? If you were able to confirm before launching the attack that it was only three people, and you determined that they were terrorists, there were no hostages around him. The speculation had been that he might be around hostages or civilians forming some kind of human shield. Do you have any indication as to those details?",

      "sentences": "Major, I'm curious as to who you suspect Israel may be negotiating that sort of deal with. There is speculation that Yaya Sinwar's brother, Mohammed Sinwar, may take over the operation. There's the potential for a vacuum of power. And then there's also the complicating factor that from our understanding, many of these hostages aren't actually being held by Hamas itself, but rather other organizations and sort of satellite groups that has already complicated the process of helping recover the hostages.So I imagine, it's not going to be a simple vote, as you said, by Hamas or its affiliates to get closer to a negotiation, to get closer to a hostage release deal or a ceasefire.",

      "sentences": "All right. Listening there to Vice President Harris reacting to this news that Yahya Sinwar is dead, killed by the IDF. We do have CNN's MJ Lee at the White House, Clarissa Ward as well in London.Clarissa, of course, is one of the few western journalists who has been in Gaza during the war. But MJ, I do want to go to you first. You have some new reporting about how families of American hostages being held by Hamas are reacting to news of the death of Sinwar. MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. And Brianna, we just heard the Vice President referring to the fact that there are still seven American hostages, both living and deceased, that are still being held captive in Gaza. These families, including American- Israeli hostages that have been taken into Gaza on October 7th, I mean, they are watching this development, the news of Yahya Sinwar's death. And they are worried sick. I was texting earlier with Ruby Chen. He is, of course, the father of Utay Chen, the young U.S. Israeli-American that was taken hostage and killed on October 7th, whose body has yet to be released. He was saying, we are very concerned terrorists in the field will do something irrational to the hostages they are holding. And he said, time is of the essence, you know, to say the obvious, the thing that these hostage families want more than anything else is a ceasefire and hostages deal so that all of the hostages can be released. And for the past year, you know, this has been a nightmare situation for these families. Every day, they are waking up hoping that there is some good news on the hostage's front. And they are now in the position of basically waiting to see and learn whether Sinwar's death ends up prompting a different phase of this conflict, whether it will ultimately mean that the conflict can end. But as you all watch, Prime Minister Netanyahu in his speech, it certainly didn't sound like that is where his mind was at, but it was very interesting that for the Vice President. Her focus was very much on the end to this conflict and basically what should happen once the war is over. That was clearly her message.",

And also with us, we have CNN Military Analyst Retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton.First, let's talk about some of -- you heard some of our interview with the IDF. But let's talk about some of the specifics, Colonel, of this operation, because I think there is a lot of curiosity around it. This was a routine military operation. But the IDF is also stressing that they had a lot of intel about Hamas leaders sort of in the area so that they were on, you know, a little bit of an alert, but they had no idea this was Sinwar until they were able to do a little bit of surveillance and see. What did you think about what you've learned so far?",

      "sentences": "Yes. This is very interesting, Brianna, because our initial reporting was that they just happened upon these three terrorists and they shot them. And it was all happenstance or coincidence. But I was suspicious of that because you can't do those kinds of operations with at least some knowledge of what you're going to be encountering. So the Israeli spokesman, the IDF spokesman, when he talked about this, he laid out the fact that there was a lot of intel preparation, what we call intel preparation of the battle space, for this type of an operation. They didn't know specifically that he was there, but they suspected that somebody might be there, somebody really important. And that's the way it usually works with these high value target type situations where HVTs, as we call them.Another thing that's interesting to note is when Vice President Harris spoke, she talked about how the U.S. was helping with intelligence and the special operations' capabilities. So there's something to be said that the United States probably helped the Israelis with some degree of intelligence and both tactical and strategic. And that intelligence helped get the Israelis to this point.",
