Well, today a plan to use explosives on the debris has been postponed, because of weather. The demolition crew was planning to free the Dali cargo ship from the debris that has been laying across its bow, allowing the ship to eventually be floated and moved from the waterway.This comes a few days after the sixth and final body was recovered from the water. Investigations will also -- are in -- Investigators will also be having a hearing on Capitol Hill next week to discuss federal response to the catastrophe. All right. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. All right. We begin this hour with dramatic new developments in the Middle East. Israeli military forces are calling for the immediate evacuations of some neighborhoods in the southern Gaza City of Rafah. The IDF says about 300,000 people have already fled. The orders come ahead of an anticipated IDF ground offensive in an area more than a million Palestinians where they are seeking refuge. This, on the heels of a new report from the White House, the Biden administration says it's reasonable to assess that American weapons have been used by Israeli forces in Gaza in ways inconsistent with international humanitarian law. CNN's Scott McLean has more on these latest developments in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Fredricka, new airstrikes in northern and central Gaza have flooded hospitals with a new round of victims. Included amongst them, a journalist, his wife and 12-year-old son. And the death toll may yet still rise, as people search through the rubble of those airstrikes with little more than their bare hands. Searching, at this point, for bodies,And the video of the aftermath and the chaotic hospitals that have taken in those victims is pretty hard to watch. Many of the victims are children, some of them are very tiny infants. The IDF declined to comment on the strikes other than to say that it was working to dismantle Hamas and insisting that it follows international law and takes measures to mitigate civilian harm. That is notable only because the U.S. State Department released a report yesterday, saying that it is reasonable to assess that Israel has not always followed international law. The IDF just this morning has told people in parts of northern Gaza to evacuate to safer areas and in several districts of Rafah as well to move to a humanitarian zone along the coastline zone where people have pitch tents along the roadway and along the coast. And there is very little in the way of infrastructure to support that volume of people. The IDF says that there are now 300,000 people there that is the double the estimate that they gave on Thursday. There are also people in Rafah who are struggling to leave at all. Some are unwilling to go, some are struggling with the logistics of moving around this active war zone, or the cost of moving around. One person told CNN that the situation there is beyond bad. It also seems like Israel is undeterred by the U.S. pausing shipments of weapons to Israel because of its continued advance in Rafah. The IDF says that it has enough weaponry to go this alone. The Israeli security Cabinet has approved an expansion of the operating area. All of this just as aid into southern Gaza slows to a trickle, if that. Fredricka?",

Also, the news had become public, it was leaked that last week, even before the Israelis moved in and took over keyboarder crossing in Rafah with Egypt. That the U.S. had made this decision, that Pentagon have made this decision to pause weapons.I think with that coming out, President Biden took the chance to make a very pointed message to Prime Minister Netanyahu. What I've heard here in Washington is increasing concern from many of the President's Democratic allies, they are absolutely fed up with Netanyahu. They believe that the prime minister of Israel has essentially been flouting the words and counsel and advice, the president of the United States for months now. And, you know, there was a lot of cheering at Biden's tough words. I think it remains to be seen exactly where the next step is, in part, because it's not yet clear whether and to what scale, Netanyahu and his government are going to follow through with this military operation in Rafah.",

That he's betrayed, as the New York Post, put it the other day -- America's partners in Israel. On the other hand, you have humanitarian groups, liberal Democrats, very concerned that he's not done enough to make clear that humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza is an -- is an actual part of U.S. policy. It's an unbearable place to be trapped in the middle at a moment where there essentially is no more rational middle in our politics.

So, in a sense, they both have an incentive to get in, you know, an argument with each other publicly and look like they are standing firm. The tragedy, of course, is the civilians in Gaza continue to suffer and that the hostages not only have not come home, but there's no deal for releasing any more of them.

Same thing, you've got the palm tree in the foreground with all of the beautiful Auroras in the background.Because again, this was such a big storm event, it's spreading to places that normally wouldn't get a chance to see these. But if you missed it last night, you will get a second opportunity to see it yet again tonight. Again, it's been a big event, we've had a G5, which is the highest end of the scale that you can get. We had the event yesterday, and then another one this morning where it reached those levels. First time since October of 2003. But the question is OK, I missed it, I want to see it again, when? The key is going to be earlier in the evening. The peak time tonight is really going to be that 5:00 to 8:00 and 8:00 to 11:00 timeframe. Yes, I'm aware from 5:00 to 7:00, the sun is still out. But basically, what this is saying is the earlier into the evening, you can look, so the minute that sun goes away, that's going to be one of the prime opportunities to see it. Yes, you can see it later, it's just going to start to diminish rather quickly as we go later on into the overnight hours. So, the earlier is going to be better. Now, the where? Obviously, the farther north you go, the better viewing you're going to see. But, even places far south, Southern California areas over towards Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, even into Florida, still have the potential to see some of those beautiful light displays tonight. The exception to that will be wherever we have cloud cover. And we've got a lot of that expected tonight across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and also the potential for some heavy clouds, and even some rain showers for places like upstate New York, areas of Pennsylvania, and even possibly Vermont too. So, that's really going to be the only thing that really limits this. Now, the reason why we're seeing this, is this yellow dot right here, this is the sun. This is Earth. What you're seeing is the solar wind. So, this right here, this is the first wave that moved through on Friday. Here is the second wave. That's the one that we expect later today, giving us that second opportunity to really see such beautiful lights. Here is the thing though, the speed at which these are moving is going to really amplify in the strength how far Southies get, but when they do, it's going to be a different color. Now, green is the most common color of auroras that we see. And also, fun fact, green to the human eye, we are most sensitive to the green color. So, it's the easiest one for us to see, as well.

That's happening right now, we're right in the middle of that magnetic reversal.Now, what happens during this stage of the cycle, we see the sunspots submerge the sunspots, typically one to three times the size of Earth. The particular sunspot, we're looking at closely now is actually 15 times the size of Earth. So, it's huge. It's complex, and it's producing these big eruptions that are getting shot out into space back to back to back, we've had up to 10 eruptions, all coming towards Earth, impacting Earth's magnetic field and creating these lovely northern lights.

Donald Trump has really changed his tone and escalated his tasks against him. And when I talk to the campaign, they say, look, there's a few reasons for this. One is that it's still unclear who Kennedy hurts more. What -- does he hurt Biden more or does he hurt Trump more? That's part of it. They think that it really varies on a state by state basis. One senior Trump campaign advisor told me that they actually think that he could hurt Trump the most in a state like Pennsylvania. They said that's the way where people are unsure if they want Biden or Trump. But also they think, you know, regardless of whether he could be a huge impact, why not try to weigh him down as much as possible? And that's really why we're seeing these attacks be ramped up by the former president himself in recent days. Fred?",
