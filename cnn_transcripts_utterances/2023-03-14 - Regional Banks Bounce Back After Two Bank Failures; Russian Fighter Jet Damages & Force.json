How will the U.S. respond? Plus, 2024 is clearly on. Donald Trump makes his first election stop in Iowa, this cycle. He takes aim at his first Florida competitor, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis who is not even officially in the race yet. But, first, protecting your money. Multiple investigations reportedly launched into the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, or CBB, as panicky tweets are partly to blame for banks losing $40 million in a single day. (MUSIC) Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. Any moment, President Biden is expected to speak in Monterey Park, California, about efforts to reduce gun violence. He'll also meet with families and victims from one of this year's many, many mass shootings. We'll bring you the president's remarks as soon as they begin. Until then, we turn to money lead. Markets closed, moments ago, up 334 points as bank stocks rebounded in a stunning turnaround from this time yesterday. The biggest winners specifically today, regional banks, some of which are double-digit losses after yesterday. Experts were feeling more bank failures after two went down within just three days of each other over the weekend. Today, CNN learned that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the collapse of SVB, Silicon Valley Bank, which was the biggest failure of any American bank since 2008. The Securities and Exchange Commission, we're told is also investigating, according to \"The Wall Street Journal.\" and also boosting new economic confidence, new data has shown that inflation has fallen for the eighth straight month. I want to bring in CNN's Matt Egan. And, Matt, this has been a roller coaster for the U.S. economy. What does rebound for regional banks mean?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, this is one sign that confidence maybe starting to return. That perhaps cooler heads are prevailing. This collapse of Silicon Valley Bank was driven by psychology, emotion, panic, specifically. And then we saw regional bank stocks collapse yesterday, despite the fact that the federal government launched the massive rescue of uninsured investors over the weekend.So, it is certainly encouraging to see a reversal today, as you see on the screen, regional banks closing sharply higher. Although I would note that some of these gains kind of lost as the day went on. More important than stock prices is what's actually happened with deposits. Now, we don't -- unfortunately, we don't have that much transparency into deposit flows, but a senior treasury official told CNN's Phil Mattingly, that deposit outflows from small and midsized banks, those have eked. And that, of course, is exactly what officials want to see. They want to stop the panic before it spreads elsewhere. They want to restore confidence. Of course, Jake, that's not going to happen overnight. Confidence is a fragile thing and it was clearly shaken over the last few days.",

Now, we should caution that these investigations are in the preliminary stage.

The money was effectively un-insured. That's what meant that customers were willing to run away at the first sign of trouble.

Bank run is when all your customers trying -- too many customers turn up and want to take all -- more money out of the vault than you've got in the vault.If you're a bank with one customer and that customer shows up, you're necessarily going to get a bank run. Fortunately, most banks have millions of customers, that's not a problem. Silicon Valley Bank, though, first of all, it had a large number of customers all in the same industry. They were startups .They're all answering to the same VC firms. So it was likely having a small number of customers. They're all very closely tied. They're all tweeting to each other, get your money out. They're texting each other, get your money out. And so, normally, a bank run happens in a period of hours as you literally have to try to get to a branch and try to get cash out and discover there's nothing left in the vault.

So the Fed is going to continue to raise interest rates until it starts to see inflation come down.

Let's roll that clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLPI) SEN.

With respect to the stress test, what they don't point out is, while we relieve the obligation to do one category of stress tests to a biannual, rather than an annual frequency, they're still obligated to do ongoing stress tests for other purposes.And here's the more important thing fundamentally, I don't think anyone designs a stress test to test the result of losing 40 percent of your deposits in 24 hours. That's what happened. So, I think that's completely specious. They also sometimes cite the relief from liquidity coverage rate. The fact is despite the fact that SVB wasn't no longer mandated to meet that, it almost certainly exceeded that requirement also. So this had nothing to do with 2155, nothing at all. And Jake --",

The point is, the stress test is usually designed to measure what happens under various stresses. And I'm saying there's no stress test that's designed to measure the results of something anywhere near as severe and radical and immediate as what SVB underwent.What I think, Jake, we've got to focus on here it's very overstate the role of the Federal Reserve in this. Just think of it this way, while the unprecedented easy money sloshing around on a massive scale, combined with the spending going on, absolutely was a big source of the surge in deposits. That's the first one. Maintaining zero interest rates, and in fact, negative real interest rates, pressure all the banks to move out of the risk curve. Now, in the case of SVB, it wasn't a credit risk curve but it was a maturity risk courage. And then, finally, when the Fed eventually realized how badly they had gotten this wrong and they very quickly raised rates, they drove under water the very bond portfolio that they themselves had created at the bank.

He had been summoned there by top U.S. officials this afternoon. This, after a Russian warplane collided with a U.S. drone over the Black Sea earlier today, forcing the U.S. to bring down its unmanned aircraft. The U.S. Air Force said the Russian attack was, quote, reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional, and warned that the clash could lead to, quote, unintended escalation. A U.S. official tells CNN that a Russian jet intentionally flew in front of the U.N. -- in front of the unmanned U.S. Reaper drone, such as the one seen here. And then the Russians dumped jet fuel in front of it, and then damaged a propeller on the drone which forced the U.S. Air Force to then bring the drone down. We're covering this from the Pentagon, from the White House and in Ukraine. Let's start with CNN's Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon for us. Oren, U.S. aircraft flying over the Black Sea's international waters is not uncommon. Is it clear whether or not the Russians did this intentionally?",

And that prompted the Russians to scramble the SU-27 jets to intercept it.And they, again, as you just heard from what Oren had said, they did not come in contact, they say, with the drone, the Russian jets. And they also did not use their weapons. So, we have kind of two narratives here for what may have taken place out there. This will certainly ramp up tensions in an area that is already beyond tense. I'm standing 20, 30 miles away from front lines, where Ukrainian and Russian troops are killing each other, day in and day out.

While the president said he's open to discussions with President Putin, it was only on the grounds of trying to find a pathway to end the current conflict.What will you have seen, though, there's been obviously harsh and sharp language as Oren laid out in terms of the response, but there's also a very methodical, diplomatic approach here in terms of summoning the ambassador to the State Department, making it very clear the statements they put out, their displeasure for what transpired and how they felt this has been significantly problematic.

So, I think it needs to be addressed very seriously. I don't think we should overreact. I suspect right now, within the Pentagon, from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on down, they're reaching out to their Russian counterparts to find out exactly what happened, to communicate with them and to find out what the Russian explanation really is. I think that will dictate in some ways our response. TAPPER:  Not long ago, the State Department spokesman Ned Price said while he didn't speak to that, but, quote, the motivations mean more than what actually transpired.

All this is very dangerous behavior and again, it could lead to unintentional escalation. That's why I think reaching out behind the scenes to the Russians is very important. I think we'll know more in the next 24 hours. But we also need to assert privately as well as publicly, look, we're not going to tolerate this behavior because if you don't do that, then you'll see an uptick from the Russians against us and our allies in the Black Sea region.

I think the other thing, the reason why we want to help Ukrainians as well is they're knocking down and beating back the Russian army in the way that only helps us, and at the same time, the Western resolve with regard to Moscow sends a clear message to Beijing that we will stand up to them, as well if they decide to take action against Taiwan.",

So, if you look at our poll, among Trump supporters, 76 percent say they're locked into him and they're not going to change their mind, 59 percent of DeSantis supporters say that about their candidate.

Also we look at enthusiasm, 51 percent of Trump supporters consider themselves, call themselves, to be very or extremely enthusiastic about participating in the 2024 primary. 43 percent of DeSantis supporters say that, Jake.

He's a former assistant U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York. Elie, what are the New York State charges that are -- that could be in play and the possible consequences if there's a conviction, ultimately?",

      "sentences": "So, Jake, this is the Manhattan district attorney who has the power to charge New York state criminal laws. So, there's two laws we're looking at here. So, the first one is falsification of business records. The idea that the payments to silence Stormy Daniels were booked improperly as legal fees to Michael Cohen. If there's a conviction on that, though, that is a misdemeanor, meaning the max penalty is up to one year in prison. But, realistically, nobody goes to prison for a first time misdemeanor.The second potential crime is if prosecutors can tie it to some other crime, in this case it would be campaign finance violation, meaning this payment actually was meant to protect Donald Trump's electoral process. If they can prove that, it's a felony. It's the lowest level New York felony. It's class E, out of A to E. The maximum penalty there is four years. However, it's quite common for people to get convicted of class E felonies and also not send to prison. That will be up to a judge.",

A person can run for and even hold the office, up to and including the presidency, even if they're indicted, even if they've indicted.But, Jake, I think as a practical matter, this is going to make prosecutors' jobs that much more difficult. It's hard enough to get a jury of 12, unanimously, to convict a former president for the first time in U.S. history who as David Chalian's data just showed is quite popular in some quarters, never mind asking a jury in 2024 when a trial would likely to happen in the middle of primaries to convict a person who is probably going to be among the leaders of one of the major party nominations.

However, again, juries are human beings. If you're standing in front of a jury as a prosecutor talking about something that happened almost seven years ago, I mean, the president at the time was Barack Obama. That's how long ago this is.It's hard to then tell the jury this is urgent, this is important, this is serious. So I think the period of time that's passed undermines the urgency and in some sense the credibility of these charges if we do see them.",

This isn't an assault weapons ban. This is not universal background checks. It's not universal red flag laws.But, you know, it depends on how you measure success. The White House saying we're not going to just throw up our hands in the wake of these mass shootings in the United States, but we're going to try to do something. As he just laid out, what will be in this executive order includes a focus on more background checks. He's directing the U.S. attorney general to focus more on assuring that firearms sellers are doing their due diligence that's required by law to ensure that background checks are conducted in certain circumstances. And that is a different frame of mind for the Justice Department. The president saying don't just go out and prosecute people who aren't following the law, but try to get ahead of those violations to begin with, and make these gun sellers aware of their duty to conduct these background checks. The second aspect has to do with what are the so-called red flag laws. That is, if you have a loved one that you think may be a danger to themselves or someone else, in 19 states, including the District of Columbia, you can go to a judge and petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from the possession of that individual. So what the Biden administration here is doing is basically charging his entire cabinet to create an awareness campaign so people who are out there that are in these states where these red flag laws apply, they know how to use these tools in order to try to save lives. It's worth pointing, Jake, that the location where I'm at here, this is not an accident. This location, Monterey Park, the scene in January of a mass shooting that took 11 lives here, injured nine other people by a shooter who took his own life. The president here speaking in front of survivors, as well as local lawmakers, as he continues to call on more action by Congress. Of course, he's laying out what he's going to do with this executive action, but pointing out the more stringent requirements will require a compromise in Congress. It appears very likely it passes as any prelude of what is to come.",
