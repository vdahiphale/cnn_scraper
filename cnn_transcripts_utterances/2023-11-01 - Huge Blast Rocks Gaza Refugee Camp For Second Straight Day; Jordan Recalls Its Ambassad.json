In Gaza, new scenes of destruction after an Israeli airstrike rocks the same refugee camp that was hit a day earlier. Israel standing firmly in defending the attacks as vital to destroy Hamas amid mounting concerns in the Middle East and in the United States about the civilian death toll.Also tonight, Donald Trump Jr. takes the stand in the $250 million civil fraud trial against the Trump family business. We're going to tell you what he said under oath in New York. And in Florida, the judge and former President Trump's classified documents case is suggesting that the trial could be postponed.

Officials say hundreds of people have gotten out including Americans and hundreds more are expected to follow in the immediate hours ahead. Our correspondents are covering all the developments in the Israel- Hamas war from multiple angles and locations. First, let's get to CNN's Becky Anderson. She's joining us right now from Doha, Qatar.Becky, Qatar was instrumental in securing the deal that made these evacuations possible. That's what we're told. Update our viewers. BECKY ANDERSON, CNN HOST: Yes, some hard earned success for the Qatar led mediation between Israel, Hamas, Egypt in coordination with the United States today to describe these talks as complicated. These talks have been going on now for some three weeks would be an understatement, Wolf, but today, relief at least for some. Escape from a living nightmare. For the first time since the war between Israel and Hamas began, foreign passport holders are able to leave Gaza through the Rafah border, the sole crossing with Egypt. Equally important dozens of critically injured Palestinians allowed to leave, some to be treated in a field hospital opened in Sinai about 15 kilometers away, others being sent directly to hospitals across Egypt. With continued intense bombardment to more than 20,000 injured, much more is needed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HISHAM ADWAN, PALESTINIAN BORDER OFFICIAL (through translator): We want hundreds of those injured to receive treatment abroad as all hospitals have exhausted their capacities in every respect. medical supplies, medicines for wars, and burns have run out as well.

And he confirmed that the process of getting these Americans and wounded Palestinians and other foreign nationals out of Gaza will take place in a matter of stages. And over the course of multiple days, Becky mentioned this, but the State Department has been clear that there are some 400 American citizens in Gaza who have expressed interest in leaving and their family members total some 1,000 people. And that is an addition to some 5,000 other foreign nationals that are expected to try to leave.

And that as far as the Egyptians were concerned, they had a lot of worries about the idea of Palestinians entering Egypt and then permanently staying. And so that was a conversation that U.S. officials had a lot with their Egyptian counterparts. And they also wanted to make sure that as these people were starting to come into their country that they could really vet every single person that was coming in.Wolf, I also just wanted to note something noteworthy that the President just said in Minnesota. He said that Israel continues to have a right to defend itself, but that it needs to continue adhering to the international laws. And he said, quote, \"Every innocent life is a tragedy.\" This, of course, is incredibly noteworthy given the growing outcry that we have seen in light of these Israeli airstrikes that hit this refugee camp in northern Gaza.

As you know, the IDF bombed the Jabalya refugee camp for the second straight day. Israel says it was targeting Hamas terrorists who are in that camp. Eyewitnesses report that the first blast also killed many Palestinian civilians. Can Israel credibly say it's minimizing civilian deaths when it's striking a refugee camp, a very crowded refugee camp? BARAK RAVID, POLITICAL &amp; FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER, AXIOS: Hi, Wolf. Well, I think that that definitely raises a lot of questions. And, at least today, the IDF spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, when he briefed our foreign correspondents, he claimed that the reason that Israel is attacking in this area was because there's some sort of a regional headquarters for Hamas in the Jabalya refugee camp. But that's -- at the end of the day, even if that's the case, you know, he's still admitted that civilians were hit in this airstrike.

Donald Trump Jr. was pressed by prosecutors on his involvement in financial documents right at the center of this lawsuit.Joining us now CNN Legal Analyst Norm Eisen and Elliot Williams. Guys, thanks very much for joining us. Norm, let me start with you.

Also note that Donald Trump Jr. has given a prior deposition in this case. So he has provided testimony already if he contradicts himself or says something that doesn't quite gel with what he said in his deposition. That's certainly something that the judge could find, speaks to his credibility and so on. So it's always risky.The other thing is that it's one thing to answer questions from your own attorney statements or testimony that you prepared questioning that you'd rehearsed. It's another thing when a prosecutor that you haven't met before takes a crack at you and can really pin you down on your prior statements or, you know, sort of other questions they may have about you or your history. And so, it remains to be seen how tomorrow's testimony will go but that's when the unpredictable questioning might come up. BLITZER: Good point.

It is now really an urban community, it has been for many years now. And it is a home to more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N. so you can imagine the sheer devastation that has been wrought by this latest round of airstrikes. We've been seeing the videos.

Wounded children rushed to nearby ambulances, the latest casualties of Israel's relentless aerial bombardment. This densely populated neighborhood gripped by panic and sheer disbelief. A second Israeli airstrike in less than 24 hours. I lost my whole family, Adi Karin (ph) says, holding a list of those killed just today. My sister's house was struck with her children inside, my brother's house too with all of his children. There is no one left except for me and my younger brother. They were innocent. What did they do to deserve this? Israel's defense says it was targeting a Hamas command and control complex in Jabalia. Hamas fighters said to be among those killed. But Jabalia is home to more than 100,000 civilians according to the U.N. And while the full extent of the civilian death toll remains unclear at this stage, Gaza Civil Defense Authority has described this latest disaster as a massacre, with more casualties and more fatalities added to the list of hundreds said to have been killed or wounded in Tuesday's airstrike. This situation is beyond belief, many have been killed. Bodies have been burned and charred by the airstrike, this doctor says. There isn't a hospital in the world that could cope with this kind of situation. We're having to treat patients on the floor and in corridors. The scale of the destruction at Jabalia is difficult to grasp. Many residents are still buried beneath the black and rubble. Rescue workers and civilians dig side by side, desperate to find survivors. This house had 15 people in it. But we still haven't been able to find any of them, Assin Akhmad (ph) says. We have no equipment, we are digging alone. Northern Gaza continues to come under heavy bombardment. Its residents warned by Israel to evacuate southwards. But airstrikes continue to rain down across both central and southern Gaza too. And for the more than 2 million Palestinians living under an Israeli blockade, the fear is that there is nowhere safe to turn. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The idea that someone would post to a message board at an Ivy League university that he wants to quote, slit the throats of Jews, that he wants to rape Jewish women for what's happening in Gaza. I mean, look, Jews are no more collectively responsible for what's happening in Israel than Asian Americans would be for what's happening in China or any ethnicity would be for what's happening in another part of the world.
