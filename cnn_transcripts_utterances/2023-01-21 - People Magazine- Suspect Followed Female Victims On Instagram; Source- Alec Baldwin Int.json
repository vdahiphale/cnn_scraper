So of course, there are so many people trying to figure out these connections and \"People\" Magazine now saying that all three of the female victims were followed on Instagram by Bryan Kohberger. They also went on to say that about two weeks more or less before the killings, Kohberger was texting or not texting, but sending these messages on Instagram repeatedly to at least one of the victims. Now, she did not answer these messages on Instagram, it is unclear if she saw the messages or just chose not to respond to them. They say, they meaning \"People\" saying that they reviewed the Instagram account that has now been deleted, and they also went on to say that Bryan Kohberger went to the restaurant where at least two of the victims worked. They say that they talked to a former employee who told them that Kohberger was at the restaurant at least two different times leading up to the killings. He ordered a vegan pizza and was adamant about his food not touching any other animal products. Now, it is important to point out that this is a restaurant that's right in the middle of Main Street, many people go there. The students usually go to this area just to hang out. So the restaurant coming out with a statement, a lengthy statement saying that all of this reporting is not true, and they specifically wanted to protect the victims and their families. I want to read part of that statement where they say: \"We all decided to collectively support the families and not share anything that could potentially harm the investigation or cause the families more stress.\" So it's not just the people at the restaurant, but basically, everyone connected to this case is not allowed to speak because there is this broad and sweeping gag order. And so no one is really allowed to speak publicly on this, which is the reason why we probably will not get confirmation from police either. And it is important to point out that Bryan Kohberger has not yet declared a plea. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for June. And of course we'll have to wait to see how this Court process plays out. But of course, we do know that police have evidence against him. Specifically, we know that there is a roommate that survived the killings that said she saw Bryan Kohberger are at the house on the night of the killing. So we'll have to wait and see how this all plays out in Court. Because of this gag order, we are likely not going to get a lot of new details in the coming weeks -- Pam.",

The challenge at a hospital is family members are treated as sort of trusted visitors as they should be, especially if a spouse is terminally ill, spouses will come in and out. A lot of them will get badged, any parent listening knows that when your children come visit at hospitals or have to be in hospitals, that's the same thing. And so they're sort of -- they are insiders, and so you're sort of not expecting this at this stage. My assumption is that they don't have metal detectors, at least at all the doors at the hospital. They may want to check into this but this is rare. Murder-suicides tend to be either quite violent, right, a man killing his wife and then himself out or tend to be quite private. And this is just unique.

There was no reason to believe she was after anyone else, they probably likely knew her. He had been in the hospital at least a couple of weeks, and so they are able to bring her out without further harm to herself, and then to get the care that she needs.

And sometimes, there's just situations in which you really can't sort of plan for because they are so unique, and maybe, you know, just different in kind, which this one is and one in which I think the authorities are really going to have to think about whether first degree murder is the appropriate charge.",

Now, one source says that his decision has nothing to do with the classified document saga that the White House is confronting at this moment. He, of course, has talked about how the job is a grueling position, but it does come as the Biden White House is set to face a host of challenges including the investigations into the handling of classified documents after President Biden left the Obama administration. There is that Special Counsel investigation, as well as investigations that Republicans up on Capitol Hill have been promising. Now, just yesterday, the House Judiciary Chairman got a response from the Justice Department. They, of course, the House Committee has sent over some requests for documents, but the Justice Department said that they will not be providing documents related to ongoing criminal investigations. Their argument is that they want to ensure that they are protecting the integrity of their work. Now, this comes as the Judiciary Committee has wanted to look into some of the politically sensitive investigations that the Justice Department has underway at this moment, including the Special Counsel investigations not only into President Biden's handling of classified information, but also former President Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. Now in addition to these investigations, of course, the White House is also preparing for battles with Republicans up on Capitol Hill when it comes to the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the debt ceiling needs to be raised by this coming summer, and it is expected that President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will meet in the coming weeks. That date for that meeting has yet to be set. Now, the White House has insisted that there is no negotiating over the debt ceiling, but House speaker McCarthy has argued that they are not interested in raising the debt ceiling unless there are spending cuts to come with it.

Now, what I think is important is that because the Attorney General has gone forward and appointed a Special Prosecutor for the Biden administration, for President Biden on this issue for the documents, there are going to be two really important issues. And the first issue is chain of custody. These didn't start out in his garage. They didn't start out in that office at the Penn Biden Center. The second thing is, is why did the President take these? I mean, it's been six years that he had these documents. When he left his Vice President's office and decided that he was going to take these classified documents with him, albeit illegally, and as he has said, he understands that because he says, you know, he said that when Trump did it, so now we now know he did it.

Some people think that he is angling to be a defense minister. Others think that he's trying to set up a separate power center from the Russian military and show that he can succeed where they fail.

There was a deadly avian flu and that killed more than 50 million birds, so there's been a supply shock. Then we have feed and energy costs, those have been going up for farmers and producers and they're passing down the cost on to customers. And we're all baking more especially around the holidays, so there's higher demand.So supply - tight supply and high demand has increased egg prices. And it's not just at the grocery store, this is impacting restaurants. It's leading to higher prices for cookies, baked goods.
