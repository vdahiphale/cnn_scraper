First, your other headlines is our authorities in Israel and Gaza reporter barrage of rockets fired from Gaza. That is after the death of Hara Adnan, a Prominent Palestinian Prisoner who was on a hunger strike. High level representatives from more than 40 countries meet in Berlin today, trying to find solutions for the climate crisis. This is a precursor for COP28 the global climate conference happening here in the UAE in November. Later this hour, \"The Writers Guild of America\" has begun its strike against the big Hollywood Studios effectively shutting down the production process of new movie and television scripts. All Right, we're starting with this breaking news just in in the past few minutes about a possible new week long truce for Sudan. South Sudan's Foreign Ministry says the two warring Generals have agreed to a seven day ceasefire and will send representatives for peace talks, and I quote them here to be held at an agreed venue of their choice. This happening on what is day 18 of fighting and a rapidly expanding refugee crisis. Well, CNN's Larry Madowo collecting us this hour to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Arrival point, Larry for foreign nationals and the fortunate Sudanese citizens, the few fortunate Sudanese citizens, it has to be said you have been able to flee the fighting. What are you hearing there?",

I think the in principle is doing the heavy lifting in this statement from the south Sudan President Salva Kiir because the statement says that this truce will begin on Thursday. It does not begin immediately. It's a seven day agreement to a ceasefire in principle, and President Salva Kiir is encouraging them to name negotiate a team to negotiate at an agreed location. So again, again, it seems like there are some things that have not been agreed upon. There's been previous reporting that that agreed upon location would be here in Saudi Arabia, we haven't heard from the foreign ministry or in Saudi Arabia. This came from at least some reporting, quoting the UN head in Sudan. But now this is the substantive statement saying that there will be an agreement in principle to a truce, and he's encouraging this to men to use this as a stepping stone to going back to dialogue to ending this war that has been going on for so long, has killed more than 500 people. But I think the details here is where it's good to all live and die because this man had been using fighting words Becky, calling each other criminals saying they've got to be brought to the book that they've costumer suffering for Sudanese people. And this is now some kind of agreement that fine, we can sit down and talk again, even though the details will be very important. Will that location be here in Saudi Arabia, as it has been reported? Will it be in Juba in South Sudan? Might it be Nairobi? Would it be Addis Ababa in Ethiopia? We just don't know. There's a lot we don't know. But if ceasefire does happen, it'll be a big thing, because there's been at least five or six failed ceasefire so far. They agreed to them in principle, and then a short while later, they said no, they started shooting at us. No, they weren't shooting at us. And so we had to defend ourselves, Becky.",

The Israeli Prison Service said he had refused to get medical checks. While in detention, he was found dead in his cell on Tuesday morning. Well, in response, at least 22 rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel for interception, 16 fell in open areas. So far at least three were injured by shrapnel in Israel as a result. Well, Adnan's death also prompted anger across the occupied West Bank.

This is a rather large barrage of rocket fire from Gazaat least 22 rockets, in addition to three rockets that were fired earlier today. So in total, right around 25 rockets fired by what Palestinian militant groups were calling their joint factions, which likely means Hamas and both Islamic Jihad. Because as you noted, Khader Adnan was once a spokesperson for Islamic Jihad. And upon his death, Islamic Jihad said they had essentially promoted him to be a commander. Now, three people were injured as a result of shrapnel from these rockets, at least one of them was seriously injured by shrapnel. That's according to Israeli medical authorities. Now, while the Israeli military did initially respond to those first three rockets fired with some tank fire, we have not yet heard about any other Israeli military response to the latest larger barrage, although the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the midst of security briefings right now with the IDF Chief of Staff. And I do believe and I would expect that we will see some sort of Israeli military response to a rather large barrage of rocket fire from Gaza, especially since the sort of modus operandi for the Israeli military in the last couple years has been to respond to every single thing that comes out of Gaza, whether it be an incendiary balloon or rocket fire. But Khader Adnan as you noted, had become really a face of Palestinian prisoners, face of Palestinian resistance. He had been detained at least 10 times since 2004. As you noted, he was a former spokesperson for the Islamic Jihad. He had been detained since February on terror charges. This was also not his first hunger strike. He had done at least five other hunger strikes in the past, but this one was going on for at least three months in Israeli prison authorities saying that they found him unconscious in his cell this morning, they said that he had been refusing medical checks throughout his hunger strike. As you noted, not only the rock, we saw the rockets but also the general strikes across the West Bank and Gaza. But what's interesting is actually what we heard from Khader Adnan's wife who before the biggest barrage of rockets spoke out and actually said that she didn't want to see rockets fired as a result of her husband's death. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDA MUSA, KHADER ADNAN'S WIFE: Not a drop of blood was spilled during the previous prisoners hunger strikes. And today, we say with the rise of the - - and his accomplishment of what he wished for, we do not want a drop of blood to be spilled. We do not want someone to respond to his martyrdom.

That was quite interesting, because in the speech of the U.N. Secretary General, which was remote, which was done by video today, he said that the nations of the world need to stop shutting their eyes. They need to get real look at the data, they need that global stock take to see exactly where they stand. Now the German foreign minister who of course, comes from the Green Party always had a big environmental agenda. She also came out and said that right now, quite frankly, the world is not doing enough.

I want to get you to Texas in the U.S. now and the massive manhunt for thesuspects who shot and killed five people on Friday including a nine year old child. The U.S. immigration and customs enforcement tools tell CNN this suspect Francisco Oropesa had entered the U.S. illegally and had been deported at least four times since 2009. U.S. Border Patrol officers have been told to be on high alert in case he attempts to go into Mexico. An $80,000 reward has been offered for any information leading to his arrest. Well, joining us now is CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell. What more do you have Josh at this point?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky this manhunt continues in Texas as well as in Mexico. Authorities are looking for thesuspect who is accused of this brutal murder on Friday night in Texas killing five people, including a nine year old boy. As you mentioned, the suspect 38 year old Francisco Oropesa, we are learning more information about his background. You indicated there that he had previously been removed from the United States four separate times that according to a source familiar back in March of 2009 he's found in the U.S. illegally, he's deported. Just six months later, he finds himself back in Texas and is removed again. Two other times follow that, he was also convicted in the state of Texas for driving while under the influence of some type of drug or alcohol he did end up serving jail time. And so the reason that is important is because authorities are concerned that because he is so adept at traveling from Mexico into the United States, there's a fear that he may have already fled the United States into Mexico. That's why border officers on both sides of the U.S. Mexico border are on alert at this hour. They've been briefed on the suspect, they have his photo, they've been told to be on the lookout in case they encounter him. Interestingly, the U.S. government is also aggressively messaging to media in Mexico about this $80,000 reward that's being offered for information leading to his arrest. And that is because if there was someone in Mexico that knows where he is, they want to hear from you. And people stand up possibly collect up to 80,000 U.S. dollars as part of that arrest effort. Meanwhile, back in Texas where this murder took place, this was just about 50 kilometers northeast of the city of Houston. There are some 250 law enforcement officers that are continuing to fan out doing what they were called grid searches to try to look through every place where he might have been, were told that they are going door to door asking residents in the area have you seen this suspect? Have you seen his vehicle? They're also asking if residents have security camera footage that authorities can look at. Just to try to again put him in that place in time as they try to find out where he is, no credible leads yet authorities say that they are receiving many, many tips that they're working through. But at this hour Becky this very dangerous suspects still at large.",

According to the Writers Guild, they are asking for $429 million in compensation each year. And they are saying that the studios are only offering $86 million dollars a year. But let's go through what the studios are offering. They said that they have come up on compensation that they are adding to residuals that they are coming up on the residuals that they pay writers for streaming, and they are willing to go even higher, but there remain these key sticking points. One of them is how many writers are in the room, the studios looking to limit that number, the writers looking to expand that number also length of employment. Additionally, a regulation of artificial intelligence is key on the table and residuals from streaming the writer saying that the number that the studios have given them is still not enough. Now when we talk about studios, we're talking about Apple, Amazon, Disney, CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Media, these are companies that have seen dips in advertising revenue, the shares of the company dropped, they then have to take cost cutting measures. And that includes layoffs. On the other side, the writer say that there are now fewer jobs for them. And the jobs that do exist are low paying jobs, especially as the industry has switched from broadcast to streaming. Now in 2007 that was the last writer strike that was about 15 years ago, it lasted 100 days, the economic impact from that was $2 billion. If you adjust that, for inflation, Becky, that's about $3 billion. Today, we are not having any negotiations between the Writers Guild and the studios. But in a few hours, a lot of these writers are going to start hitting the picket lines across New York City and California. It is day one of this writer strike, but still a long ways to go, Becky.",
