      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, the two main issues they discussed, Ukraine and the balloon. Let me set the stage for how this thing went down because it was just hours after Beijing's top diplomat, Wang Yi, basically stood in a panel and accused the U.S. of being hysterical and absurd and said that the United States needs to repair the damage to the China relationship for using, in his words, excessive force against their balloon.So, needless to say, there was no apology from the Chinese side, no apology from Secretary Blinken on behalf of the U.S. for shooting down that balloon. No, he condemned the incursion. He stressed it must never happen again. But then he had another warning for China, and this one was about U.S. concerns that Beijing may be considering providing what the U.S. calls lethal support for Russia. Not just saying helping them get away with, you know, violating sanctions and bolstering their economy, which China is already doing by, you know, buying, you know, cheap oil from Russia when it's sanctioned, or at least price capped around much of the world. But also there's concern that China might be considering taking that support even further, perhaps even providing weapons, Chinese weapons, to Russia for Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war on Ukraine. Blinken saying that that would have very serious consequences for the U.S.-China relationship. Wang Yi saying that without naming names that some forces around the world don't want negotiations to succeed and don't want the war to end. This meeting comes pretty much two weeks after secretary Blinken postponed his trip to Beijing, when the whole balloon fiasco began, when that suspected spy balloon entered U.S. airspace on the eve of his trip, which would have been the first visit to China in five years by a U.S. Secretary of State. Both sides have been preparing for months for that meeting, which they say is badly needed to stabilize this fraught relationship, arguably at its lowest level in decades. A relationship that's even being tested right now because one of the top Pentagon officials, you know, on China is actually here in Taipei, in Taiwan as we speak. And, of course, China never likes it when high level U.S. officials visit this self-governing democracy. But they didn't talk much about Taiwan. They didn't have time to do it. That's something they would definitely, probably discuss whenever this rescheduled meeting happens, Boris and Amara.",

It has millions of troops in reserve. And the point has been to try to get more sophisticated weapons to Ukraine so that it can make up for that numbers difference on the battlefield. The Russians are willing to lose a lot more troops. The British intelligence services have been reporting that they are losing hundreds of troops a day in an absolute meat grinder on the battlefield.

So if they were to beat Russia, is that sustainable?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, probably not, because so much of the Russian equipment has been damaged. But truthfully, Boris, those equipment, those pieces of equipment that they are capturing are of a much lower quality than they're getting from the Western allies in the United States. They are -- you know, they have been assisting in that because they have had the capability of using that equipment because it's just like the ones they started the war with. They need more ammunition for the types of weapons they have, which are old Russian equipment. So that helps a lot when they capture an ammo dump or a cachet. It contributes to their capability of creating mass. But truthfully, I think the equipment they're going to get from the Western countries has been significant. You ask about Poland. Poland alone has provided 3 -- almost $4 billion in military aid to Ukraine, and all the Western nations in NATO are doing the same kinds of things. When you talk about the amount of equipment the United States has delivered, almost $40 billion worth of equipment. You could run down the litany of the list of the things that have been provided, and they are significantly in terms of technologically advanced in the military hardware.",

Just give it to them and they'll put it to use.Well, that's not quite true. There has been some real challenges to the Ukraine Iranian army. And what you're really suggesting is that they completely transform their military during a time of war. It has been very difficult. It isn't just putting, you know, a pilot in an F- 16 fighter seat. It's also providing the support, the repair parts, the supply, and the capability to train all those individuals on a weapon systems like the F-16, which is a flyby wire aircraft, very different than the hydraulic type of aircraft --",

But it was also a chance for the U.S. Secretary of State to articulate things he didn't say in public, like those threatened punishments if China decides to start supplying actual weaponry to Russia for its war against Ukraine. Reporters in D.C. had a briefing from a senior European official that praised the U.S. ability to pull together a new sanctions regime against Russia. And when I asked about, well, could you use the same thing against China? And they said, absolutely. Look, once you develop something like this, you can deploy it elsewhere.

What chemicals are released when it breaks down and what is the impact that that can have on people in terms of, you know, health?DR. HAYNES: Yes. So, the vinyl chloride, it goes away quickly. It was there. It was, you know, it was in the fire, it burns. And most of it is probably dissipated and maybe even turn into something else. So, when these chemicals heat at these high concentrations heat in temperature, new chemicals can form and then those new chemicals are in the environment, in the water streams, in the soil. So, that's the next concern, is to see what these buy products are from the fire. WALKER: Yes, I mean, it's obviously, concerning when you're hearing from people who, you know, are complaining of sore throat and nausea and headaches, you know, even though officials are saying some of the stuff seem to be safe at this time. So, bottled water, cook with bottled water, drink bottled water for now. Dr. Erin Haynes, thank you for the advice. DR. HAYNES: Yes, thank you for having me on. It's a pleasure. I look forward to working with the community in the future.",

And Mac had everyone just in awe again in the finals when he sealed the win with this spinning dunk. Mac's from Gate City, Virginia. Town of just 2,000 people. He went to Georgetown, then Texas Tech for college ball, and trying now he's trying to latch on in the NBA. And I caught up with him last night and asked him, how does it feel now to be the 2023 slam dunk champion? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAC MCCLUNG, 2023 NBA SLAM DUNK CHAMPION: I feel a lot of gratitude. I had a lot of help and the crowd was really amazing. And I was -- it was a blessing. It's really cool, man. I mean, I'll be able to tell my kids and brag about it one day.
