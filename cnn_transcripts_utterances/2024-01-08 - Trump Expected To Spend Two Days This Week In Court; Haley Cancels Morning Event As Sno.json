      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, the final week. Republican presidential candidates begin the seven-day sprint to the Iowa caucuses. Trump, DeSantis, Haley, they all spent the weekend in the Hawkeye State. Hammering each other and making their closing arguments in a state that could make or break all of their campaigns.Plus, fighting hate and extremism. That's President Biden's focus today when he speaks moments from now at the same South Carolina church where a white supremacist shot and killed nine black parishioners nearly a decade ago. We're going to bring that to you live. And under scrutiny. The secretary of Defense is still in the hospital as Washington demands answers. Why did he and his staff wait days to tell the White House that a critical member of the chain of command was in the ICU? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First, breaking news Donald Trump is asking a judge to throw out the election subversion case against him in Georgia. The former president's legal team just filed a motion claiming presidential immunity just like they have in other cases. CNN's Paula Reid has been going through the court filings. Paula, what's his reasoning for wanting immunity in this particular case?",

      "sentences": "Oh, Dana, this is all very familiar. The former president's lawyers arguing that presidential immunity should protect him from the sprawling Rico case down in Georgia. And that argument might sound familiar because it is the exact same argument, they made in his federal election subversion case.And this question of presidential immunity. This is going to be the focus of a much-anticipated oral argument tomorrow before the D.C. Court of Appeals. Trump's even expected to attend. Now, in today's state filing, they're making many of the same arguments they've made in the past. They argue that in and around January 6, Trump was acting in his official capacity as president. They argue that conversations he had with state officials about election proceedings that that's all part of his official duties as president and of course, they argue that because it was part of his official duties as president that he should be protected under presidential immunity. These are the same arguments they've made before in the federal case, but so far, the courts have not seen it this way. This argument was dismissed at the district trial level here in Washington D.C. His former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has also argued similar issues. And a Court of Appeals dismissed the idea that election related activities that those are really part of his official federal duties. Now this question about immunity the extent to which the former president has any protections for his actions around January 6. Dana, this is a question that could ultimately end up with the Supreme Court. Special Counsel Jack Smith has already asked the High Court ones to just weigh in and settle this once and for all. They declined to do that, instead of letting oral arguments go ahead in the Court of Appeals, whatever happens after these oral arguments or the Georgia case. It is highly likely that the justices will again be asked to weigh in on this. It's unclear if they're going to want to weigh in here. But one thing that is for sure is that by litigating this at the federal and state level, the former president has been at least successful in delaying his federal case and could be successful in delaying the state case as well.",

Vivek Ramaswamy, he's forced to shift as well. He typically travels by private plane from event to event. He's doing a long three-hour stretch just so he can make some of his events today, and then holding a tele town hall on the campaign bus.But yes, this is a real concern for these candidates. As you know, they're trying to meet every voter, shake every hand in just a week that they have left. And the looming storm is challenging that. They were out in full force over the weekend though. What we're hearing from Governor DeSantis and Nikki Haley is some sharpening their attacks against former President Donald Trump. For his part, though Trump really leaning on Iowans as well. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: For those that want me to hit Trump more, I just have not going to do it. I told you that I'm not going to do it. If he lies about me, I'll call him out on it. If he's done something wrong, whether it's the economy or how he talks about dictators and in those things, I'll call him out on every one of those issues. But I just think politics is personal enough. And I think let's focus on the issues and getting America back on track. DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Don't go by the polls. The pollster that we're leading by so much. It's incredible. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this. But we have to get out there, every one of us have to get out there because it really sends a message for November. The main thing I got to ask you, look, we got to get out and vote because you know, bad things happen when you sit back. What I'm worried about here is we have to just get out and show the support.

One week to go till Iowa.I just think it's so fascinating what Eva just played from the former president. We're going to play a lot more from him later in the show. But just on this notion of expectations of getting out the vote/caucus goers. You know, he understands that winning could be losing depending on the margin for him. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yeah, absolutely. Especially when polls have shown 30-40, sometimes 50 points ahead. In Iowa, that if he loses by -- if he wins by a very small margin, that shows that he is absolutely vulnerable. And that is what Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis is trying to do. They're not trying to win. They're trying to decrease the margin that they lose to Donald Trump.",

I think you ain't seen nothing yet. Because if you remember, Dana, we both covered the 2000 election with John McCain. And it wasn't until John McCain who's being accused of some of the same things that Nikki Haley is, you know, not a real Republican. Wasn't until John McCain won New Hampshire that the real knives came out and it got really ugly. And that's before Trump era politics.
