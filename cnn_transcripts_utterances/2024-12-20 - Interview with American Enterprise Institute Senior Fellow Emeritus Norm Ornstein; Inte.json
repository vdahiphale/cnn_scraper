I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. America faces chaos in Washington yet again, with the U.S. government just hours away from shutting down as we speak. Two spending plans have now failed to pass the House. The latest one had Donald Trump's support, but dozens of Republicans joined Democrats to kill the bill. Congress seemed ready to move ahead with government funding earlier this week, until Elon Musk jumped onto X to tank that bipartisan deal, and then Trump followed suit. Now, Speaker Mike Johnson's speakership could be on the line, as Democrats claim real power in Washington is shifting towards the man they're calling derisively, Mr. -- or President Musk. Republicans have been meeting today to try and break the stalemate, but barring an early Christmas miracle, the proverbial lights in D.C. go off at midnight tonight. Norm Ornstein is a veteran political observer and dean of Washington's Congressional Experts, and he joins us now. Norm, welcome to the program. So, it seemed that as of Wednesday, we had a bipartisan deal that the president would have signed today. And then, as I noted there in the introduction, things blew up when Elon Musk started getting involved and posting over 70 times on X, Donald Trump following suit, demanding that raising the debt ceiling also be included in the C.R. or doing away with it all together. What do you make of the current dynamic in Washington, and does it surprise you at all?",

Vance putting the blame squarely on Democratsfor the current situation and the fact that we may be facing a government shutdown within just a few hours. Democrats have responded by saying they agree to that initial bipartisan deal and it is Republicans who blew it up. And notable that in that bipartisan -- that second piece of legislation that failed yesterday, which was endorsed by Donald Trump, 38 Republicans also voted no, one of them being Chip Roy. I'd like to play sound from him after that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): To take this bill yesterday and congratulate yourself because it's shorter in pages, but increases the debt by $5 trillion is asinine. And that's precisely what Republicans are doing.

He has been virtually silent the last 48 hours in this. Donald Trump publicly saying that if there's going to be a shutdown, let it be Biden's shutdown. And as I noted, many Republicans placing the blame on Democrats and there is a question of whether or not given the silence we've seen from the White House and given the continued blame from Republicans on Democrats, whether Americans will indeed say that this the fault of Democrats, that's to be determined though. I do have a question to ask you about the Elon Musk factor, because he's not only involving himself in domestic politics, as we know, being the right hand of Donald Trump, but also in foreign politics as well, meeting with Nigel Farage, some really extreme members of governments around the world. The most recent to raise eyebrows is his endorsement overnight on Twitter of AfD. The right -- the extreme right party in Germany saying that only AfD can save Germany. That was responded very quickly from the co- chairman of the party, Alice Weidel, who said, you are absolutely right. How far does his influence actually extend and how concerning is this that he's wading into not only U.S. politics, but global politics?",

And he made this deal withDonald Trump in part, as many other billionaires did, because they knew that they could get even richer. He has completely taken over that platform, Twitter, which he renamed as X. He has manipulated it so that his tweets go out to virtually everybody on the platform, which is a couple of hundred million people. And what's happened to Elon Musk is he's been completely captured by far- right extremists and conspiracy theorists. He regularly retweets some of the craziest things and lies that have been said, and now, he's in bed with the most extreme parties in western democracies and probably around the world. He is pro-Putin and anti-Zelenskyy. And the problem is, even though he is a buffoon in many ways when it comes to understanding what government does, having a disregard for the truth, he has a platform that is almost unmatched. We often talk about the presidential bully pulpit but, you know, the bully pulpit that Elon Musk has with all of those resources is even greater.

People have to remember there are the heavy machinery workers, the bulldozer driver, the excavator driver. These are the people that dug the trenches in the mass graves and covered them up after civilians were poured inside. And then you have the funeral office workers that drove there and were the ones that pulled these bodies in. We've dubbed them, and as they testified before Congress and the British Parliament and other places, as the grave digger, the bulldozer driver, et cetera. But while I was in Damascus over the last week, they introduced me to yet another one of their colleagues who then took us in person to these mass grave sites that we had identified, Qutayfah, which your viewers can see on the screen right now, that wall around it was only built after we had announced that we knew its location, but we could only see it from satellite imagery. Today, we were able to go there in coordination with the new Damascus government. And what we're trying to do is ensuring that these places remain safe, remain untouched until the right experts that have the expertise in excavating and exhuming bodies from mass graves with the right DNA testing to help both bring closure to the families, including mine that we know 99 percent chance our loved ones were right beneath our feet when we were standing there, and to also start building the cases for accountability against all these war criminals, starting with Bashar al-Assad.",

The bulldozerdriver that worked there every day for a year from 2011 to 2012, and the funeral worker, another individual we interviewed aside, both came to the conclusion that based on what they were seeing every day, that they in person buried about 75,000 bodies. These are mostly conservative estimates. When that location was filled, they then had moved on to Qutayfah, which went on from 2012 to 2018 at the frequency of those tractor trailer trucks that were arriving. And then, there is another one on the road to the airport. Another mass grave. I cannot give you, you know, an estimate of how many, but in the thousands, not in the hundreds. There is another location that it's smaller that a lot people know about that is definitely, we would say, in the tens or hundreds. That's in the Tadamon area where the Tadamon massacre and that leaked tape was shown to everyone. There is another location at Baghdad Bridge. And the fact is, if you count even the smaller ones, not just the ones with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of bodies, we're looking at dozens of mass grave locations. And so, far, we're just looking at Damascus. We just got a report of a mass grave at Palmyra, near the prison over there. This regime was more -- way more sadistic than even we knew what I saw and what our team is seeing in person, what Syrians even on the ground that have lived there the whole time are seeing in person, is by far, these are the worst crimes of the 21st century. And so, far, the International Community has not sent in its experts. We deserve the same amount of help that the Ukrainians rightfully so got, and that other countries like Bosnia and Srebrenica and others had. We need help to make sure we provide closure for families and we preserve the chain of evidence as we build justice and accountability for the millions of Syrians.",

So, many generals have also fled in the last few weeks, those that you want to hold to account are not in the country right now. So, what's the best way to go about seeking justice?

You know, its first real sustained boom was I think around 2017 when it really -- you know, it jumped up, I think it broke -- you know, I remember breaking like the $20,000 per coin, you know, mark. And a lot of people said, you know, oh, Bitcoin is going to $100,000. It's going to a million. And those people were sort of roundly mocked for that. And it has had massive fluctuations since.

Bitcoin just purports to do it a little bit better. But it hasn't really taken off, right? Bitcoin has not really taken off as an actual currency. You know, the countries that have tried to use it have struggled to some degree with that. So, that's not quite the killer app. And so, I was trying to think to myself, you know, this thing has become durable. It is worth a lot of money. It has made a lot of people rich and I couldn't really come to any other conclusion than what it has done is it has created a culture that is very kind of obsessed with speculation, right? That's obsessed with getting rich. That really cares about the sort of gambling aspect of this the -- you know, the stock marketing aspect of day trading and the numbers going up. And a real culture has come around -- has been built around that. And I think that the culture starts with this idea that Bitcoin is -- in some sense, is a political project, right? It is a technology that says, we are going to create a new version of a financial system that doesn't need the banks, that doesn't need the governments, that doesn't need anyone else. And that culture, you can see the through lines now when you go online and you see the people who are, you know, Bitcoin maximalists, who are the true believers, the true enthusiasts, and even the day traders and the guys posting memes and things like that. There is this notion that Bitcoin can free you and the cryptocurrencies in general can free you from the man, can free you from authority, that you can make all your money this way without having, you know, other people taxing it and watching it and transferring it back and forth. And I think that that's really important to understanding the appeal, but also what Bitcoin has produced.

The idea that it is a sophisticated database technology that is distributed -- all that stuff, right? I don't think he's paying strict attention to that or that he really cares that much about it. And I think the real reason is that cryptocurrencies and the people who like them are people who really do resist these institutional ideas. People who really feel that they're the same type of people who would want to drain the swamp, right? They're the same type of people who would cheer on Elon Musk and that idea of the Department of Government Efficiency. There is an ideological overlap to some degree, not fully, but to some degree with the MAGA platform, with this idea that banks are screwing you over or Wall Street is screwing you over, and to sort of take control in this own way and work in a financial system that doesn't include those people. I think he saw a huge constituency overlap there with crypto and decided, you know, there are some people, especially people who've made their fortunes in this, who are single issue crypto voters. And in an election that is very close, you know, in an election where, you know, we're trying to win disaffected men, especially, I think he saw an opportunity there to speak to those people, to become the candidate for those people.

This Bitcoin strategicreserve, essentially, as I seem to understand some of the possible plans is that the United States will purchase Bitcoin from large holders, right, or everyday Americans, but the people who stand to benefit from that are people who own a lot of Bitcoin, right? So, it's purchasing 200,000 Bitcoins a year for five years is what I believe it is. But regardless, the purchase of this Bitcoin from large Bitcoin holders will drive the price of Bitcoin up. So, every subsequent year that the government is purchasing this bitcoin, it's going to do so at a higher rate. It's going to have to spend more and more money to create the strategic reserve. To do so, it's going to have to sell off some of its gold reserves. And a way to think about this essentially as a cash transfer from the United States government to the people who already hold the most amount of bitcoin that will also inflate the price of Bitcoin because it has this massive sort of, you know, unquenchable buyer in the United States Treasury. It's a terrible deal for the United States government because it's getting a worse price every year. It speaks to me as a great example of the way that these people who have invested early in this technology are going to try to bully institutions and the global financial system. And that's saying nothing of the fact that bitcoin is an extremely volatile currency, right? You don't want this speculative asset that can lose half its value in six months or a year as, you know, backing your monetary system. It's dangerous. And this speaks to the most important point I heard when I talked to a bunch of crypto skeptics and people inside the financial industry, which is that their biggest fear isn't that a lot of people will adopt Bitcoin or, you know, choose a technologically based financial system. The biggest fear is that crypto will intertwine and mesh with the global financial system in a way without adopting any of the guardrails that it will need to do. And then, there will be this contagion between the crypto ecosystem and the traditional financial system. When FTX collapsed, a lot of people lost, you know, their life savings. It was a huge, you know, financial catastrophe. It was very well covered. A lot of people saw it, but the global financial system was not affected by this. If we plug crypto into that, these people have told me what they're most worried about is that, you know, malfeasance or fraud or whatever that's happening in this much less regulated sector could come in and hurt people who are not doing that kind of speculating, who are trying to invest in sound assets and stable assets.",

So, I can only imagine that unless the industry does something to, you know, turn him off or, you know, attract his ire, I think he's only going to try to, you know, enmesh crypto with the global financial system. There is a fear inside of a lot of banks that I've heard from numerous sources that they don't want to be left behind, right? They don't want this one asset class to be, you know, the historic 21st century growth asset that they do not get behind. They also do not want to be seen as dinosaurs, you know, in terms of their institution. You have a lot of younger people who see crypto as new, exciting part of the future. Those people are only going to, you know, make more money, invest more heavily in banks and things like that, and want to see an asset class that they believe is important. And so, there's this idea of like fear of missing out, right, that these banks might want to do this. And if the Trump administration comes in and, you know, props up crypto and, you know, offers no real important regulations and allows people to trade it as a security, I think what we're going to see is that co- mingling, because I think banks don't want to be left out of, you know, the money.",
