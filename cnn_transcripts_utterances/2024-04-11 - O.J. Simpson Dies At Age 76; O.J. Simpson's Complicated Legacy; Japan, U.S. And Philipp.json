This is what you need to know as you start your day. O.J. Simpson has died. He was 76 years old. We will look back on a controversial life filled with spectacular highs and equally spectacular lows. The leaders of the U.S., Japan, and the Philippines are holding their historic trilateral summit, and China's military might is at the top of the agenda. Shohei Ohtani's former translator has now been charged with bank fraud, accused of stealing $16 million from the baseball star. And Oren Liebermann gets exclusive access to a B-52 bomber mission that passes near China, Russia, and North Korea. We'll have that and a lot more. It's all coming up. We start with the death of O.J. Simpson. One of the most controversial figures of modern times is the former football star, U.S. football star, who became a hated villain to many who ultimately believed he was responsible. He was the murderer of his ex-wife and her friend. Who can forget this image seared into the minds of tens of millions of us? The slow-speed white Ford Bronco Chase in 1994. Police were trying to arrest Simpson. It was among one of the most watched events in TV history. It rewrote the rules on how we cover these sorts of cases. Live helicopter pictures that were beamed worldwide for hours. The jury found O.J. Simpson not guilty of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The trial was a year after his eventual arrest. And then in 1997, a separate civil trial jury found him liable for their debts. If only that was it. In 2008, O.J. Simpson was finally convicted, this time of armed robbery and a variety of other felonies in Las Vegas. He served nine years of a 30-plus year prison sentence. He largely stayed out of the limelight in recent years and his family said earlier today he died of cancer at the age of 76. Stephanie Elam now looks back at the life of O.J. Simpson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Tonight, O.J. Simpson dead, leaving behind a controversial legacy. JOHNNIE COCHRAN, O.J.

Well, apparently, this interpreter opened a bank account for Shohei Ohtani and told all of Ohtani's other advisers that Ohtani himself wanted this bank account to be private. And this was the bank account that all of Ohtani's actual baseball earnings went into. Then, apparently, the interpreter, Mizuhara, when he was speaking to bank officials, he pretended to be Shohei Ohtani and, you know, provided all the, you know, biographical details you need to get past the security in order to get the bank to wire this money from Ohtani's account to the bookmaker's account. And, you know, this all came out because investigators were looking into illegal bookmaking and they saw Shohei Ohtani's name on some wire transfers. Now, initially, Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter, came out and said, Ohtani was loaning me the money. Pretty quickly, Ohtani's people said that is just completely not true. This money was stolen.

In general, we're expecting inflation to moderate in the region from 3.3 percent last year to 3.2 percent this year and 3 percent next year. We still feel that despite recent price pressures, both energy and food prices will normalize over time. And so, the Fed, we're still expecting to eventually cut rates later this year. We think that lower interest rates in Asia, which will be more facilitated by a Fed cut, would help to spur greater investment in the region as well.",

Now, we take you someplace completely different to the Ural River in Russia. This is what happens when you automatically take the temperature from zero Celsius to 20 or from freezing to about 70 and all of the water melts out of the snow.

CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports now on how these strikes are adding to Ukraine's call for military aid.

The energy company, Centrenergo, declaring Thursday, \"a black day.\" The dark smoke on the skyline marking the end of the company's energy supply. All three of its power plants across the country either destroyed or occupied. Russian strikes systematically targeting power facilities have been a constant in Ukraine since late 2022, but have ramped up in recent weeks. DTEK, Ukraine's largest power company, saying two of their plants were also targeted overnight. They say their facilities have suffered their worst attacks this month since the war began, with 80 percent of their infrastructure already destroyed. Employees trying to repair and to rebuild. The burnt-out skeleton of their facilities needing to be back up and running as soon as possible, echoing each other's calls for the world to ramp up its weapons support. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We need more air defenses. If we don't have air defenses, there won't be anything left. A lot of missiles and drones get through, and we get a lot of hits. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  It's a call heard many times over, with the Ukrainian president currently in Lithuania to meet European leaders, and to ensure those calls do not become white noise in this very long war. Warnings by generals also becoming more desperate, with the country's parliament voting on Thursday to overhaul mobilization rules, potentially allowing the military to call up more men. GENERAL YURIY SODOL, COMMANDER, JOINT FORCES OF UKRAINE (through translator):  The enemy outnumbers us by seven to 10 times. We lack manpower. We are holding the defenses on the last breath. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The bill still needing to be signed into law by Zelenskyy is a sign of an exhausted front line. Civilians in Kyiv spending the night, once again, underground.
