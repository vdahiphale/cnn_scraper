      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, we hear from an Israeli official that the reason they decided not to send a delegation to Cairo is because some key points and demands that they had put in these negotiations have not been resolved. They say they still don't have a list of the hostages that Hamas and other groups have taken into Gaza on October 7. They also say that that list should specify which of those hostages are still alive and which have died, also saying that the ratio of Palestinian prisoners that will be released to the hostages has not been confirmed as well. At one point, there was a report that it could be 10 Palestinian prisoners for every one hostage released.And when it comes to Hamas, from that side, a source tells CNN that they have sticking points of their own. The three sticking points are they want to have a permanent ceasefire before they give this kind of information and agree to release hostages. They also say they want to see a withdrawal of troops, the Israeli troops from Gaza, and a return of the displaced residents of Gaza from the northern part. They have been displaced for many months now. And they want to make sure that they will be allowed to return from the south back home. Now, we had heard on Saturday a senior Biden administration official saying that Israel had basically agreed to the six-week ceasefire and that they were simply waiting for Hamas to respond. But, this does show that there are still some key details to be hammered out here before a ceasefire, no matter how temporary can be agreed upon. Rahel.",

Paula, thank you.Ukrainian intelligence, meantime, claims that it blew up a bridge 800 kilometers inside Russian territory. Defense Intelligence of Ukraine says that it destroyed the load-bearing structures on the railway bridge in the Samara region. Russian media report that it's causing major train service delays. On Sunday, Russian missile strikes hit a school and apartment building in the Donetsk region, injuring six people. Ukraine's President says that his country needs more aid to fight off the Russians, but also adds that the military did destroy 15 Russian aircraft last month. And so far, we have not had any reaction from the Kremlin about Friday's funeral for Alexei Navalny. The prominent opposition figure died last month in a Siberian prison, and hundreds of mourners flocked to his grave in Moscow again on Sunday. The Kremlin also denied any involvement in his death. This comes as Navalny's main target, Vladimir Putin, will likely secure another six-year term in the presidential election next month, this month, I should say. Let's bring in our Clare Sebastian, who is following all of these developments from London. Clare, good to see you again. Let's start with the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine. It does seem more and more likely as the weeks goes on that Ukraine is really struggling to hold the line there.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rahel. I think there is a growing sense of concern, in particular, around the Eastern Front. Obviously, we saw the fall of Avdiivka on February 17. Since then, there were a string of very small, it should be said villages, almost hamlets that Russia managed to occupy west of Avdiivka. Now, there is concern around a few more villages. Some pro-Russian sources saying that they've already been captured. Ukraine is denying this.But obviously, the problem for Ukraine, the significant lack of ammunition. They also have issues around personnel. The new Commander in Chief of the armed forces having to admit twice in the last week that there were miscalculations. He even suggested on Saturday that he'd had to make some personnel changes. And none of that really has any quick fixes, in particular, that ammunition crisis while we watch what's happening in Congress. And so, you do see that Ukraine is trying to move the needle by these attacks behind enemy lines, the likes of which we saw in the Samara region in Russia hitting that railway line that Ukraine's Defense Intelligence claims is transporting military equipment. So, trying to ease the pressure, trying to take out some of these weapons before they get to the frontline, separately with those hits on aircraft, as you said, Zelenskyy claiming, that 15 military aircraft have been taken out by Ukraine in the last month, significant because we have seen an uptick in Russia using these aircraft to drop bombs on, in particular, that Eastern Front. It was widely reported that that was part of what was going on in Avdiivka. So, significant successes for Ukraine in the sky, but it is not moving the needle on that frontline at the moment. As I said, there are no quick fixes to the problems that Ukraine is facing.",

Allen Weisselberg arrived at the Manhattan criminal courthouse a little earlier on Monday. And a source tells CNN that the charges stem from testimony he gave during the civil investigation into the Trump Organization's finances. Weisselberg had been the company's chief financial officer in 2022. He pleaded guilty to 15 counts of tax fraud, and served about 100 days in jail. Let's bring in CNN's Kara Scannell who joins us from New York. Kara, of course, this is a case you've been following very closely. Remind us just of who Allen Weisselberg is? He does have a long history with the Trump Organization.",

      "sentences": "Rahel, Allen Weisselberg has been with the Trump Organization for nearly 50 years. He even first started working with Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, long time ago, and he had been a close confidant of the former President until he left this organization after pleading guilty to those tax fraud charges. So, today, we are learning that Allen Weisselberg will be back in court. We see him there arriving at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, and he is expected to plead guilty to perjury charges that relate to testimony he gave in the New York Attorney General's civil fraud investigation. He had testified during their investigation in 2020, and then he was also on the stand last year during that trial.Now, it's not clear exactly what he will be saying under oath that he lied about, but there have been questions raised about his testimony and the accuracy of it as it related to conversations he had with an insurance agent. That was one of these charges, and then also what he said about his knowledge of the size of the Donald Trump's triplex apartment at Trump Tower. That was the key part of the civil AG's case. So, he is due in court this morning where he will then enter these guilty pleas and say what he did. Now, this will be -- what is important here is that although he is a longtime confidant of Trumps and he is pleading guilty for the second time, he is not going to be cooperating against Donald Trump. There had been pressure on him for years to what they say flip and testify against Trump, testify against him in that civil fraud trial and also with prosecutors. But, he is not going to do that. He is just going to give a straight guilty plea, but he is not cooperating. Now, he is a central figure in the Manhattan DA's Office criminal investigation of the former President involving the hush money payments and the reimbursements that were made to Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen. Weisselberg was at the center of these financial dealings. But, again, he is not expected to be called as a witness by either side. He will not be part of the trial, although he is at the center of it. So, this is not necessarily negative for the former President. But, another guilty plea by Weisselberg, certainly for perjury, would make him a tough witness if Trump's team did change their mind and want to call him. As we will learn more details about this, as you noted, Weisselberg had already served about 100 days in Rikers Island. That's this notorious jail in New York City. And it is likely that as part of this guilty plea, he will have to serve additional time. So, he could be heading back to Rikers. He is in his late 70s and has health issues. It's just another kind of fallout from this relationship with the former President that has lasted for decades, Rahel.",

A simple one-line note on the Supreme Court's website has ignited speculation this morning that we may get a ruling today on a major case involving Donald Trump. The court says that it has at least one decision to announce today, but there are no clues about what that ruling is actually about. But, court watchers think that it could be the case involving the Colorado Supreme Court decision to ban Donald Trump from the ballot after finding that he engaged in an interaction on January 6. The Colorado Republican primary is tomorrow, and it is thought that the Supreme Court will want to issue a ruling before that vote happens. Let's bring in CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid.

But, Super Tuesday was the deadline. And I'm talking to sources and publicly both source -- both sides were, look, hey, we really need some clarity, particularly ahead of Super Tuesday, not only because Colorado participates in that, because that's really what kicks off the primary season. And people are going to want to know, hey, is the person that I'm voting for here going to end up on the general election ballot?So, this is kind of a -- look, the Supreme Court, they answered to no one. They do what they want when they want, Rahel. But, this was a deadline that everyone was pushing for, for very logical reasons, which is why we expect this opinion to be issued today.",

As you said, CNN projected that she is going to win the primary in D.C. That's the first contest as part of the Republican primary process that she has won. So, we assume that she'll say something about that. Her campaign saying last night that it's no surprise that those closest to the dysfunction in Washington have rejected Trump.But, when it comes to Nikki Haley's overall message, she really hasn't varied it up through the course of the campaign all that much. Even when it's on the eve of these days when voters are heading to the polls, she does something where she encourages them, of course, to get to the polls, to bring their friends. But then she reiterates the centrality of her message, which is that she believes that she would do better in a general election against Joe Biden than Trump would do in that general election. And she has also made the case time and time again that it's time for America to have a new generation of leadership. She views herself as that person.",

So, as you say, it's not indicative of where the country would go in those battleground states when it comes to a general election. Those battleground states would be the states that would determine if Biden wins or if the Republican nominee wins. And of course, we saw one of those states vote just last week, Michigan voted in favor of Trump over Nikki Haley. So, that is more of an indicator of where these battleground states stand in terms of just how deep Trump's support is in those places.But, we should also note that there have been these matchups between former President Trump and Biden, and Nikki Haley and Biden. And there are polls that show that Nikki Haley would do better in that general election. So, she has been making that pitch time and time again. But, it's not clear that it's really resonating with voters, because in our exit polls in a number of these States, voters do feel that Trump is better poised to beat Biden despite the fact that there are those polls that show that Haley would do better despite the fact that she has made the case that she would do better. And as you said, Rahel, Super Tuesday is critical for Nikki Haley. She has said that she is not looking beyond Super Tuesday just yet.

He is the Editor and Publisher of \"Inside Elections\". Nathan, so good to have you today. Let's start with Super Tuesday. I mean, Nikki Haley has always said she was in this through Super Tuesday. What now? I mean, it hasn't been the most suspenseful race as of yet. What can we expect moving forward? NATHAN GONZALES, EDITOR &amp; PUBLISHER, INSIDE ELECTIONS: Well, we can expect Trump to continue on this path to the nomination. I mean, it's pretty clear that if a clear path to victory was important to Nikki Haley, she would have dropped out a long time ago. But, ever since the night of the New Hampshire primary, it's become very personal. It's become, I think, a spite between Nikki Haley and Trump. She doesn't want to look like she is being bullied out of the race. This is personal to her. And so, that's why, even though I think she is going to lose soundly on Super Tuesday, I'm not convinced that she is going to get out of the race, because again, this is personal. I think she is trying to prove a point in which she makes that -- Kylie was talking about that message of Haley saying that she would do better in the general election. The challenge for Nikki Haley is that Trump right now in the polls is beating Joe Biden. So, when she says, well, there is a danger for the party, the Trump supporters just say he is winning right now. He is beating Biden in the swing states. He is winning this race.

Wade in the summer of 2022, a ruling that was to impact women in the United States but reverberate around the globe. SARAH DUROCHER, PLANNING FAMILIAL (Translated): With what happened in the U.S., there was a strong reaction in France by politicians. Several laws were proposed and the prime minister came to see us here at Family Planning to tell us how worried she was about the right to abortion. BELL (voice-over): A right as hard won in France as it was elsewhere, the procedure only legalized in 1975 after a battle led by the lawmaker and then Health Ministers Simone Veil, a woman speaking to a Parliament of men. SIMONE VEIL, FRENCH HEALTH MINISTER (Translated): This is an injustice that must be stopped. BELL (voice-over): Now, France is looking to go further by enshrining freedom of access to abortion in the Constitution. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (Translated): This will enshrine the freedom of women to choose abortion and to be a solemn guarantee that nothing will ever limit or abolish this right because it will have become irreversible. BELL (voice-over): Among those supporting the move, the singer Barbara Pravi, her own experience of abortion at 17 so traumatic that she wrote a song about it.

There is the room for it. It has, of course, the symbolic nature as well in the French psyche. The idea is that all 925 members of the French Parliaments, Upper and Lower House combined, are on their way there. They will then debate this for several hours.But, the arithmetic for now, and having seen the progress of this bill, both in the assembly and in the Senate leads us to believe that this will lead at some point today to that vote of two or three fifths of that joint assembly in favor of the change. And essentially what the government is saying is that, look, abortion and contraception have been accessible by women here in front since 1975, since that law named after Simone Veil, that you saw there addressing the Parliament back in the day. The point about this change is that it will prevent future governments from ever rolling that back. And the government has been very specific about pointing to what's happened in the United States as being a part of the impetus of what led them to consider this change, and that will make France the only country in the world where this freedom to terminate a pregnancy is enshrined in the basic law in the country's Constitution, Rahel.",

There is no need to go this far as to put in the Constitution. But, there was a fairly overwhelming majority both of legislators and within public opinion that this change actually go ahead. And, I think that's simply because people have been pretty shaken by how fragile the right of American women to abortion have proven to be.The idea is that this will mean that they simply can't be changed in the future. I think that will then in turn, Rahel, change the experience of women, that woman you heard in our report, Barbara Pravi, explained how difficult it would have been. You get to a doctor who doesn't particularly agree with abortions, where it can be made much harder if you're young and arriving alone without your parents in a hospital.

This is the backstory. Last week, a lawmaker in the Philippines called on his country to pressure Singapore for an explanation. Joey Salceda said this. \"This isn't what good neighbors do. It was at the expense of neighboring countries which could not attract their own foreign concert goers, and whose fans had to go to Singapore.\" But, the allegations were made public earlier by the Thai PrimeMinister Srettha Thavisin at a business forum in Bangkok on February 16. He said that Singapore paid Taylor Swift up to $3 million per show, allegedly on condition of exclusivity of a Singapore-only arrangement in Southeast Asia. And Srettha added this. \"If I had known this, I would have brought the shows to Thailand.\" Now, Singapore said it did award Taylor Swift a grant to perform there, but it did not confirm the exclusivity clause. And on Monday, its Culture Minister Edwin Tong made new comments about the grant. Speaking to Parliament, he said this. \"There has been some online speculation as to the size of the grant. I can say that it is not accurate and not anywhere as high as speculated.\" Citing confidentiality reasons, he did not reveal the size or the conditions of the grant. This week, Swift is playing six sold-out nights to 300,000 fans in Singapore, her only stop in Southeast Asia. And according to an economist that Maybank, seven in 10 concertgoers are coming in from overseas, spending up to $370 million in the city state.",
