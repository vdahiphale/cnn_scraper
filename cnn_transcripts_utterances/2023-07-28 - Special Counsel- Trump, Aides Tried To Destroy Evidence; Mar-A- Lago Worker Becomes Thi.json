A superseding indictment charges the former president with more crimes and puts a new co-conspirator in the crosshairs.Plus, how many indictments is too many indictments? Some Republicans reflexively rush to Donald Trump's defense, others including some inside the Trump orbit worry criminal charges will eat away at his general election chances. And tonight, Iowa is all a stage can anyone deliver a breakout performance, or will the indictment make every single Republican running for the nomination just another player and a story all about Trump? Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, it is always the cover up. Jack Smith hits Donald Trump with three new charges connected to his effort to allegedly conceal classified documents. The superseding indictment from the special counsel out 60 pages of meat to the case against the former president. The document reads like something ripped from the pages of the untouchables. Federal prosecutors tick through with exacting precision, dates, times, phone calls, encrypted chats, a search of tunnels at Mar-a-Lago arrangements for a secret trip, fake family emergency and orders from the boss to make sure surveillance video disappears. Ask the former president about it. And he says, well, that's all made up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: This is harassment. This is election interference. For now, maybe a January 6 case. I don't know, maybe not to because it's nothing wrong. They did this in order to get me out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One of them for the willful retention of national defense information, which is that Iran document that we've talked so much about that Donald Trump allegedly flashed to a bunch of people in a meeting with writers working on a Mark Meadows biography.But the other ones, as you pointed out, are related to this scheme to attempt to destroy surveillance footage at Mar-a-Lago. And you know, you nailed it on the head, when you said that there is a lot of detail in this new superseding indictment. It runs through at some point, almost minute by minute, hour by hour about interactions from some of these Trump employees, Walt Nauta, as well as this other man who's now a defendant in the case, Carlos De Oliveira. Of when the Trump world gets a subpoena for these surveillance tapes. You know, it shows that Donald Trump's attorney informs him of this subpoena that Donald Trump then makes it clear he wants to speak to Walt Nauta. Walt Nauta all of a sudden changes his travel plans to stick around Palm Beach. And then we get all of the detail of Carlos De Oliveira, talking to other Trump employees about how the boss wants this surveillance footage to be deleted, establishing that it's kept on the server for 45 days and essentially trying to figure out what he's going to do about this conundrum of all this surveillance footage out there, when the boss wants it gone.

And the former president and everybody around him are trying to make sure they're circling the wagons, and to make sure that everybody stays on the team.It really raises an important thing that I think, we don't -- it's not necessarily charged in this case, but which you might see appear at a trial, right, which is that one of the features of the obstruction that the former president is accused of right, is paying the legal fees of some of his employees. People who are around him to try to make sure that they stay on board. And also, to try to make sure that he is aware of what they're saying, what testimony they provided, and make sure he has all the intelligence of what Jack Smith and what prosecutors are getting. And right there, you see that Donald Trump calls De Oliveira and says, he's going to get him an attorney. Again, this is not exactly crystal- clear charge. There's not a separate charge for this, but it is something that, you know, you can get the sense that prosecutors could use in an upcoming trial.",

Also, in these videos, this is essential evidence.And at this point, they realize that, so then they're trying to destroy it. Now, of course, this is an attempt to destroy it. It's our understanding that the surveillance footage was not destroyed. But these are fascinating charges to add on. And you also ask, well, why now. And it appears they would have liked to have gotten a plea deal out of Carlos, maybe gotten him even as a cooperator. But look, if he's not going to join team America, he's going to be charged. And then of course, they also added on that document from the tape. A big question, why now? And it's just not clear if that was to just put Trump on notice that they heard him in his Fox News interview, where he said I didn't have a document. And they want to add that or if there was some issue with the intelligence community. But it's really interesting to see these additional charges.",

Yet, however, they read as a textbook script for how you would instruct someone to obstruct justice, because what you have is number one, and if you just go through that timeline where they say, number one, they receive a draft subpoena for the materials that are at Mar- a-Lago, then they start the conversations both with the president and with each other about how to start deleting evidence in effect.It is a level of Keystone Cops type, almost I don't know if it's incompetence or arrogance, but the mere fact that they all the above, but the mere fact that they knew an investigation was happening, they knew they had evidence, and they knew that they had to suppress it is right out of the elements of obstruction of justice. And frankly, obstruction compared to all the other things Donald Trump is charged with, whether that's here or potentially, with January 6, is the far more straightforward crime because you don't have to tie in classified documents to it. You just have to prove that they knew that there was an investigation that they were trying to get the way of it.",

But these two gentlemen need to assess their own situations, assess the fact that the former president could become the president once again, potentially make this go away. They need to look at their situation carefully, right, because neither one of these men is going to have the resources to go up against the justice department on their own. But former President Trump, he has two jobs right now. One he wants to get reelected to the White House. And the second is to keep Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira very close. And I'm told that actually he has learned a lot from what happened with Michael Cohen. I'm told by people close to him that he's gotten a lot better about keeping people who could potentially be a very helpful to investigators closer to the fold, so far, so good.

He has no desire to engage on the actual facts of what's being presented in the indictment.I mean, and when he does, he tends to cause himself perhaps even greater legal peril. So instead, he does this broad race. This is just politics. And it works for him in the short-term. It rallies his troops to his side. It brings in more of those grassroots donations. It does no doubt sort of blot out the sun. And he continues to be the dominant force in the race. So, I don't expect that we're going to see a change in approach from Donald Trump at each stage. If there are two more indictments to come, I'm sure that Breitbart interview that you played there, you could hit on repeat. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: You know, I will say, and this might make me sound very superficial. Well, he looks a little disheveled and stressed out, right? And I think, of course, he wouldn't be the legal problems that he has are piling up. He's got people who work for him. He's got to keep them in his circle. Probably there are people who are -- who used to work with him or work for him now, who may be cooperating with the folks who are investigating this. So, this is a very stressful time for him. Sure, he can go in these interviews and sort of say, it's no big deal. And he's beating Joe Biden in the polls. I actually don't think that's true. He's certainly beating Ron DeSantis.

But the issue for the other candidates is that Republican voters haven't really prioritized electability over everything else. Remembering the Democratic primary in 2020. This was the pitch, Joe Biden was able to make above all the other candidates to say, OK, put all those things aside. It's about who can win in November. That's not the priority for most of the Republican voter electorate. And so, even Donald Trump's general election problems, which would come with these indictments because swing voters and independents universally find this to be something that makes it distasteful to for him to get back to the White House.
