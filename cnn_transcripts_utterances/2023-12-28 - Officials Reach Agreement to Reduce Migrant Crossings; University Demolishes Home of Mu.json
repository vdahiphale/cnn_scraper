This is happening despite some of the families of the victims pleading with the university officials to preserve the home until after suspect Bryan Kohberger's trial.

A trial date has not yet been set.CNN's Veronica Miracle is live for us in Moscow, Idaho, this morning.

There were still some legal issues. Would an injunction happen. Uh-uh, it's sort of game over there. This house is now being torn down. How surprised are you to see this happen? [09:45:04] MISTY MARRIS, DEFENSE AND TRIAL ATTORNEY: I was absolutely shocked to see that this demolition is going forward before the trial. And there's several reasons here. The demolition is moving forward because the owner had donated the property to the school after the murders happened, to the university. And the university has now decided that they are going to -- that they want to demolish the property. You know, this happened back in August that this began to unfold. But what I would have thought would happen is that prosecutors would step in and say, no way, this is a critical piece of evidence in the case. It has to be preserved, like any other piece of evidence, through trial. However, in this case, prosecutors did not contest the demolition, nor did the defense attorneys. That, to me, was a pretty shocking part of this because that structure of the house, the fact that it's three floors, the logistics of how this horrific murder could have happened is of critical importance in the trial for both sides, the prosecution and defense. So, it's quite shocking that this is moving forward. But we don't even have a trial date yet. Meanwhile, the demolition is starting earlier than planned.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. This is a really important point, John, and this is why, from a trial perspective, I'm so surprised. Now, prosecutors, the district attorney made a statement that they did not intend to use the house for a jury site visit. A reminder to the folks watching, a jury site visit is when the jury actually goes to where a crime occurred and takes a look -- you know, it's worth so much more to see the actual property and the actual area where this happened. And particularly critical importance in this case where there's so many logistical issues about how this actually was done by one person.And so the fact that we have prosecutors just saying, well, it doesn't fall under what the statute would allow. Meaning, the statute says that if the interior is substantially different from when the crime occurred that a site visit isn't permissible. Well, John, that's always an arguable point. I expect the defense in this case to say, it would be impossible for one person to commit this murder. The defense will likely argue it wasn't Bryan, we don't know who it is, but it would be unlikely that one person could do this. And it will be up to the prosecution, who has the burden of proof, to explain to the jurors sitting in that box how two murders occur on the third floor, two murders on the second floor, and an exit on the first floor is feasible. As we talk about it right now, thinking about those logistics of what the prosecutors intend to prove with respect to Kohberger, seeing the property and the staircase and the angles, that is something that I would, from a prosecutorial perspective, be fighting very, very hard for. Now, meanwhile, there are models, there's a lot of technology. Site visits are less common. But in this particular case, that property is so important and critical from an evidentiary perspective.",
