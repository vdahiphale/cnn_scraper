I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, we are 10 hours, from the first polls opening, in the first- in-the-south Republican primary, in South Carolina, Nikki Haley's home state, where she is facing a daunting uphill battle, with Donald Trump leading in the double digits in the latest polls. But anything can happen of course. Both still fighting until the finish, trading new attacks on the trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She's going to have a very bad day, tomorrow, because she's not a nice person. Nikki's actually gone very far left. She's very rude. Do you notice that? NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Trump is siding with a dictator, who kills his political opponents. Donald Trump calls anybody that doesn't support him, vermin. That's not normal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I practiced Christianity, all of my life. My dad preaches often from the Old Testament, as he did from the New.

She's just one of many Republicans, now trying to distance themselves, from this ruling. All of it, a sign the GOP is struggling to formulate a winning message, on reproductive rights, since the overturning of Roe v. Wade two years ago.Joining us now, we have former Communications Director, for the DNC, Karen Finney. And also here, tonight, with us, we have Republican strategist, Rina Shah. And I wonder, Rina, what you think the effect is, of Trump and other Republicans, pretty quickly trying to shift in favor of IVF, if it works for them? RINA SHAH, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, it's the right move, because the backlash was severe, right after this ruling came out. It bears repeating, this court ruling is the first ruling of its kind, where it determines, what is life, so close to conception. That really shakes the consciousness of the younger American woman that two years after the overturn of Roe, never thought we'd really see this day. But those of us, who are in the political sphere know, that when you give an inch, they'll take a mile. And that is what the politicians, in Alabama, determined. I think their Supreme Court didn't do this, by any sort of interpretation of laws on the books. They wanted to gauge public opinion, or what they think is public opinion. But the numbers are stark, Brianna. They're really stark. Across the United States, the CDC says there were 92,000 live births, in credit to IVF. Now, in Alabama alone, there were 966 embryo transfers, in the year, 2021, of which 407 live birth deliveries resulted. That's 50 percent. That's families that would never have the beautiful thing that is life, if there weren't IVF. So, reproductive-assistive technologies are massive. And the GOP knows that. So, no surprise that the former President would come out and say, I'm fine with it, I'm not going to take it away. Because he knows those are votes that are against him, if he didn't say what he said.",

And the challenge, and part of where I think Republicans, again, when the Dobbs decision happened, it opened up a whole Pandora's Box of issues. How are you, as a candidate, going to say, I believe a woman and her husband, or her partnership for IVF, they can make that decision. But she can't decide, for herself, whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. And think about the stories, we've seen it in places, like Texas, where a woman needed -- wanted to have an abortion, because it would preserve her ability to have more children. And they said no, and they threatened her. So, I think this, you know, I think there was not -- they were not prepared for what this was going to mean. And so, and don't forget, also during the election, there are going to be other races. There are Secretary -- not Secretary of State races. But there are down-ballot races that will be impacted by this issue. And I expect candidates are going to be asked, where do you stand on this issue?

That could be now a separate basis for removing her from the case. So, that's why this is so important. I think the judge has a decision to make, because the Willis team is saying that that -- the evidence of the subpoenaed phone records shouldn't even come in that the judge shouldn't even consider them. So, he first has to decide if he's considering this evidence, and then what to do about it. The evidence is supposed to be closed, at this point. They're not supposed to go back for more evidence.

So, the evidence was quite compelling that he was using it, for his own purposes, for lavish trips, and so on. So, the jury verdict makes perfect sense to me that he should have to pay back the money. That was the NRA's money that's supposed to be used for the purposes of the NRA, which is largely lobbying, and not for his own personal expenses. So, seems like it's the right verdict, to me. He'll have to pay it back. He already had resigned. So, their order that he should be taken off of the NRA anyway, doesn't really mean much. But now there's another proceeding, following on this one, Brianna, where the judge himself will decide things, about what happens to the NRA, from here out, whether an independent monitor should be put in, and whether other penalties will be put into place, to make sure that the NRA now will be on a proper footing, going forward.",

He is not on the same page, not only with the Palestinians, but also with the United States, Brianna. I think that this is really an example where Netanyahu's proposals look quite different. For example, President Biden, and his administration have talked about a kind of revitalized Palestinian Authority, as the governing authority, in both the West Bank and Gaza, after the war. Netanyahu seems to reject that, and say, no, we would have military controls, still rest with Israel, and that civilian administration should be handled only by unspecified Palestinians, who do not have any connections to terrorist groups. What does that mean? We don't know. But it doesn't suggest the Palestinian Authority, because he says they should be local, and not living in the West Bank. That's just one example. You mentioned the buffer zones as well. I think that would be a non- starter, for many parties, including Egypt, which of course shares the border with Gaza, and is already very concerned, about the prospect of trouble spilling over those borders.",

And so, there's a delicate calibration there.Remember that Netanyahu is very unpopular in Israel. And there's a very real prospect that if the war stops, that the first order of business, for many Israelis, will be to throw Netanyahu out of office. Maybe that'll happen, maybe it won't. But I do think domestic politics are, if not top of mind for him, certainly an important factor in this plan. Also remember that throughout his long, long career, in politics, Netanyahu has been not a friend, or a believer, in the concept of a separate Palestinian, an independent Palestinian state. And many of the things that he's done, as a politician, have made it harder and harder for that goal to be achieved, frankly. So, I'm not surprised that he's not changing course now.",
