He's maintained this aggressive schedule throughout the four week runoff period trying to hit as many events and many different types of events as he can. Herschel Walker, the Republican has had a relatively late schedule for the runoff period. But that changed today with five separate events, mostly in the northern part of the state, that's actually where he was about 200,000 votes when he finished behind Republican governor, Brian Kemp. Some of that from that area right there trying to turn out their base. More than 1.8 5 million people have already voted in that early voting period. But today, the message is if you've already voted, get your friends to vote, get your family to vote, ask strangers to vote, they need to see turnout. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): Matter of fact, call your father and your mother, your sister and your brother, called Lottie, Dottie and everybody. Tell them his time to vote. Tell them that a vote is a kind of prayer for the world we desire for ourselves and for our children. HERSCHEL WALKER, (R) U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE IN GEORGIA: All of you who has already voted already called 10 of your friends to go vote or you can pick up your friends to go vote and all of you that got to vote tomorrow, carry someone with you that hadn't voted to vote or go with somebody that had voted to vote, you all know who to vote for.

Herschel Walker did a few, but not as many as Raphael Warnock and you just heard him, now is the time to vote. Tell your mother, your grandmother and everyone. So the momentum in this race is coming down to the wire and we're waiting to see what will happen at the polls tomorrow. Again, we're hoping - Warnock is hoping that he can capture that Republican vote. He's trying to get Independents and young yes and that black female. But tomorrow is the big day for Republicans, so he's reaching out to them as well. Herschel Walker is doing status quo. He's not giving those interviews that you would expect during this late hour, but he is doing some stopping. So we're going to wait and see what happens tomorrow. CAMEROTA: So Lisa, we all remember that there was this controversial new voting law passed in Georgia after the 2020 race. So in 2021, basically, I think they eliminated things like Sunday, early voting and you'll remember the Democrats feared and claimed that this would lead to voter suppression.

She wants to celebrate marriages, she wants to expand her business, but she does not want to work with same-sex couples and she's come up against this public accommodation laws. But the justices, the conservatives really looked at this as a free speech case and they said that maybe if a business person creates something that's custom or a piece of art, then they cannot be compelled to express a message that they don't believe in, so suggesting that they would rule in her favor. And the liberals pushed back hard, the three liberals on this court.
