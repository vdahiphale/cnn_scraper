      "sentences": "Hello everybody, welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing a remarkable news day with us. We begin this hour with a brazen spy drama. We'll take you straight to the Pentagon now to brief you on a Chinese balloon over Montana.AIR FORCE BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: Conducting press briefings here in our temporary press briefing room, while our primary location undergoes extensive technical renovations and upgrades. We do greatly appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work to install some long overdue upgrades to the Pentagon press briefing room. Because we do not have internet or phone capability in this area of the Pentagon for a variety of reasons, our normal calling options will not be available. So, for those who have had to call in, we apologize for the inconvenience. However, we will aim to get our briefing transcripts and the audio up as quickly as possible for reporting purposes. We'll also aim to answer your questions through our DOD press desk when you send them to us. Moving forward, we'll look at ways to improve our briefing operations and the facilitation and expect that our regular press briefings will resume back in the press briefing room in middle to late May. So again, we appreciate your patience and flexibility and extend our thanks to the Department of the Air Force for allowing us to use Airman's Hall as our temporary briefing home. And other news Secretary Austin returned yesterday from a very productive series of meetings in the Republic of Korea and the Philippines. The secretary and his Korean counterpart Minister Lee Jong-sup jointly reaffirmed measures to enhance extended deterrence on the Korean peninsula. The two leaders additionally pledged to closely cooperate regarding U.S. strategic assets in the future, as well as further expand and bolster the level and scale of combined exercises and training. And the Philippines Secretary Austin had his first in person meeting with his counterpart Secretary Galvez and reiterated that the U.S. commitment to Philippine security is ironclad. The secretary expressed his appreciation for the Philippines approval of four new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement locations, and both Secretary Austin and Secretary Galvez noted that the EDCA is a key pillar of alliance cooperation and supports combined training exercises and interoperability. Separately, the Department of Defense announced today a significant new package of security assistance for Ukraine. This includes the authorization of a presidential drawdown of security assistance, valued at up to $425 million, as well as $1.75 billion in Ukraine security assistance initiative funds. The presidential drawdown is the 31st such drawdown of equipment from DOD inventories for Ukraine. In total, the U.S. has now committed $32 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014, and $29.3 billion since Russia's unprovoked an illegal invasion nearly one year ago this month. Today's announcement includes critical air defense capabilities to help Ukraine defend its people as well as armored infantry vehicles and more equipment that Ukraine is using to effect so effectively including, Javelin anti-tank missiles, artillery, ammunition, and conventional and long-range rockets for U.S. provided HIMARS. Additional information on the security package can be found on defense.gov. In regards to our announcement last night regarding the high altitude surveillance balloon, I'm not going to have much new information to provide other than to say that the North American Aerospace Defense Command continues to monitor it closely. While we won't get into specifics in regards to the exact location, I can tell you that the balloon continues to move eastward and is currently over the center of the continental United States. Again, we currently assess that the balloon does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground at this time and will continue to review - excuse me, continue to monitor and review options. Finally, Secretary Austin will host a bilateral meeting today here in the Pentagon with Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Richard Marles. The secretary looks forward to discussing bilateral defense cooperation and our mutual security efforts within the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. A full readout of the engagement, we'll post later today to defense.gov. And with that, we'll go ahead and move to your questions. We'll start with AP Tara (Ph).",

Do you have any guidance for people as they see this balloon or they're trying to photograph it or maybe trying to interfere with it? [12GEN. RYDER: Sure. Thanks Tara. So, first of all, we are aware of the PRC statement, however the fact is we know that it's a surveillance balloon. And I'm not going to be able to be more specific than that. We do know that the balloon has violated U.S. airspace and international law, which is unacceptable. And so, we've conveyed this directly to the PRC at multiple levels.

So again, well above the range of civilian air traffic or where civilian air traffic would normally fly, certainly aware that there are cameras, you know, civilian owned commercial cameras that could spot this balloon. In terms of guidance to folks, again, this is something that NORAD is closely monitoring. We do assess at this time that it's not pose a physical threat, as I mentioned, to people on the ground.

Again, what we're focused on is on preserving peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.

And secondly, are there any alternatives being considered to shooting it down? Is there any option to take this balloon out of the sky intact, to maybe get a better look at that equipment?GEN. RYDER: Yes. So again, this is a surveillance balloon, you know, operating at about 60,000 feet. Clearly, you know, we did a very close assessment in terms of what it's doing. And as I mentioned, military commanders have assessed that there is no physical or military threat to people on the ground. And so, in that regard, we'll continue to monitor.

Again, running through the various factors, and looking at in terms of, does it pose a potential risk to people while in the air. And right now, as I mentioned, we assess that it does not pose a risk to people on the ground as it currently is traversing the continental United States.

So, again, it's important to look at this from an evolution standpoint in terms of adapting to the conditions on the ground. And so, we've been focused on several key areas in the last few months to support Ukraine, specifically air defense capabilities, armor capabilities, long range fires capabilities, and then combined with training in order to enable them to have the ability to conduct combined arms. And so, looking at things like further enhancing and enabling their integrated air defense, which I think everyone continues to the watch with horror as Russia conducts aerial bombardment on civilian targets throughout Ukraine. So, working with them in those areas, but also, through those - through the combined arms training, enabling them to be able to change the equation on the front lines, not only defend their territory, but take back sovereign territory. Thank you. John?",

A Chinese balloon over the central part of the continental United States, it was over a key Air Force Base in Montana, just yesterday or the day before, some new information. Also, some lack of information where General Ryder said some things are classified.Let's get to one of our great correspondents, Alex Marquardt, standing by to help us through this. Alex, he said it's at 60,000 feet. He says it is maneuverable, meaning there's someone at a Chinese military base who's controlling this balloon, the decision not to shoot it down. General Ryder saying because of the fear, that heavy equipment onboard, the debris field could cause civilian deaths or casualties. But he says it is being closely monitored and options are on the table. Those options, of course, including shooting it down, perhaps trying to capture it. What else jumped out at you from this briefing?",

      "sentences": "Well, when he was pressed as to the exact location of the balloon, he was said he wasn't going to be giving an hour-by-hour update. And when he was asked if it was classified, he said no, but if the American people wanted to see where it is, they can just look up in the sky, which is a rather glib answer, given the fact that it is flying at some 60,000 feet. That figure is a new detail from the Pentagon.We had been told that it is in U.S. airspace, of course in the atmosphere, but not quite. In outer space, that is a very high- altitude, John, which of course makes the question over how to shoot it down whether to shoot it down even more complicated. There are only a handful of fighter jets, I'm told that can even get up that high. But for the time being that that's not really the argument against shooting it down. The administration, the Pentagon holding firm, that it is simply too dangerous. And that for right now, there is no real point, they say that the balloon is not a danger to people on the ground. As it flies to the sky, it is not a threat to Homeland Security. And they say that they have taken steps to prevent this balloon from carrying out its mission of surveillance of gathering intelligence. The president was briefed on military options. He asked for military options were told and was told by his top commanders that it would not be a good idea to shoot this down simply because of the damage that it could do to people and property on the ground. Remember, this thing is the size of three school buses. It is not just a balloon it has surveillance equipment on board with hold it has solar panels on board. So, you can imagine if this thing was shot down to some 60,000 feet, that that would create quite a bit of debris falling to the ground. So, for the time being despite the Monday morning back quarter quarterbacking. And you know, questions from former officials, current officials, as to whether this is a smart idea to continue letting it fly through American airspace that is what they intend to do for now. They say of course, that they do have a number of options, should they change their mind. John?",

Let's also go to other national security correspondent Kylie Atwood. So, Kylie, this happens, the timing is fascinating. Just as the Secretary of State Antony Blinken about to go to Beijing, that trip now postponed. It comes well if you look at the inbox, it's a polite way to put it of issues between the United States and China it was already pretty crowded, pretty complicated and pretty tense. And now the Chinese send a spy balloon over the continental United States. What are U.S. officials saying, can they answer the question, why and why now?",
