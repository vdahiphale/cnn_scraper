Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room.

The Maryland governor and other top officials, they are now getting ready to hold a news conference in Baltimore, should begin very soon. We'll carry it live. Right now, let's check in with CNN's Pete Muntean. He's joining us live from Baltimore. Pete, I understand there's been a lot of new action today over at the scene of this disaster where you are.

The latest goal is piecing together the final frantic moments on board the ship as it careened helplessly out of control and into Baltimore's key bridge, causing it to collapse.

Both of those gentlemen you mentioned have been in the country for 18 or 19 years, raising families, paying taxes, doing whatever they could do to get work. Some of them work two and three jobs. And so, this is a tragedy that should not be set on anyone. This family and these six families, I should say, are very, very much impacted, as, of course, we know they are.And I think the main thing right now is twofold. Do what we can to support these families at this hour of real tragedy and then do what we can to support the 15,000 workers who are out of work effectively now who work in the port as a result of the inability for ships to come in and out. About 35,000 people a day, go across that bridge, and so it's been a lifeline, an artery to both sides of Baltimore City and Baltimore County. And the key right now is to try to find a way, once we do those other things, to dredge and to get all of that scrap out of the water because you can't put a vessel through there as long as you don't know what's underneath the surface. BLITZER: Yes, important point. You heard the Transportation Secretary Buttigieg say rebuilding this bridge won't be quick, won't be easy or cheap.

This is going to be a long process.Fortunately, I talked to President Biden yesterday, spent time with Secretary Buttigieg, and both of our senators, Senator Carden and Senator Van Hollen, have been in touch with the leadership on the Senate side, myself on the House side, so that we're able to put together a strategy to get an emergency supplemental. There's got to be an appropriation. And I think what I'm sensing, Wolf, around the country is that people, regardless of their political affiliation or where they live, have a sense of loss here, sense like we've all been wounded by this. And so I'm hoping that that appropriation process does not get hung up in politics. The President will put forth what he's going to do, but the Congress controls the purse strings. And so we're going to need a major appropriation, a supplemental to begin with and several after that to be able to do what we want to do here.",

The parties will be, obviously, the shipping crew, the harbor pilots. It will be road constructors. It will be bridge experts. And they do this through different working groups.They have, for example, a recorders group, a human factors group, an engineering group, a shipping practices group, and they divide up the work to all these different groups, and then they report back together and coordinate. And that's how they get these massive jobs done on this and any other NTSB investigation of this magnitude. [17:10:01] And then they also will cover literally everything. Some things that you or I or other people might think are red herrings that don't have anything to -- you know, might not be significant here. They will cover each one of those and systematically rule them out, and that's how they avoid investigation bias. If they go in the beginning thinking, well, this doesn't matter, they might be biased. And so the NTSB does not do that. They will literally cover every single aspect of this through various working groups. Oh, and by the way, they do have to bring in and are bringing in the Ministry of Transportation of Singapore because they are a party to this investigation as well because of the flagging of the ship.

From your understanding right now, did the ship's team do everything they could? Was there any way to have prevented this horrible collapse? CAPT. JOSEPH AHLSTROM, SAFETY MANAGEMENT INSTRUCTOR, SUNY MARITIME COLLEGE: No, I think the ship's crew did everything they could. They had a man standing by on the bow, which again, the investigation will prove. The anchors were ready to be let go. Unfortunately, they lost power at the wrong time, and possibly they put the engines astern, which may have pushed the bow to starboard. And again, I'm a big fan of having tug escorts. They did not have a tug escort. It wasn't required. But I do believe that this crew was well trained. They had STCW qualified, they complied with soil loss, they were licensed. And I believe the pilots did a fantastic job. But unfortunately, it was Murphy's law. And we trained our cadets, I always say going to sea is 99 percent burdensome and 1 percent sheer terror. And what you do in that 1 percent will depend if you stay alive or still have a license. And they did the best they could with what the hand they would dealt.",

They do include what they call dolphins, or if you would think of it as giant cement and rock cylinders and they are reinforced. They have additional standards. For example, there's a new suspension bridge in Charleston, South Carolina replaced an old bridge very much like this, 2 miles long, 100,000 vehicles a day.It costs almost 1 billion and it was finished ahead of schedule, but it has more modern things such as the supports, the additional restructuring.

I was just thinking back to my last conversation with him only a few weeks ago about this movement called no labels. He's been urging and looking for a third party candidate, if you will.He, of course, has been frustrated by the direction of the party. So Joe Lieberman has a long, long career, longtime friend of Joe Biden's, but he thought it was time for a new direction. So that was his latest act in politics, Wolf. But if we look at the long life of Joe Lieberman, there is no doubt he's history making. He was one of the Democrats who, of course, was very good friends with Senator John McCain, one of his closest friends in the Senate. In fact, John McCain really wanted to and tried to make Joe Lieberman his running mate in 2008. But Republican advisors, of course, picked Sarah Palin at the time.

Joe Lieberman, he lost his Democratic primary, ran as an independent.There are very few senators, few leaders in this country who put their principles over party and really can bring both sides together. It's extraordinary. I remember that moment very well from 2008 when he endorsed John McCain. He had served alongside Joe Biden, who was Barack Obama's running mate for a very long time. And that was so shocking. But he answered the question there in your obituary, Wolf. He said that John McCain was the only one who asked him for his endorsement. So the reality here is his independent streak. Yes, it rankled people, particularly even recently, pushing that no labels movement here.

But I remember thinking back to his brief 2004 campaign when he ran very briefly. His announcement ceremony was in Stanford, Connecticut. We went through his family home. He was still a Democrat then without a doubt. He had a short lived campaign. But shortly after that, something changed.The Democratic Party changed a bit, but I think it was Joe Lieberman who changed as well, largely because of the Iraq war, largely because of in the Bush administration as Scott remembers. He largely became aligned with the views of the Bush administration. That was a very polarizing time for Democrats and that, politically speaking, was never really healed. And certainly in this Democratic Party, he had many, many disagreements with the Democratic Party or some members of it, view on the Israel-Gaza Hamas war. So certainly the party changed tremendously. But throughout the years, his independent nature, at least during his voting time in the Senate, was notable. It was back when you could cross the aisle. Now, some Democrats, it will be interesting to see the statements coming out. Of course he'll be praised. But my guess is some might also have some complicated words. Hopefully they don't say them at this time of his death. But he wasn't viewed in the warmest way by some Democrats of this era. But looking at his whole picture, his whole source of his public life here, I do think it's that independent streak in the Senate, at least. That is something that simply rarely exists anymore. In fact, it does not exist.

Now, some would argue the Republican Party has changed even more dramatically under Trump. But, you know, when Joe Lieberman was in the U.S. Senate for years, it was okay to have some conservative positions and it was okay to talk to a, you know, a Republican president about an issue.But that increasingly, I think, has gone away. And I think the party got more liberal than he did over the years. And I'm sure some of the way the Republican Party changed also was not the kind of Republicans that he was used to dealing with as well, which is what I'm sure led him to be part of the No Labels effort because he was uncomfortable with the direction of both parties. So I think he was someone that embodied the idea that being a public servant and being an American patriot meant talking to everyone in the room and not just the people in your own party.

      "sentences": "For many years. First of all, I'm shocked by it, since, as you guys were talking about, he's been so involved in the No Labels stuff and was very vibrant and continued to be a voice in politics. What I remember most about Joe Lieberman, of course, is when he was the first Jewish candidate to run as vice president with Al Gore. And I did a documentary on the, I believe it was the 15th anniversary of Bush versus Gore and spent an awful lot of time with Lieberman, kind of reliving that whole era, which left him very pained, of course, because they ended up losing the race.But when you think about that time and a presidential contest that was effectively decided by, you know, over 500 votes. And Al Gore conceded in a genteel way, and there was no demonstrations and there was no violence. I think that was something that Lieberman was very proud of and reflected his attitude towards the American political system. And his engagement in the future with bipartisanship did not surprise me.",

And even during the campaign, he would not participate in meetings, you know, on Friday, during the Sabbath, Friday evening during the Sabbath, or on Saturday when he was at home observing the Sabbath. So he was very religious, and people adjusted to it during the campaign. They knew that he wouldn't be available at certain times.",
