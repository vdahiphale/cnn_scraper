Israeli forces say they went deeper into Gaza City on Sunday, reaching the outskirts of the Al-Shati refugee camp. and conducting raids in multiple areas. The IDF says it has arrested 20 alleged Hamas members, including some accused of taking part in the October 7th attacks on Israel.Meantime, multiple hospitals in Gaza are closing due to airstrikes and lack of fuel. Health officials and aid agencies say patients, staff and thousands of displaced civilians are trapped inside Gaza's biggest hospital, Al-Shifa, due to fighting nearby. CNN's Nada Bashir has more on the desperate situation in Gaza hospitals and a warning some of the video you are about to see is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): These are the sounds of the final gasps from Gaza's collapsing healthcare system. Medical staff in Gaza City working under near relentless Israeli bombardment for over a month. But now, this chorus of frantic voices, seen here working under torchlight, tells its own gut-wrenching story. The Al Quds hospital, the second largest in Gaza, has now collapsed, the hospital no longer operational, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. But these scenes are all too familiar across the besieged Gaza Strip. The vast majority of hospitals here are already completely out of service, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah says. And those remaining now on a cliff edge. UNKNOWN (through translator): There is a direct injury in the head, internal bleeding, and we can't do surgeries. No surgeries, no oxygen, no electricity. We work manually. We are using a manual resuscitator. It is a clear injury. It needs an urgent surgery, a life-saving one. He is less than a year old. BASHIR (voice-over): Remarkably, this baby survived. But his father, who was in the very same building when an Israeli airstrike hit, did not. At Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa, officials say newborn babies had to be moved and that at least three babies in the neonatal unit died after a generator-powering incubator was damaged in an Israeli strike. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The IDF regularly says it is targeting Hamas. But doctors here say the hospital is now completely surrounded.",

Talked by Israeli cabinet ministers of a new Nakba, a new disaster, you know, essentially the ethnic cleansing that took place in the formation of Israel. All of this has caused Israel to be completely isolated in the world on this issue. When you take a look at what happened in the United Nations General Assembly, resolution calling for a ceasefire was supported by more than 120 countries, only 14 countries. voted with Israel and the United States. The United States was the country that vetoed the resolution, calling for humanitarian pause introduced by Brazil, the same measure that Biden now supports. This has cost Israel tremendously internationally. It is also costing the United States tremendously internationally. Just take a look at the large protests worldwide. This is not just in the Middle East. It's in Latin America. It's in Indonesia. It's in South Africa.

But whatever comes out of San Francisco can only be best described as tactical stabilization, according to many experts, because fundamentally how each side views their own strengths and the other's intentions have not changed. In Washington, China remains perhaps the only bipartisan consensus being viewed as America's menacing strategic competitor. And here Xi Jinping has made clear that the U.S. is out to contain China's rise and suppress Chinese interests. That's why they have to fight back. And that has translated into policy measures, including growing emphasis on self-reliance in key economic sectors, especially in tech, but also expanding counter-espionage efforts that have now impacted foreign, including American businesses and their operations and confidence here, not to mention growing military close encounters in this region with each side blaming the other as the culprit. But that really in a way points to the importance of military-to-military communications to avoid miscalculation or worse. That, of course, has been cut off by the Chinese since last year when then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan. So that's why analysts say the biggest deliverable out of this meeting could be resumption and normalization of such communications at all levels, government-to- government, but also people-to-people, we have seen some positive signs at that front with resumption of more nonstop flights and more American academic and cultural delegations visiting here. Now Xi Jinping, of course, faces a lot less pressure and constraints compared to Biden, but he does have incentives to repair and improve ties as he faces strong economic headwinds at home as well. That's why he may be put on a charm offensive in San Francisco meeting business leaders, meeting his old American friends and as many have suggested, Rosemary, if he really wants to win American hearts and minds, he should consider sending another pair of pandas to the U.S. Rosemary?",

That is now among the growing lists of questions surrounding this federal probe.That's especially in light of some \"New York Times\" reporting in which the outlet cites three different unnamed sources saying that the FBI is now looking into the possibility that Mayor Adams, which was actually Borough president at the time, may have pressured officials at FDNY to sign off on the occupancy of his Manhattan skyscraper that houses that consulate, in spite of some safety issues that were reported at that building. Now, Adams campaign spokesperson today, responding to that reporting, saying that his bureau president at the time, that Adams would routinely hear from some of those constituents about some of those issues, and they would often relay those issues to other city officials, essentially saying that something like that would not be unusual as part of his daily duties. The campaign spokesperson also repeating what we heard on Friday after that information came to light that he had some of his electronic devices seized by federal authorities, that the mayor has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and that he continues to cooperate with federal investigators as they press forward with this public corruption probe.

      "sentences": "The U.S. once again carried out strikes in eastern Syria, targeting facilities used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, marking the third time in three weeks that such strikes have been carried out.This time, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the U.S. targeted a training facility as well as a safe house in eastern Syria used by the IRGC and affiliated groups. This marks the third time in three weeks we've seen the U.S. carry out strikes against the IRGC and its affiliated groups. And that's because of the ongoing attacks the U.S. has seen on its forces in Iraq and Syria. As of the latest update on Thursday, the U.S. has seen about 46 attacks against its forces, mostly drone and rocket attacks, in Iraq and Syria. Those attacks, according to the Pentagon, have resulted in 56 injuries to U.S. forces, mostly minor traumatic brain injuries and minor injuries. It is because of that the U.S. once again felt the need to act, trying to calibrate the response to send the message of deterrence to Iran while also not escalating the situation. Austin called these precise strikes and says they'd been directed by President Joe Biden. We saw the U.S. target weapons and storage facilities over the course of the past several weeks again calibrating those responses to try to avoid a further escalation. The U.S. has been watching very closely what's happening with the conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, but it has tried to separate that from the rest of the region. Still, it hasn't been successful in that effort, as groups affiliated with Iran have continued to carry out attacks on U.S. forces. The U.S. responded to those, trying to send a message to Iran not to attack again. We're also trying to make sure the situation doesn't escalate unnecessarily and the conflict in Gaza spreading farther in the region. Oren Liebermann, CNN in Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
