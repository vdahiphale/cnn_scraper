      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with the race for the White House, entering the final 10-week sprint to Election Day. With both parties conventions now in the history books, Vice President Harris and former President Trump are returning to the campaign trail and setting their sights on their first head to head debate in just over two weeks from now. The Harris campaign is moving on with momentum and a growing pile of cash. More than 26 million TV viewers tuned in to the final night of the Democratic National Convention eclipsing the RNC's closing night. Democrats say they raised more than $7 million during the Vice President's acceptance speech and raked in more than $100 million during the convention. Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, are now looking to build on the surge. They head to the battleground state of Georgia in the coming days for a bus tour and a series of rallies in the Peach State. Meanwhile, her opponent, Donald Trump, attempted to reclaim the spotlight last night as he campaigned in Arizona alongside Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The independent presidential candidate, Kennedy, ended days of speculation as he officially suspended his campaign for the White House and endorsed Trump. What remains unclear is what kind of impact Kennedy's exit will have on the race. CNN's Steve Contorno joining us now. Steve, good to see you. So what do we know about why Kennedy is ending his campaign and throwing his support behind Trump?",

It was sort of a bizarre exit from the race.He also said he was suspending his campaign and all of his campaign activity, but not necessarily ending it, suggesting that if there's some sort of tie in the Electoral College between Vice President Harris and Donald Trump, that maybe he still had an outside chance of being elected president. He also intends to stay on the ballot in about 10 states where people can sort of vote for him as sort of a protest vote between the two candidates. But, look, he is been told by the Trump campaign and Trump has said that RFK Jr. will get some sort of role in a Trump administration if he is elected. So there's clearly some transactional element to this endorsement and Kennedy yesterday talking about what he came to see in Donald Trump had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.

I'm not convinced that this will make the difference.Now, remember, and I know all your guests and all your interviews, we're all saying in a close race, any sliver will make a difference.

There might be some room to move on that way, make it about his issue and not about him. I think we saw the first sign of that from the Harris campaign when they said in the statement that what -- that we can welcome you into the party and there is a capacity. I mean, the thing for all the voters to remember, whatever RFK was talking about is going to take Congress to happen. Even if he were in charge, you're not going to just with the snap of a finger close down the, you know, Food and Drug Administration. So the aspects of some things he cares about may be addressed. I don't think when you get into vaccination denial, though, that there is a lot -- you know, on that issue, there may not be a lot of room to maneuver, but the appeal to the libertarians might be come from independent voices. [12:10:09] You know, Oprah, when she spoke at the convention said she's an independent. Maybe, maybe there's a way of retooling the democracy and freedom themes that came out of the democratic convention to say for this time, you know, that's what this election is really about. And even though we differ on policy, we still should not, you know, prosecute the case that Trump should not be in the White House. You know, if you're Harris, or if you're Trump, you say that I promised to put RFK in there to get it done. But here's where Trump's steps on his message, creating a commission to study assassinations, I don't think it's a message that resonates with anyone who it is about hit the attempt on his own life, which was terrible a month ago just before his assassination and then bringing back the assassination on, you know, certainly of JFK and Bobby Kennedy.",

Tropical storm warnings in effect for the Big Island, but we now have a hurricane watch for the coast there where we're worried about some hurricane force winds. You've got some tropical storm watches for some of the rest of the islands as well as we kind of get side swiped by the winds and the heavy rain. Flood watches in effect for up 6 inches to 10 inches of rain possible on the big island of Hawaii. You've got to remember when it comes to the Big Island here, it's a massive volcano. So a lot of this rain is also driven by the terrain here. So especially on that east side of the terrain is where we could find some of that heavy rain, some landslides, mudslides possible in some of those heaviest downpours because again, these islands are pretty mountainous. We do have some drought conditions in effect for all of these islands here in Hawaii. 73 percent of the island has some drought conditions, so they need the rain. The problem with the drought conditions now, when you get the tropical storm force winds, is we have red flag warnings in effect. This is, you know, kind of what happened last year with the wildfire situations. When you get gusts over 50 miles per hour with some dry ground there, some dry air on the backside of this hurricane, that's where you get some problems.

He served on both the White House COVID Task Force and as President Biden's chief medical adviser during COVID. Let me bring in now Dr. Carlos del Rio. Dr., good to see you. So how might Dr. Fauci have contracted this virus? DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, EXEC. ASSOCIATE DEAN, EMORY UNIV. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT GRADY HEALTH SYSTEM: Hello, Fred. It's good to be with you. West Nile is now the most common mosquito borne illness in the United States. The virus of West Nile, it's a cousin of the virus that causes Zika, that causes dengue, that causes yellow fever and it is the most common mosquito transmitted infection in the United States. Climate change has changed what -- where mosquitoes live. You know, we have longer summers, shorter winters. And talking to Dr. Fauci, he told me he thinks he got it in his backyard. There's mosquitoes that growing there and he hadn't trouble anywhere and it's probably in his backyard in D.C. where he got infected.

Nothing happens.Then there's about a percentage of people 10 percent to 20 percent who get a rash, maybe fever, headache, they feel bad, but that's about it. But there's a small percentage of individuals that get what we call neuro invasive disease, in which they develop essentially a meningitis or an encephalitis from West Nile. And those are the people that end up in the hospital. That's, you know, very similar to what happened to Dr. Fauci. And people that get neuro invasive disease, first of all, they have a long term -- a long time recovery. Many of them, you know, have trouble recovering, but about 10 percent of them actually die. So once you get neuro invasive disease, it's a pretty bad disease, and the problem is that we really don't have antivirals or any medications in the hospital.

He's been charged with concealment of the body. And the woman who is missing is his wife, Mamta Kafle Bhatt. She's 28 years old. And as you said, Fred, she's been missing for nearly a month. Now, we have the timeline of the last time she was seen by her friends. It was on July 27th that she was last seen by her friends. On the 28th she spoke with a friend. On the 30th she is the last seen by her husband at the dinner table, but it is not until August 5th that her husband reports her missing.

And I want to just read to you from some of the documents which we -- which we have reviewed, detailing what they found inside that house. They said that there was a substantial amount of digital and forensic evidence that was consistent with a death. They said after completing the search warrant, they found what appeared to be blood pooling and blood splatter in the home's main bedroom. They also have evidence that Naresh Bhatt purchased a set of three knives. Two of the knives have yet to be recovered. And that a few days later, he was at a local Walmart purchasing cleaning supplies. Now, although he has not been charged with murder, at this stage, he is expected to be back in court on Monday.

A jury could find you guilty, you could face life.And so balancing the weight of the evidence and -- and making that assessment about the likelihood of -- of prosecutors being successful at the end of the day with two cooperating witnesses who were defendants at one time, that is going to be a serious discussion about whether or not to take that plea deal to limit the amount of time that would ultimately be served. So those are all the factors thinking about this weekend.",

ANDREW YOUNG, FORMER ATLANTA MAYOR: Everything that's happening here is laid on the groundwork of a very quiet, sweet, wonderful, powerful man who even when he wasn't talking or preaching or even praying.

And behind me, as you mentioned, that ceremony is wrapping up, you can see that 12-foot bronze statue of the late John Lewis with his hands over his heart adjuster. He frequently used to express his love for others. And it's standing in front of the historic Decatur courthouse.And it's in this district where Lewis served for 17 consecutive terms. Nearly two years ago, sculptor, Basil Watson, was chosen to design and create this statue, and the significance really can't be understated. Early on in this process, the memorial was billed as providing a symbol of inclusivity, equality and justice to replace a Confederate monument, which was erected in the early 1900s to glorify the so called Lost Cause. Now Lewis, who was the son of sharecroppers, survived a brutal beating by police during the landmark 1965 march in Selma, Alabama, and went on to become a leader of the civil rights movement. Georgia's -- Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, spoke about that march in Selma and the impact it had on the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): Somehow, when he crossed that bridge, by some stroke of grace mingled with human resilience, he crossed the bridge and built the bridge at the same time. And today, all of us are standing on the other side of that bridge. REP. NIKEMA WILLIAMS (D-GA): This statue today is a reminder of the courage and the love that it takes to face arrest dozens of times in the pursuit of dignity for human rights for all. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
