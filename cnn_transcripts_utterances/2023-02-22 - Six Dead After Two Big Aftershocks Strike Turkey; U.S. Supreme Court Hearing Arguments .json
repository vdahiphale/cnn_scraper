It's one of the largest of the tent cities -- camps here in the city where there are about 3,500 people currently being sheltered in this particular camp. And you can see here they've set up stations for people to come and get food -- to have their dinner and breakfast and lunch -- all served here.There's also, as you mentioned, a center just away from where we are now where they are providing care for children. So there are activities, little education classes, a cinema room. But crucially, they're also providing psychosocial support for children, but also to the parents who have been through so, so much. And you can see the expanse of this camp. This is one of the larger ones in Iskenderun. This is one of the provinces among the hardest hit by the earthquake two weeks ago. And as you mentioned, that significant aftershock on Monday was, of course, a huge concern and fear for so many in this city and across southeast Turkey. Now if you just look around here -- I mean, it is very vast. This is one of the larger camps. But there are smaller ones dotted around and we were actually at one of (audio gap) a Syrian man who has already been displaced from the war in Syria and now he is homeless here. Take a listen.

That they were struggling to find food. That their loved ones and their children were sleeping out in the cold at night.Now, the Turkish government has responded. They said they are trying to provide further support. Some 6,000 tents -- an additional 6,000 tents are being sent over to the affected areas following Monday's powerful aftershock. But everyone is still waiting for news of loved ones and family members in the hospital. This is a hugely difficult time and this is a process that is going to take months if not years. They have a long way ahead and for these families it is -- it is difficult to imagine what they are going through in having to relieve those aftershocks on a daily basis -- Christine.",

JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Every other industry has to internalize the costs of its conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear. On the other hand -- I mean, we're a court. We really don't know about these things. You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet.

Norfolk Southern creating a million-dollar fund for Ohio residents after the toxic train derailment in their town. That $1 million seems like a lot -- it isn't for Norfolk Southern. It's not even a rounding error on the billions it gave back to shareholders last year -- $4 billion in stock buybacks. Norfolk Southern passing along its profits to investors.Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets ended down. Europe is lower. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now basically flat trying to find their footing after a tough day yesterday. Home Depot and Walmart forecasts raised concerns a resilient American consumer today may grow weary later this year. Worst day for the Dow and the S&amp;P since December 15. The Nasdaq down 2 1/2 percent. Gas prices were flat overnight at $3.40 a gallon. And on the housing front, home sales fell for the 12th month in a row, though home prices nationally rose a bit. The housing market is where the Fed's rate hikes have been most noticeable in the -- in slowing the U.S. economy. The minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting is due out later today. All right, let's bring in economic analyst at the Morning Consult, Kayla Bruun. So nice to see you, Kayla. The housing market is cooling. Mortgage rates have doubled. Sales are falling a lot, but prices are only slowing a little. What's your -- I guess, what's your take on what's happening in housing? KAYLA BRUUN, ECONOMIC ANALYST, MORNING CONSULT (via Webex by Cisco): So, good morning. Thank you so much for having me back. You're right. We have the housing report for existing home sales out yesterday, which really makes up the bigger part of the market. And while demand has come way down -- it's down about 37 percent year- over-year and it fell again in January, which some were expecting a bit of a rebound. So on the demand side it's looking very, very weak. But as I mentioned, with existing home sales being such a big part of the market that also relies on sellers coming into the market and adding to supply. And supply remains very, very tight. So the fact that when all these buyers are dropping out, a lot of them are also sellers. So sellers have dropped out of the market at almost about the same pace and that's really restricting supply, which has been a bit undersupplied for years, really. It's been a chronic issue.",

You're just going to sit on that cheap mortgage if you can. I think that's one of the reasons why you don't have a lot of supply.You know, the evidence seems to be, Kayla, that inflation is peaking -- still too high, but peaking.

For one thing, we have the strong jobs report, which that's good news. That's underlying strength in the economy. But it also continues to put upward pressure on wages, which feed into prices in turn. And it's a sign that the interest rate increases haven't really cooled the economy quite the way the Fed is expecting it will need to in order to target those price increases and slow down price growth.Then the Consumer Price Index -- the CPI report that we've seen so far this month -- that came in a little stronger than expected. Topline inflation is slowing but there were some upside risks in there in some of the categories that Powell is watching. So I'll be curious what he says later today but I do think that there's a bit more pressure on the Fed given the latest economic data.",
