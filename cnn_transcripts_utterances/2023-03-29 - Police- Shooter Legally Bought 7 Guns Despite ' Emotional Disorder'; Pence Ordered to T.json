They only got a few days' notice. They didn't even get to actually travel, her brother, from California here to Baltimore to attend in person for that hearing the appellate courts they agreed with him, and they said that he deserves that right.So essentially, what the appellate court is saying is that this hearing needs to be redone and gave the -- both sides about 60 days to kind of set a date to figure out how they're going to move forward with that. And if you're wondering, how is that not double jeopardy for Adnan Syed? Well, essentially, the appellate court is saying it's not infringing on his rights or violating double jeopardy, essentially saying, because he's not being re-prosecuted in this case. He could go back to this hearing and again get his conviction vacated. Or he might be put back behind bars, depending how the judges rule.",

They said that \"Ensuring justice for Hae Min Lee does not require injustice for Adnan. The appeal was not about Adnan's innocence but about notice and mootness.\" So that really gets to the core of what they're saying: Why do we have to do this all again? '",

He said he plans to take the next two months to decide whether or not will run, which is interesting. Because Chris Christie and Donald Trump used to be friends. He was even Trump's debate coach.
