We're off 220 points. We need to analyze whether this is a justifiable fall bearing in mind what they have said on the Fed. Rates did rise by the way, in case you were wondering, by half a percentage point. the markets and how they are trading and the event of the day of which everyone is talking. The Fed is slowing the pace of rate rises, and it signals that rates could top more than five percent next year. President Biden is hosting African leaders as part of the US push to build economic ties and fend off both Russian and Chinese influences. And Morocco, fighting to stay in this World Cup after France took an early lead. We'll update you every step of the way as we move forward. We are live at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, December 14th. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. The US Federal Reserve has ended its streak of jumbo rate rises of 75 basis points, three-quarters of a percent. In the last hour, it has announced that it was raising rates by half a percentage point. Now, that in itself would have been a considerable amount in days gone by. However, in this new environment, it breaks the streak of four consecutive three-quarter point rate rises. As data is showing, US inflation has cooled or at least is off the top. Peak inflation has been seen some people seem to think. The Chair of the Fed Jerome Powell is speaking at the moment. While he has been speaking, of course, the markets dropped quite sharply. If you look at the way the markets trade, we are now off on all three major indices, with the largest losses being as against the NASDAQ, and the markets had been higher before the decision. So we need to understand why they took this decision in such poor odor. Well, the Fed has signaled it would raise rates next year to higher than previous projections. Remember our famous dot-plots. The dot-plot shows where the Committee members think interest rates are going to go. Now, if you look at the dot-plot before September, you can see more clearly there, they were all saying the dot-plot had it under five percent. They did not believe rates would go beyond five percent next year, and that was all of them. Now, it's all but certain. Look at this year's dot-plot or this month dot-plot, this quarters and you see only two participants just at the top of the range, the rest are all in there, with some going in excess of five-and-a-half percent. There was also a cutting growth projections from 1.2 to half a percent. In other words, you're getting very close to recession. When you're only growing by half a percent, it is only between a cut and a slit before you do fall negative. The Chair Jay Powell said its policy remains restrictive until inflation has been crushed.
