I'm going to get out of your way immediately, because you can see that there are the first responders still out there who right now we believe are taking away the body of the one victim who was killed in this ramming attack that took place earlier this evening here. And you're absolutely right. It's right on the promenade here in Tel Aviv.And there's some social media video out there of that car that you see there as well, that's now laying there, overturned, just racing down that promenade at some point, getting off course and then flipping over several times before just coming down on its roof. The latest that we have from the authorities here is that there are seven people who were injured in this, four of them being tourists three, as you mentioned, come from the United Kingdom, and one is from Italy. Some of them are moderately injured, and some of them lightly injured. Some actually tried to flee to a hotel in the area to seek help. But as you can see, this is a wide cordon here now in the center of Tel Aviv, there's a lot of ambulances, obviously a lot of police cars here, as investigators are obviously still working the scene here as well, and probably will be for a long time to come. Right now this is still extremely fresh. So far, it's unclear who exactly is behind all of this, but certainly, obviously, a devastating event. And as you were mentioning, Jake, obviously, it comes on a day of so much violence here in Israel where you also have that other attacks that you were speaking about as well with those two women who were killed when apparently their car was shot at and then crashed to the driver of that car, who was the mother of the two women who were killed, also severely wounded and severely injured in that incident as well. So as you can see a dramatic day here coming to a close. And a lot of people as you can imagine here on the scene standing around me who were absolutely shocked by some of the things that they witnessed here tonight, Jake.",

So according to our sources, Jake, this state department after action report has far more findings and recommendations in it than the document that was put out yesterday from the White House. And according to our sources, who have either seen this report or have been described the report, they say that there are 34 recommendations in total. And they're very specific. They talk about doing things such as putting a single official in charge when there are the complex crisis situations like this or standing up a red team to challenge assumptions that are being made.These are things that the Biden administration did not do during the Afghanistan withdrawal and recommendations for how it could have gone better. Now, in contrast, that White House document that was put out yesterday does cite some lessons learned such as prioritizing earlier evacuations. But what it really does is dwells on the decisions that were made during the Trump administration and says that those decisions that were made such as striking a deal with the Taliban to get out the U.S. completely from the country, drawing down U.S. troops in the country, severely constrained what President Biden was able to do. And so, there's a disconnect between these two reports that NSC is saying that they are simply separate reports, that the one from the White House was drawing on certain parts of the State Department report but it wasn't mirroring it.",

And as we covered in August 2021, he secretly flew to Kabul during the frenzied U.S. evacuation back then with Congressman Seth Moulton. Congressman, good to see you. So, you call the White House report on withdrawal, you call it shameful, you call it a craven whitewash of events. Tell us why. PETER MEIJER, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (R) MICHIGAN: Oh, it's a political documentary, plain and simple. This was the Biden administration's attempt to basically shift blame back onto the Trump administration for what happened under the Biden administration's watch in response to the hearings that are taking place on Capitol Hill with the now Republican majority finally scrutinizing the withdrawal operation. I mean, that was -- I served in 117th Congress while this was occurring, and the Democratic majority refused to probe deeply, refused to ask the tough questions of the State Department, of the Biden administration in terms of how this withdrawal went so catastrophically wrong. And finally, there are those questions being asked and the White House felt they needed to respond. And they put this report out as a political document and nothing more.",

So he may have been constrained by the troop numbers, there were 2,500 American service members in country by the time the Biden ministration took office. But he changed the deadline from May 1 to September 11th and then realize the political optics of that were bad, so moved back to August 31.But frankly, again, I'm not going to say that the Trump administration set the Biden administration up for success. But the Biden administration executed the withdrawal and it happened on their watch. And the fact that nobody in this administration takes responsibility for it, there has been no one who has resigned or suffered any negative consequences from a career standpoint because of this, it's shameful. That hasn't been the case in other NATO countries. And it just shows how desperately this administration wants to leave Afghanistan in the rear-view mirror.",

And I think he's trying to tack to the center a little bit. In the meantime, there are three big areas where he's done that and we see, often see, incumbent presidents do that when they're setting up a reelection campaign. The first is on immigration, he's embraced some tougher immigration enforcement measures at the border, angering members of his own party. He also recently approved an oil drilling project in Alaska, which climate activists were very upset about. And of course, the most high profile one was when he ended up signing that Republican led resolution on the DC Criminal Code, which not only blindsided Democrats, but frustrated many of them because, you know, it really showed a rift within the party.

But the idea that just because Harlan Crow, the wealthy Republican donor doesn't have a specific case before the court can't possibly be trying to influence the court with all of these lavish trips is absurd on its face. And I think the spirit of the law really speaks to that.

She said that she was struck twice and it hit her shoulder that one of the punches grace her face, and that campus police had to bring her to a separate room. Now in speaking with the Turning Point USA spokesperson, he wasn't physically there but spoke to three members who were in the room. He said that this was actually a very civil discussion.The event itself went on peacefully, even though the room was full of people who both agreed with and disagreed with Gaines, that there was constructive debate and that this disruption happened as the event was wrapping up. He said he was texting with Gaines as she was locked in a computer room with campus police as protesters were at the door. And that he said it took a couple of hours, eventually for San Francisco police to come and disperse the crowd and escort Gaines out of there. Of course, she's been very outspoken on this issue since she tied for fifth place in the 2022 NCAA swimming and diving championships with its transgender swimmer Lia Thomas in the 200 yard freestyle competition. Clearly a very heated topic about transwomen's participation in women's sports.
