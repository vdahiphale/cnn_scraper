The public trials, according to state media in revolutionary courts began over the weekend and are continuing. One Iranian official telling state media that they were hoping that these will be speedy trials. Some of those on trial right now will be facing very serious charges including killing members of the security forces, attempting to destabilize the country and overthrow the regime, destruction of public property, so the expectation is that many will be facing the death penalty. And we are talking about a country that has a very high rate of executions, a country that for years has been criticized by human rights organizations for its flawed judicial system, for not providing people with fair trials. Human rights organizations also accused them of extracting confessions in many cases under torture. So, a lot of concern for those who will be standing trial right now. And the fear is that the government, the regime will be using this to try and make an example of those protesters to try and deter people from taking part in these ongoing protests. Over the past nearly seven weeks now, the regime has used everything that is used in the past to try and crush protests, whether it is the brutal crackdown that we have seen taking place on the streets, the arrests, the beatings, the use of live fire, according to human rights organizations, as well as the most severe warning to date that we heard over the weekend coming from the hand of the feared Revolutionary Guards, telling protesters that Saturday was their last day and an ultimatum telling them that they should not come back out to the streets. Despite all of this, despite these trials, people are still defiant, they are still taking to the streets.
