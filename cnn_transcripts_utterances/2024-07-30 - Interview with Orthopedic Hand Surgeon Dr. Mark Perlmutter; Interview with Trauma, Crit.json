Well, this spring, two American doctors made the treacherous journey intoGaza to try and offer their services in this desperate situation, but what they found was far worse than they had expected. As they recently wrote for \"Politico,\" \"What we saw was unspeakable.\" Doctors Mark Perlmutter and Feroze Sidhwa joined the program to relay what they witnessed and the urgent need for an end to the violence. Doctors, welcome to the program. Thank you so much for taking the time. We should note that both of you volunteered at the Gaza European Hospital and in Khan Younis for two weeks at the end of March into early April and have a combined 57 years of volunteering in disaster and war zone. So, we should commend you for your humanitarian aid all of these years, especially now. Let me start with you, Dr. Perlmutter. What surprised you most or stood out to you in terms of what you saw during your time there in Gaza? DR. MARK PERLMUTTER, ORTHOPEDIC HAND SURGEON:  Retrospectively, what surprised me most was not the anticipated effect of a 2,000-pound or a 500- pound American bomb being dropped on a tent, city bombs that were designed for busting bunkers in Afghanistan, but rather how the carnage that was induced really focused on children, healthcare workers, and journalists, those that were the most innocent, those that provided care, and those that would report to the world the accuracy of the carnage were specifically targeted.",

We found children -- many workers found children, not just myself, that had high velocity bullet wounds, sniper bullet wounds, rifle wounds that were dead center in the chest. I mentioned to other reporters that I couldn't put my stethoscope more dead center over a heart than the entrance bullet hole was. There was no back to these children. The bullet had removed their entire torso. There was similar bullet hole in two of the children's temples. So, they were shot twice. Once was certainly a kill shot. The second one was when they were on the ground. And so, no sniper hits a child, and I'm talking toddlers twice by mistake. And so -- and that finding was duplicated by many healthcare workers that children were specifically targeted by high velocity rifle bullet wounds. And then, there was a plethora of health care workers with horrible stories of being specifically targeted. And then, of course, journalists were either assassinated, not allowed back into the country, or had their equipment destroyed.",

If -- even if she does manage to survive, she's going to be permanently disabled for the rest of her life. And she's just one of thousands and thousands of kids who are hurt this way.

The Israeli officials say they've allowed the delivery of more than 600,000 tons of food and supplies. Dr. Perlmutter, when you hear those numbers and counter them with what you actually see on the ground, where is the disconnect? Are these supplies just not getting to where they need to go? DR. PERLMUTTER:  Well, I think they're being as dishonest as Netanyahu was when he spoke to our Congress. When we were there, we ran out of the supplies that we had brought within our first week. I personally brought 700 pounds of orthopedic supplies and dressing changes, and Dr. Sidhwa brought even more. And there were no supplies when we got there. The supplies that we bought were exhausted by the end of our first week. And in fact, many of the hospitals were transferring patients into the European Gaza Hospital where we were working because they ran out of supplies. So, driving in, we saw hundreds of trucks piling up at the border, waiting to get in. When we got out of -- through the Rafah Crossing, we saw thousands of trucks, side by side, end to end, waiting to get in. And this is when the Rafah Border was still open. They just were not allowed in. They had Oxfam, United -- I'm sorry, the -- universally recognized relief groups, names on the sides of the trucks that were not allowed in. Tankers of water and healthcare aides. It just was not delivered. They're being dishonest.",

Currently, the rules are that you cannot bring any medical supplies in. Nobody is allowed in the country now to volunteer if you have any Palestinian history in your family your grandparents or your parents were Palestinian and you were born in America, you're not allowed in as a volunteer. You cannot bring supplies in that are more than your personal supplies. You cannot bring any medical supplies.

And that represents 2.5 percent of Gaza's health care force. That's one out of every 40 people that works in health care in Gaza. So, it's a massive blow. A lot more have fled. Actually, the director of the hospital that we worked at had fled just before we got there because he was constantly threatened by the Israelis. And in fact, every hospital -- every departmental director in the -- at European Hospital showed us text messages that they had from the Israelis threatening them, telling them to leave, telling them that we're going to get you just like we got Shifa.

He was in the operating room, closing a wound after a surgery when an Israeli soldier came into another hospital, not the one we were working in. This is a hospital that was already occupied by the IDF. They ordered him to abandon the patient who he was closing the wound on. He refused to do so. So, he was shot in the knee. His proximal tibia bone or his shin bone was sent across the room. He was obviously unconscious from that assault. He was then operated on. He recovered the next day, consciousness. The next day, he was taken prisoner by the Israelis and taken into Israel to an Israeli prison. He was handcuffed. He was blindfolded for 45 days. He received absolutely no wound care. He was fed a juice box by his report to me, sometimes every day, mostly every other day. And then, on the 45th day, after they discovered that he wasn't Hamas, they let him go by dumping him on the side of the road on the other side of the border. He crawled for three kilometers. His wound is now horribly infected. As a goodbye present, they gave him a rifle butt in his right eye. They blew out his globe, meaning that he's blind forever.

The area is a populous part of Beirut and a stronghold of the Iran-backed group. Correspondent Ben Wedeman is in Beirut and joins us now.

Now, according to the state-run national news agency, this was a drone strike involving three missiles. There are reports that it hit a residential building, and there are reports of casualties. Now, this is definitely the most significant escalation since the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah and other militias here in Lebanon since the 8th of October. And certainly, what we know is that Hezbollah has made it clear that they will meet escalation, which -- with escalation, which is the terms they use. Essentially, they've always maintained that a strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut for them is a red line and they will respond accordingly. Now, we don't know specifically. We've seen the statements from the Israeli side talking about, you know, it's a major leader within Hezbollah, but we have yet to see any details about who might have been the actual target. I've tried to contact sources in Hezbollah at the moment, they're not answering. But certainly, this raises tensions, really skyrockets the tensions at the moment.

Of course, CNN cannot confirm this. This is just reporting from Amos Harel of Haaretz who we frequently have on for this very subject matter. I am wondering, Kim, there, as we noted, had been an anticipatory response. The United States had given that warning, obviously, the Lebanese to their citizens as well. Just a matter of what that response would look like. If this is it, and again, this is just within the last few minutes. So, we have no idea whether there will be more.

Is it going to be a multi-day targeted operation? Is it going to be one long night of airstrikes? We simply don't know. What we do know is that all sides expected that this would happen. The Israelis made clear they were going to retaliate. I think messages have been passed on to Hezbollah, most likely through envoys, the U.S., et cetera, saying, this is going to happen, and messages to the Lebanese government to pass on to Hezbollah for their response then to be restrained as well. So, that, as I said, it remains somewhat contained. But this is a very dangerous moment, because you can choreograph these things or try to choreograph, you can telegraph intentions, but these are not war games. This is real-life.",

But the dangers are humongous. And the impact on civilians everywhere remains, you know, terrifying. Every time we have these moments where we step closer to the brink, it's going to become harder to step back and contain it.

The children and young people who were killed that day were not actually Israeli citizens, but there have been calls, of course, from within Israel to use that moment to deal with the problem of Hezbollah. This is all in the context of a devastating war in Gaza, of course, which has been going on for 10 months and thousands of people have been killed and, you know, Gaza lays in ruins. Now, there has been -- there have been these border clashes between Hezbollah and Israel since October 8th. Hezbollah said that they were doing this in support of Hamas. And as you pointed out, they've insisted that they will not stop until the war in Gaza comes to an end. The contours of a deal between Lebanon and Israel, and by extension Hezbollah, to bring this to an end on the border are known, but they remain conditional on an end of hostilities, a cessation of firing, a ceasefire, whatever we want to call it in Gaza, and Hezbollah has not backed down from that. What happened on Saturday, I think, was a tragic accident. There are different interpretations of what may have happened. We heard even from Israeli military sources that they think it was an errant Hezbollah rocket. Because Hezbollah had no real reason to want to kill Druze Arabs on Syrian territory because it does not suit their interest in Lebanon, where they're trying to repair frayed ties with the Druze community and also with the Druze community in Syria itself. But that goes to the point of what I'm saying, you can manage and try to contain and play by rules of engagement. And at some point, something's going to go wrong. And inevitably, civilians die, and that's the tragic thing about where we are today. It's fine to talk about these things as, you know, geopolitics and diplomacy, but the consequences for the people on the ground in Gaza, in Israel, in Syria, in Lebanon are tremendous. I want to remind your viewers that Lebanon's been through a lot over the last four years. We're coming up on the fourth anniversary of the Beirut port explosion of 2020 on the 4th of August. The largest -- one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in modern history. So, there's a lot of layers of trauma in Lebanon that people are dealing with, and nerves are fraying. And nobody wants to see more of this. So, it's really time for diplomacy, for focused diplomacy and pressure on leaders in power on both sides to try to get to this deal so this region can get on a slightly more positive trajectory.",

But certainly, if I look around me, the amount of traffic seems to have diminished significantly. As Kim was saying, there has been anticipation of this strike ever since the events in the Golan Heights on Saturday evening. But certainly, the expectation was the strike would happen perhaps very, very late at night rather than sometime just before 8:00 p.m. in the evening local time. Now, we shall see if this is going to affect the amount of planes flying into Beirut. Air France announced today that it was resuming flights. That might change. But others, for instance, like Lufthansa, have postponed flights in and out of Beirut until August 5th. Now, we're waiting for some sort of comment from the Lebanese government, but when I spoke to the Lebanese foreign minister the other day, he did underscore that even though they speak regularly with senior members of Hezbollah, that Hezbollah is -- largely does what it wants to do, and the government itself is largely helpless in determining the course of events when it comes to Hezbollah's actions.

And what we've seen, certainly this summer, is that a huge number of Lebanese from the diaspora have come that it's been a fairly good summer for tourism in Lebanon despite all of this, but now, I think, you know, the mood is going to change dramatically since, as Kim noted, this was the first strike on Beirut since the 2nd of January, this year, when a Hamas leader was assassinated by the Israelis. So, this is going to definitely change the mood in the city from one of, sort of, we've seen it all, what can -- what else can happen to now, it's getting serious. And I think people who, since October, have been talking about perhaps stocking up on supplies, on fuel, I think that talk is going to resume again with the fear that this isn't a one-off strike, that indeed Hezbollah will strike back in one form or another. Now, I've noted, I've seen that there are reports that Hezbollah is claiming that this Israeli attack failed in assassinating a senior member of Hezbollah.

Of course, the trouble is, right, they don't know each side's red lines here and they also don't know how far each side is willing to push up close to those red lines. You'll remember that yesterday when the Lebanese foreign minister spoke to our colleague Ben Wedeman, he said that their understanding of what a limited response by Israel would be, would mean no attack on the Beirut airport or the Beirut suburbs. Now, you have a strike inside Beirut itself, on a Hezbollah stronghold, still not clear whether it was a successful strike, regardless, it's one right in the middle of quite an urban area there. So, now, the question becomes, how does Hezbollah read this and how does it react? And the trouble with escalation scenarios, right, is that you don't quite know how each party, each player is going to react and how each will read the other side's intentions here. But listen, this is a strike in an urban area, possibly a deadly strike, not clear if it got its target, but in what was already a volatile mix of factors here, this is yet one more spark, and it -- we'll have to watch very closely how the parties respond to this, but it's a dangerous -- it's a dicey time there.",

      "sentences": "Thank you for having me. Look, we've all been expecting Israeli retaliation. Theypromised it. They've now delivered it. I think this was, at least, in my perspective, perhaps a bit more escalatory than even I was anticipating. The Israelis have said this is the end of their response, now shifting the onus back to Hezbollah. And the Israelis are no doubt poised and preparing for a Hezbollah response. The question becomes how full-throated is that response? And a lot will depend on who the individual was that was targeted. Clearly, a provocative act to go after the Hezbollah Shura (ph) Council right in the heart of the southern suburbs of Beirut, Hezbollah stronghold. There are some rumors floating around that this could be Fuad Shukr, involved closely with Hezbollah military operations, including somebody linked all the way back to the Beirut barracks bombings in the early 1980s. So, high-ranking, we just don't know yet. The rumor mill is swirling. And I think the region again on edge, anticipating a Hezbollah response.",

And I would agree with Colin that in the realm of possible retaliatory strikes, this one appears to be fairly aggressive. And again, you know, inside an urban area at senior leadership. So, it's a dangerous time and we have to factor that in, and this seems to be pushing the limits to some degree. The other point I would make, Bianna, is that be conscious of the political support for military action in Lebanon, in Israel. I was in Northern Israel in the weeks and days following October 7th, and as you know, still to this day, many tens of thousands of Israelis, they've been forced to flee south. They still can't go back to their homes because of the level of fire in the north. It's just not considered safe there. And when I asked folks then, and I still ask them now, should the Israeli military go into Southern Lebanon? And their answer, and you hear this from residents and you hear this from officials, is that it's not a matter of if, but when. You know, they use this language, finish the job against Hezbollah. So, you do have a well of political support for military action there, even knowing, you know, the severe, severe risks of broadening this conflict. And that's for something, right, Bianna, that would be a major ground incursion as opposed to an isolated strike like this. So, there's political support in Israel for something bigger. And listen, you know, the region is watching this very closely.",

And, Colin, I mean, that goes back to the earlier point made by the defense minister to target a tougher, much larger, morepowerful enemy before going into Gaza, where now we're entering 10 months of fighting there. There may be support among Israelis and the war cabinet to now turn and enter a new front here. But is there enough bandwidth among the IDF, among the resources that Israel now has at its disposal, knowing that a large part of that will likely have to come, once again, from allies, including the U.S.?",
