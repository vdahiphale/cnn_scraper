Of course, the opposite happened.And now, Donald Trump's campaign is really trying to keep as much attention as possible on Biden's lackluster debate performance and capitalize on it, including both politically and financially, as they head into a critical next few weeks. And look, we kind of saw this play out over the weekend. Many of Donald Trump's top surrogates were spanning the airwaves trying to keep the momentum up from the debate. It was actually a pretty stark contrast to watching Democrats who were trying to dismiss and explain away some of what happened with Biden's performance over the weekend. Take a listen to what Trump surrogates were saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  He's a decent man. He's a failed president. He is compromised. That's the storyline here.",

At 10:00 a.m. we're going to see the Supreme Court deliver their final rulings of this period, including this massive blockbuster decision on whether or not Donald Trump had \"full immunity\" while president. That's likely to very much upend this rhetoric around how wonderful Donald Trump did at the debate. We're also, of course, looking ahead to next week. He has his sentencing on July 11 -- another crucial date that could really change a lot of his candidacy. And then, of course, also, he has the convention later this month. But hanging around all of this is also when Donald Trump is going to announce who his vice-presidential pick is, and that's something that I'm told Donald Trump's team is kind of reserving to -- a card they're going to play when they know they need another distraction as well. All of these moments are also key fundraising moments for them as well. So this is likely to change as early as today -- this celebratory rhetoric from the Republicans -- John.",

You just heard Congressman -- no, Matt Bennett, not Matt Gorman. You just heard Congressman Jamie Raskin talking about the fact there are serious discussions going on. What discussions? Give us a window as to the discussions that are happening right now among members and among serious Democrats this morning. MATT BENNETT, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND CO- FOUNDER, THIRD WAY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY ASSISTANT, CLINTON ADMINISTRATION (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, it's just undeniable. We've been hearing it all weekend that people are really worried because the debate performance was obviously extraordinarily bad. All first -- all presidents have bad first debates -- all of them going way back -- but this was about the worst that we can remember. And so, it did trigger a lot of discussion. Obviously, a lot in the press and then a lot private among Democrats about what to do. If the president continues, I think there is unanimity among Democrats that he needs to be extraordinarily aggressive -- much more aggressive than he has been by getting out in front of the public. Doing town hall meetings with voters. Doing sit-downs with reports. Doing television interviews. Doing press conferences. He needs to prove that was one bad night and not a pattern. And so far, at least, we just don't know which it is. And I think that is what is triggering a lot of conversation among Democrats today.",

There's no one to blame other than President Biden for his poor debate performance. It wasn't just one bad night. I think that this follows a trend that we've seen of his diminishing decline.

So it is -- it would be an extraordinary political feat to try to get in the race and figure out how to shove aside the vice president in just a couple of weeks.And the other I think that's important to remember is we -- political obsessives -- people who watch this show every morning -- of course, they know who all these other candidates are, but a lot of voters don't.

I mean, I saw and heard from actual human beings over the last three days, and I know we all have. And this is something that everyone is talking about. But there is an interesting phenomenon here. While you do hear I think universal concern and shock about President Biden's debate performance, it's not clear to me that there is this wave of people saying and also, Donald Trump was great or also I'm switching to Trump because of this. It's not clear to me exactly where or if or how he gains. MATTHEWS:  I think that a lot of voters watched that debate and were just even more depressed about the current state of affairs because they are not happy with their options. People did not want this rematch. I think the only people who probably wanted this rematch are Joe Biden and Donald Trump's teams because I think that they believe that they can defeat the other opponent because they I think respectively know that other candidates are each pretty weak. And so, as I've talked with voters who are just everyday Americans who maybe aren't tuning in and watching the news 24/7, and they were pretty alarmed when they saw what Biden's appearance looked like on that debate stage. I think everyone knows that he's old, but just to see him on that debate stage struggling, it was sad for a lot of people. And I do think that the couch caucus grew much larger after that debate performance because I think there are going to be a lot of people who think I can't vote for either of these guys. Because they watched Trump go up there and just lie as often as he breathes and refused three times to say that he would accept the results of the 2024 election. And they think a) I can't vote for that guy. But then they watched Joe Biden and thought um, he might not be up to the job of serving another four years. And so, I think there are going to be a lot of people who leave the top of their ballots blank and who maybe just sit at home and don't even take part in the election after last -- after last Thursday.",

The structure is changing just a little bit.And you can see where it got a little bit cloudy overnight, but it's starting to clear up again. And that's telling us that it's gaining intensity and could come back up to the category 4 status. We are watching it closely. Either way, you have outer bands already lashing parts of Barbados, and Grenada as well -- some of these islands. Category 3 as it stands right now with 120 mile per hour winds, sitting 125 miles east and southeast of Grenada. Again, we're already seeing some of these outer bands. We've been watching some of these showers clip parts of Barbados and some of these islands as well -- some of the Windward Islands on this radar. And you can see there's that eyewall -- how intense that is. And that looks like that eyewall heads towards St. Vincent and Grenada as we go through the day today. Barbados already looking at 43 mile per hour sustained winds. Gusts have already been up to 60 miles per hour. So this will continue as we go through the day today. Again, you've got hurricane warnings because we're looking at some catastrophic damage possible from those intense winds in the eyewall. We are also looking at some six to nine feet of storm surge possible. There it is with the intensity coming back up to a four, like I mentioned. And then we continue to scrape the Caribbean Sea. A lot of these island, like Jamaica, already have some watches in effect for parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. And then eventually, headed up towards Mexico by the end of the week. The reason we're talking about such an incredibly strong storm so early in the season is because these ocean temperatures are in the middle and upper 80s. This is the first time we've ever had a category four hurricane in June this early in the season. It underwent rapid intensification over the weekend. It took less than 24 hours for it to go from a tropical storm to a category four hurricane. And they find that trend getting extremely stronger faster more recently because of climate change and our warming oceans -- John.",

The Supreme Court rejected a last-minute effort by Bannon to delay his four-month sentence. Bannon was found guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress nearly two years ago.

At least two areas in Ruidoso had to evacuate due to the flash flooding. Eleven people were injured after an escalator malfunctioned at a Brewers game in Milwaukee.

Battling two forms of kidney disease, which forced her to step away from the sport, still somehow managing to earn this spot in Paris. She posted the highest score of the event on the bars, which has long been her signature. And the selection committee takes into consideration both the performance at the trials and also past experience, and this group has plenty of the latter as they head to Paris. It's a group of women that has continued to mature, Sara. And I'm just so struck by not only the things that Simone is doing and saying, but also the way that Suni Lee has stepped into this moment. At one point in time, she couldn't practice. She had significant weight gain. She didn't know if she was ever going to be able to compete again. It was a life-altering illness for her.
