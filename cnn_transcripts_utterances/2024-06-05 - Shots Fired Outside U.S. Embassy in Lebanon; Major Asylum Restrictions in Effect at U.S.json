Tensions have been heightened in Lebanon since Israel's war on Hamas began in October, with a surge in cross border attacks on what is the northern border in Israel, the southern border in Lebanon. Just today, a visit near that border for Israel's prime minister elicited this warning that his country is prepared for, quote, \"very intense action\" in the region. Few people know Lebanon region better than CNN's Ben Wedeman. Jeremy Diamond also with us. He has very latest on the controversial Jerusalem Day. Let's start with you, Ben. What do we know about where what happened in Beirut today and the context for that? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  This happened around 8:30 in the morning local time, when there was small arms fire in what appears to be the parking lot in front of the U.S. embassy, where people just usually leave their cars if they're going in to get visas and things like that. Now what we've seen on social media is video of a lone gunman, who seems to be wearing body armor. His face is masked, there is shooting going on. Now the U.S. embassy put out a statement, saying that the Lebanese security forces, which are deployed in large numbers around the embassy, in addition to embassy security reacted quickly when this happened, that no U.S. embassy staff were injured and no damage occurred to the embassy itself. Now Najib Mikati, who's the caretaker prime minister of Lebanon, said that an intensive investigation has begun into this incident. We understand that the brother of the lone shooter has been detained. He's been described as a Syrian national, according to the Lebanese official national news agency. There have been a number of Lebanese security force raids on houses in a town called Majdal Anjar (ph), which is near the Syrian border in eastern Lebanon. But this certainly underscores the level of tension in Lebanon that has been high since the 7th of October. Certainly, we have seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and other Lebanese factions and Israeli forces on the other side of the border. And what we've seen, certainly in the last week, is an intensification of that cross-border fire. And the visit by prime minister Netanyahu to the area and his warning of intense action against Lebanon certainly underscore just how dangerous this situation is in Lebanon -- Becky.",

But of course, Hezbollah is not Hamas. Hezbollah, according to the Israelis, has more than 150,000 rockets. Now, I've seen Hezbollah in action going back to the 1990s. I was there for the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. This is an organization that is very well disciplined, very well trained, very well equipped and is very flexible in terms of its strategy. So the problem is that if Israel is having -- we're eight months into the war in Gaza and Israel still has not subdued Hamas. How it's going to subdue Hezbollah, given its strength, its support from Iran, its battlefield experience, leaves some questions about whether the Israelis are going to be jumping from the frying pan into the Lebanese fire -- Becky.",

But in recent years, it has, indeed, as you said, become a flashpoint for violence between many of these Israeli nationalists who descend on the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem and the Palestinians who live here. And we've already witnessed crowds of thousands of Israeli nationalists descending on this area right behind me, is that the entrance to the Muslim quarter of East Jerusalem. And we've already seen -- we were actually marching with crowds of several dozen, at least, Israelis, who were chanting in the streets of the Muslim quarter, including things like, \"may your village burn,\" talking about Arabs in a very derogatory fashion. And we've also seen videos of scuffles breaking out at times between some of these Israelis who've descended and some of the Palestinians who live in this area. The Israeli police is very aware of the extent to which this is a flashpoint. They've sent 3,000 police officers to try and control the crowds here. But we've already witnessed, as I said, several scuffles up breaking out, banging on the doors of shops of Palestinians in this area. And you can see that more still beginning to arrive over my shoulder here as. And one of the things we're waiting to see is whether or not, for example, a figure like the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right member of this current government, who came here last year, whether he will make an appearance. And then, of course, there's also always the possibility of a response from Hamas to these activities. You'll remember that, in 2021, it was violence during these Jerusalem Day events that prompted Hamas to fire rockets, launching that war in 2021, between Israel and Hamas. So as of now, Hamas has yet to fire any rockets in this direction. But it is obviously something that people in this area are very much on alert for today.",

The issue here is that the crisis at the southern border, record arrivals of migrants, is becoming an issue that's increasingly concerning the American public. And the public is moving toward the Right. And they're more open to harsh immigration enforcement measures than they were. Donald Trump, as you say, is perfectly positioned here with his extreme right-wing and often even racist ideology on -- toward migrants. He's made that the basis of his political campaign. The president is very exposed on this. He needs to show he is addressing the crisis. This is coming just three weeks before the first presidential debate. What the president wants to do is to stand up and say to Trump, that, while Trump and Republicans have actually blocked quite conservative legislation to fix the border, because they want this as an electoral issue, he is the one that's acting. Biden doesn't have to win on immigration but he badly needs to fix some of his real -- some of the perception in the public that he has ignored this crisis and he doesn't know how to handle it.",

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The problem is Gazans who are brought in are labeled as terrorists and it is very popular opinion over here that terrorists deserve to die. So they do not deserve the same medical care as everyone else. CHANCE (voice-over):  Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows how the Sde Teiman facility was expanded after the October 7th attacks, with detention facilities and makeshift medical bays being added after public hospitals in Israel refused to treat injured Gazan suspects. Eyewitness accounts described a field hospital with 15 to 20 patients, virtually naked and blindfolded, with hands and feet shackled to their beds and wearing diapers. One eyewitness told CNN painful procedures were carried out by underqualified medics, treatment, the medical worker told us, amounts to punishment. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They've been eager to get this flight going. And I'm very excited for them. But they're going to have a great mission. And I think it's all going to just work out wonderfully.",

And it'll adjust its orbit slowly over the next 24 hours to matchthat of the International Space Station before they approach and dock to the station.

You were describing just ahead of liftoff how the sort of model of space travel is changed. It is being privatized. And Boeing, alongside Elon Musk, of course, one of the companies taking advantage of that opportunity. Now just walk us through, from your viewpoint, what we've just seen. And  what happens next? Why this is significant, why today makes sense. O'BRIEN:  Well, let's not forget what happened when the space shuttle was retired many years ago. The United States had a long period of time, a long multiyear period, where its only way of getting astronauts to the International Space Station was to avail ourselves of Russian rockets -- which Leroy has flown on. Launching from Kazakhstan, returning to Kazakhstan. And that was a scenario that no one at NASA wanted. But it worked to fill the gap. But in the meantime, NASA was pushing very hard to sort of get out of the business of building rockets. Now NASA has never built its own rocket. It's always used contractors. But the way they did those contracts were very cost-plus defense-style contracts with a lot of NASA people involved in every step of the way, very bespoke, very expensive way to get to space. And so the idea was, if private companies could get on board and do this, it might become much more affordable. And it would give NASA the ability to focus on things like going to Mars. Well, it's paid off in the case of SpaceX. It took a while but now we see SpaceX as the preeminent space enterprise. And it's had frequent missions to the International Space Station, aims to go further. And meanwhile, Boeing, which was at the very beginning of the space program, it's one of the companies that -- it began with McDonnell Douglas, built the Mercury capsules after all, sort of a preeminent name in space. And is the prime contractor for the space station after all. Boeing had all kinds of misstarts trying to operate with this new kind of way of doing business. It was hard for the elephant to dance, in this case. And so there's been a lot of problems along the way. I'm gratified to see it get off the pad. Butch and Suni are courageous astronauts on a test flight. Anytime you fly a first flight, anytime you go to space, it's risky. But this in particular is a risky mission. And it's important, though, to have a couple of paths to space. We don't want that gap again.",
