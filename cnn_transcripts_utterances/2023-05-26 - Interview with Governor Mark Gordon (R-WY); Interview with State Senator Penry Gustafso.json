I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. We begin in the western U.S. where a landmark deal to protect one of the country's most important waterways has finally been reached. The Colorado River serves more than 40 million Americans across multiple states. But it's drying up at an alarming rate. This is what its largest reservoir looked like last year. Drought, overuse, and climate change are largely to blame. Now, in the new deal, the lower basin states, Nevada, California and Arizona, will temporarily cut their water usage. In exchange, they'll get over a billion dollars' worth of federal grants. It is a significant reduction, about 13 percent of their total demand. But experts are already warning that it's not a long-term fix. Wyoming is one of the upper basin estates, which should also see the benefits of this deal. And Wyoming, Governor Mark Gordon joins me now from Kaycee, Wyoming to talk about this and much more of the news today. Governor, thank you so much for joining us. So, I'm sure this deal is a big relief for you. Tell us exactly what it means for the state? GOV. MARK GORDON (R-WY): Well, it's very positive news. I will say, we don't know the details yet. There's still a lot to be worked out. So, we're analyzing what this means. As you pointed out, it's really a lower basin state issue, and they are working through the details. And it's a little bit uncertain with the debt ceiling topic coming up in Congress, whether the pay for reduce use is actually going to happen. But I think the point you made early about how we've had a two-decade long drought, and that has really put challenges for the system, it's very much important -- an important part of this conversation.",

I mean, unfortunately, this is not a big surprise given the political climate today. But it does appear that there is somewhat of a deal, at least in reach. I've -- latest reports suggest that there's a difference of about $70 billion, but nonetheless we'll believe it when we see. The deal reportedly under discussion now. Caps nondefense discretionary spending over two years. Now, that is considered a win for Democrats. Republicans had been looking at 10 years.

But your point about payments in lieu of taxes, your point about what happens to towns and communities, that is a substantial hit. Wyoming has been very forward thinking in making sure we have adequate reserves, but those can only last for so long. What we really need to do is to make sure that this country gets back on track with energy production. You know, we have not seen leasing on federal lands that's been done in any kind of productive way over the last several years. And that means reduction and payments are coming to the state from private companies that go through the federal government. It means the reduction in minimal royalty grants, and those, I think, are significant. And it is a way that we can increase revenue, both to states and to the federal government.",

You signed the first state ban on mifepristone, that is the abortion medication, despite the fact that it has been legally approved for over 20 years in this country and is proven to be safer than Viagra and even penicillin. You also signed a total abortion ban, currently blocked in the courts right now. Here's how one Republican state senator, a female who I did not -- not one of the women I will be speaking with shortly. But here's how she interpreted these bans.

I mean, we've been here in the past, but once again we've seen President Biden cut short a G7 trip. The world is watching.

And, you know, I've lived in Washington for three decades and I've seen this movie many times before. And I look back and I see that, you know, since 1960, whether Republicans are in charge of Congress or Democrats, the debt ceiling has been raids like 78 times. So, you know, it's in no one's interest for this to, you know, not to work.

So, you know, it might cut both ways. They might sort of say to themselves, look, that's a pretty tough knot, we should be very careful.

So, the whole idea of having a scalable artificially intelligent tutor is to try to level that playing field as much as possible. We think already, even with the computation costs, that it's far more accessible than traditional tutoring.

It should only be used to improve the learning experience for the student, personalize it more, or actually improve the efficacy of the platform. So, these are things we're taking very seriously. Even the current A.I., we are not using that information to train the artificial intelligence and some of the questions that you bring up. You know, I think for students, there's a different context. We are making it so that -- and this is one of the safety mechanisms, that everything a student does is monitorable by the teacher and by the parent. We also have a second artificial intelligence that's monitoring the conversation with the student, and the first artificial intelligence to flag any conversations and then notify parents or teachers.

And the problem with that is the only people who are going to follow that are the good folks, are that rule followers. The people -- the criminal organizations, the authoritarian states, they're not going to slow down one bit. And in my mind, the most dystopian scenario is one where authoritarian governments and criminal organizations have better artificial intelligences than that rule followers. So, I actually don't think that that's a viable path to just act with fear and try to slow things down. I think the other path, you will have a lot of folks say, oh, this is all going to work out, kind of like the industrial revolution. It's somehow going to create more jobs than destroy jobs. Maybe. But I don't think it's enough to just hope, use hope as a strategy, so to speak. I think it is important for actors like Khan Academy and many, many others in every domain to be very proactive and say, all right, what are the risks here? How do we mitigate them?

It's going to be able to happen in any language. You might sometimes engage with it on your phone on, on your laptop or through virtual reality. So, you feel like you are in the same room with it. So, I think it's going to be pretty immersive. I think you are also going to see changes to other parts of the system. Traditional assessment, the only thing you can grade in a very scalable way were your traditional Scantron multiple choice, and because of that, that's what the education system got focused on, things that you could actually assess in a reasonably low-cost way. Now, artificially intelligence can assess your writing, it can assess your thoughts. You have a simulation with it, you can have a dialogue with it. You can essentially have an oral exam with it, which is, you know, the gold standard for a Ph.D. thesis defense, you can now do that on demand. So, I think in five or 10 years, assessment is going to be -- is going to look a lot richer. I think the teacher's role in this artificially intelligent world, so to speak, a lot of their administrative tasks are going to be taken away, hopefully by Khanmigo, and they're going to be able to focus on the one-to-one personal attention. And -- but they're always going to have that artificial intelligence there to help advise them. We are actually -- we have another nonprofit called Schoolhouse.world focused on peer-to-peer tutoring. We're already leveraging artificial intelligence to give the tutor feedback on how they could tutor better based on the transcript. And then, we think we're about a year away of -- in real-time, being able to give the tutor feedback on, hey, you haven't called on this student lately or I think this is what they are actually asking.
