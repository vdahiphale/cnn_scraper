They're going to continuously try to drive that home and they're hoping that his testimony will reinforce that. They're looking for sound bites of him saying basically what he said in his report. I think Democrats, on the other hand, are going to try to continue hammering the point that the special counsel decided that there was no criminal intent there and try to contrast that with what former President Trump is facing as far as his use of classified documents after taking -- after leaving office.",

Author and journalist Sasha Issenberg explores all of this in his new book, \"The Lie Detectives: In Search of a Playbook for Winning Elections in the Disinformation Age.\" And Sasha joins me now. Sasha, this book could not be more timely. Yesterday's cover of USA Today had this as the lead, so this is something that's really broken through with the general populous. But how should we be thinking about these challenges? I mean, if you're the average voter, what do you need to be looking for? And how are campaigns trying to talk to people who are getting -- honestly, being flooded with this stuff, probably quickly, probably on their phones, probably with not a lot of tools to figure out what's true and what's not? SASHA ISSENBERG, AUTHOR, \"THE LIE DETECTIVES: IN SEARCH OF A PLAYBOOK FOR WINNING ELECTIONS IN THE DISINFORMATION AGE\":  Yeah. Well, generally, what's fascinating to me about this topic is the asymmetry that it creates. So if those things had been 20 years ago on a TV ad or on the front page of the newspaper, political professionals have a way of assessing who saw this? What do we think the impact is? The stuff that's moving around digitally is often very difficult to measure and very difficult to anticipate its impact. And so, it has forced political professionals and people running campaigns -- the party committees -- to totally revisit a lot of their assumptions about when and how you respond to attacks.",

Six members of Congress were there. We visited the Nova fields -- the fields covered with poppies and now with little trees symbolizing each of the young people slaughtered there. We visited Kibbutz Be'eri where more than 100 people were killed in the most brutal of ways -- burned out of their houses, shot in their safe rooms -- just absolutely despicable -- as they waited hours for any kind of rescue. We met with Palestinians. We met with government officials on both sides. And so, I have to say that what I found is what is unacceptable is number one, we have to remember what happened to Israel. It must never happen again. Israel has the right and responsibility to secure its land and have its sovereignty. But the suffering in Gaza is too great. Thirty -- more than 30,000 people are dead.
