And that was clear from the outset. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a fierce critic of the Biden administration, greeted Biden when he arrived and gave him a letter. That letter criticizing the administration's immigration approach. Now, over the course of the hours'-long visit, the president went to a port of entry. He went to the border wall. And he went to that migrant processing center that you mentioned earlier, where he didn't appear to see migrants. Now, advocates say he essentially left the visit without seeing the worst of the humanitarian crisis, a crisis, Kaitlan, that remains a challenge for the administration and one that Biden is very likely to talk about here in Mexico during the North American leaders' summit.",
