It's Tuesday, December 5th, 5U.N. officials are warning of an apocalyptic situation, nearly 1.9 million Palestinians displaced, tens of thousands of them fleeing to the Rafah crossing near Egypt in the last two days. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says nearly 16,000 civilians have been killed since October 7th. The IDF says that the death of two civilians for every Hamas militant is, quote, tremendously positive. Meanwhile, multiple U.S. officials tell CNN that hostage negotiations are unlikely to resume anytime soon. The White House reports one American woman and seven men remain unaccounted for.

      "sentences": "I think it's important to remember, Kasie, that even while the formal talks broke down there are still frantic efforts going on behind the scenes in and around those talks that involved, of course, Qatar, the United States, Egypt, Israel and Hamas to try to figure out what can be done between Israel and Hamas to secure the release of those remaining hostages.And, of course, their fate very much is in the balance, and you mentioned that resumption of the fighting, the furious bombardment now with the entire Gaza trip. It's 137 hostages that remain in the hands of Hamas. And, of course, to the United States, that focused very much on that one American women, seven American men now unaccounted for since the October 7th attacks. Now, what we understand has been happening is that the aim is to get some kind of traction, as you heard they said that these talks can resume around how to get the specifics of anyone further out. The trouble is, of course, given that breakdown, given the ferocity of the fighting how difficult that is going to be to get everyone around that table for the time being. We're also hearing from the United States that they have very little hope, for instance, that there could be anything like the similar deal that we saw struck by the Russians, other nations, to Thailand, of course, as well, who managed to speak directly to Hamas to secure the release of their hostages. The feeling amongst administration that there is no sense that Hamas would want to do any favors to the United States. So furious negotiations still going on to try to get everyone back around the table in order that some kind of hope, some kind of solution can be found of these hostages. But for the time being, Kasie, I think very dim prospects. And a great deal of gloom around what hope there might be that the situation would be unblocked. Fundamentally, this remains a blockage that is around the IDF says, Hamas's inability to speak about what it had negotiated, which is the idea of the women hostages being released. The Israeli position is that they will go no further with those discussions until Hamas releases all of the women hostages, with the question at the heart of that of what it is they will have to say about their time in captivity -- Kasie.",

I mean, I was -- I was struck by Congresswoman Dingell being around a long time. She's dealt with a lot of emotional issues. She says emotional as I've ever seen her talking about the horrific things that happened, and the things that happened to her when she was told that, hey, what you're saying is not true.

And even in the Democratic side on how to speak about the war, and what side people are on that it has been really hard to find a ton of unity on this subject. And at times has gotten really tense between members.I mean, one issue with congresswoman Jayapal's comments, I'm told is, you know, that she is going on television and having interviews speaking for herself but she also stands for the chair of the Progressive Caucus, with is a broad group, representing over 100 members. And some lawmakers tell me that they are frustrated that Jayapal is out there speaking her opinion when it doesn't represent the entire conference. And the conference hasn't taken an official position on anything having to do with the complicated war between Israel and Hamas. Now, Jayapal's office is, you know, trying -- is defending the congresswoman's comments and says that she always only speaks for herself, not the entire caucus but these are just some of the dynamics at play here.",

But, of course, that is the reality of war.To put this statement from the IDF into a broader context, to perhaps help your viewers understand what is being set here, so, in World War I and II, the civilian casualty ratio was around -- well, I put it in percentages, was around 60 percent supposedly. According to the IDF, they're saying around 33 percent of the fatalities inflicted in Gaza are currently civilians. The Iraq were the lowest estimates, were around that same ratio, but most likely, they were much higher than that. So they are framing it, even though it sounds so stark as to try to underscore that they are actually doing a fairly good job in the context of recent warfare. The U.N. has published a report with experts citing that most modern wars have a civilian casualty rate of around 90 percent. So, the IDF is trying to communicate that even though they have been widely criticized and our reporting has so much evidence of it of the civilian collateral damage, huge scale, they are trying to say, actually, within the context of modern war, we are doing a good job. And just to provide a little bit more information -- so we heard from the Israeli defense minister that thousands of terrorists have been killed. The AFP reported that they put the number at 5,000 Hamas militants being killed, to their sources and that the IDF said that number is more or less right. But a very difficult conversation to have, and also fundamentally, we must point out, that this rests on the premise that it is even possible to get really anything approaching an accurate picture of numbers in an active conflict. And we know that is just notoriously difficult prospect, not to mention the propaganda value of any act they're wanting to inflict the casualties of their side are receiving and deflate those if they are inflicting.",

Officials, say a suspect inside the house discharge a flair gun about 40 times as officers tried to speak with him. Moments later, the house exploded. Republicans on the House Oversight Committee released payments made by Hunter Biden to his father, but neglected to include documents that prove he was repaying the president for a pick up truck. The White House said committee chair James Comer continues to, quote, lie and mislead the public, end quote, in what they call a failed impeachment stunt. All right. Now, let's go to weather. Waves of heavy rain and winds in the Pacific Northwest, more snow in the higher elevation. The cause, this year's back to back atmospheric rivers expected through tomorrow.

The ability for this to transport water vapor from the tropical regions of the planet to the mid-latitudes where you and I actually live is just incredible. And we're talking about the tremendous amount of water vapor. So much so that it has the ability to transport as much as an equivalent of 25 times amount of water that flow through the Mississippi River.So this river on the skies, the atmospheric rivers we keep talking about produce significant heavy rainfall and mountain snow. That's when the freezing level is far enough down in altitude where we can get so much snow. But this time, it's a little different because you can actually trace back the origin of this atmospheric river all the way back to Hawaii. And that moisture means it's pulling in this tropical influence moisture. So it's going to be a warmer AR event, or atmospheric river event, and we believe this will be more of a rain event. So, the snow we got early in the week, well, that's going to melt. It's going to add to the flooding concerns because we have a level five of five, according to some of the authorities out there. So, this is the significant event for the coastline of Oregon, even into portions of Washington. Again, heavy rain on top of snowpack means quick melting and that will offer rivers to rise rather quickly. So we're going to look up for the potential of flooding across that part of our country today and the rest of --",
