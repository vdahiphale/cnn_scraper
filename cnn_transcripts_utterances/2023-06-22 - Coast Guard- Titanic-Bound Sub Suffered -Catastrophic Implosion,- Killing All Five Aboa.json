So, it's possible. But it's going to be expensive. It's going to take time. They do have the ROV still, that's going to be capable of going down and looking at the debris field.

So, that is going to be a big part of this conversation, going forward, a big part of the investigation, in terms of exactly what happened. Earlier today, out here, in Boston, we heard from the Coast Guard's Rear Admiral. We also heard from experts, deep sea diving experts, the Rear Admiral, explaining in very specific detail what that rover, what that remote operated vehicle that was down on the ocean floor, exactly what it found, early this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL JOHN MAUGER, U.S. COAST GUARD: This morning, an ROV, or remote operated vehicle, from the vessel, Horizon Arctic, discovered the tail cone of the Titan submersible, approximately 1,600 feet, from the bow of the Titanic, on the seafloor. The ROV subsequently found additional debris. In consultation with experts, from within the Unified Command, the debris is consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber.

Almost everyone I know that have been around, as long as I have been, in the ocean game, has taken some risk. They didn't end up like this, fortunately. But, so I can't comment. It's not a vehicle I would have gotten into. It's just not my kind of thing to get into a tube-like vehicle. I do wonder about that, too. This was a tube. Most submarines that I know about are spheres that you -- and a sphere, when it's under compression, is pretty strong. But a tube is a bit different.

Was Stockton an innovator, adventurer, and was taking a calculated risk? Or was it just one of those things? Because the oceans, just because you pass every test, and get every sort of stamp there is to have, doesn't mean, you're going to have a perfectly safe dive. The oceans are full of surprises. It's a very hostile place to be. So, somewhere in between there, something that could have happened, to any submarine, or this was a fundamental design flaw.

And the truth is, is that partly because of how Joe has governed, those divisions have been bridged. I think what's true in American politics, generally, is until you get to campaigns, people aren't paying much attention. People have gone through a difficult time, because of COVID, and the Pandemic, and lockdowns, because of inflation, primarily the result of both, the war in Ukraine, and rising energy prices, as well as supply chain issues. And so, people have memories about the \"OK, eggs got more expensive, and gas was more expensive.\" And they haven't been paying as much attention to the fact that, for example, the African-American unemployment rate is lower than it's been in decades. The campaign will allow President Biden to make those arguments. And I think that, in a media environment that's so cluttered, it's very hard to break through, until you get to election time. You'll recall when I ran for re-election, in 2012, my poll numbers weren't that great. And we ended up winning comfortably. Part of that was just we started campaigning, and we were able to get a message out, and people said, \"Yes. That policy, or this policy, or this thing left undone?
