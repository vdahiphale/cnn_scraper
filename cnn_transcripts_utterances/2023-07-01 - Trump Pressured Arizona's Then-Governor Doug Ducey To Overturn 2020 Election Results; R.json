Jim Acosta is off.And we begin this hour with new evidence of Donald Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A source tells CNN that after the votes were cast, former President Trump called then-Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona in an attempt to pressure him into overturning that state's results. Sources say Trump also pushed then-Vice President Mike Pence to help him in this pressure campaign. CNN's Jeremy Herb joins us now. Jeremy, what more are you learning about Trump's attempts to pressure the governor?",

Now sources are telling CNN that Ducey has said that the president pressured him to try to find enough fraud in the state of Arizona so that Ducey could overturn the election.Now the governor stood against Trump and certified this election despite these pressure calls. Sources also told CNN that the president talked to his former vice president and pushed Vice President Mike Pence to try to also pressure Ducey. We know that Pence called Ducey about the elections several times, but a source tells CNN that he did not pressure Ducey as he was asked. Now this all comes as a special counsel is ramping up his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including efforts to reach out to states like Arizona and Georgia. We should note here that a spokesman for the governor, he downplayed the significance of this call, telling CNN, frankly, nothing here is new nor is it news to anyone following this issue the last two years. Governor Ducey defended the results of Arizona's 2020 election. He certified the election, and he made clear that the certification provided a trigger for credible complaints backed by the evidence to be brought forward. None were ever brought forward. A source -- special counsel spokesman also told CNN that Governor Ducey -- excuse me, a spokesman for Ducey told CNN that Ducey has not heard from the special counsel -- Paula.",

Now in this case with Ducey, we don't know that -- if President Trump actually asked him to find votes. We know he asked him to find fraud. But that is a key distinction.Another difference here is that there was a recording made of this call with Secretary Raffensperger, and a source tells CNN that in this case with Governor Ducey there was no recording of the call, Paula. So those are just a couple of these key differences that may help explain why the special counsel who interviewed Raffensperger this week may have not yet contacted Governor Ducey -- Paula.",

And there is an aspect to that recorded conversation with Raffensperger where it's a bit of word salad.That really can be defeated very easily if there's a pattern of activity. Of course there is a bit of a pattern of activity in Georgia itself. He made calls to the speaker of the House there and others.

I want to talk to you about a key part of this report that says, look, this largely boils down to a failure to consider a worst-case scenario. We all remember that terrorist attack in the final days of the withdrawal that killed 13 American service members and more than 70 Afghans. Shouldn't a focus on worst-case scenarios be a vital part of planning for anything of this magnitude and complexity? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Absolutely, Paula. There's no question about it. You know, it's -- a tragic mark on the administration and on the prior administration for not considering worst-case scenarios. That's what planning is all about, you know, in the military and we should have the same situation in the State Department. You should be planning for the worst possible outcome. You hope that that worst possible outcome doesn't take place, but in the Afghan situation, it was really clear. We've had plenty of historical antecedents such as Vietnam, for example, the fall of Saigon, which happened very quickly. And there was enough information that could have been extrapolated from what was going on at the particular -- at this particular time about two years ago that it was very clear that the central government in Kabul was not going to lasts and that we had to do something very quickly to get our Afghan partners out, the ones that had helped us, the translators, the interpreters, the other people who assisted us logistically and in other ways throughout the 20 years that we were in Afghanistan. So this is, indeed, a failure to plan and a failure to plan in this case resulted in a failure to act.",

That is a significant shortfall.There was an interview in \"The Washington Post\" with the head of the Ukrainian armed forces, General Zaluzhnyi, and he correctly points out that if a Western army or even if a Russian army goes into battle, they're going to try to gain air superiority before they mount a defensive operation. The failure to mount a defensive operation without air power is a significant failure, and it's pretty clear that air power, longer range artillery, faster delivery of weapons systems, faster delivery of munitions, all of those things play a part in this. And the West and the United States especially would really be well-advised to get these weapons to the Ukrainians as quickly as possible if we want to see results on the battlefield that will help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty.",

JESSICA LEVINSON, PROFESSOR OF LAW, LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL: My reaction is that the difference we see between the majority and the dissent shows two very different views of the Equal Protection Clause and equality in this country. As Ariane just laid out so well, in the affirmative action case, we have the Supreme Court, the conservative majority, saying basically that we have no offramp to continue these plans, and that the Equal Protection Clause says we don't discriminate on the basis of race, period. So we don't take race into account. Then we have the liberal justices really saying, but if we don't take race into account, then we're ignoring what true equality means. And in fact we're ignoring cases like Brown vs. Board of Education which were race-conscious decisions.

You don't refuse a portion of the public because you don't agree with their lifestyle or you are racist or you don't want to serve people of a certain religion. And what the majority said was we can't put people in this untenable situation where they have to choose between their livelihood and complying with this law. And the majority said it amounts to forced speech, to force people like Lorie Smith, this would-be Web site designer, to design a Web site for a same-sex couple.

New Orleans, Mobile experiencing a similar drop. But it's going to be a bit more of a delayed effect, likely waiting until Monday to see a bit more relief.

From there, I know that a lot of people are very worried because they counted on not having to pay back those $10,000 or $20,000 of debt. They went out, they bought homes, they bought cars, they spent money, and now they're thinking, oh, my gosh, what do I do. And there are two things you should know. First, the president and the administration have created what they're calling an on ramp for borrowers. We expect that a number of people will not be able to make these first couple of payments on time. So what they're saying is that, if you are late, if you miss a monthly payment, you have a year of basically a grace period where -- it's not a pause, but if you're late they're not going to report you to the credit bureaus. They're not going to say that you're delinquent. The other big thing that's underfoot is a change in income-based repayment. They're rolling out a new plan called the Save Plan. It's really good news for borrowers who are strapped by a certain amount of monthly income that makes it difficult to make their payments. Under this new income-based repayment plan, you'll have to pay, at most, 5 percent of your disposable income, that's for an undergraduate student, or 10 percent toward your monthly payments. There's also been an increase in what's considered disposable income, so that more money is actually sheltered from those payments. And once you make those payments for 20 years, again for undergraduate students, any remaining debt is wiped away. If you go to studentaid.gov, you can start getting in line for this program. And you should know that if you're currently in an income-based repayment program, the current one is called Repay, you'll be rolled into this new version.",

Income-based repayment has gone through many different iterations through the years.And we're expected to see these changes take hold within the next couple of months. So this was not a congressional act. It was something that came through the administration. But again, it's expected to provide a lot of relief for a lot of people. Because rather than having to put up to 10 percent of their disposable income toward monthly student loan payments, it drops it to five for undergraduate students. Now some people aren't eligible for this. Parents who took out Parent- Plus Loans are not eligible, but undergraduate and graduate students with federal loans are.",

But my sources are saying that these will go through, that we should have good confidence that they will go through.And by the way, income-based repayment for anybody who is having trouble making their payments, whether we're talking about the old plan or the new plan. is a very good idea. So if you're not enrolled, go ahead and get enrolled. The other thing that's happening right now is that the Department of Education is undergoing a review of months that people have been making payments that should have been applied either toward public service loan forgiveness or toward their income-based repayment. And they're adding months to people's calendars. So you may see that you're getting more relief than you expected.",

I want to note that no opinion very large at 17 percent. We'll have to wait and see after they hear about what the Supreme Court did, whether or not people might change their minds. I should note, on this particular issue, very few people are paying very close attention to it before the Supreme Court ruling came down. So I think these numbers are sort of squishy.

Only 33 percent of Americans approve of that idea. The clear plurality, 50 percent disapprove. Again, I'll note that no opinion number, 16 percent, is rather large. So you know, these are issues that I don't think people are necessarily thinking about every day.

I think that the issue of affirmative action, student loan forgiveness are not in the same ballpark. I don't think that they will sort of allow for that same sort of rising up public will against the court.
