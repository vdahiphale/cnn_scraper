Before we start seeing anything brought out of the water, they need to get a good look at all of the pieces involved. We're told more than 1100 engineers here in Baltimore across the country now analyzing the bridge and the various pieces, trying to figure out how to take it apart, usually very complex, you're on the water and if you move one piece, how might that shift other parts of that bridge structure.So, once they get through that, that's when we'll start seeing all of that equipment that's being brought in starts this cleanup and removal process put in perspective. It will all be happening just behind me. You see some flashing lights there. It's just past there where we saw the bridge collapsed, as well as where that ship sits out, bringing in quite a few different pieces of equipment to take part in this. So we know that there will be 10 tugboats involved, also nine barges, eight salvage vessels, seven float (AUDIO GAP) thousand that large crane there. That will be able to lift around a thousand tons. But the trouble here is some of that equipment that's on top of the ship that's around 3,000 to 4,000 tons. So, again, they have to start taking it piece by piece apart. As for a timeline, we're told it could take several weeks once they get to that point to clear that debris. As for how long the recovery process here will take (AUDIO GAP) on all of that.",

So, there is the potential for a flash flood threat. Again, not just for Southern California, but this will eventually spread farther east and to other states like Arizona. There's also the high wind component, you're talking winds gusting up to 50 to even 60 miles per hour. That's also spreading east too, so even states like Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, also looking at those strong winds. Then you can take a look at where all of these places are that are still expecting some of that winter weather including the snow. Obviously the higher elevations are where we're going to see those highest total, some of these areas could be picking up six to even 12 inches of snow over the next few days.

Very heavy rain along the front and even the potential for some severe thunderstorms along the southern edge where you have that very warm air. Some of these areas could be looking at record high temperatures on Monday. Then by Tuesday, we begin to see that shift a little bit over more towards the Ohio Valley and spreading into the mid-Atlantic region and into the Northeast. That severe component we talked about really ramps up on Monday. Take a look at this damaging winds, large hail, we're talking golf balls size or even larger and yes, the potential for some tornadoes basically stretching from southern Texas all the way over into West Virginia.

And also, I mean, how does the Biden campaign hope to win over these voters? Where do they stand? Because they may not like, you know, Trump's style and tone, perhaps, but I would imagine that a lot of them are closer to Trump when it comes to policy, than with Biden.",

You know, I wouldn't -- and I think for a certain number of voters that's going to resonate, and that's going to remind them why they voted against them in the first place.",

And there's no clear leader in this race.Trump with 47 percent, Biden with 44 percent, but then when you look at the cash-on-hand by these two campaigns, Biden at the end of February had $71 million in cash reserves, way more, nearly double that of what Trump has, $33.5 million.

It's coming out of some of the Super PACS that would otherwise be supporting his campaign. So, over time, this can make the difference.

In fact, it will be a week later.Will Washington manage to convince Israel to hold off of its ground offensive in Rafah? That is the question, Amara and Victor. There is so much at stake. We're talking about 1.2  million Gazans who are huddled in and around that southern-most parts of Gaza. A ground operation, of course, the fear is, would lead to a bloodbath, that's why pressure is being brought to bear and will again. We heard -- notwithstanding the Israeli delegation's cancellation earlier this week, when Yoav Gallant; the Israeli Defense Minister did meet with his counterparts in Washington on Monday and Tuesday, we heard that at the end of those conversations, both the United States and Israel had agreed to continue talking about Washington. What Washington is hoping to convince Israelis to heed, which is the avoidance of a full-scale ground operation in favor of much more targeted attack, targeting of Hamas. There are four Hamas battalions, American and Israeli officials believe in that Rafah district. And of course, fortifying of the border with Egypt to prevent any of them from fleeing. That's what America is trying to convince Israelis to listen to for now. What we've heard from the Israeli authorities and specifically, from Benjamin Netanyahu; the Prime Minister is that Israel intends to go ahead with that ground offensive. We heard the Israeli Prime Minister meet with American congressman on Wednesday in Jerusalem, telling them that Israel had no choice, but to invade. And again, we heard him meet with the families of hostages who have now been held as you mentioned a moment ago for nearly six months in Gaza, meeting them and telling them that it was in order to get their loved ones back, that this operation would go ahead, vowing that no Israeli would be left behind. So, a great deal at stake when these conversations begin, we expect possibly on Monday, although for the time being, there's no confirmation of that.",
