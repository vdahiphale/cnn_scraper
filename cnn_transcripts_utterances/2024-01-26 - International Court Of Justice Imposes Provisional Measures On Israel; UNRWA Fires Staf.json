And what the targeting of Taylor Swift can perhaps teachers about the dark side of artificial intelligence. Live from New York, it is Friday, January 26th. I'm Julia Chatterley in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And a good evening once again, great to have you with us. In today's top story, the United Nations top court ordering Israel to take all measures to prevent genocide in Gaza. The ICJ says Israel must do more to limit the death and destruction and let humanitarian aid into the Strip. It did however, stop short of ordering a ceasefire. The court only ruled on the emergency measures requested by South Africa and not on the core of the case. A ruling on whether genocide has occurred in Gaza could take years to resolve. South African and Palestinian officials are welcoming the decision, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there is no merit to it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And indeed, the Israeli judge even joined with the court on two provisions, one that that incitement of genocide stop; and second, that humanitarian aid be let in. So this was a very fair case. Now, some people are disappointed that the court didn't order a ceasefire. But frankly, I never expected it to because the International Court of Justice is a tribunal to resolve civil disputes between governments. So it was only South Africa and Israel that were present. Hamas not being a government was not present, and the court was not going to order a ceasefire to one side of the conflict, and not the other.

It has been widely reported by the UN humanitarian agency. So the court basically said, open up the gates, you've got to let the aid in. Now, the courts, as it said, this order is binding, but it doesn't have a military. It doesn't have a police force. It depends on the UN Security Council to impose coercive measures if that's necessary, but that means contending with a US veto. But I wouldn't go too far down that line, because there's going to be enormous political pressure on Netanyahu to comply. You know, he accepted the court as a legitimate body by sending his lawyers to argue his case, but you can't accept the court if you win, but not if you lose.

Let's get straight to Alex Marquardt here on this. Alex, do we have any sense of what evidence was used to suggest these individuals were involved?

But certainly they are, as the Commissioner General for UNRWA called them shocking allegations and an investigation has been launched. UNRWA, of course, is playing a pivotal role when it comes to getting aid into Gaza. They are giving as much shelter as they can. Their shelter is in southern Gaza, bursting at the seams. They have been trying to get food and medication, other aid in. And then, Julia, during peace times, they are one of the biggest employers in the Gaza Strip. They have schools like the one that we're showing on the screen right now. You have all kinds of facilities across the Gaza Strip, and elsewhere, where there are Palestinian refugees, including the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. So this is it truly stunning to the point where the State Department has announced that it is holding back what they're calling additional funding, temporarily putting a pause on that additional funding. They haven't said how much that is going to be, but it could of course, significantly affect the activities of UNRWA. At the same time, Israel which has quite a rough relationship with UNRWA, they have accused Hamas militants of using UNRWA schools and shelters to hide their weapons, to fire their weapons from, to hide their militants as well. We've seen strikes by Israel on UNRWA facilities as a result of that, but Israel hasn't come out and said explicitly what these staffers are alleged to have done. The Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, he said that these humanitarian workers and he put that in quotes, as if to demonstrate that animosity had blood on their hands and Israel said that they do expect an investigation, a thorough investigation by UNRWA, which the United Nations says is being undertaken. But certainly at this point, we still have a lot of questions about what the staffers are accused of doing, but all parties taking this very seriously -- Julia.",

I mean, these are people on the ground, who are doing what they can to help keep Palestinian safe, alive, fed, get the medical treatment that they can. So certainly that is where UNRWA, the US, Egypt, the Palestinians want the focus to be. But this is -- these are -- if this is indeed true, this is obviously something that they can't be ignored. So while this is being looked at, certainly, UNRWA is going to try to press ahead with their mission.

Jean Carroll, that can be up to 10 times or more the amount of compensatory damages. So you might be seeing a large number for the jury or maybe a smaller number, then that will go to the judge to adjust particularly the punitive damages. Judges will often reduce those. And then Trump gets an appeal, and can appeal it all the way up to the United States Supreme Court. So there could be some delays before we see the end of the legal proceedings.

Personally, the attacks she's had, the threats against her life, her professional damage that she's suffered with her career being adversely affected, the pain and suffering she's had. So that argument is not going to work, and I think the jury is going to say not only is there compensatory damages in the eight figures, I don't know if they'll do the full $24 million more or less, but I think you are going to see eight figures and then a multiplier for intentional wrongdoing. That is the punitive damages, where Donald Trump has done harm never mind to other people. He's continuing to do harm to hurt. They need to address that as a jury and I think they will.

But artificial intelligence, these generative A.I. tools have made it so much easier, so much faster, so much cheaper to make these kinds of images and to spread them really rapidly. And as you said, the situation with Taylor Swift is kind of different because of her celebrity, these images spread so quickly. They got tens of thousands of views which, you know, of course, is horrifying for her. And she also had these fans coming to her defense, reporting these images, reporting these accounts, and many of the women, the victims of these kinds of crimes don't have that kind of backup. You have experts saying this is a sign of just how badly we need regulation around artificial intelligence. Some rules, some accountability for the people who create these images, the platforms that allow them to spread.
