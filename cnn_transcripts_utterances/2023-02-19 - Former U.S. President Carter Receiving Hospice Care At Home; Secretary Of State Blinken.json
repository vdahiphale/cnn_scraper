The last time that a U.S. secretary of state actually visited Beijing was five years ago. That visit that Blinken postponed was actually -- would have been two weeks ago today. But instead, they are meeting in Munich on the sidelines of this security conference. And, yes, they talked a lot about concerns that are not just in the United States, but across NATO and throughout the West, that China is considering upping its support for Russia beyond what they are already doing, which is helping to bolster the Russian economy from sanctions.The United States is concerned about that. But they are also concerned about what they call lethal support for Russia which they say could be a wide ranging number of things, including potentially weapons. Blinken telling the Chinese that they would have serious consequences in their relationship with the U.S. and others if that were to happen, if China were to help Russia, but also China, you know, is saying that, you know, some forces, not saying the United States by name, actually don't want negotiations to succeed, don't want the war to end. Of course, the balloon was also the other big contentious issue. You know, just this meeting happened right after, you know, Wang Yi basically called the United States, you know, hysterical, absurd. He said that the United States needs to repair the damage to the China relationship for using excessive force against the Chinese balloon. Of course, Blinken warned China that, look, if this balloon thing happens again, there could be very serious consequences for the Chinese side as well. So, this is not exactly a friendly chitchat. But, you know, supporters of diplomacy would say this is progress, at least they are talking. And, again, Blinken still not ruling out a visit to Beijing at some point in the future after postponing that trip two weeks ago. Boris, Amara.",

Both sides are looking for an apology. Neither side offered an apology.Mr. Blinken's trip to Beijing was not rescheduled. There wasn't even discussion of rescheduling it. There has been some talk of trying to set up a phone call between President Xi Jinping and President Biden maybe in the next few days.

We have seen some of the toughest export controls of the high technology equipment used to make the most advanced semiconductors.

The window for finding survivors is closing. The focus has shifted to providing support to those survivors who have been left homeless with absolutely nothing, many of them, of course, have also lost loved ones.And there has been a real outpouring of support here in Turkey in terms of the humanitarian response effort and, indeed, from the international community. We have seen those commitments of aid and humanitarian support from Turkey's international partners, including the United States. And we do know now, of course, that Secretary Blinken has departed from Munich and is on his way to Turkey, expected to be touring the province of Hatay which was, of course, hard hit by the earthquake. Thousands of people there have lost everything in Hatay. And he is also expected to be touring an aid distribution center in the province to take a look at that response effort. But the message that we have been hearing from aid groups and from the territories that are working on the ground is that they simply need more. They need more support from the Turkish government, more support, more donations, and crucially they don't want to be forgotten by the international community because, of course, this is a process that is going to take months, if not years. And we have heard from the Turkish government. They say they are committed to rebuilding the affected areas in southeast Turkey within a year. We have already been told by the vice president that the construction of around 30,000 apartments is set to begin in March. But of course we are talking about an enormous area here. We are talking about thousands of families that have been made homeless. And we are already seeing some of these families being evacuated to other parts of the country, including here in Istanbul where some are being hosted in university dorms, for example. Others being hosted by generous families who are opening their doors to those who have been impacted by the earthquake. And then of course, for President Erdogan there is a significant challenge ahead. Not only is the government focused on rebuilding southeast Turkey but they are also focusing on accountability. So far at least 120 people arrested. Out of 400 identified suspects in connection with allegations of construction negligence. Boris, Amara. SANCHEZ: Nada Bashir reporting live from Istanbul, thank you so much. Amara, as we've talked to people trying to offer help to those in need in that part of the world, we have learned that delivering much needed help to those folks that have been impacted by the earthquake has become a challenge in itself in some areas.

Here's her escape. It was caught on camera. You see the woman who has not been identified. She's running. She's barefoot. She's only in a T-shirt in 40 some odd degree weather. And you see that man that was closely following her. He tries to get in but she deadbolts the door. When he realizes he can't get inside, he turns around and leaves. And that's when the owner steps in helping her get to the back of the gas station where they call police.Now, her alleged abductor is 57-year-old James Parillo and he's now behind bars on kidnapping and assault charges. Authorities say that he choked her multiple times, that at one point he took away her cell phone and used her credit cards and isolated her from her family. They also say he goes by different names and may have actually done this before in other states. CNN has reached out to an attorney listed for Parillo but we've yet to hear a response. Joining us this morning is one of the heroes of this story, the owner of that gas station, Bobby Madaan, who helped keep the woman safe until police arrived. Bobby, good morning. We're so grateful that you're sharing the story with us. Walk us through what that day was like. When did you first see her and realize that something was wrong? JATIN \"BOBBY MADAAN, OWNER, THE PAINT STORE-CONOCO: Hi, good morning. Well, it's yes -- it was just a regular day at the gas station. I was in the backroom doing paperwork and my employee was in the front just having a little break. And all of a sudden, we hear this screaming and yelling. And I look up on the camera, there's somebody's son running on the side of the building. Then they're at the front and I could see the woman and the man right behind her. Excuse me. And so, my employee, Jamie, and her come into the store and they lock the door. By the time I get out to the office, I see the guy is trying to open the door but we kind of look at each other and he is gone. And she is frantic. She is shaken. She was really, really scared. You could tell. I couldn't grasp in the first 10 seconds what was going on. I just knew that this woman needed help. My employer knew this woman needed help. She helped her out, get her in. And my employee told me that she was screaming on the way here that I've been kidnapped. This man has kept me for too long. And that's exactly what she repeated to me when she got into office. So, we just got to sit down and give her a safe place and told her we're calling the police, to not worry, nobody's coming in here.",

I'm talking about those 65 and older with small hormone receptor-positive breast cancer who are also receiving hormone therapy. So, typically, breast cancer patients receive radiation after having a tumor removed. But for these patients opting out of radiation, appears to have no major impact on their overall survival. That's according to new research in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers looked at data on more than 1300 women with breast cancer. About half of them received radiation across their whole breast following surgery, the other half did not. The researchers found that the incidence of cancer coming back in the same breast was higher for those who did not receive radiation, 9.5 percent versus 0.9 percent. But when it came to overall survival at 10 years, that was nearly identical between the two groups, 80.8 percent versus 80.7 percent. And we know that radiation therapy can come with side effects, fatigue, hair loss, and swelling or tenderness in the breast, and the risk of complications. So, having the option to skip it might be welcome for some. Others might still want radiation therapy because of concerns about their cancer coming back. And one important caveat for women who are not planning to take hormone therapy, skipping radiation is not recommended. Back to you.",

It didn't have any star power. But Mac McClung just putting on an all-time performance here last night that had this arena just going bonkers. Mac is the 2022 G League Rookie of the Year and he just got signed by the Philadelphia 76ers. And he was just incredible. His first dunk, he jumped over a guy sitting on a guy's shoulders, tap the backboard, and finished with the reverse slam. That had everyone on their feet. And then Mac had everyone just in awe again and the final sealing the win with this spinning dunk. Mac is from Gate City, Virginia, a town of just 2000 people. He went to Georgetown and then Texas Tech and College. Now, he's trying to latch on in the NBA and I caught up with him last night.
