      "sentences": "Yes, and Boris, I should note that just seconds ago we saw the car that is carrying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu roll through into the White House where, of course, he is now expected to have this bilateral meeting with President Biden. What sources tell me is that we do expect that President Biden might be as forceful as he has ever been in a private setting with the Prime Minister in urging him to accept the ceasefire deal that is currently on the table that would put an end to this war that has been ongoing, of course, since last October. As one senior official put it to me, Boris, we're closer than we've ever been and it is up to the Israelis to accept it. And it's not only just this bilateral meeting where the President will have the occasion to exert some pressure on the Prime Minister. As soon as that meeting has wrapped up, the two leaders are going to go into another private meeting with the families of American hostages that are still in Gaza. And that, of course, would be another setting where the Prime Minister might get a hard push from everyone in the room to accept that deal to end the war.Of course, we should remind everyone there are eight American hostages that are still believed to be in Gaza. And just looming over this day of meetings, Boris, is, of course, the fact that it's only been a couple of days since the President announced his decision to end his reelection campaign. And now the question of how this war exactly comes to an end is really poised to play a big factor in the legacy of the President's one term presidency. And of course, as we have talked about so much, this is a war that has taken up so much of the President's time and his effort. And this is a ceasefire deal that the president has made such a hard push, unsuccessfully so far, of course, over the course of many months, to bring this deal across the finish line. I will also say one senior official for now is insisting that the U.S. does not believe the Prime Minister is sort of purposefully delaying a deal from coming together for political reasons of his own. They did tell us yesterday, however, that if the deal remains stalled a month from now, then they may come to a different conclusion. Boris?",

We heard hostage families say that they had hoped that he would stand up and -- and announce that the ceasefire had been accepted.And as you just heard Jeremy say, it is believed that the ball is in Israel's court. I mean, listen, anybody who has been listening to Netanyahu for a long time could have written this speech in the days ahead of time. I mean, this was -- this was Netanyahu through and through. There were very few surprises. There was a lot of red meat in there for his supporters, many of the lawmakers, primarily Republicans, standing up and applauding. There were Democrats in there as well. But he hit on the subjects that we expected him to. And among those subjects, there was room for a lot of pushback and a lot of fact checking. Whether you're talking about the amount of aid that needs to get into Gaza, which the U.S. says is complicated by Israel's military operation, whether you're talking about the civilian death toll, what's happening in Rafah, and the list goes on and on. You know, he talked about these protesters being useful idiots for Iran. There were some pretty nasty scenes out there among the protesters yesterday, some -- some pro Hamas language. He certainly looked to paint all of the protesters that we've seen in the past few months in this country with this broad sort of pro Hamas brush tools of -- of Iran. And then when talking about the future for Gaza, I think there was a lot of disappointment in that. He was -- he was talking about the -- the efforts would continue until it's deradicalized and demilitarized. And that's -- that's -- that's code language for, you know, this is going to take a very long time, and Israel is going to maintain a presence in Gaza for quite some time, which he did say. So he wasn't, he didn't talk about, you know, acquiescing to a two- state solution. He didn't talk about his vision for peace. So I think certainly globally speaking and those who want to see this conflict come to an end, there was a fair bit of disappointment.",

In her public statement so far, before she was a candidate for president, she had differences of emphasis and nuance with President Biden, but no real differences of substance. In her famous speech in Selma, she talked a lot about the suffering of the Palestinian people, but did not suggest in any way that she would pull back on the arms aid to Israel, Israel using a lot of U.S. weaponry for its attacks.Now she's got to basically walk the line that President Biden has been walking until now, which is to say she can't anger the very pro-Israel groups who believe that Biden has been too hard on Netanyahu. And yet on the other side, she doesn't want to give any ground that would suggest that the progressives would abandon her. And that's, of course, going to be a key base for her as she heads into the election. And the progressive view has been very much to put much more blame on Israel for its response than to focus instead on the original terror attack.",

Many Republicans complained before that she had not gone. Then they stopped because she went. But Trump has continued three years later.He said she was Joe Biden's border czar. She wasn't. She was never put in charge of the border. She was given a much more limited assignment to lead a so called root causes diplomatic effort trying to address the reasons in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras that people choose to migrate. Now, many Republicans scoff at this kind of fact check. They're like, there were a bunch of articles back in 2021 that called her border czar. Frankly, those articles were wrong. And if you look at CNN's own coverage, not toot her own horn, but you'll see that the White House and Harris office consistently, as early 21, pushed back on that framing. And then Trump also said Harris has allowed 20 million people to stampede in. Aside from the question of her own responsibility, that number is way too high. There have been about 10 million so called border encounters at the southern border under Biden. And not all of those are individual people. Many of them are attempted repeat crossers. Many of them are immediately expelled. So even if you add in so called gotaways, people who evaded the Border Patrol, House Republicans say there are a couple million. That doesn't add up to 20 million. It just doesn't.",
