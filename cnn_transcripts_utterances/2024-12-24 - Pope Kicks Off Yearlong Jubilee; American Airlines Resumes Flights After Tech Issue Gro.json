We're following these major developing stories and many more also coming in right here to CNN News Central. It is the top of the hour here, America Hill, along with my colleague Danny Freeman in New York. Nice to have you with us on this Christmas Eve. And we begin this hour with what could have been Christmas Eve chaos at airports across the country. American Airlines says it was a technical issue which forced it to briefly ground all of its flights this morning on, of course, one of the busiest travel days of the year.",

We now know that this was caused by an outage of a computer system that is key to getting flights on their way and push back from the gate.American has about 3,900 Tuesday flights scheduled. The good news for the half million people traveling on the airline, no major cascading cancellations, making the real story here the delays. Airline analytics from Syria just gave this to us. It says American airline hubs like Charlotte and Miami have been hit hard. Add bad weather into the mix at DFW, America's largest hub. It all means about 37% of American flights have left on time today. Not a great score, but the silver lining here is that 93% of all flights operated by American are departing within about two hours of when they were scheduled. American spokesperson Sarah Jantz tells me that the delays are really to be expected. But she insists that American does have the staff to get things back in place and back on track quickly. This all really started about 7 a.m. on the East Coast. All American flights held on the ground flight about an hour. American now says this was an issue with an IT vendor that network feeds into American's critical flight operations system and without that, flights could not be dispatched. Here is the statement now from American Airlines. They say, quote, \"A vendor technology issue briefly affected flights this morning. That issue has been resolved and flights have resumed. We sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience this morning. Now, history has shown airline technology issues can have really have an outsized impact. In July, the crowd strike outage caused Delta Airlines to meltdown. It canceled about 5,000 flights in total. The Southwest Airlines holiday meltdown was happening right now two years ago. Seems like not all that long ago, but two years ago now. Southwest canceled about 15,000 flights over about a week's time. The Department of Transportation has really turned up the heat on keeping airlines accountable. And outgoing secretary Pete Buttigieg says the Delta investigation is still ongoing, though airlines are pretty hopeful that a new Trump administration may be more sympathetic to them when it comes to issues like this latest snag.

As you mentioned, he said that he believes Biden's decision, quote, \"makes no sense\". And just a few hours ago in a social media post, he actually expanded on that, giving a preview of how he will see this issue going forward in his next term, saying, quote, \"As soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families and children from violent rapists, murderers and monsters. We will be a nation of law and order again\".This statement, of course, follows Biden's latest end of term action, and that was taking 37 federal prisoners off of death row. When he announced that he would be doing that, that those people would be instead serving out life sentences in prison, here was part of his announcement explaining that thought process. He said, \"Make no mistake, I condemn these murders, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all of the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss. But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vice president and now president, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions I had halted\". Now, Biden's decision leaves only three federal prisoners awaiting execution when Trump takes office.

Despite a major blow by the Supreme Court decision to strike down his key proposal last year, Biden has approved the discharge of more student debt than any other president.And while Trump has not made specific promises when it comes to student loan forgiveness, we know that it's not the same type of policy priority that it has been for the Biden administration. So there are a lot of Democratic lawmakers really pushing Biden to take more action in these final weeks. And here's some of the specifics that they are asking for. To officially deliver student loan forgiveness promise to defrauded borrowers, to provide more forgiveness through borrower defense and to provide options for borrowers stuck in legal limbo. There's a plan called SAVE that the Biden administration launched last year that has continued to be challenged in the court. So still a lot of questions for people out there with student loans. A lot of questions they want answers to. And these Democratic lawmakers are hoping that they can do that in these last few weeks before there's a change in administration. Erica.",
