Let's recap our top story for you an exclusive new reporting. CNN has obtained a transcript of an audio recording where Former U.S. President Donald Trump admits having national security documents that he did not declassified. The tape is significant because it shows that Trump had an understanding that the records he had with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House remained classified. And it could be crucial evidence in an investigation that marks the first time a Former U.S. President has faced federal charges. He is being indicted on seven counts in the classified documents probe, more on that story throughout this hour of course. Right now we are hearing about the latest fighting in Ukraine from the country's Deputy Defense Minister. She says the frontline in Eastern Ukraine is still the epicenter of the battle where \"heavy fighting\" continues. This comes as Kyiv accuses Russian forces of shelling flooded areas in Kherson including evacuation points. Now, thousands have been fleeing floodwaters unleashed by the catastrophic collapse of a major dam in Southern Ukraine. We all know from watching this program it is still uncertain whether Kyiv's long awaited a counter offensive against Russian troops has actually begun when Ukrainian forces do appear to be stepping up activity southeast of Zaporizhzhia. Russia's Military claims its troops were engaged in a major battle there on Thursday, more now from CNN's Fred Pleitgen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Breaking news on Kremlin controlled TV claiming Moscow's forces are facing massive attacks in Southern Ukraine.",

While the Ukrainians have not confirmed offensive operations and CNN can't independently verify this specific Russian claims. U.S. officials have told CNN the Russians are putting up stiff resistance. Ukraine's leadership says they understand their counter offensive will be long and tough and they lead lots of armor to penetrate Russia's defenses. They showed us this repair and modification shop where they fix up mostly vehicles captured from the Russians, including this modern troop transporter. PLEITGEN (on camera): Even with all the Western equipment that the Ukrainians have already received, they still have a lot less than the Russians do. That's why every tank and every armored vehicle that they can get back on the battlefield will be vital for Ukraine's war effort. PLEITGEN (voice over): That includes even seemingly destroyed vehicles like this blown up armored personnel carrier the project manager tells me.",

Starting Monday about 10,000 participants will unite to simulate NATO's response to an attack on a member country. 250 military planes from 25 countries including the U.S. are taking part in the drills for the next two weeks. Germany is hosting the military events. CNN's Nic Robertson, joining us from Jagel in Germany, it is very significant that it is Germany hosting this event taking a lead and stepping up to show that it is interested in ensuring the security of Europe. This is a real about face, of course, from Germany, traditionally, not taking this sort of military start. The scope of this drill is enormous. And clearly it has a message and that message is directed at one key person at this point. Surely this is a message to President Putin.",

That's exactly what the U.S. Ambassador to Germanysaid just a couple of days ago, she said every world leader would look at the scale and scope of this military exercise, including President Putin and draw their own conclusions from it. But the way it's discussed here, and I was talking with the German commander of this military, this air military exercise that's going on here. He said, look, this isn't about President Putin. He said he tabled this possible defender operation back in 2018. And of course, by then Russia had already invaded Ukraine once back in 2014. The 2022 invasion on full scale by Russia into Ukraine hadn't happened by then. So his point is, look, this was on the books long before what we're seeing in Ukraine at the moment and his message to your point, that the importance of the Transatlantic Alliance is huge. Germany's commitment to that alliance writ large here is very important. But the core of what goes on during this exercise is really sort of wingtip to wingtip ability to fight side by side should they need to defend Ukrainian territory to prove to the alliance that prove to NATO. They can do it to prove to their populations that they can do it right up to that red line at the edge of NATO territory, which of course is right, essentially next to Russia. So, that message, the military message is train and be ready, approve that we're ready, be ready, the diplomatic message to President Putin utterly unambiguous. This is a military alliance that is ready to defend its territory. Should you step over that red line and I spoke to one young U.S. airman earlier today. A first lieutenant had come from Colorado, which is where all these F-16s lined up behind me come from and he was from Colorado, based in Colorado. And he said, look, I've never partaken in one of these massive training exercises before. Yet here I am, for the first time ever able to fly side by side, wingtip to wingtip with a Euro fighter just two days ago, he said you cannot replicate that in any other training environment. And that, of course, is what's key to getting all these different nations talking to Turkish Air Force officials here before involved in this as well saying the same thing we're about working together learning from each other, passing on experience. That's what it's all about. But no one's under any illusions here, that these aircraft the F-16s, they're defending. And the biggest threat to the area that they're defending right now is Russia. An aircraft very similar to these F-16s here will soon be in Ukrainian Air Force pilots hands to fight in that battle space.",

Therecan be some several dozen counts we know that one of the counts in this indictment is for willful retention of Defense information. Now that's part of the Espionage Act. You're going to hear references to the Espionage Act, but that word tends to have a broader meaning that we sometimes associate with it. All it means here is that Donald Trump intentionally retained held onto defense information doesn't actually matter under this law. Whether that information was classified or whether it was ever declassified, as long as it relates to information relating to the defense. We also know that there is a charge relating to obstruction. Any effort by Donald Trump and effort ordered by Donald Trump to interfere with the investigation in any way will be obstruction of justice. We also know there's a charge for destruction or falsification of records. Let's keep in mind this could relate to a certification that Trump's team submitted to DOJ. At the point when they served a subpoena response, they said, we searched everywhere in Mar-a-Lago, this is all we found turned out there were many, many more documents, that certification was false, but was intentionally false. The Prosecutors allege that it was. Next we have a charge of conspiracy. Now conspiracy simply means an agreement, a meeting of the minds between two or more people really important because that tells us Donald Trump, according to prosecutors did not act alone, there was at least one other person who knowingly agreed to commit a crime with him. And the last charge that we know about relates to false statements. It's not a crime, to make false statements to the public. It is a crime if you make a false statement to DOJ or the FBI.

Then Donald Trump's defense team will bring motions rest assured they will make motions to try to get the case dismissed. They've already told us they're going to be arguing there's prosecutorial misconduct, then, at some point, we will have a trial query whether we will get that in before the 2024 election or not, that's going to be a really important issue.

Someone can run forand be President, even if they've been convicted, theoretically, even from prison. I will say this, there's one law that could be in play here. It's not one of the ones that we know is in the indictment, but it was part of what got them the search warrant that says if a person's convicted of this, he's disqualified from holding federal office, not clear whether that provision is constitutional.

This was a way of separating the politics out of it, as we know, Merrick Garland was appointed by Biden, so it to try to take the politics out of it. Jack Smith has been really quiet. He has been underground. He is not somebody who is out there making statements. We are hearing you know, that he is being very serious about this.
