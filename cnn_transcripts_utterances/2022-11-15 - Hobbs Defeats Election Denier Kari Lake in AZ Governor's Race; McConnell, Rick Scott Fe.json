CNN is projecting that Democrat Katie Hobbs has defeated Republican Kari Lake in the governor's race.Lake has been one of the country's most prominent and outspoken defenders of Trump's lies about the 2020 election. Lake will join a growing list of Republicans this election season who campaigned on election lies, and they lost. That includes two other high-profile election deniers in the same state: Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters and the secretary of state nominee, Mark Finchem. Now, Hobbs characterized her victory as a win for democracy. Lake, on the other hand, is already starting the grift. This is a quote from her: \"Arizonans know B.S. when they see it.\" Well, that is apparently true, since voters rejected her and so many other liars. Obviously, her tweet is the B.S. here. There is no evidence of fraud. There's no evidence of wrongdoing. It is a grift that so many Americans rejected at the ballot this year. Republican Liz Cheney taking credit for -- after the projection there, telling Kari Lake, \"You're welcome,\" after Lake sarcastically thanked Cheney for urging people to back Lake's Democratic opponent. Meantime, an Arizona Republican strategist releasing a statement after Kari Lake called John McCain a loser and, I quote, \"Kari Lake told a legion of John McCain supporters across Arizona that they could go to hell. Well, tonight, they returned the favor.\" Hobbs is now set to become the fifth female governor in Arizona's history.",

By now, they thought, they thought they would have this huge majority in the House, that control would have been declared. None of that has happened yet. So it's certainly a different situation than he thought he would find himself in on this day. We know he held a closed-door meeting yesterday with House Republicans, really trying to bolster support. What we need to keep in mind is, for this vote, you only need a simple majority. He doesn't have to get to that 218 number today. That's for in January when they reconvene and formally would elect a speaker. So he just has to get that simple majority. He's faced, though, stiff headwinds, though, Poppy, especially from the House Freedom Caucus. And we know that Andy Biggs from Arizona is mounting this kind of longshot challenge to him. But it's -- it's not uncommon for someone to run and not -- and fall short of the 218. We know this happened with Nancy Pelosi in 2018. She went on to be speaker. Paul Ryan back in 2015, he went on to be speaker. So he is expected to fall short of that 218, but again, he needs to get the simple majority.",

But the second, of course, is that they still believe that a GOP- controlled Congress a GOP-controlled administration, even, is better for their interests. They did not want to give and do anything that could have given Biden and the Democrats an advantage in the election. And of course, a retreat from Kherson, very strategic and important city in Southern Ukraine, is very humiliating for the Russians. It is a big, big defeat for them. And so when they were discussing the timing of making this formal announcement, going on TV, having senior Kremlin officials kind of parade this announcement. They said, according to U.S. intel officials, it was discussed that the midterms needed to be a factor in that conversation. Now, it's important to note, there is no assessment, formal assessment here that that was the only consideration at play. Of course, realities on the ground were also at play.
