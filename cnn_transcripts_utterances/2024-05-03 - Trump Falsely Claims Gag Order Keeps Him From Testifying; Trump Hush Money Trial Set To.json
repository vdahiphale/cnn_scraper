Tonight, Donald Trump's lawyers on the attack, trying to undercut credibility of Stormy Daniels' lawyer. Secret recordings played in court, and that trial begins in the next hour. We will have full coverage as and when it happens. Uzbekistan is undertaking economic reforms. It wants to boost foreign investment. On this program today, we're going to hear from the U.S. Ambassador. You'll hear from the head of the EBRD, and the digital minister will be with us along with the CEO of Masdar, the UAE energy company. I'll be exploring the metro, the subway, the underground, call it what you will. We went for a ride in Tashkent because we all have 14 cents. You'll see those palatial stations, well, with a space thing. That's something that you'll not see anywhere else, except arguably possibly Moscow. Live tonight from Tashkent in Uzbekistan, it is Friday. It's May 3. I'm Richard Quest, and it is Uzbekistan. You better believe, I mean business. And a very good day to you, and a warm welcome wherever you're joining us. We are live tonight in Uzbekistan's capital, which is a central Asian nation at the crossroads. The difficult parts, of course, between China, East, West, Russia, Europe, the country has an ambitious reform plan, which the country is aiming to attract $70 billion in direct foreign investment over the next five years. And this is the numbers according to the Ministry of Investment and Trade. If history is to go by, they will meet those targets. The question, of course, is where the money is coming from? Business leaders gathered here for the Tashkent Investment Forum, and I'll be speaking to them throughout the course of the hour ahead. We must now return to New York in the United States where the Donald Trump hush money trial begins in just 90 minutes from now. There was a tense day of testimony when we had Stormy Daniels' lawyer who was giving evidence and being cross-examined, Keith Davidson. Now, the Donald Trump team was cross- examining him, trying to undercut his credibility, as indeed of course the prosecution will now have to show it back up again. Trump's lawyers accused him of near extortion, and said that Davidson wrapped many celebs, and Donald Trump said the deal was nothing new, and at that point, Davidson became defensive. Another gag order hearing took place yesterday. This time, it was the prosecutors who wanted Trump said -- they said violated it four times. He says he attacked Cohen and talked about David Pecker in a way to intimidate future witnesses, basically believing that he'd said nice things about Pecker. But, this time, they weren't asking for jail, just a fine of $1,000 for each infringement. Donald Trump has been warned of possible jail time. The former President spoke about the order and falsely claimed it barred him from testifying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I'm not allowed to testify. I'm under a gag order, I guess. I can't even testify in that. Now, we're going to be appealing the gag order. I'd love to answer that question. It's a very easy question, the easiest question so far. But, I'm not allowed to testify because this judge, who is totally conflicted, has me under an unconstitutional gag order. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Judge Merchan again reiterating that in court yesterday, saying he is notstopping Donald Trump or forcing Donald Trump to go speak to reporters when he leaves court or when he enters court every day. He is has a very strict and a very specific set of guidelines. Trump cannot talk about the jury. Trump cannot talk about potential witnesses. And Judge Merchan's concern here, and he voiced it again yesterday, was that by talking about these witnesses, even a witness like Michael Cohen is a little bit combative in the press himself. It could impact the other witnesses in this case, as it's sort of a trickle-down effect. So, that's really the concern that Judge Merchan voiced as far as the gag order goes. As you know, they did not -- Judge Merchan did not issue an order on the gag order, whether or not he is going to impose sanctions for those supposed four more violations of the gag order the prosecution brought up yesterday, but he has threatened Trump with jail time, as you mentioned. So, it will be interesting to see how he handles that going forward.",

Their strategy yesterday was essentially comparing Donald Trump to Hulk Hogan, the wrestler, to actressLindsay Lohan, to other celebrities who Keith Davidson help facilitate payments for, essentially saying, look, he is slimy. They tried to paint him as slimy, paint him as somebody who walked right up to the line of extortion. That's what Trump's attorney said yesterday, sort of walking the jury into that framing of Keith Davidson. Now, it remains to be seen it the jury will buy that law. As you mentioned, it -- that's probably a foreign concept to them. As you know, it's not normal for journalists to pay for a story not to run one. And it really is at the core of the prosecution's case here that they had to convince the jury that this was an extraordinary payment, an exceptional payment, and one that was intended to influence the outcome of the presidential election. That is still the bridge that prosecutors have to build, and it's the one that they're going to try to continue to do so today. But, look, they made progress on that yesterday too by introducing these audio recordings of Michael Cohen, trying to show that Donald Trump didn't know about these payments. So, we'll pick back up with a forensic analyst today and we'll see where they go from there.",

Uzbekistan, as far as the argument goes, people would have said a few hours ago, can you find it on a map? Well, the country has ancient origins, and it is absolutely at the crossroads of the world trade, the Great Silk Road, the Belt and Road Initiative. It is a key stop in the global trade routes, and it's emerging from its Soviet past. Independence came in the early 90s. But, arguably, it's only in the last decade when there was a change of administration. It was only then that modernization truly arrived in this country. And now Uzbekistan is recapturing its position as a trade hub. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) QUEST (voice-over): From its roots in antiquity, Uzbekistan is trying to chart a modern path. The territory that now makes up the country once connected East and West, on the ancient Silk Road. Its cities such as Samarkand and Bukhara date back more than 2,000 years.",

QUEST (voice-over): Its capital, Tashkent, is undergoing a major reconstruction. Cranes are everywhere, as its leaders move further and faster to leave its Soviet past behind. It's a shift increasingly important after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Uzbekistan is trying to become a new connector of East and West, strengthening ties with countries like the United States, France and China. The country's geography is one of the many challenges to its growth. It's double landlocked making the management of scarce resources like water extremely important. It's also working to address corruption, and its citizens still lack many political freedoms. Through opening up to tourists and bolstering its high- speed train system, its leadership hopes to speed its way forward in the right direction. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But, for all those reasons and for historical reasons as well, it's also this, historically the center of a major trading route, has -- is very rich in terms of natural resources as we surrender critical minerals, energy resources, if we're talking about the whole region, of course, and therefore for the United States, it's strategically very important.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Richard. These numbers do speak to the slowdown that we had really been anticipating for quite some time. Now,this is just one month after a series of really hot jobs numbers. So, we don't want to read too much into it. But, 175,000 jobs added, that is slower than expected. The expectation was 232,000. And this is a significant slowdown from what we saw in March. That was revised higher. March was 315,000. So, this is almost half the pace. The unemployment rate was expected to tick. It was supposed to be flat, but it actually ticked higher to 3.9 percent. And a number that I know people on Wall Street are paying attention to right now and officials in the Fed is wages. We saw wage growth cool down below four percent on an annual basis. We haven't seen sub-four percent wages in almost three years. Now, for workers, I know workers don't want to hear that their paychecks are not growing rapidly anymore, but for 3.9 percent wage growth, that's still ahead of inflation. So, that means paychecks are beating prices. But, the Fed is going to be happy to see that the rate of change is slowing down. That's going to make them a little bit less worried on the inflation front. And when we look at the reaction over on Wall Street, we do see stock futures at session highs. At last look, the Dow Futures were up about 500 points. So, markets do seem to like this. We see NASDAQ futures up 1.6 percent here. So, this is being viewed as good news by Wall Street. One other point here is to put all this in historical context. With the latest month of sub-four percent unemployment, that now marks 27 straight months where the unemployment rate is below four percent. That's tied for the longest streak in U.S. history, tied with the streak that was set between 1967 and 1970. So, Richard, this does still look like a historically strong jobs market, maybe just a little bit cooler than it was a month ago.",
