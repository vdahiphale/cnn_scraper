You almost nailed it, 303,000 jobs added last month. This is 50 percent more than expected. It is an acceleration from what we saw in February. The unemployment rate ticking down to 3.8 percent.You know, these really are very impressive numbers and this jobs market, it just continues to defy expectations, both in a short-term basis, coming in hotter and hotter than expected, but also when you zoom out. This jobs market is so much better than people thought. A lot of economists reasonably expected that the Fed's war on inflation, spiking interest rates, was going to cause the unemployment rate to go up, was going to cause job loss, and that just has not happened. If anything, this jobs market is heating up. And some economists are already - they're baffled by these numbers, right? One economist just put out a report with the subject line, wow, and writing, quote, \"the data leave us border line speechless.\" Some context around these numbers. We're now looking at more than three straight years of monthly job gains. That is the fifth longest streak on record. And the unemployment rate is now below 4 percent for 26 months in a row. That is the longest streak since the late '60s and early 1970s under LBJ and Richard Nixon. So, John, listen, you can't bet a bet - bet against this jobs market because it just continues to defy expectations.",

Spokesperson John Kirby said earlier this morning that they want to read through and reach their own conclusions about what the Israelis are saying before they publicly comment on it.But it does come on the heels of that blunt phone call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday. In that call, a senior administration official says that Netanyahu did admit that the IDF was responsible for this strike on that convoy which killed the seven aid workers. The president has said that he wants to see accountability amid this investigation. We will see if the steps and the firing and dismissal of those two IDF - or military personnel by the Israelis is enough. But earlier today, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also had a bit of a shift in his language in saying that he wanted to see an independent and fully publicized investigation. So, we will see if the U.S. continues to press Israel on that front. But that called between President Biden and Netanyahu really was quite notable because the president was quite direct in conveying to Netanyahu that things needed to change when it comes to their protection for civilians, protections for aid workers. The president basically saying that the U.S. would potentially be prepared to implement consequences against Israel if they do not change course. Now, in that conversation, the president laid out a few of the things that he wants to see. He wants to see protections for these humanitarian aid workers. He's - an official said that both he and Netanyahu agreed that more needs to be done to talk about where these aid workers are located. He also wants to see more humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza. The U.S. has welcomed some of these initial steps taken in the hours after that call to open up some of these key crossings and ports. But as Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this morning, the real test will be the metrics. How many trucks are getting in. How much humanitarian assistance is actually being distributed. But the aftermath of this call will be very closely watched to see what Israel does and whether the U.S. might impose any types of consequences for their actions so far.",

When you see these consequences, what does that tell you? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): It's significant, the fact that the Israelis admitted so much that went wrong here. So, this major in particular was responsible for all the fire support in that area. He was really responsible for the target. The one that should have made sure that it was not hit. It should - there was multiple rules of engagement that likely Israel thought they followed. And I think that's what's going to change here going forward.

They want to try to cut off this land bridge at the Persian Gulf here. There's a - there's a land bridge that goes from Israel through Iraq that gets goods and supplies into the Persian Gulf here. Iran will likely start focusing on that and activate militia groups and do - and have its proxies do their dirty work because once they decide to launch a missile from Iran and hits Israel, everything changes at that point.
