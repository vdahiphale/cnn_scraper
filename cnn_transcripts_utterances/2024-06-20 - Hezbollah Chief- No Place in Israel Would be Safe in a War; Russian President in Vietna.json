Well, there aren't new fears that the conflict in the Middle East is set to spread after the Leader of Hezbollah threatened the Republic of Cyprus. In a television address Hassan Nasrallah said the island would be targeted, if it opens its airports and bases to Israeli forces. Cyprus has held joint military exercises with Israel in recent years, and as recently as last year. Well, Nasrallah's main focus in his speech that purported Hezbollah drone video of Israeli cities and military facilities that we showed you on this show yesterday. At this time, he warned Israel that the Iran backed group's intelligence and weaponry have significantly expanded and that if all-out war erupts, no place in Israel will be safe. Our Ben Wedeman is in Beirut for us. We talked about the sort of psychological warfare being waged by Hezbollah on Israel and Israel's response in the sort of past 36 hours or so when you and I spoke yesterday, we were awaiting Hassan Nasrallah's speech. Ben, just explain to us and our viewers why Cyprus is a target as far as he is concerned, and just how serious this threat is?",

Now we've heard back from the Cypriots who said that there was a spokesman this morning, who said that they will not allow their territory to be used in any military action. But it is certainly a concern of Hezbollah at this point. Now that tensions have really reached a level we haven't seen since last October.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam to try and strengthen political, economic and military ties with the Southeast Asian country. He's been meeting with President to Lam and senior officials in Hanoi. Russian media reporting that Mr. Putin told the Vietnamese President a strategic partnership with Vietnam is one of Russia's top priorities. Mr. Putin is keen to dispel the perception that Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine have left Russia isolated. The U.S. government, a key partner of Vietnam, criticize Hanoi's decision to host the Russian President. CNN's Mike Valerio following the story for us, and joins us now. Putin arrives in Hanoi, of course, fresh from his meetings in North Korea. Clearly, you know, he is limited in his choice of destination, and partners at this point. But it's -- there are those countries out there that are prepared to still do business with Russia, many of them are in the global south. Why does it make sense from Putin's perspective, to move his chess piece as it were to Vietnam on this trip?",

      "sentences": "So Becky, I think to answer that question, we can best analogize it to basic human relationships. If you have aneighborhood pariah, where you live, something horrible has been done by that neighborhood prime, make no mistake, you know, what are they going to do? Oftentimes they go from home to home in the neighborhood to say, you know, we good. It's just a checkup. So obviously, in terms of Russia and the neighborhood here in Asia, North Korea, certainly make sense. You get headlines like this, a new military treaty, all the pomp and circumstance in Pyongyang that we're still talking about right now. Vietnam certainly makes sense, because Becky, I think what people need to know is that a whopping 70 percent of Vietnam's military hardware comes from one place, and that's Russia. So Vietnam, no time soon will let go of their connections to Russia. Also, we can't forget about the history, the number one backer of Vietnam when it was fighting the French, when it was fighting, the Americans for years came from one place. And of course, that was the Soviet Union. So ties run deep. But the question here, you know, we saw the fanfare in Pyongyang and Kim Il Sung Square, it's been certainly more reserved in Hanoi. Certainly, there has been some degree of celebrations with school children, waving the Russian and Vietnamese flags. But Vietnam has to be very careful here. They're trying not to be aligned, as you alluded to, with any nation be at China or Russia or the United States are very proud of their -- non-alignment able to host the leaders of those three countries in pretty rapid succession. So what really matters, what we are looking for similar to North Korea, and Putin strip there, what's the deliverable? How is Putin going to leave the house of Vietnam? Is he going to leave, you know, with coffee, with gifts, with the food come back soon? Or is Putin going to leave Vietnam with President Lam saying, OK, you know, bye. We'll see you later. And that's it. It really matters to Vladimir Putin, when he comes back to his domestic audience saying, look, I left Vietnam with all this stuff, with all these new economic deals. If he doesn't, it will be a hollow visit. And, you know, of course, he does his own thing. That is the point of his trip to say, we don't need the West, we can operate with this new world order. But I think it certainly matters to some degree to show that he has credence with his regional neighbors and saying, you know, what we're loved, we still matter. So it's going to be very interesting to see what he leaves Vietnam with.",

And when it pertains to the economy, it is really one of those tricky spots that both candidates have been dealing with. For Biden, his team often points to those economic indicators, the fact that unemployment is down, that jobs are increasing, inflation sometimes is cooling. They point to those things are real bright spots in the economy. But at the same time, as you noted, there are many people who say they just don't feel that at home. The campaign has long hoped that they would be able to kind of ride this out and sentiment would start to turn when it pertains to the economy, similar to this point in the race for President Obama's re- election back in 2012. But one thing that Biden's team is hoping that with this debate is that this will give them some type of bump, it was really one of their main focuses is trying to get lay out for people what --remind people what Trump was like in his first term in office and what a second Trump presidency would look like. And they are hoping that this will really be a starting point where people are starting to tune in a bit more and hear from the both candidates.
