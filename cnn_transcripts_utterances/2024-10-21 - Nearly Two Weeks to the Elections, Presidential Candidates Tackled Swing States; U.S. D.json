The event was even shorter than normal.And it certainly seemed like the former ESPN host who moderated the event, plus the campaign-selected voters who asked the candidate questions, really were able to keep former President Donald Trump more on track throughout the evening. He emphasized his proposals on the economy, including no taxes on tips and overtime, talked about supporting fracking. And, of course, he mostly railed against the Biden administration when it comes to immigration. Now there were of course several exaggerations when it came to the subjects of the economy, immigration, immigration and crime and there were some of his normal asides. He spoke about bragging about his poll numbers. He also aired some of his grievances against ABC News for the last presidential debate, but there was nothing particularly vulgar or odd like we saw at Saturday evening's rally in western Pennsylvania. For example, that odd Arnold Palmer story. Trump did however continue to boost his new campaign surrogate Elon Musk the billionaire who has been stumping for him in Pennsylvania over the course of the weekend in fact even including offering a raffle of a million dollars to supporters who signed a petition to get into some of the events which some legal experts tell CNN it might be illegal but take a listen to what the former president said this evening about both Harris and Elon Musk. DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This woman is so incompetent she's so bad. You cannot, and I would normally not like to speak like that. If they get chosen, our country's finished.

We remember his post-inaugural claim that his inauguration's crowd was bigger than anyone else's biggest ever bigger than Obama's and we saw the pictures and saw that certainly Trump's was smaller.But his comments about Arnold Palmer's private areas are both disturbing, but also revealing. It reveals a lot about Donald Trump. And also I think gives us a glimpse as to why he is always going on the attack on the view that the best defense is a good offense. So before someone can attack him or make fun of him or laugh at him, he goes on the attack and takes the aggressive stance. The problem is our adversaries also know how insecure Trump is about size, and they know that they can play him. They know that they can get under his skin. They can rattle him.

This follows a meeting in Brussels last week with his counterparts in NATO. High on the agenda, questions from allies about the upcoming election and how it might impact Ukraine aid, specifically concerns that a potential Trump victory could jeopardize future USAID to Ukraine.Sources familiar with the meeting tell us Austin said that while he can't predict the future, there's still bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress. NATO officials say they're preparing for the U.S. to take on a lesser role. And CNN's Natasha Bertrand is traveling with Secretary Austin and joined us now by phone. Good to talk with you Natasha, so what is the significance of this visit? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on the phone): Well, this is the last time that Secretary of Defense Austin is going to be visiting Kyiv before the U.S. election, of course, which is just in 15 days now. And so this is an opportunity for him to meet with President Zelenskyy, to meet with Defense Minister Umarov, and get a sense for how Ukraine is grappling with its very serious manpower shortages, as well as get a sense for what they need at this moment to better meet their war aims. Because Ukraine, you know, right now is kind of on the back foot on the battlefield. Russia continues to make small but steady gains on the battlefield and they are recruiting up to 30,000 troops per month, whereas Ukraine is really struggling to ramp up its, you know, enlistment of additional troops. And so these are all things that the Secretary is going to be thinking about while he is here today. But it's also a chance for him to reaffirm the United States' support for Ukraine, particularly, you know there's a lot of anxiety here about what the presidential election is going to bring it particularly in the next year. And President Zelenskyy has said that he would like this war to end by the end of 2025, but the future of U.S. aid which has been so critical  to allow Ukraine to send off the Russians over the last two- plus years, that really hangs in the balance. You know, President Trump had said repeatedly that he believes that President Zelenskyy is a, quote, \"salesman\", that he should have never let the war start, which of course we know the Russians are the ones that invaded. And so all of this really paints a picture of doubt and anxiety heading into the next year about whether the U.S., which has been the biggest backer of Ukraine, is going to continue to play that outsized role. It really is a very uncertain moment here at this point.",

Russia is inching forward, not just on the eastern front, but it's pushing up in the northeast, in the sort of Kharkiv region. It recently claimed to have captured a settlement down in Zaporizhzhya. Aerial attacks are up exponentially over the past few months. Case in point, according to our analysis of Ukrainian Air Force data, Russia fired more than three times more drones in September than it did in May, and all of this of course heading into winter where the International Energy Agency says that Ukraine is operating with less than a third of its pre-war electricity generating capacity, partly thanks to attacks this year. So this is the situation in which it finds itself. There's also evidence emerging that Russia may be getting ready to bring North Korean soldiers into the fight. We have videos, one of which was sent to CNN by the Ukrainian government, showing what purports to be North Korean soldiers. You see it there at a training ground near Russia's border with China. So Ukraine may now have to fight a second, or elements of a second national army on its soil. And of course, we don't have evidence yet that they are actually on the battlefield. So it is a very precarious moment. U.S. remains the biggest backer by far. And it certainly, when it comes to crossing the next weapons Rubicon that Ukraine is looking at, that issue of lifting restrictions and using Western long-range missiles inside Russia. President Zelenskyy hinted last week that the three countries that provide them, the U.S., the U.K., and France, they want unanimity. And the U.S. at this point may be the holdout. Secretary Austin saying on Friday that he believes Ukraine is doing perfectly well with its own drones when it comes to hitting these targets deep inside Russia. So all of this will be extremely closely watched during this visit. Now just over two weeks out from the U.S. election.",

Right now, efforts are underway to rescue people trapped under the rubble. This video, geolocated by CNN, captures the moment a strike hit a building near Beirut's International Airport Sunday, sending it crumbling to the ground.You can see the airport in the background of another video with plumes of smoke rising from a building in front. The Israeli military says it's targeting financial institutions linked to Hezbollah. The Lebanese Health Ministry says more than 1,800 people have been killed since Israel ramped up attacks on the Iran-backed militant group last month. But the IDF is vowing to continue defending the Israeli people, saying Hezbollah fired about 200 projectiles into Israel on Sunday. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins me now live from London. Good morning to you Salma. So what is the latest on this new wave of Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon? SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so more airstrikes overnight in Lebanon. I have to begin by saying, Rosemary, that these have just occurred so rescue workers are still trying to assess the damage and find survivors but what we do know is that Baalbek, this area in eastern Lebanon, was struck. Multiple buildings hit. Rescue workers are trying to find survivors under the rubble. Tyre, as well, in southern Lebanon, that was an area that was struck as well. Israel says that it issued what it calls evacuation orders for these areas. And it's part of this wider push that we saw over the weekend. Rosemary, Israel says that it is targeting Hezbollah's financial institutions, particularly those that are based in southern Beirut and in southern Lebanon in its crosshairs is the Al-Qadr Al- Hasan Association. Now, Israel says that this financial institution is responsible for purchasing weapons for Hezbollah, for paying its fighters, for evading sanctions but it also serves another system. This is a banking institution for some 300,000 potential customers in Lebanon. It provides loans to the poor in the Shia community. It pays salaries. So the goal, Israel says, is not just to destroy the very structure, the concrete structure of these financial institutions, but also to evade the trust between Hezbollah and the Shia community in Lebanon. Now, Israel is not backing down. In fact, it is doubling down. The country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was on the border with Lebanon just the other day speaking to Israeli troops, saying in his words that the goal is to, quote, \"clear that area of southern Lebanon to allow Israelis to return to northern Israel, these areas that have become ghost towns.\" But the fire continues to come into northern Israel as well. There were some 160 rockets fired over the weekend into northern Israel, but Israel continues to say its goals are being met, including, again, going back to Yoav Gallant saying that Hezbollah was not just being defeated but destroyed. Israel also claimed that it killed some 65 Hezbollah fighters in a single day over the weekend but the cost, the consequence of this, Rosemary, is absolutely dire. The death toll in Lebanon now exceeds more than 1,800 people and more than 9,000 wounded.",

But you also document the ongoing events in Gaza. Could that perhaps be why Israel has banned your organization, do you think?",

And yes, we're a humanitarian organization. Part of our work is to document what we see on the ground. We don't take sides. We don't, you know.The only thing that we report for our own research and analysis and publications, we report what we see on the ground, we document it, and we publish it. That is the minimum that we can do as humanitarian organizations on the ground without taking any sides. So we maintain our apolitical position and we maintain our neutrality, similar to the organization that we operate under its umbrella, which is the WHO. And we have seen consistently over the past 12 months that those organizations have effectively stayed in their lane, which is the humanitarian medical lane taking care of women children those who require immediate attention due to the blast injuries that we see literally on a daily basis when we are when we are in Gaza. I can tell you our team on the ground in the north has reported that the Indonesian Hospital, the Al Awda Hospital in the north as well as Kamal Adwan Hospital that have been bombarded multiple times or bombed multiple times in the past few days. The upper floors of the Indonesian hospital as well as Al Awda Hospital have been destroyed. The Indonesian hospital does not have electricity. Patients are trying really hard to effectively, you know, survive in this terrible environment and many families have to pull their loved ones out, you know, in literally, in the crossfire. And it's just, as humanitarian organizations, especially American organizations, to be denied entry, especially at this point, it really breaks our hearts. And I call upon the U.S. government specifically, since we are U.S. organizations, to help us reverse this decision as soon as possible.",

She says the formation of toxic foam in the river should be declared a public health crisis as it can lead to skin and breathing disorders and possibly cancer. Less than half of New Delhi's daily sewage output of 3.6 billion liters is treated. The rest gets dumped in the river.Conservationists in India are taking a novel approach to dealing with two environmental issues, invasive plant species and the plight of elephants. CNN's Bill Weir shows us how this intrepid group is taking an art installation to New York designed to draw attention to both issues. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the south hills of India, a conservation success story stomps through the tea fields. A couple hundred elephants living in relative harmony with a quarter million humans, the densest concentration of wild pachyderms and people in the world. RUTH GANESH, CO-FOUNDER, CO-EXISTENCE COLLECTIVE: They know all the elephants by name and personality. And I just thought that was the most incredible story. And if we could tell that story, we might be able to inspire a little bit more sort of close living with other animals as well. WEIR (voice-over): So Ruth and her wildlife lovers decided to spread the message of coexistence in a way that turns heads. A 100 elephant migration across America, each one a life-sized replica of a beloved individual all handmade by the people who know their wild neighbors best. TARSH THEKAEKARA, WILDLIFE RESEARCHER AND CO-FOUNDER, REAL ELEPHANT COLLECTIVE: The thing is we used to make furniture before, right? Indigenous people don't use furniture in their lives. But when we started making elephants, they're the experts. They know the elephants better than we know it. So it's an amazing sense of pride and their kind of position in society has changed. From being at the bottom rung manual laborers, they've become these very skilled artisans making these things that are traveling around the world. WEIR (voice-over): They hope to sell hundreds of these to raise millions for conservation efforts everywhere. And since their art supplies come from a toxic invader, there's also a powerful message in the medium.",

And it's choking about 40 percent of India's forests right now. So we're trying to create an economy and demonstrate a use for it so it can be removed at scale.WEIR (voice-over): Lantana can also be turned into a powerful weapon against climate pollution as something called biochar, the ancient technique of reviving farm soil with charred plants, which also locks away planet warming pollution.",
