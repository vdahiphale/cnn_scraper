Erdogan now enters his third decade in power. And Asiana Airlines says it will no longer sell tickets for certain emergency exit seats after a man opened a door midflight. The airline says the new measure will apply even if the flight is full. You may recall, this plane was about 700 feet off the ground on final approach when a passenger swung open the door.
