      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. Here our top stories today.Jury deliberations are expected to begin today in the historic hush money trial of Donald Trump. The court heard from nearly two dozen witnesses over 21 days. Haiti's transitional presidential council has picked Garry Conille as prime minister. Conille briefly served in the same role more than a decade ago. He'll now be stepping down from his current role as a UNICEF regional director. North Korea is tormenting South Korea by sending more than 150 floating bags of garbage over the border. South Korean officials say the waste is attached to giant balloons. North Korean state media says the move is to retaliate against South Korean activists who send banned materials into the North, such as propaganda leaflets, food, and medicine. Closing arguments then in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial wrapped up on Tuesday, and the jurors are set to begin deliberations in the coming hours. CNN's Brian Todd breaks down what we know about the jury and the stress they'll endure. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The foreperson is an Irish immigrant male who works in sales and hasn't finished college. He shares a jury box with a young female software engineer who lives with three roommates in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Also in the jury box, a retired wealth manager. Just a few of the 12 people who now have to work closely together to decide the fate of the former president of the United States.",

One female juror said she doesn't really follow the news. Another was not aware that Donald Trump is facing charges in other criminal cases. SHAN WU, FORMER U.S. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I worry a little bit about what experience they have in breaking down a lot of information and having to analyze it if they kind of just don't pay attention to the news that's going on. TODD (voice-over): Two of the Trump jurors, both men, are attorneys themselves. One a corporate lawyer, the other a civil litigator. Analysts say that could be good or bad. On the positive side, their skills in analyzing the law could help fellow jurors. But conversely, they could dominate the jury room.",

Melinda French Gates is speaking out about resigning from the Gates Foundation. The prominent philanthropist says she'll now focus her charity work on American women's reproductive freedom. In a Tuesday op-ed in the New York Times, she attributes the decision to the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling to reverse the constitutional right to an abortion, calling America's high maternal mortality rate unconscionable. She writes I now feel compelled to support reproductive rights here at home. For too long, a lack of money has forced organizations fighting for women's rights into a defensive posture while the enemies of progress play offense. I want to help even the match. She says she'll donate a billion dollars through 2026 to advance women's rights.
