He is in fact now selling watches at $100,000 each. Now, just to be clear, in case this distinction matters, these watches are being sold for personal profit, not for his campaign. We looked up the disclaimer on the brand new Trump watches website and it says, quote, these watches are not political and have nothing to do with any political campaign. And for those who can afford $100,000 for an 18 carat gold diamond encrusted watch that says it is Suisse made, there are other options. Trump is also selling less expensive watches for $799 or at the lowest price, $499. I guess what? This is not the first thing he has sold during his campaign. He has sold $499 gold sneakers. He sold $99 digital trading cards. Now the digital trading cards or interesting because they've been up there for a while. So we know from his disclosures that he made $7.2 million off of those digital trading cards alone. Now, we do not know how much he made from the bibles he sold because yes, he did sell bibles for $59.99 which come emblazoned with the words \"God bless the USA\". And, of course, that picture of Trump on the website. All of those items sold just to be clear, we check the disclaimers, were sold to benefit Trump, not to raise money for the campaign.

You have Kamala Harris who was leaning more and more into it and I find it very interesting that this is the place where she decides to break with the administration and say, I will be even tougher. I think that's a recognition of some of the -- of where immigration is for a lot of undecided voters. And I think this is her going back to the law enforcement brand we saw before, the presidential run in 2019. I think this is somewhat interesting though, because when we think back to where Democrats were four years ago, they weren't really saying what they wanted to do on immigration and the border. They were basically just saying what Donald Trump is doing is discriminatory, what Donald Trump is doing is wrong. Now, we have them kind of emitting a little bit that there is an issue that needs to be solved even if they're saying that our solutions are better than his. I think the only question here is, as they elevate the border as an issue, as an issue for this race, does that really entice voters to go to them over Trump? If you're a voter who thinks that immigration is the most important issue, isn't Donald Trump the one who's made that most central? That's the kind of game that they're playing. They want to acknowledge the problem. They're simply just trying to offer themselves as the solution.",

There's -- it's not without risk her going down to the border is not without risk because it does give them the opportunity to make this point that she's only been one other time. But the point is, you've got to run that risk to just peel off some of these voters. And I think she's actually doing that. She's demonstrating not just that she's presidential, she's also reinforcing her credentials as a former AG on a border state. She's also really spotlighting the point -- hopefully, she does is later today -- spotlighting the point that Donald Trump is the problem. There was a bill -- Democrats and Republicans came together on a bill which hardly ever happens in Washington. He stood in the way of it. I would also add though, if you don't mind, Erin, that he's been a total disaster on the border. I mean, the wall that he said he built is not even erected. Mexico, I still haven't seen any receipts for them paying for it. So, I think she's also going to lean into the point that he has no credibility on the issue of the border.",

Since then, they've gotten tough. The Republicans walked away from the bill. They implemented increased security at the border. Border crossings are down 40 percent.

The official said the Israel would not have attacked with such scope and power if it was not sure with a very high degree of certainty that the ultra terrorist was there. Ultra terrorist, there the description for Hassan Nasrallah.So that's the first question. Will they be able to confirm that he was killed? But then you have these ongoing strikes that we're watching play out right now that we were told earlier were because Israeli intelligence is that a number of anti-ship missiles were stored under buildings there in southern Beirut. That's what they're going after now. And the question, Erin, really, it's not just how does Iran react, how does Hezbollah react, how does it, if and when does it retaliate? But also what is Israel's next step because we're seeing a series of airstrikes continuing there -- does Israel take the next step of sending in ground forces?

Now when it comes to Beirut, the Israeli military earlier this evening issued a warning or evacuation orders that were posted on X for the residents of three neighborhoods in Beirut's southern suburbs, telling them that they will be conducting strikes on what they say are Hezbollah weapons missile facilities, asking people within a 500 meter radius around these buildings and these neighborhoods to evacuate immediately. And what we have seen since Erin is we are getting these reports that hundreds of people are on the streets, families with children and parks on the streets not knowing where to go.

They say that they feel like the parties talking in the kind of black and white language. And for folks who don't exist kind of in that demographic spectrum, they feel as if they haven't really gotten a clear answer about why of the parties have really not prioritized this issue and they don't really feel heard on it.
