Power outages at the hospital have forced them to take premature infants off of incubators. Israel's military has repeatedly said that Hamas is hiding itself among civilian infrastructure. Today, they say troops killed 21 alleged terror suspects outside of al-Quds Hospital after an intense firefight at the hospital's entrance.

They have long seen it as a -- as where Hamas has one of its most important command-and-control areas, using what should be a sanctuary, Al Shifa Hospital, on top to function under -- function down below underground and continue their operations from there.Israel is essentially very close to Shifa Hospital. According to hospital officials, they have surrounded the hospital. According to the IDF, the east side of the hospital, remains open for those who want to evacuate, but it's also clear, speaking to those inside the hospital, that many are too terrified to evacuate, even if there is a humanitarian corridor by which to do so. Israel and the IDF say they're trying to operate in such a way as to minimize civilian casualties, but the fighting, the Israeli strikes, and the operations in that area have damaged some of the outside buildings. In addition, the hospital itself, as of yesterday, essentially had to close down all of its essential units because it's simply out of supplies, and civilians are dying inside the hospital, even if it's not as a direct result of the fighting. As an example -- and you referenced this, three babies died over the weekend in the neonatal intensive care unit because the generators that powered the incubators shut down, and doctors inside have had to rely on hot water and foil to try to keep those babies alive. That's just a hint of how difficult the situation is in there as the humanitarian crisis across Gaza worsens. We are also hearing some booms, although we're not hearing red alert. It's difficult to know exactly what that is. We're going to see if we hear the red alert as I keep talking to you here, Brianna.",

So, obviously, the question now is, are these airstrikes actually deterring these Iranian proxy forces from staging these attacks on U.S. forces? And the answer right now appears to be no. Those additional four attacks that came after that U.S. airstrike last night do not appear to have resulted in any casualties or any damage to these military bases, but other attacks by these proxy groups have. More than 56 U.S. service members have been injured, including many who have suffered traumatic brain injuries from these drone and rocket attacks that these Iranian proxy groups have launched, over 50 now that we are tracking since October 17. Now, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, he did speak to this earlier this morning, and he said that the reason the U.S. is continuing to launch these airstrikes is to degrade these Iranian groups' ability to carry out these attacks. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  These strikes are intended to disrupt and degrade the freedom of action and capabilities of these groups, which are directly responsible for attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. These attacks must stop. And if they don't stop, then we won't hesitate to do what's necessary again to protect our troops. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, the threat has to be very significant, Jessica. And when you look at the kind of situation that we have in Syria, we have to remember we have got U.S. forces in places like Deir el-Zour and Abu Kamal. It is actually where the Iranians are, but we have forces here. We have forces up in this area. This area right here, because it's also close to where the Iranians are, it becomes a very important area for us to make sure that we protect our forces.

He said, I'm going to give them enough time to put on their case. So he allowed this. And that is where most of the day has been, focusing on all of the properties that the Trumps have. And Donald Trump Jr. testify how they had taken these properties that were often run-down, and then transform them. He used words such as -- about his father, calling him a visionary, an artist, and say he was on the leading edge. And all of that is part of their defense of how they were creating value for these properties. Mar-a-Lago came up. That, of course, is one that has been a hair trigger for the former president because a tax assessor valued at $18 million. They were showing photos of Mar-a-Lago in court, and Don Jr. said he took umbrage of that, saying that -- pointing to an atrium there that was very -- just very ornate. And he said that this atrium alone would cost more than $18 million to construct, so really trying to get the focus on how these properties were transformed into value, that there was value add, saying that his father foresaw using amenities in residential buildings, that he was also, they said, the first to make hotel-condo combinations and that other developers had followed. So, trying to inject that they put value in this, that it's more than what the valuations are that the A.G.'s office said that were inflated, so trying to get to this point.
