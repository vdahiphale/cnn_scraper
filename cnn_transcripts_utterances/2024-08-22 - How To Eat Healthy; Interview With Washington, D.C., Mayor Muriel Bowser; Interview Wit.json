But how can she make a case that she actually can handle the border, in addition to describing Trump's policies, however they are?I mean, I think voters want to know, can she stop what they see as an uncontrolled flow at the southern border? SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA): Look, I appreciate the question. It is timely. And it's also clear, not just the contrast of what you will get under Trump, mass detentions, mass deportations, chaos and fear in communities across the country, let alone the economic impact of that. But under Vice President Harris, we have already seen a significant drop in the number of people coming to the southern border, mostly to seek asylum, others not, because of her leadership and our engagement with Mexico and other countries in the hemisphere. What we're also going to get through Vice President Harris, when she becomes president of the United States, is a more thoughtful, holistic solution. We do need to address the border. Everybody of all political stripes wants a safe, secure, orderly border. But we also need to address the root causes of migration, what's causing so many people to want to come to United States. We're only going to address that through continued engagement with allies. And we cannot, President Harris will not forget about dreamers, farmworkers, other long-term residents of the United States who happen to be undocumented, but are contributing so much to the success of their communities and our country.",

Vance spoke to my colleague Jake Tapper, and he criticized Democrats. He said that there's an attempt to distract from the issues that voters care about. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So what you see from the Democrats is instead this argument that, if you want to vote for Donald Trump because you want to change the direction of this country, you're somehow a bad person. And I really think that that dark message really doesn't gel at all with the idea that somehow the Democrats are the joyful party. There's a lot of attacks on Donald Trump, a lot of criticisms of what he's done and what he's said, not a whole lot of positive vision for how Kamala Harris is going to fix the problems that plague the country.

And so he's the one trying to distract, debating crowd sizes, belittling people. If he spent as much time trying to help people as he does trying to come up with nicknames for political rivals, maybe they'd have something more to show for it. What we're seeing on the Democratic side is not just the energy of hope and optimism, but specific, concrete ideas that build on the success of the last four years. To think that we're at this point with record low sustained unemployment, inflation going down, record job creation, more people with access to health care and reducing the cost of prescription drugs, access to quality education, we're tackling climate change, people are feeling the benefits of that. And we want to continue that. And that's part of the energy driving the Harris/Walz ticket.",
