Kamala Harris and Donald Trump hold competing events in the pivotal State of Michigan. Mission to Moscow. South Korea accuses the North of sending troops to Russia to support their war in Ukraine. Behind bars. An exclusive look inside Singapore's Changi Prison, where drug trafficking can lead to death row. And Koala conservation, Australia's national symbol, is under threat. We speak to the foundation trying to save them. That conservation conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make whirlwind stops in Michigan with both campaigns focusing on a handful of swing states. Harris is meeting with labor leaders in Lansing, Michigan, of course, the headquarters of the U.S. auto industry. The vice president also trying to go on the offensive, attacking the former president's fitness for office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  He is ducking debates and canceling interviews. Come on. And check this out, his own campaign team recently said it is because of exhaustion. Well, if you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether you are fit for the toughest job in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a critical state to wing -- to win, and it's swingy. We know it is because Trump won it in 2016 by a tiny sliver of votes. Then Biden took it, of course, in 2020. The question for me really is how many undecided voters really are there out there to win, or is this simply about ensuring that everybody who can vote does? LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR POLITICS, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND EDITOR, \"A RETURN TO NORMALCY?\":  There are a handful of undecideds, and if the race is as razor thin as it appears to be, maybe they'll make the difference. But I think, really, this is about a turnout, and it's about motivating your supporters. And as usual, Democrats have a little bit tougher job than Trump supporters do. Trump supporters are so energetic that you worry about their hearts sometimes. But the -- it's not that Kamala Harris' supporters aren't enthusiastic, but there are a lot of Democratic voters who really need a push to get out there. Now, the good news for Harris is, the Democrats this year, her campaign, has a much better get out the voter apparatus than the Republicans do. So, that will help her.",

A recent ABC News and Ipsos survey had Trump winning with men by eight points, and it had her winning with women or at least leading by nine points. So, we do have this sort of sexist gap, not sexist in the truest sense of the form, but sex gap, let's call it, between men and women and the two candidates.

People hymn and haw, and then at the very end, they support the nominee of the party they've always identified with.

The group refuses to release any hostages until Israel withdraws from Gaza and frees Palestinian prisoners earlier. Israeli leaders met to discuss their next move with sources telling CNN since Sinwar's body could be used as a bargaining chip to secure the hostages' release. U.S. President Joe Biden and other western leaders say Sinwar's death offers hope for a ceasefire. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv for us tonight. Jeremy. It feels as though Hamas is digging its heels in here and saying, look, unless the war ends, unless Israel leaves Gaza, we're not going to hand over the hostages. Meanwhile, the Israelis are saying, look, unless you hand over the hostages, we're not going to leave Gaza or consider any movement further.

And so, that reality is finally reached us here in the capital, what Cubans have been living in other parts of this island for now for four months. And that is fueling an exodus. That is the largest exodus of Cubans in the history of Cuba, you know, since the Cuban revolution, and that's just because, you know, people don't want to live in a situation where they have to cook with charcoal, where they do not have water, and they have to go to a well and carry water for several miles. You know, people are living in a way that people typically have not lived in this country in the last century. And it is forcing them to leave.

Their habitat is under pressure from land clearances. This heartbreaking Greenpeace footage video highlights climate change, disease, road accidents, and even dog attacks are also dangers. Now, despite the launch of a 10-year recovery plan in 2022 by the federal government, the population decline has not yet reversed. Lost and looking for homes, some are turning up in suburban backyards, climbing power poles, hiding in swimming pools and other risky places. Now, the campaign group, the Australian Koala Foundation, is pushing for legislation called the Koala Protection Act to save the marsupial and millions of other species, which rely on woodland. Deborah Tabard is the CEO of the foundation and she joins us live now from Brisbane. Deborah, thank you so much for joining us on the show. I think everybody thinks they're cute, believe that they would be protected. So, why have we seen a 30 percent drop in koalas just since 2018?",

So, there has to be a balance between necessary city development so that people can work, so that people can improve theirlives, but at the same time, the habitat, the wildlife and trees, of course, have to be protected as well. I know the federal government's committed, I looked at it, 76 million Australian dollars to support the recovery. Queensland added its own 32 million dollars and said that there was around 700,000 hectares of koala habitat in the southeast, half exempt from any kind of development. So, the first question is to do with the money and whether that's enough money. And then the second was that half exempt from any kind of development. Deborah, what are the rules around development and how protected really are the habitats for koalas?",

There has to be a point at some stage where everyone says, go build the houses wherever. I mean, I've driven this country, which is 1.25 million square kilometers, which is koala habitat, for 30 years. There are so many places where we could be putting sustainable housing. We worked with a developer in 1994, our Koala Beach, where we sort of encouraged people to live harmoniously. No, it's time for our world to really say we are going to bite the bullet now. We won't wait until 90 percent of the habitats are gone. It is now. And I am hoping that our country and people around the world will support a Koala Protection Act, a bit like the Bald Eagle Act. And I have found great support from environmental lawyers in the United States who have taught me this is the only way the koala will be saved.",
