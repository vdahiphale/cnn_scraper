And this is what people in Washington are having to contend with, the new 119th Congress, those Congress members having to step out into the snow as the first winter storm of the season kicks on.I'm Isabel Rosales, live in Atlanta. Thank you so much for joining me today on CNN NEWSROOM. Let's get right to it. We begin on Capitol Hill, where Speaker Mike Johnson has just officially been sworn in as the speaker of the House of Representatives. He retained the gavel after a dramatic vote. Two of the three Republican holdouts for his speaker bid, Congressman Keith Self and Ralph Norman, changing their votes from no to yes after sources say they received calls from the President-elect Donald Trump. That was enough for Johnson to get to that magic number 218, with just one Republican Thomas Massie voting no. It is a major win for the speaker, avoiding the chaotic and protracted battle that we saw for the gavel with his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, and what he experienced at the start of the last Congress. All right, let's get to CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox on the Hill. Lauren, avoiding the snow there as best you can. I'm sure it's not -- not pleasant. A very wet and cold out there. Can you walk us through what happened and how Johnson managed to get to that number 218?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. We're -- going into day, obviously, Speaker Johnson was watching really closely what that vote count was going to be. And then there was a little bit of a moment where it wasn't clear how many no votes he was going to have. And that was because there were about six members who abstained from voting in the first round. That means they simply pretended that they weren't in the chamber, even though we saw many of them with our own eyes, essentially just ignoring their name.That really added to the suspense in the room. Meanwhile, you had three Republicans who voted against Johnson. One of them, Thomas Massie, had been warning for weeks that he was going to be voting against Johnson. But those two other members that you mentioned, those folks were not surprises, but they certainly were members that I think Johnson had not necessarily been counting on. Obviously, a huge game changer happened when what you saw was Donald Trump having a phone call with those members, making his plea that if they were committed to moving forward with Donald Trump's agenda, then they had to get to yes, on Mike Johnson. And there are a few reasons for that. One of them is they are staring down a certification of the election on January 6th. That's just on Monday. So, just a couple of days away. Beyond that, we know what happens if you have a protracted speaker's fight. We saw it when Kevin McCarthy was ousted. It took House Republicans three weeks to find another candidate. There was no clear second place member. There was no clear sense of who that would be if it weren't Johnson. And I think that went a long way to convincing some of those members. We should also just note that Johnson has been making some promises about how he's going to govern moving forward, that he's making clear that he wants to cut spending. That is really important to some of those conservative members in the House Freedom Caucus. He's also making it clear that he wants to move forward with a larger tax package, renewing a lot of Donald Trump's tax cuts. That's something that, again, was really important to some of those hardliners who wanted to see that moving forward.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Look, Trump you know, Trump is the undisputed leader of the Republican Party and he will have sway over this very small and fractious Republican majority.But to me, the big -- the big indication of today is that is that it really reinforced the message of the battle in December over funding the government and maybe the attempt to, you know, lift the debt ceiling. It's that the pressure on Johnson is coming almost entirely from the right and around one very specific issue above all, which is cutting government spending and potentially launching big cuts in entitlement programs, particularly Medicaid, maybe others. That is really going to define this. I think Republican House, and it may push Trump toward positions that he will resist and potentially regret, in the same way that the Republican House desired to execute big cutbacks in government led to the effort to repeal the ACA, Affordable Care Act, which was the lowest moment of his first term. So the dynamic here is that the right is the squeaky wheel in this House Republican majority, and that has big implications for governing over the next two years.",

      "sentences": "And, Leigh Ann, I think it's curious that it's nine Republicans who voted no or didn't vote originally in this first and only ballot. Nine is the number needed to do a future motion to vacate against Johnson under this new rules package.Is that a threat? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST'S EARLY BRIEF:  It is definitely a warning to Speaker Johnson that he is being watched and that he must fulfill his promises to reduce spending. That is -- remember when Speaker McCarthy was removed from his job? It only took one member to start that process. It was a big win for Johnson and some of the more centrist Republicans earlier this year, when they got that number increased from one Republican to nine. So the fact that there were nine today who held out is a huge signal to Johnson that that they aren't going to give him much slack, that they are going to insist that he does what he says he's going to do, which is put forward spending cuts regarding this, these massive bills that are set to move forward, including a very expensive tax cuts package, extending Donald Trump's tax cuts. There's going to be a border security bill that could cost money, and there's also going to be an energy production bill and other pieces of legislation that could cost trillions of dollars, including the tax cuts. So it's going to be a very difficult job for Speaker Johnson to fulfill these promises, while passing Trump's agenda, while also reducing spending and these far right Republicans are -- they're watching closely. ROSALES:  And while having the narrowest margins in nearly a century there with the majority. Ron Johnson said this morning that he wasn't going to make personal deals to get the job or, in his words, a quid pro quo. But he did release commitments of spending reforms, creating a body to work with, DOGE, to look at government spending and audits of federal agencies. Is that not personal deals, in a way, to some of the holdouts?",
