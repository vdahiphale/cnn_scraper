I'm Bianca Nobilo live from London.Just ahead for you on \"CNN Newsroom.\" A desperate search deep below the waves after a tourist submarine heading to the Titanic crash site disappeared during descent. What we know about the search and who was on board the craft. Donald Trump facing new restrictions from the judge as his legal woes mount, were the voters paying attention to any of it? We'll have the latest from the campaign trail. And a high-stakes meeting between the world's superpowers. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says progress was made in his talks with China. But have tensions really eased? An urgent search and rescue mission is underway right now in the North Atlantic Ocean for a missing submersible carrying five people to see the wreckage of the Titanic. Three of the people on board have now been identified. Hamish Harding is the founder and chair of Dubai-based Action Aviation. He wrote on Instagram that this mission would likely be the only manned mission to the Titanic this year. And Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son, Sulaiman, were also on board according to their family. The father is on the board of trustees of the SETI Institute in California. That's a non-profit research organization. Now, the wreck of the Titanic is almost 400 nautical miles southeast of Newfoundland, Canada. It sits in two parts on the ocean floor more than two miles or almost four kilometers below the surface. A U.S. Coast Guard official briefed reporters Monday on the search efforts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. JOHN MAUGER, COMMANDER, U.S. COAST GUARD FIRST DISTRICT: It is a remote area and it is a challenge to conduct a search in that remote area, but we are deploying all available assets to make sure that we can locate the craft and rescue the people on board.

If you can imagine, not only do they have to search such a large area and perhaps challenging weather, we do know now that fog has rolled in, but the fact that they have to search perhaps an area of the seabed as far as nearly two and a half miles down. That is where the Titanic wreck is. And that is when presumably they lost contact with this submersible. It's only 21 feet long. And so, this will continue to be a challenge as the hours roll on here. I want you to listen now to the U.S. Coast Guard.",

And given the dire situation, I'm sure that everyone's trying to expedite, gear out to them in a rapid method. The ROVs are very capable. That's probably what they'll use for searching for this vessel. As far as the surface, the Coast Guard's very good at doing this so as a Canadian Coast Guard. They're very capable. If it is on the surface, there's a good chance they can find it. But as far as going in the water, it's going to be nothing manned that deep. It'll probably be ROVs.",

So, time is of the essence, and it's a matter of getting them out there rapidly and get it on site, get it down on the wreck and start looking, because it's a big wreck field. That's a small vessel.

Officials in the state of Bihar say that at least 44 people have died in recent days due to the high temperatures. The Indian Meteorological Office issued a red alert after somedistricts in that province recorded temperatures above 113 degrees Fahrenheit or 45 degrees Celsius. But temperatures are expected to cool in the coming days. Storms have battered the U.S. South in some of the same places already devastated by tornadoes over the past few days. More than 90 storms are reported across the country Monday, and more than 25 million people across the South are under a severe weather threat Tuesday into Wednesday. Take a look at this video of a possible tornado in Moss Point, Mississippi. The storm ripped through the area, levelling several homes and businesses in its path. And also in Mississippi, at least one person was killed and nearly two dozen injured when a powerful twister swept through the Mississippi town of Lewin Sunday night. The National Weather Service gave it a preliminary rating of EF3. Meanwhile, around 35 million people are under heat alerts from Texas to New Mexico, and hundreds of thousands are without power in the blistering temperatures. Meantime, the third tropical depression of this year's hurricane season has intensified over the Central Atlantic Ocean. The U.S. National Hurricane Center says it is now a tropical storm known as Bret and it will likely become a hurricane on Wednesday. It's currently churning east of the southern Windward Islands, packing maximum sustained winds of 40 miles or 64 kilometers per hour. If it becomes a hurricane, it will be the first one of the 2023 season. U.S. President Joe Biden is touting his record on fighting climate change as he makes his case for reelection.

And as you mentioned, Russia continues, according to Ukrainian officials, to focus on the east, particularly in the Bakhmut region. We know that's been a flashpoint for very many months now, but they say, according to Ukrainian officials, that Russian troops are reallocating resources to the south, to the south of Zaporizhzhya, which appears for right now to be Ukraine's major focus, rather, in their attempt to push through this land bridge that connects Crimea to the rest of those Russian-occupied positions. Absolutely, Russia has been preparing for this for months, just as Ukraine has. That means that landmines are dug in. That means there's anti-tank equipment laid out. That means there are more and more soldiers prepared to provide that stiff resistance that Kremlin wants to see. But part of the reason military analysts say why you're seeing this very slow movement from Ukraine is because they're poking, they're prodding, they're trying to find that area of weakness.
