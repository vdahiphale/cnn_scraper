And had it not been for the size of the Gaza tragedy and the president's announcement, I think what he did on Thursday would be recognized as a much bigger, more significant change in the nature of the American involvement in Ukraine or potentially so.So what the president has always said, until Thursday, is, no matter what the circumstances. U.S. weapons cannot be used against the Russians in Russian territory. He is now saying in a limited area, right around Kharkiv, you can use them. But we also know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others have now begun to say this could expand over time. And if that's the case, between now and the election, you could have the U.S. in much more direct confrontation with Russian forces. Not with the U.S. pulling the trigger but doing everything but.",

So there were thousands of people at the Socolow (ph), the main square here in Mexico City celebrating with her.She made the announcement that she's going to run, she's going to represent all Mexicans regardless of the way she voted. Today, she's been rather quiet. We haven't heard from her. she's probably getting a lot of calls from world leaders judging by the post on social media. But what she has accomplished, beyond the huge lead she took over her two contenders, is also historic. Who is she? Well, Claudia Sheinbaum, at 61, she is going to be the first woman and the first Jewish person elected as Mexico's president. Her grandparents migrated from Eastern Europe, fleeing the Nazi regime. She rarely talks about her background this way. But it is a significant achievement given that most people in Mexico are Catholics. She's the former mayor of Mexico City, one of the largest in the world. And before she was a politician, she was an academic. She is a physicist with a doctorate in energy engineering. She earned her masters at the University of California in Berkeley. And she is the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Now she was part of a large group of scientists who wrote a paper on climate change. So the group together was named as the recipient, nobody individually. But certainly quite an accomplish for this woman who is now in charge for the next six years, after October, after she takes over. But she's going to be in charge of Mexico.",

So the hardware on the rocket itself was totally fine. It was just a, bug with one of the ground computers that gives the rocket the final go to launch in those final few minutes before lifting off. But so now, over the last few days, ULA engineers have been troubleshooting that problem. They think they fixed the faulty computer. And so now we are two days away from the next launch attempt on Wednesday. I'm heading back to Florida tomorrow. So hopefully, this thing is finally a go.
