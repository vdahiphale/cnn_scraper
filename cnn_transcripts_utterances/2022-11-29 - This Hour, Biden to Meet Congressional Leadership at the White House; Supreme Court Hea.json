Lee is on the north lawn and CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju is up on Capitol Hill. M.J., to you first, what more are you learning about this meeting? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you will recall that right after the midterms, President Biden said that no matter what the final results are, he wanted to work with both Republicans and Democrats to figure out what their legislative priorities are in the lame duck and convene these lawmakers at the White House. Well, we're just learning that that meeting is going to take place this morning at 10:30. So, we should briefly hear the president speak as well before he heads into that meeting with congressional leaders. But, obviously, there are a number of very urgent priorities for this White House and Democrats, including things like raising the debt ceiling, like funding the government. They want to get more money for things like COVID, for Ukraine aid, and the same-sex marriage bill that is making its way across Capitol Hill, that is obviously something that the president hopes to sign into law as soon as possible. And then on the issue of the assault weapons ban, we obviously heard the president talking about this over Thanksgiving break. Our reporting on the Hill is that the votes simply aren't there but the White House has made clear in recent days that it is still an issue that they want to continue to at least talk about and push forward because they wanted to signal that it is a priority for Democrats and this president. Now, the reason that there is such real urgency around all of these issues is because Democrats are keenly aware that come January, things are going to really change in Washington. Governing and legislating is going to become so much more difficult for Democrats once Republicans take control of the House. So, there are a lot of reasons why in the next couple of weeks, Democrats are hoping to get done a lot of these urgent things on their top to-do list.",

      "sentences": "Yes. We probably won't hear an outcome until the spring here, arguments starting right now. But this is a case that really pits the conservative states, which have taken this hard line and this hard stance against the Biden administration because of their immigration policies, against the secretary of homeland security, which has really tried to set these guidelines for priorities about how they're going to arrest, detain and deport undocumented immigrants.So, this really all traces back to a September 2021 memo from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. He prioritized which immigrants should be deported, specifically those who are a danger to national security, those who pose a threat to public safety, also those who pose a threat to border security. Because of those guidelines, Republicans in Texas and Louisiana, they sued. They said that since federal law provides that all illegal migrants must be deported in certain circumstances, that the administration was acting contrary to federal law in that memo. The administration, of course, pushed back. They said that he had no choice but to prioritize certain immigrants for deportation since there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the U.S. and DHS really lacks the resources to deport all of them. Now at this point, a federal judge has already blocked these Biden administration guidelines. So, now the administration is fighting to get them back into effect. And, Jim, the Biden administration is really arguing here that, sure, federal law says that most undocumented immigrants under certain circumstances must be deported, but they say it is up to the administration to set these guidelines and these priorities since they have limited resources here. Of course, Republican states, this is just their latest fight against the Biden administration when it comes to immigration. We saw Republican officials busing immigrants, undocumented immigrants to Democratic-led states earlier this year, exactly, flying them to Martha's Vineyard. So, this just their latest fight here. The justices are hearing these arguments now. They'll have to decide whether these states even have the standing or the legal right to sue here. And then they'll decide whether the administration have the right to enact these guidelines. We'll see.",

But one area where we are seeing a definite slowdown is in the housing sector and U.S. home prices slowed again in September for the third straight month as higher mortgage rates continue to put pressure on the housing market.So, here with us to explain it all is CNN's Matt Egan. So, Matt, how do we talk about these numbers that we're seeing from retailers at the same time factoring in how consumers are feeling?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim and Bianna, I think it is important to distinguish what consumers say they feel and what they're actually doing. So, the new numbers out just a few minutes ago, from the Conference Board shows that consumer confidence in November dropped to the lowest level since July. And the Conference Board that said consumers have marked down their expectations for what is going to happen next in the economy. They say the short-term outlook remains gloomy and remains at a low level that suggests that the risks of a recession are high.The reason why this is concerning, of course, is because consumer spending is the main driver of this economy. People stop spending, all bets are off. But we also have new numbers out suggesting that people are still spending. Adobe Analytics says that on Cyber Monday, Americans spent a record $11.3 billion doing online shopping. That is up by a healthy 5.8 percent year-over-year. And that does appear to be real growth, not just the reflection of inflation, because online prices have actually been coming down. So, if you do adjust for inflation, then that means people are indeed spending more. I think the fact that confidence is low is a reflection, of course, of high inflation, and also some concerns about the jobs market. We have seen this wave of layoffs from tech companies and there is concerns that that could perhaps spread elsewhere. We have also got new numbers out this morning on the housing market showing that housing does continue to slow down. Home prices year- over-year in September rose by 10 percent. That is still a big gain but it is actually a deceleration from recent months. It is the smallest year-over-year gain since late 2020. Month-over-month we've seen prices actually decline 1.5 percent. This, of course, is a reflection of high mortgage rates, mortgage rates that have only gone higher in recent weeks. And Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, he told our colleague, Poppy Harlow, this morning that it could end up taking two years to get mortgage rates back down. So, Jim and Bianna, we may still see more turbulence in the housing market to come.",
