This district in West Java province. It's about 75 kilometers southeast of the capital, Jakarta where tremors were felt there.But this area, you know, buildings are not well built in this part of Indonesia. So according to officials, you know, most of the victims if not all, were crushed by the rubble. These buildings are made of concrete and because of that violent quake and the power of that quake, they just simply collapse. Hundreds of buildings collapsed, 1000s have been damaged. The death toll as you mentioned Laila stands at just over 100 but authorities fear that that is going to rise. Now, many of the injured they were taken straight to Cianjur Regional Hospital which itself was evacuated because of fears that it too was going to collapse. There are also power outages there. So, this makeshift hospital was set up outside once things stabilize patients returned but, you know, all these injured people with fractures and head traumas had been brought to the grounds of the hospital where this makeshift hospital outside has now been set up in the carpark. The military is also setting up another makeshift hospital to help with the numbers that they are being seen. But you mentioned the search and rescue operations that are ongoing. You know, there are dozens of people that remain missing and the President Joko Widodo, who has arrived in Cianjur. He has told officials there that their number one priority is to try to rescue those people who may still be alive under the rubble. You mentioned the monsoon season, that guest that you spoke to Laila talked about there being a monsoon in Indonesia at the moment that means there is so much water in the ground.
