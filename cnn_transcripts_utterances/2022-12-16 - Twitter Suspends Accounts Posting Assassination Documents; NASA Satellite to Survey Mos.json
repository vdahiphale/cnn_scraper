Musk says it was a violation of Twitter's so-called doxing policy by sharing what he called assassination coordinates. Trouble is, his explanation does not line up with the facts.CNN senior media correspondent Oliver Darcy joins us now. Oliver, tell us what the facts are here about what exactly these accounts including our colleague Donie O'Sullivan's account shared.",

      "sentences": "Well, one, Jim, it is exposing Elon Musk's lack of commitment to free speech. I think when Elon Musk came in, he talked about how he wanted to make Twitter a beacon of free speech across the world and now you're seeing that he's banning journalists from news organizations such as CNN, \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post.\" And the reason he's going this or the reason he says he's doing this is because they were supposedly doxing him.That's not true. What these journalists were doing was reporting on an account called Elon Jet, which used publicly available account information or flight information to track Elon Musk's jet. This isn't unique to Elon Musk. There are a lot of these bots that track where celebrities like Taylor Swift or Kim Kardashian are going. But Elon Musk hated this account. He did not like it. And so he changed the Twitter rules this week to ban that account. These journalists who he banned later were just covering this as a news story. And he then decided to ban them from Twitter. And I think this is raising a number of issues, Jim. Obviously it highlights how Musk doesn't really have that commitment to free speech that he said he does. But it also raises questions about what the future of the free press looks like on Twitter. Of course, you know, Twitter is a private platform so they can do what they want. But news organizations, you know, have provided a lot of content to Twitter over the years. News is sort of the life blood of Twitter. And if they decide now that they don't want to be on this platform because he's banning their journalists, I think it raises some questions about the future.",

So we'll be looking at the elevation of the top of the oceans like we've been doing for the past 30 years but with a much finer pictures that we've ever seen. They're allowing us to better understand ocean circulation.And that's critical to understanding how the oceans are eating up the heat from the atmosphere but also critical for navigation. So that is the ocean part. But on the land, for the first time ever, we have a mission that is specifically designed to observe the river, lakes and reservoirs, and that's most accessible and most renewable component of the earth's freshwater cycle.

And when you have video which depicts essentially gives a different story and a version from what the police narrative was, I think you certainly have to credit ultimately the process for looking at this more closely, the family for its activism and others for saying, look, we have to do something about this in the event that the police reports were amiss, in the event that the police told tales that were not consistent with reality.And so I think this is the first step in the process. I remind you, Jim, that a grand jury indictment simply is an indication that there is reasonable cause to believe that a crime was commit and that those police committed it.

It got little attention until an Associated Press investigation exposed a cover-up, got a hold of this video which only came out last year and then led to this investigation here. You have the act itself, right, which these indictments target here. But do you have broader potential criminal exposure here for the police not telling the truth it seems early on?",

And then you conduct a broader investigation as it relates to a videotape surfacing that tells a different story. You then present that case to a grand jury, a majority of which need to vote out an indictment and then it unravels, right?And so ultimately I think what happens and how the case moves forward and even charges we know can always be is amended, consistent with the evidence, I think the police have a lot of -- really a lot of explaining to do with respect to how he died and how they could be inconsistent, what they revealed, what they failed to reveal, and I think ultimately when it goes to before a trial jury, that's when you have a unanimous jury of 12 making a determination, I think then we'll see with all the testimony that comes out, all of the investigation that comes out, exactly what happened, and whether or not the police officers are responsible after having their day in court, will then have to answer for their potential or alleged crimes as against Mr. Greene.",

When they step off the line, they should, like everyone else be held to account. And we certainly saw that as it related to George Floyd which was a very important step in really engaging in the blue wall of silence and really getting behind that.And so I think that we are in a day and age where people are examining the evidence, examining the issues and they're not fearful that is, the jurors, to come back with a guilty verdict if that's what the evidence shows.",
