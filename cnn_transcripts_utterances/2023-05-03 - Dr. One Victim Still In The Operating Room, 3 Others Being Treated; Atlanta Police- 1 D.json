Just a short time ago, Cobb County Police Department tweeting out an update, saying that they've responded to several false reports, false sightings of this individual just about 30 -- more than 30 minutes outside of the city center from where we're standing here with this incident unfolded earlier. And it's interesting, Jake, because the same thing was happening here in Atlanta, according to the APD spokeswoman saying that different sightings of this individual, none of them had panned out. We did see a tense moment in just speaking to just how amped up police are here.And it's still very much so, an active scene. Even though this perimeter has softened up, there's still several Atlanta Police Department officers outside of the North Side Medical Center where this shooting unfolded, where 24-year-old Deion Patterson is alleged to have opened fire, killing at least one person, all of them women, ranging from 25 years old to 71 years old. The deceased is a 39 year old woman. We're told that shortly after the shooting unfolded here, that individual carjacked somebody nearby, just a few blocks away, and that vehicle was recovered in Cobb County, which speaks to why that law enforcement presence is actively looking for Patterson in the area. Still very much so an active manhunt with this individual considered to be extremely dangerous, and, of course, armed as well, Jake.",

And as you just heard Dr. Jansen mentioned, we talked about it last hour as well, you can sometimes control that bleeding by putting catheters directly into the blood vessels, which is what they did there.As you heard, these patients are still considered in critical condition. Those three that had procedures, they may likely, in fact, for almost certain, will need additional procedures over the next several days. So, this is the first type of procedure, especially to -- in the abdominal patient, for example, to stop bleeding. But then, the patient may need to come back, you know, maybe even several times now to address all the other wounds that an injury like this causes to the abdomen, injuries to solid organs, the intestines, liver, spleen, whatever else may have been injured, that's all going to need to be addressed as well.

Russian officials claim Ukraine was trying to assassinate President Vladimir Putin, though Putin, of course, was not there at the time. And Ukraine strongly denies any involvement, and there doesn't seem to be any evidence Ukraine was involved. Nick Paton Walsh is in Ukraine tonight, where the brutal war rages on and at least 21 people, 21 people were killed in the latest round of Russian attacks.

An apparent drone flies into the Kremlin and detonates right on its dome. Captured on many cameras a truly seismic allegation. Russia saying Ukraine sent two drones to kill President Vladimir Putin, but he wasn't home. As the smoke rose, these videos played out globally unverified, and the only slim evidence of the Kremlin's claim, it is a moment that carries great risk for the Kremlin ahead of an annual victory day parade there just next week. It's embarrassing, they have claimed such a breach of security happened and there will be calls for their battered military to find a way to escalate, now they have. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy on a visit to Finland today issued a flat denial. PRES. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE: We don't attack Putin or Moscow. We fight on our territory.

I've been to the Kremlin, the Kremlin is a fortress, and Putin doesn't exactly take walks around the Kremlin. There's no rose garden at the Kremlin. So, this is clearly an allegation that is false.

If you're serious about using a drone, the way you have to do it is to frankly conduct a great deal of surveillance in order to make sure that you're going to hit the right target.As far as I can see here, there wasn't any kind of surveillance involved. There were just a couple of drones that were up in the air. So, it doesn't strike me that this was a serious effort, certainly at an assassination, which is far-fetched. Was it an operation to try to create some kind of damage at the Kremlin? Who knows? I think it really smells like the Russians trying to set this up as some kind of diversion. There just isn't a logical explanation to try to use drones to try, to assassinate Putin in the Kremlin, that's just unbelievable. TAPPER: Well, it's also just -- I mean, anyone who knows anything about Putin knows -- well, first of all, the Ukrainians are fighting a war, they're defending themselves, nobody should think that they wouldn't grab an opportunity to inflict harm on the man killing their children if they could. But the idea that they would send a little drone to attack the outside of the Kremlin as a way to get Putin when I know, and I'm certainly not Ukrainian intelligence, I know that Putin's not spending the night in the Kremlin.",

Putin is -- there's a tremendous amount of security around him at that place. If you're even going to think about a possible assassination, you would look at probably at his residences outside of Moscow and near the lake. He's got a residence as well. But again, you'd have to do some surveillance to make sure that you've got a target. Otherwise, you know, you're just wasting time and not really doing anything that's going to be effective.So, I just see this as a lot of baloney that the Russians are throwing out there in order to kind of justify any further action that they're going to take against Ukraine.",

He also had some of his own interactions with Pence. We don't know exactly how that went, though we are told from one source that it was respectful between the two men.

For the 10th straight time since March of last year, the Federal Reserve announced it is raising interest rates, this time by a quarter point to a 16-year high. Let's bring in CNN's Matt Egan and CNN's Rahel Solomon.Matt, Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, has a lot of skeptics out there. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren told me six weeks ago that she thinks that Powell wants a recession because he wants to bring inflation down so he's going to have joblessness go up.

So the Fed is making it more expensive for all of us to borrow in the hopes that this is going to cool off inflation, get the cost of living back down to healthy levels. Now, this rate hike was a unanimous decision, but it was also a controversial one because it's coming just days after the second biggest bank failure in American history. These recent bank failures have been caused in part by the Fed's spike interest rates. And some experts do fear that the Fed is basically throwing gasoline on the fire, that they're going to make the banking crisis even worse. Now, in part because of this stress in the banking system, the Fed is signaling that it could be ready to soon wrap up its fight against inflation. The Fed made changes to its statement, and Fed chair Jerome Powell, he did drop some hints that the Fed could soon be ready to pause. But, Jake, I would note, Powell made it clear they are in no rush to cut interest rates anytime soon.",

And now it looks like they did break something in the banking system. And this bank stress could potentially cause a credit crunch or even a recession.
