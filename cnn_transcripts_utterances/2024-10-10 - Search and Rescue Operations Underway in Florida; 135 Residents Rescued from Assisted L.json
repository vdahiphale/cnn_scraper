You're looking at a very, very active search and rescue operation that is a SHERP, that vehicle you're looking at right there, able to go into the deep flood waters that they're experiencing right now at the University Mall area.This is strange scene for this area. This sort of flooding, this does not happen here. Behind that vehicle is actually a sign of the great American Assisted Living Facility and that is where deputies have just rescued 135 members. Let's move this camera to the right, right here, and you're going to see them right here. Many of them elderly, many of them elderly, many of them need to use wheelchairs or walkers, and what they're doing right now is they've been rescued out of those floodwaters by Hillsborough County deputies and Hillsborough County Fire Rescue. And what's going to happen is they're going to be loaded into a school bus, like we saw just moments ago, the bus full to the brim with these people, for the assisted living facility, and they're going to take them away to a shelter or somewhere that they can get the appropriate attention, food, water, shelter, medical attention, most importantly. I spoke with somebody here named Gary, who was inside of that assisted living facility, and he told me the water came suddenly and up to his knees that it was scary. The sheriff here, Chad Chronister, this was actually his district when he was a rookie. And he tells us that he has never seen anything like this in terms of flooding for the University Mall area. And this is not the end of it. They have set up a command post, Jim, because, yes, they got all of these people out, but there's other people stuck in homes and in an apartment complex. I'm told by HCSO. So, they're going to be busy going door-to-door here and getting people who are trapped by these floodwaters out.",
