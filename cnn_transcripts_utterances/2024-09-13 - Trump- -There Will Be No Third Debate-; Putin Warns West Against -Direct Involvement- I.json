And you know, I have to say having covered Trump, since the first time I interviewed him one-on-one was way back in 2013 when he was first considering running for president and this was the thing that kept him above all of his primary rivals in 2016, it is something that ultimately helped lead him to victory, his dominance basically over various rivals. That is the thing that of all of the realities that we saw on the debate stage seemed the most changed to me and it's clearly his team didn't want to be tagged with backing away from this, but that's fundamentally what they're doing.",
