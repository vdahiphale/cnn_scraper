      "sentences": "Coming up on CNN, the four-time indicted, twice impeached, one-term president Donald Trump takes the stand as a defendant in a New York civil trial, accusing him, his sons and other Trump Organization executives of business fraud.  And it's now been one month since the horrific Hamas attacks on Israel, and as the war rages on. A UN official says the death toll in Gaza from Israeli airstrikes defies humanity.Wherever you are around the world, thank you for joining us. This hour, we begin with an historic day in a New York courtroom. For the first time in more than a century, a former U.S. president has taken the stand as a defendant. And Donald Trump stayed true to form, during 4 hours of testimony insulting the court, insulting the judge, and insulting the prosecution, while repeating his favorite and blatantly incorrect claims from the campaign trail, calling his criminal charges part of a political witch hunt and election interference. On the stand Monday, he also boasted about his wealth. The trial in New York is a civil case, which means Trump does not face jail time, unlike his 4 criminal indictments. But this New York case strikes at the very heart of Trump's business empire and could end with a ban on conducting business in New York State ever again. In a pre-trial ruling, Trump was found liable for fraud for inflating the value of his properties in order to receive more favorable loans. The judge, who has appeared visibly annoyed with Trump's combative performance, will ultimately decide the outcome of the case. Trump's legal team has threatened to file a motion for a mistrial. CNN's Chief Legal Affairs correspondent Paul Reid has a closer look at what happened in court and what might come next.

And on his role in preparing the statements, I accepted it. Other people did it, but I didn't say make it higher or make it lower, he said. When asked if he maintained accurate records from August 2014 going forward, Trump said, I hope so. I didn't keep them myself. Trump was also questioned about the valuation of his assets, including his Trump Tower apartment, which financial statements show a more than $200 million value drop in 1 year. I thought the apartment was high, he said, adding, we changed it, and saying different property assets were both high and low. Trump has long claimed his Florida Mar-a-Lago property was undervalued, saying today it is worth $1 to $1.5 billion.",

It was the accountants. It wasn't me. He said, in fact, to the New York attorney general, you're wrong. I didn't overvalue. I undervalued because I am worth so much money. The Trump brand brings all of these properties up.So, it was interesting legally and politically. You see the kind of convergence of this argument of I am worth so much money.

Now, of course, there was 7 counts in this complaint and the judge granted summary judgment, as you noted, on one of them, finding that there was in fact fraud, that Trump committed fraud, the Trump organization. But there still are six other counts where the judge is looking at potential liability. And when you are extremely combative and non-responsive with the judge, who again is acting as a jury, that's not a great legal tactic.The fact that he was so aggressive and critical of the judge indicates to me that he largely thinks this is lost, at least on liability, likely on remedies. And so, he is making his case to the voters to say, see, I told you it was a witch hunt. I told you it was election interference. And the fact, again, that he pulled no punches indicates to me that he thinks this is largely lost. Now, of course, the defense has not put on their case yet. They estimate that their case will last until mid-December.

And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says once Hamas has been destroyed and the fighting ends, Israel will be responsible for Gaza's security for an indefinite period of time. Netanyahu made those comments during an interview with ABC News, his first public remarks about the future of Gaza once the war is over. And until then, he stressed, there will be no ceasefire with Hamas until the militant group releases all their hostages.And now, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank, more than 10,000 people in Gaza have been killed during the month-long Israeli offensive. A senior UN official said that number defies humanity. For more, live now to journalist Elliot Gotkine, So, Elliot, you know, Netanyahu didn't go into all the detail here, but what more is known about the security play for Gaza after the war? And an ongoing Israeli security presence in Gaza has never been very popular among Israelis, at least in the past. How will they view this now?",

What is the plan for the Gaza Strip, especially if Israel succeeds in its objective of destroying Hamas militarily so that it can never again inflict a pogrom of the sort that it did on October the 7th. And also politically, so that it can no longer remain in power in the Gaza Strip.Now, there's been talk about potentially the United Nations coming in, perhaps Arab states. I suppose the most elegant and convenient solution for the Israelis, the US, and many other countries internationally would be for the Palestinian Authority to come in and take charge once again in the Gaza Strip. Of course, it lost power in the Gaza Strip when Hamas violently seized it in 2007. But of course, the Palestinian Authority is, to begin with, lacking in legitimacy. The president, Mahmoud Abbas, is now in his, what, 19th year of a 4- year term, and there's no way the Palestinian Authority will want to come in and be seen as being a puppet of the Israelis, unless by some miracle there is some grand plan or bargain which leads towards a two- state solution. So that seems to be a non-starter. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was asked in this interview with ABC News last night, gave his thoughts as to perhaps part of what comes the day after this war ends. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Arriving ambulances are packed with as many people as they'll fit. This girl is one of the luckier ones.

Two hundred fifty-eight education facilities damaged, 39 health facilities damaged, 16 hospitals and 32 health care centers out of service. That's about half the medical system in Gaza.The Israelis will say, as you mentioned, the damage is because Hamas is deeply embedded within the civilian infrastructure of Gaza, which is true. But with the offensive now intensifying, what does it say about the strategy and the overall objectives, not just in the short to medium for Israel, but also long term? What does it say about the plans they have for Gaza, you know, the day after tomorrow?",

I think all eyes are on Tokyo to see whether or not these ministers from the world's wealthy democracies can agree on a firm and united approach because this -- whether or not they can achieve that, it does have implications on this grouping's political relevance going forward because we are already seeing divisions emerging within members, different concerns, different political loyalties, and different economic priorities.The French, for example, voted for a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire late last month. Even though the U.S. vetoed it and other G7 members abstained. And the, of course, the host Japan has been resisting pressure from its closest ally, the U.S., when it comes on to a full on display of pro-Israeli positions. Instead, Tokyo has been taking a, quote/unquote, balanced approach since the beginning of the war because of its own diverse interest in the Middle East, not to mention its heavy reliance of oil imports from that region. So, it's going to be very challenging for all the ministers to agree on the wording when it comes to Israel's right to defend itself and the Gaza civilian casualties, not to mention any concrete proposals to get humanitarian aid into this region. But I think they are keenly aware that what they end up saying, or now saying is closely being watched, not just by partners and allies, but also especially by critics and detractors including Russia, but increasingly China. [00:40:03] Both Russia and China, of course, blaming the U.S. and its Western allies as the root cause of this conflict, portraying themselves as champions of the developing world, and peace makers. So, they have been using the increasingly bloody war in Gaza to further justify their desire, and willingness to reshape the U.S.-led world order. So I think the G7 ministers are aware of it, and they are, that's why they are very much aware of the high stakes in terms of what they end up saying -- John.",
