Look, I'll remind your viewers and I know most of them, and you know this, we had an election.In November, all the Republicans, all the Democrats got together in their individual caucus or conference and they elected their leadership and anyone could run, you could stand up and campaign and lobby, everyone had a chance to vote and Kevin was elected our speaker, and it wasn't even close: 190 to 30 or something like that. So there is that frustration, but I think your first point is this, is Kevin giving too much. I don't think he has to this point, but he's very, very close. And I think he knows that he's very close. Well, in fact, some of these individuals said there's really nothing more he can give. There's nothing more for us to ask for. And I do believe we're at the point now where we would so weaken the leadership, if we were to concede anymore, that it would be in a very difficult leadership position anyway, it would make it nearly impossible for them to lead, which is why I think people on both sides recognize we're probably at that point. And there's very little negotiation that take place over those issues, which is why I think we're near an impasse where we can break through and have some, some positive movement.",

They didn't come to be held hostage by these people and so there is a balance.Now, if the if the alternative is to get it a little closer to that line and go ahead and get McCarthy to speakership. I guess most of them will fall in line, but this is something we've been discussing. At what point is it too much and McCarthy starts to bleed support on the other side of the algebra and that raise - that caused me to raise my eyebrows because it sounds like we're getting close.",

He says he hasn't - he's come - he's close to the line, but he hasn't crossed the line. We don't really know, because we don't actually know. We know it's been reported. We don't know it's been offered, but I don't know how much more you have to say.

And if the perception is, and I think, look, there's nothing Democrats particularly can do right now about this situation. But if the perception is that they're sort of enjoying the spectacle, popcorn and all of that stuff, I think that there'll be people out there who say, this is exactly what we don't like about Washington, each side trying to get - find the advantage over the other. Now, most of the Democrats I talked to are - they're sort of appalled by what's going on, and they want to get on with the work of governing.

Vote after vote, nomination after nomination, Democrats are united just like we were united when we pass the American Rescue Plan to get our economy back on track. United when we pass the infrastructure law to rebuild America, United when we cap insulin at $35, pass historic gun safety legislation and pass the PACT Act to help our nation's veterans.United when Democrats passed the CHIPS and Science Act to bring manufacturing back to America, United when Democrats pass the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce our deficit and protect our environment. Democrats are unified to tackle the climate crisis while Republicans are mired in their own leadership crisis. Madam Clerk, House Democrats are ready, willing and able to get to work for the American people, we will do so under the leadership of Hakeem Jeffries who has a plan for the American people. Therefore, as Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus, I'm directed by the vote of our caucus to present for election to the Office of Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 118th Congress, Representative-elect from the state of New York, Hakeem Jeffries.",
