Interest begins accruing again today on student loans for the first time since March 2020. Borrowers won't need to take any action until their first monthly payment is due. And drivers will see gas prices near all-time highs today heading into Labor Day weekend. The national gas average is $3.83, just short of the record set in 2012. Tropical Storm Idalia beginning to make its way back out to sea after lashing Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, but officials say the threat isn't over. Here's a live look at Virginia Beach. They're warning beachgoers over this holiday weekend to be cautious of dangerous rip currents. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar has the forecast. Allison -- I mean, does this mean people should stay out of the ocean this weekend or is it just about being cautious?",

You want to take advantage of the nice weather.But yes, there are going to be some pretty high surf, waves up to 10 feet, and the rip current threat pretty much up and down the East Coast for the most part. So, yes, if you do have plans to go to the beach just make sure you are extra cautious. Pay attention to the flags and any advice that the lifeguards may be giving in certain areas. Elsewhere across the U.S., the big concern is going to be heat building in the Central U.S. and also, we've got some very heavy rain that's been making its way across the Desert Southwest. Several flash flood watches and even flood warnings across the Southwest at this time -- specifically, that area stretching between Phoenix and Las Vegas. Those are going to be two areas of concern today. But it also stretches down into Tucson, as well, and up into portions of Utah. For tomorrow, a similar area but we start to see it spread a little bit farther to the north, looking at the potential there for some isolated flooding. The Central U.S. -- you're going to start to see that heat begin to set into place this weekend, then it begins to spread across portions of the Northeast and into the mid-Atlantic as we start off the first full week of September. Take a look at this. Minneapolis, 100 degrees. Yes, still looking at triple-digit temperatures Sunday. Their average this time of year is only 78 degrees. Chicago not much better. Going to see those temperatures getting into the mid-90s for the holiday weekend. Their normal high is just about 80 degrees. Again, you've got a lot of these areas that are going to be looking at temperatures -- we're talking 20, even as high as 30 degrees above average. So it's no -- it's no surprise you're going to have about 100 potential record temperatures as we go through the holiday weekend. The vast majority of them again focused across the Upper Midwest but as that heat spreads you're going to start to see some additional records beginning to pop up across the Northeast, as well as the mid- Atlantic. So stay -- try to stay as cool as you can for this final summer weekend. Omar, back to you.",

Is there any reason to think that'll change? STEF KIGHT, POLITICS REPORTER, AXIOS (via Skype):  They are going to have to see whether we continue to see these episodes. Obviously, these concerns and questions around age -- the age of people leading our country continues to come up. It's not just McConnell, of course. We also saw similar conversations around Dianne Feinstein as she's been missing for months because of her own health issues. She's 90 years old. And that's also impacted Democrats' ability to push judicial nominations through. This is a question and a conversation we keep coming back to over and over again in the 118th Congress, which is one of the oldest Congresses in history when you look -- when you're looking at average and median ages there. So, of course, right now, we're seeing people kind of rally around McConnell.

All of those images, of course, add to people's concern about Biden's age.But you do raise a good point that Trump also is not young. He's 77 years old. He is also nearing 80.
