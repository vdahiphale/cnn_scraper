But we're talking about, first of all, Donald Trump's base, people who are already in favor of voting for him. And that is a huge number, because one of the things that Donald Trump's campaign is relying on is the fact that his base always turns out to vote for him. The other reason why that number could be concerning for members of his team is because both Biden and Trump believe that this election is going to be decided by such a narrow margin of voters that 7 percent of his base could be a huge problem for them. But they say they have seen time and time again that his legal peril does not cause problems for him, either with fundraising or in the polls. Obviously, right now, we are in uncharted territory. We just aren't sure what could happen.",

      "sentences": "It could. First of all, this still has to go to trial or some other hearing. The court's action today did not say the claims were true. It just said that if they were true, it would be a First Amendment violation.This dates in part to 2018 and the terrible shooting in Parkland, Florida, where 17 children and staff members were killed. And after that, you know, there was a backlash against the NRA. And New York state officials thought, you know, let's use some of our power to leverage insurance companies that underwrite NRA claims. And at the time, there was some investigation going on in New York having to do with insurance policies. But this action that the NRA has brought to the Supreme Court was separate. And essentially, it said that the superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services really tried to muscle the insurance companies and make a deal with them that said would say, you know, as you said, Boris, cut your ties. Don't do any more business with the NRA. In return, we will be more lenient on your companies. Today in the courtroom, Justice Sotomayor said if those allegations are true, it can go forward. Here's kind of the key part that she said from the bench. At the heart of the First Amendment's free speech clause is the recognition that viewpoint discrimination is uniquely harmful to a free and democratic society. She went on to say that this Maria Vullo, who was, you know, head of this department, quote: Threatened to wield her power against those refusing to aid her campaign to punish the NRA's gun promotion advocacy. If true, that would violate the First Amendment. Now, she said nothing in the -- Justice Sotomayor said nothing in the ruling would stop government for going, investigating gun groups or advocacy groups for true violations of the law, or even stop government officials for trying -- from trying to kind of pressure or use their own soapboxes to try to, you know, get their messages out there. But in this kind of case, if the allegations are true, it goes too far. And this is what Justice Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said in the end. Ultimately, the critical takeaway is that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from wielding their power selectively to punish or suppress speech directly or as alleged here, through private intermediaries. So, you know, it will, it will definitely this decision will offer a guide to government officials who would like to encourage a certain kind of behavior, but not to have them go too far.",

The opinion confirms what the NRA has known all along. New York government officials abuse the power of their office to silence a political enemy. That's that sentiment of feeling like it's a landmark for them is good. But it's not quite yet. What it is, is it's on the law. The justices were basing this in their own First Amendment precedent going back six decades. But they also said, we're not deciding whether the facts here are true or false. We're just saying if they are true, there would be a violation. Now it goes to lower back to lower court for a hearing.",

I wrote two books, also two books about the KGB operations in the United States in the 1930s, 1940s. That was the golden age of Soviet espionage in the United States. Why? Because the situation was favorable. And one of the results of it was that just a bunch, a few operatives stole the secret of the atomic bomb. They really shaped the world. By the way, one of them was my instructor in the KGB spy school. You would never guess that he did something like that. But he was a very ordinary-looking man, Anatoli Yatskov. So, you know, it doesn't depend on the number of operatives working in some country. It depends on the political situation in that country.
