Kamala Harris about to close it out in Philadelphia with an assist from Oprah and Lady Gaga. Donald Trump, meanwhile, sticking with his 2016 and 2020 tradition of holding his final event in Grand Rapids, Michigan.Good evening, I'm Laura Coates. On this Monday night, as this wild 2024 campaign nears a close, the question now, are we headed to a photo finish, a blowout? Well, tonight, the candidates make their final pitch. And tomorrow, it's you, the voters, who will ultimately decide. Let's get to CNN's Jeff Zeleny at the Harris rally in Philadelphia. Jeff, a massive focus on Pennsylvania for her in these last several hours. What is the message she's hoping to drive home at this final event?",

She has been traveling across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania all day long. She has just flown here from Pittsburgh. She'll be standing on the steps here of the Philadelphia Art Museum. They may be familiar to many of our viewers from the \"Rocky\" steps. Of course, that is a movie, this is real life. But Vice President Harris, in her address tonight, I'm told, will urge her supporters to work one more day, fight one more day, and then turn the page. There is a sign that is above her crowd here that says, \"A President for All.\" Those four words simply sum up her closing message.You know, this has been a long campaign, really 105 days, so short by modern standards, but certainly divisive. But in the final hours of this race, Vice President Harris has been saying that she will be, indeed, a president for all. She has not mentioned -- she has not been mentioning Donald Trump's name at all. I'm told she will not do so again tonight. But there is not overconfidence in the Harris campaign. One advisor tells me overconfidence loses elections. The reality is that more than half of the electorate here in Pennsylvania will be voting tomorrow at the polls. That means that this is a hard scrabble fight between the Harris campaign and the Trump campaign to turn out their supporters. So, she'll be addressing the crowd here with a bit of help from Lady Gaga and some other star power. But again, her message is one more day of work. This campaign is not yet over. Laura?",

But tonight, and in really the closing hours and a few days, she has been focusing on turning the page. She will be talking about that again here tonight.Laura, I can tell you, we were at a rally eight years ago here in Philadelphia with Hillary Clinton. She thought that she was on the cusp of making history. That did not happen. So, there is much more, I would say, a sense of a wary apprehension, certainly excitement and cautious optimism, but there is no overconfidence here. Again, the words of that advisor, overconfidence loses elections. Laura?",

I think you've seen the fundamentals shift in a way that have not been done in a long time. I think you see Georgia and North Carolina coming home. I think you see African-American voters.I don't know if you all remember this, but there was a time in which we came on CNN and talked about if Black voters are going to go to Donald Trump because he gave us gold shoes. I don't know if you remember that. But that ain't a thing. You saw \"The New York Times\"/Siena poll. He was at 9%, which was 3% less than what he polled in the exit polls in 2020. And so, I just feel I'm in a kind of Zen (ph) mode. I'm not where I was in 2016, which was overconfident, but I am kind of Zen (ph). I think that this woman from Oakland is, in a couple of days, going to be called Madam President, and that's okay. And I think that what we're going to see over the next few hours, is that that coalition of young voters, Generation Z, has gone ham. By the way, that's -- where is my camera? That's a colloquialism, which means -- (LAUGHTER) -- that going ham means that they are exuding confidence. They're doing everything they're supposed to do. They're above and beyond. And so, I believe Gen Z has gone ham. Women, we're going to see that demographic go and expand. African-American voters coming home. And what people don't pay attention to in Georgia, AAPI.

We haven't seen African-American turnout in the south, I think, where Democrats -- at least we feel confident where it is. I think African- American turnout in Philadelphia, Wayne County, Michigan, I'm watching that very closely. If it comes through in large numbers, it's a good sign for Kamala.

Democrats have to win their races early, Republicans generally win them on Election Day, and the margins don't add up right now for the Democrats in any of these battleground states. And trust me, Karen, I was there in '16, I walked off the plane in New York, and I thought if the election had but happened on Sunday, we would have barely one.

So that is what is there.But to your point about the math, I mean, we don't want to leave the viewers uneducated. Let's talk about the math. When you talk about a state like Georgia, for example, and what you've done in early voting, is you have exhausted all of your voters. In all the rural counties in Georgia, they're at 96, 98%. That is phenomenal. What you all have done with early voting for Republicans has been great.

Then September, it was a four-point lead over Harris. Then it now is a three-point lead with Harris over him, which made people think, is there this eighth swing state that might be happening? And it was about those independent voters who may be exhausted by the nostalgia as opposed to encouraged by it.When you're looking at the final messages of these two candidates tonight, this is their final chance to do so, how are they talking to those independent voters? Are they going the Nikki Haley route? Are they going the, you know what, it's the existential crisis? Or are they going the granular details about the economy? BARRON-LOPEZ:  Well, Trump is not going the Nikki Haley route. I mean, he never asked Nikki Haley to go out there to campaign for him, despite her saying that she would be willing to do. But Harris, and you talked to Jeff about this while he was at the rally, but Harris has slightly shifted her tone in the last few days. She's not naming Trump specifically in her campaign speeches. She is trying to go after those Nikki Haley primary voters, those Liz Cheney- type Republicans. That's been a big part of her campaign this whole time. So, it's winning over those independent, disenchanted Republicans at the margins now and hoping that she's able to get over Biden's 2020 numbers with that same type of voter demographic. They're optimistic that they can. So, she's trying to make this argument on a bigger character scale of -- you know, her final closing ad says that Americans are neighbors and we view each other as neighbors, not enemies. So that's what her closing message is, which is again that she wants to represent everyone, that she wants to include Republicans in her administration. And Donald Trump's closing message is one that he has been running on a long time, which is anti-immigration, which is focused on economy, which is, you know, making comments about Kamala Harris herself, repeatedly calling her stupid and low IQ. That is his message to voters.",
