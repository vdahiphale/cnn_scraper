In reaction to the new charges, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee says IRS whistleblowers had been prevented from following evidence that could have led to Joe Biden himself.With me now is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Republican James Comer from the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. Congressman, Mr. Chairman, thanks for joining us. Hunter Biden is now facing nine additional charges related to tax crimes for which he could be sentenced to a maximum of 17 years in prison. Your reaction. REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY), CHAIRMAN, OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Well, I'm not surprised. I mean, we've been talking about lots of different crimes that we found in our investigation of the Biden family in the House Oversight Committee. This is one of many crimes, tax evasion. This particular tax evasion pertains to unpaid income while he was working with Burisma. But I would argue there are other things that he received money from that he's evading taxes. We believe they've also clearly violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act. We believe they've committed money laundering crime. So, this is one crime that there's no question Hunter Biden's committed, but we believe there are many more.",

If you argue the Foreign Agents Registration Act violations, he was clearly an unregistered foreign agent for China, perhaps Romania, Ukraine and Russia as well, we don't know. We want to ask him about that in the deposition.But at the end of the day, who was he lobbying on behalf of those countries, he was lobbying his father. So, you know, Joe Biden could have some FARA liability as well. We believe that this was clearly an influence peddling ring. We don't believe it's limited to the President's son, we believe the President's brother has just as much liability.

Are we going to crater out? Or you know, is there going to be 10 percent, 15 percent unemployment?And we're not having those conversations today because of steps that Biden's taken. But that's a hard thing to communicate, because what people are feeling is, yes, tremendous job creation. Yes, wages are up. But prices are also high. And people are feeling that when they are, you know, when they're going out when they're spending their money. So what Biden needs to do, what the White House needs to do is channel some of that anger. Bring the Joe Biden populism, the Joe Biden, I'm fighting for you, messaging to their economic message. And I think you see Biden do that. He certainly talks about, you know, Scranton versus Park Avenue. And he gets that kind of, you know, his underlying view that the economy should work for middle class families and working people. But you know, the more that they can do to talk about how they're addressing prices or dressing costs, they do this with their junk fee work, they do it on healthcare costs, but the more they can really lean into that and show that he is fighting on prices.
