      "sentences": "We begin with new reporting today about the state of the counteroffensive in Ukraine.Weeks into it, Western officials are describing to me an increasingly sober assessment about Ukrainian forces' ability to retake significant territory now held by Russia. The primary challenge for those Ukrainian forces is the continued difficulty of breaking through Russia's multilayered defenses here, three defensive bands in the east and the south of Ukraine. These areas are marked by tens of thousands, tens of thousands of land mines. And here are some of those land mines as they're discovered they're in the Zaporizhzhia region, extremely dangerous to find them and destroy them. In addition to these land mines, there are also vast networks of trenches. Ukrainian forces, as they have tried to break through these trenches, the land mines and other defenses, have been incurring staggering losses in the south and the east, leading Ukrainian commanders in some cases to hold back units to regroup and reduce those casualties. A senior official said the U.S. recognizes the difficulties Ukrainian forces are now face facing, though they do retain some hope for renewed progress. Still, multiple officials are telling me the approaching fall season, when weather and fighting conditions are expected to worsen, give Ukrainian forces a shrinking window to push forward. Here's another issue I hear consistently. Western officials say the slow progress has exposed the difficulty of transforming Ukrainian forces into large combined mechanized fighting units, sometimes with as few as eight weeks of training on Western-supplied advanced weapons systems, such as the Abrams tank, which is going to be going in, in the fall. There are other new weapons systems, of course, that have been going on -- going in. We have been reporting on the Storm Shadow missile from the U.K. has been effective, but, again, something Ukrainians have to train on. A senior U.S. military official says the lack of progress on the ground is one reason we have seen Ukrainians tried to strike more often inside Russian territory to try to show Russian vulnerability. That attack outside Moscow was meant to be a very visible demonstration of that. These latest assessments represent a marked change from the optimism at the start of the offensive. Officials say expectations were at that time unrealistic, and are now contributing to pressure on Ukraine from some in the West to begin peace negotiations with Russia, but not clear Russia is interested. Some officials fear the widening gap between those expectations and results could create divisions within the alliance, which has to this point remained largely intact as we approach, well, coming up next year, Brianna, nearly two years into the Russian invasion.",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, I mean, this is a tactic that we have seen Russia use.Indeed, we have seen the Syrian regime use it, possibly with Russian tutelage. It's called a double tap. And, essentially, you hit a civilian target. Then you wait, and you watch rescue workers flood in and search the rubble, and then you hit the same place again, so you can maximize the casualties that are in that initial building, but also amongst the rescue workers too. And, indeed, we have heard from one of the rescue workers from their hospital bed, Volodymyr, talking about how he had a punctured lung and was essentially just scrambling through the rubble there, trying to get people out. Now, one of the places that appears to have been impacted here in Pokrovsk was indeed a hotel, which local officials say was empty when these two missiles, Iskander missiles, substantial amount of firepower, did indeed hit. And this is, frankly, something we have seen a lot during this war, this double tap situation. People are constantly wary of the possibility that, indeed, if Russia is able to be accurate enough at hitting the same place twice, that they may well attempt to do that, to get the most amount, frankly, of fear and chaos out of that situation. Does it amount to a war crime? Many experts would say that's the case. But it's something we have seen again and again here, Brianna.",

You and I have had extensive conversations about assessments from the battlefield. What is your assessment right now? Ukrainian forces have not advanced as much as they or the West hoped. Does that mean they can't or won't? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Absolutely not, Jim. And I liked your opening commentary, because what you said is, many analysts believed Ukraine could not stop Russia at the beginning of this war, when they were on the defensive and Russia was on the offensive. Now the tide has turned. The mission set has switched. And what the Ukrainians are now doing is attempting multiple deliberate attacks on a much larger scale with all the brigades they have as part of a large offensive operation. They're doing it with multiple combat units. Estimates say -- unsourced estimates say between nine and 12 combat arms brigade over a very large area, between 400 and 600 miles, or, conservatively, the distance between Washington, D.C., and Boston, against an enemy who had eight months to build three extensive belts, which you outlined early on. This is a tough mission. I was one of those that countered the analyst view at the beginning, saying that Ukraine could hold up against the Russians. I'm also one right now that is saying, yes, there's a lot of dour commentary about what's going on right now, but what Ukraine is attempting to do is the toughest of all missions, and it's going to take a long time.",

But this is a fundamentally different battle than it was, for instance, around Kyiv, around Kyiv, defended by small mobile, Ukrainian units, mobile weapons systems like the Javelin. This is a grinding war on flat land in the east, as you note, highly defended. Is it just a matter of time, in your view, that you believe these Ukrainian units can break through, or is there a missing piece, is there a tactical change, is there a weapons change that's necessary?",

But what you're talking about, Jim, is, the Ukrainian army is changing their way of war. They still have a lot of post-Soviet biases from their time working part of the Russian military. So they have to break that. The Russian way of war is a lot of artillery strikes, constant artillery, as we have seen the Russians do in this campaign. What we're attempting to help the Ukrainians with now is undertake that transformation of using forces in a different way. It's going to be hard. And, unfortunately, Jim, truthfully, I'm going to go back to what I said earlier, that what the mission they are attempting is the toughest one of all. [13:10:01] I have trained on this kind of mission as a tank brigade commander. And what I got to tell you is, I failed miserably multiple times in training operations. I can't imagine, when you're talking about real bullets and real enemies and real casualties, how tough it is for Ukraine to do what they're doing. You said earlier they're pulling forces back. Some of the commanders are saying, let's stop this mission. At our national training center, we could call end of mission, and then give an AAR, an after-action review of what people did wrong. In combat, unfortunately, you can't do the same thing.",

But what we have seen even in the ground campaign is, Ukraine has accepted a bunch of equipment. They had relatively few weeks to train on that equipment. They have tried to put it together. Now we're talking about air-ground coordination. That's a whole different ball game and is Ph.D. level warfare, to be honest with you. Would a modern air force applied in this situation help? Yes, it certainly would. But, unfortunately, that also takes time, not just to train pilots. And that's been the issue. It only takes a couple of months to train a pilot. Yes, but it takes a whole lot longer to get the interaction between the ground, the air, the support, and the ability to hit targets either in the air or on the ground through things like joint tactical air controllers and how you force -- Russia does not have air superiority right now. That's a mistake most people believe. They are not going forward of the Russian front lines, because they're afraid of Ukrainian air defense.",

But it also brings up an interesting tension about honoring Native Americans, who have been supportive of President Biden, especially in Arizona. This movement, by the way, 75 percent approval in Arizona. People like this. But it's a tension with the minerals needed for the new electronic age right now. Transitioning away from fossil fuels demands more copper and lithium. There is a copper mine in Arizona that's seeing opposition from tribes. There's one lithium mine up in Northern Nevada that's facing a real political fight right now.
