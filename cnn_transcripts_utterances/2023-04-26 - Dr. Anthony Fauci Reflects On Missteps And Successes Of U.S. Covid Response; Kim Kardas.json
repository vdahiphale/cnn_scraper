You referenced the work that you did with HIV and with AIDS and the outreach that you felt changed how that response was. Your outreach to that community, specifically. And you said, \"I have always felt when people are pushing back at you, even though in many respects are often left field somewhere, there always appears to be a kernel of truth. Maybe a small kernel or a big segment of truth in what they say. One of the things that we really need to do is we need to reach out now and find out exactly what it was that made them push back.\" Referencing people who did have problems wearing a mask with vaccine requirements. Who do you think should be doing that outreach before there is another pandemic if it's inevitable, as you say? FAUCI:  You know, Kaitlan, I think we all should be doing it. I believe public health officials should be doing it. People are who political leaders should be doing it. The point I was making at the end -- I felt very, very sincerely. There was a lot of opposition of do this, don't do this -- people pushing back. Those people could not all be wrong. We've got to understand what the underlying reason why they were pushing back about what looked like completely valid public health principles. There's something wrong with that. We were not doing something completely correctly because we can't have those many people who were fundamentally good people, yet they're pushing back on things that are lifesaving. We've got to figure that out and we've got to reach out to those people and not make them the opposition. That's the point I was making.",

And, you know, President Trump did understand once he started to hear these stories instead of just seeing their cases. And he went in being so pro-death penalty and really hard on crime to opening up his heart and realizing that so many people are inside that don't deserve to be and have completely rehabilitated themselves. And he passed a bill, the First Step Act, and I think almost 30,000 people have been let out because of the storytelling of one woman that changed his mind.

Accounts surfaced then of an incident that had happened more than 30 years before in which the coach, Gregg Berhalter, assaulted his then-girlfriend and now his wife. Two longtime friends of his reported the incident to U.S. Soccer officials but their apparent motivation was dissatisfaction that their son, who was the star midfielder, was not getting enough playing time. An independent investigation into the matter cleared the coach, we should note, but it did raise concerns about the organization's policies around parental conduct, how they communicate with staff, and other issues as well. Joining us now is U.S. Soccer's new sporting director, Matt Crocker. Thank you so much for being here this morning. MATT CROCKER, U.S. SOCCER SPORTING DIRECTOR:  Thank you.",

So my job is to identify the process and make sure we get the behaviors right of the coach in terms of what style of play we want to play.
