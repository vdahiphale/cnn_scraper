This is according to a city official who again has seen the video. It's not clear why the gunman stopped shooting. Officials say that a worker inside the bank said good morning to the gunman. The gunmen could then be heard telling the woman, quote, you need to get out of here. He then tried to shoot her in the back but failed because the safety was still on the gun and wasn't ready to fire. Once he had the weapon ready to go and took the safety off, he did shoot her in the back. And her condition is not known this morning.Again, these are new details. As I said, grim, new details just coming in. And we're going to have much more on this throughout the hour. Sara.",

It is trying to get this federal appeals court to block that lower court ruling, and that's because that lower court ruling, as you said, we'll go in effect on Friday. And the way the federal judge wrote his opinion, he did not leave much room for the FDA to sort of look at the issue and maybe unwind it in a timely fashion. That's why there is such -- there is this urgency.And in these new briefs, the Department of Justice basically said that that judge got it wrong. He got it wrong on threshold issues, and he got it wrong when he was talking about the heart of the case. Here's what they said. They said in the brief, the district court order would thwart FDA's scientific judgment and severely harmed women, particularly those for whom Mifepristone is a medical or practical necessity. And we've seen doctors here signing these sworn declarations, and they say this is safe. It has been on the market for more than 20 years. And in addition, they say that the FDA here has authority and medication abortion right now is used in the majority of the abortions that are being carried out.",

And we have such a strong scientific background. We are -- just would be totally outraged if the courts did not recognize that. Now the court, as you know, a district court judge in Washington state issued an exact opposite ruling, which required the FDA -- in the 18 states subject to this lawsuit, to require the FDA to continue the approval process. But as I've indicated, in our state, under our state law, regardless of what the Supreme Court does, we intend to continue to distribute this product under state law. We believe we're confident in that and our ability to do it. That is why we went ahead and acquired the product so we would have it under state law to distribute to women in the state of Washington.",

This is not the only challenge. We have a challenge in Idaho, our neighboring state, which is trying to interfere with a constitutional right to travel across state lines. That is going to become a front in this effort as well. And so what I would say is, we've got to follow democracy but also be creative and aggressive. We have been, in Washington state.

We condemn the Kremlin's continued repression of independent voices in Russia in it's ongoing war against the truth.
