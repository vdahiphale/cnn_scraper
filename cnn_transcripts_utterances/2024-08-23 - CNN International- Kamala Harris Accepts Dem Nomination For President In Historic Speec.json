Harris set out clear differences between her path forward and the one laid out by Donald Trump.

And he went on Fox News after Harris wrapped up. Take a listen.

She didn't talk about China, she didn't talk about fracking, she didn't talk about crime. She didn't talk about 70 percent of our people are living in poverty. She didn't talk about the trade deficit.

Let's bring in CNN National Political Correspondent Eva Mckend for more on this. So major night for Harris. Next step, they're going to hit the ground running? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Fred, were still waiting to learn from the campaign where the Vice President and the governor will head to next. But it is instructive that they did not even take a day off this week, actually holding that big rally with thousands of people in the battleground state of Wisconsin while the Democratic National Convention was happening. So that just gives you a sense of them trying to use every single day that they can. We also learned last night sort of what their theory of the case is going to be on the campaign trail in the weeks ahead. We heard the Vice President argue a country over party in what seemed like a message directly for Independent and Republican voters. She said that a defining goal of a future Harris presidency would be uplifting the middle class. She talked about the importance of fighting for reproductive freedom. We know that freedom is a major theme of her campaign. And then she forcefully made the case against former President Donald Trump, arguing that he wouldn't be able to stand up to dictators because he is an aspiring dictator himself. So those are the things that we are likely to hear over the next couple of weeks as they make their case in this condensed period, Fred.",

And then he'll hold a more traditional rally this evening in Arizona. And, you know, as much as these events all week long have been billed as sort of a policy centric topics and that they've been hoping to sort of keep the former president on that message, it's been also very clear he's been watching the DNC closely, pretty much every morning or afternoon. After a DNC, he'll sort of recap his thoughts on what happened the day before. And we expect to see that from him again today. He's already been posting on Truth Social kind of in real time his thoughts on Vice President Harris' speech last night, sort of a bizarre array of stream of conscious thoughts.

All right, just weeks after hugging Russia's President, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been embracing Ukraine's wartime President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This is a trip which India calls landmark and historic and one that will be closely watched in Russia as Moscow's assault on its neighbor grinds on.In July, Kyiv condemned Mr. Modi's Moscow trip to meet with Vladimir Putin. And during that visit, Russia launched a deadly strike on a children's hospital in Ukraine. And a short time ago, we have heard confirmation from Kyiv that it had attacked a Russian ferry said to be carrying fuel tanks. And Kyiv is also urging thousands of Ukrainian civilians to leave the eastern city of Pokrovsk as Russian troops get closer. All right, before we get to what's happening on the battlefield, I want to bring in now CNN's Mark Stewart for the latest on the meeting between the Indian and Ukrainian leaders.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. So let's begin with that claim of responsibility that was issued just a few hours ago by Ukrainian forces, saying that, yes, they did attack this ferry that was in the Black Sea, a Russian ferry. It's important because this port, the port of Kavkaz where this happened, is one of the main ports for Russia in the Black Sea.Not only does it export goods, but very importantly, it brings oil into Crimea. And apparently that's exactly what this ferry was doing when it was struck by Ukrainian forces. According to Russian troops, that ferry did sink. There were no casualties. But you have that video, of course, of smoke billowing, the fires that were -- that were sparked in the Black Sea. So yet another indication of just how vulnerable Russia's forces are to any attacks by Ukrainians. And of course, that vulnerability stretches all the way up into Russian territory itself, where in Kursk, Ukrainian forces are continuing that surprise offensive that they launched two weeks ago, but now say they are facing stiff resistance from Russian troops who have been able, of course, to redeploy and rearm. But Ukrainian officials are most worried about a very different diversion in a different location, and that's in eastern Ukraine in Pokrovsk Square. I know you played those images earlier, those very distressing scenes of families now forced to flee. Local officials saying everyone needs to get out of Pokrovsk in the next two weeks because Russian troops are advancing so quickly. Local officials saying that some families are going so far as to hide their children from these mandatory evacuations. So they're absolutely pleading with people, Russian troops are coming, get out, get to safety. Inside Russia. President Putin, although, of course, taking on these attacks from Ukraine, dealing with this assault inside Russian territory, is trying to present strength. Yesterday was Flag Day in Russia, Fredricka, and there were just these huge crowds in Red Square where a concert was held in support of the war, where you could hear people voice their love in support of President Putin. Yet another attempt there to flex muscle, to establish strength at a time when very much this war is being fought on home turf for President Putin.",

She is door number three, you know, after people were rejecting door number one and door number two.So I thought she was able to put a lot of time and emphasis into reassurance in the way I was just talking about, convincing those voters who are not inclined to vote for Trump, that she's an acceptable alternative. Because she didn't really have to make the case that she is about change. She never talked about her gender or the history making nature of her candidacy. That is just very apparent, the visualization contrast. I kept thinking last night, I wonder if you did, too, of what Nikki Haley said back in February. The first candidate who ditches their 80 year old nominee is going to have the advantage. Now, you know, if everything goes well, perfectly for her between now and November, she probably wins Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin by a point or a point and a half.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Fred. According to local officials, the Secret Service was supposed to pick up those radios and even got a personal reminder to do so and still failed to pick them up before Donald Trump's rally on July 13.And according to Butler County DA, if they had those radios on hand and they were paying attention, they likely would have heard a warning from local officers on the ground about a man on the roof before Thomas Crooks opened fire, ultimately shooting and hitting Donald Trump in the ear and also killing a rallygoer on July 13 at this rally. But like you mentioned, this is really just indicative of a broader messy picture of communication failures that happened and leading up to and on July 13. Sources are describing really this complicated web of communication structure that's used by the Secret Service to coordinate with their local officers on the ground during these big events like Trump's rallies and other large security events of this kind. And it's really something that the Secret Service is going to have to look closely at and they are looking closely at. We know that an internal watchdog is really reviewing the entire structure of how the Secret Service deals with its local law enforcement partners because right now they don't even have a structure in place to communicate directly with local officers on the ground. That was part of the problem and part of the issue that's emerging as we continue to see investigations move forward -- investigations of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Look, a task force, a congressional task force also investigating this incident is scheduled to go to Butler, Pennsylvania, next week where they're going to visit the rally site and talk to local officials. I'm sure these communication issues will be top of mind for them as they try to nail down how did this happen and how can we prevent it from happening in the future?",

Students in Bangladesh have been protesting, what they say, was the release of water from a dam in India. Our Anna Coren is in Bangladesh and filed this report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

People are walking past saying, India, India, it's India's fault. And that is the message that we are hearing in Bangladesh. That it was India that opened the floodgates to one of its dams just past the border. We are virtually on the border of Bangladesh and India and that has caused this extreme flooding.You know, Bangladesh is no stranger to flooding. It has them every single a year. And in actual fact, they have developed an early warning system, probably one of the best in South Asia. So the fact that there was no warning on Wednesday night when this surge of water came down the river, you know, Bangladeshis are absolutely furious. Now, India denies that they opened the floodgates, but it also says that there is an automatic release that is triggered when there is too much water. There has been no apology from India, just further infuriating people here in Bangladesh. But, you know, this is unprecedented. That is what we are hearing from the government, that this is an unprecedented flood situation. And this is a huge challenge as well, you know, for the interim chief advisor, Muhammad Yunus, an 84 year old sworn in just two weeks ago after the mass uprisings here in Bangladesh, which lasted for over a month and saw the overthrow of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. And I think it's also really important to stress that Sheikh Hasina has taken refuge in India. So like I say, a huge challenge for the chief adviser. He is called on the military, the army, the navy, for volunteers to come out and help the flood affected people. And the latest numbers that we are getting is 3.6 million Bangladeshis have been impacted by these floods here in the southeast of the country. It is spread over ten districts. And, you know, the water here -- there were Friday payers just a short time ago. And the people here, they are wading through. This is what they've been living now for days. I think this is really important to note that, yes, houses and have been affected. Livelihoods been affected. There's been a very low death count so far, but we just saw a baby rushed to a clinic. It had fallen into the flood waters. It was lying on a bed. The bed was surrounded by water. The one year old tumbled into the water. We've just received amazing news that the baby is alive. But the mother walked past. She was, she was screaming, she was crying. You know, this has a human impact. This is not just about houses. This is about lives, people's livelihoods. So Bangladesh is going through so much right now. And, you know, there is a real shortage of boats. So there is a, you know, truck after truck coming down the highway with boats on board to rescue the people who are trapped on their roofs and in their houses. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The FDA has approved new Moderna and Pfizer vaccines that are expected to be in pharmacy soon. The CDC recommends that everyone over six months old receive both an updated COVID-19 vaccine and a flu shot this year.CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell joining me now live with more. Good morning to you. So when will that shot be available or vaccine be available? And then when should we actually get the shots?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So it should be available within days in pharmacies. We heard from Walgreens they're starting their appointment September 6, but these are going to start arriving in pharmacies over the next coming days. So folks who are very eager to get the shot may be able to walk into their pharmacy and find it if it's already arrived there. It is expected to be widely available in September.As you said, the CDC has recommended COVID vaccines, updated ones, for everybody over the age of six months. But infectious disease doctors say it's really different for everybody based on their own health situations, when it might make sense to get the vaccine. They say for people who are over the age of 65 or vulnerable because they have other health conditions, they may want to go out and get this booster now or a lot sooner. Whereas other folks who may not be as concerned about severe COVID may want to wait until maybe they get their flu shot in October, for example, because we always do see a large winter wave of COVID at the same time as we see a large wave of the flu. Of course, a lot of people, as you said, have gotten COVID recently in this summer wave we've been seeing. And so the recommendation there we've heard from experts is you could wait about three months because that infection will give you immunity for about that amount of time, Fred.",

Right now, the one that's prevalent is called KP.3.1.1. It accounts for about 37 percent of cases.The vaccines target a strain called KP.2, but these are closely related to one another. Experts say they do expect the KP.2 vaccines to protect well against that strain, hopefully other ones that emerge, and certainly better than protection if folks got vaccinated with last year's vaccine.",
