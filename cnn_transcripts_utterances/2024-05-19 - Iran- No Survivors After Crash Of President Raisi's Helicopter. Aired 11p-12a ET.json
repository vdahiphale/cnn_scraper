I'm Paula Newton, and we begin with breaking news out of Iran, where we're learning rescuers have now reached the site of the helicopter crash involving President Ebrahim Raisi.Just a short time ago, Iranian media reported that the crash site had indeed been located after rescuers braved cold temperatures overnight searching the mountainous area in dense fog. The aircraft crashed on Sunday in Iran's East Azerbaijan province, after President Raisi and other officials and that included Iran's foreign minister attended a ceremony for the opening of a new near the border with Azerbaijan. Now, Raisi can be seen here in helicopter. That's video that we received on Saturday. Right now at this hour, his condition and those are the other passengers is unknown. Iranians are being urged to pray for the president and those aboard the aircraft. A sentiment echoed by Iran's supreme leader.

But they have also relied on a drone from Turkey that has been deployed to help try to locate the crash site. Now, the president in his helicopter had been flying back from a border region where he'd been inaugurating a dam project with the president of one of Iran's neighbors, of Azerbaijan, there was a three helicopter aerial convoy that were flying back from this ceremony. And two of the helicopters made it back safely. The president's helicopter sadly, did not. So as you mentioned, the supreme leader, who is the most powerful figure in Iran has -- he has declared that Iran will remain stable through this crisis and has called for people, of course, to pray for the health of the passengers and crew on board. But in any country, if you had a president go down in an aircraft this would be a major political crisis and a shock to society. And Iran is no exception -- Paula.",

We want to bring you the breaking news now and remind you that rescuers have now reached the site of that crash that was apparently carrying the president of Iran, but also the foreign minister and seven other people. We are awaiting for more news to see what was found on that search. Apparently, they did find this site on foot. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of rescuers really trying to scour this very sparsely populated area, rugged as Ivan just mentioned, with a terrible conditions, cold temperatures, dense fog and we will obviously remind everyone that the sun is just coming up in that area of Iraq. And no doubt that will also help them right now in their rescue efforts. I mean, Ivan, I want to turn now to what we had mentioned before, the fact that in fact the supreme leader made a point of coming on television and addressing Iranians quite quickly.

The loss of the president of the country, of the country's most senior diplomat, of a governor of a senior cleric, and, of course, the crew members on that aircraft nine people onboard there has been conflicting information. Paula, in the frantic search and rescue effort because there were officials, the vice president of the country, no less, who were saying that they had been getting some kind of messages from at least two people on board the aircraft.And I guess well have to wait and see that have been just conflicting information or not. But I think without question, the headline here is the death now of the president of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, elected in controversial elections in 2021, and perceived as a hardliner in the spectrum of Iranian politics, the most senior diplomat in the country. That's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and at least seven other people were believed to have been on board the aircraft. A question now, well turn to transition of power in the aftermath of this tragedy. The vice president of the country, who I think experts that I've talked to will argue that very few Iranians actually know who this man is a man named Mohammad Mokhber. And according to the Iranian constitution, he would then take the post of president in the country and then the constitution stipulates that in the next 50 days that a council, including this interim president, and the speaker of parliament, and the head of Iran's powerful judiciary, that they would then have to set up elections for the next president. We also have to keep in mind, of course, in Iran's unique system of government, that the most powerful, without question, figure in Iranian politics is the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei who has already come out in the aftermath of this now deadly crash to vow that that stability will continue in the Islamic republic, moving forward, whatever may happen, but also calling for prayers for the health healthy and safe return of the crew members and the passengers on board. We are now learning from Iranian state media that the president of the country and the foreign minister and the other passengers and crew have all died aboard, this helicopter crash that took place Sunday afternoon in remote mountains of northwestern Iran. So I think we can see that we can anticipate that very quickly, the people who've been praying for their safe return will now turn to prayers of mourning in Iran.",

The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps which she is at the center of the defense and the outreach and coordination with Iran's allies and proxies in a very turbulent Middle East, they are still in place.There will be questions internally in the parlor games of who could become the next leader. There are other ambitious policy petitions inside Iran who may seek to win the presidency in a future election if it is to take place. Ebrahim Raisi, while being mourned by a section of the Iranian population, his crash will be celebrated by other Iranians who have been alienated by the hard-line tactics of this man himself, and of the Iranian regime. Recall that, you know, there have been periodic uprisings in modern Iranian history since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. But over the past 20 years, I've covered a number of them I and just since 2022, there's been an uprising and many would argue a crisis of legitimacy and credibility of the current government. So, the authorities there will have to manage the next transition and how it moves forward. Then there's the very complicated international and regional picture where the shadow war that had long been fought between Iran, sworn enemy, Israel, and Tehran, that it has broken open into the open in the wake of the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza where you had just last month the Iranian government, for the very first time, fire hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel -- Israel retaliating with a direct strike on Iran. Those tensions are out in the open right now. And Iran has other enemies. It has been openly supplying Russia with Shahid drones wounds that have been launched at Ukrainian cities over the course of the last year plus, racking up a death count there. So this is a very complicated time and Iran has its own internal economic challenges as well. Some people questioning why the president of the country would have been flying in a U.S. made helicopter when Iran famously broke with the U.S. in 1979 with the Islamic Revolution. So, this will be a challenge for the Iranian authorities to manage moving forward. But much of the security architecture and the architecture of governance, despite now the untimely death of the president will still be in place moving forward -- Paula.",

A dissidents who just starting with the tenure of President Raisi, have been fearful of returning to his Iran, fearful that they would not be safe given how they express themselves outside of the country, whether its students or other dissidents. Ivan, I want you to stand by for us as we continue to follow this breaking news. Again, a reminder that are on state media now saying that there were no survivors of that helicopter crash. And that in fact they do believe that nine people were onboard, including the country's president, Ebrahim Raisi, and the country's foreign minister. I want to bring in CNN military analysts and retired U.S. Air Force colonel, Cedric Leighton. Thanks so much for joining us. I mean, listen, as Ivan was just saying, right, this is a U.S. helicopter, no doubt getting parts for it, under sanctions, wouldn't have been easy. But again, they were flying these things. How much do you think that may have contributed or as you and I know from being on helicopters, weather, and the judgment of a pilot and maybe failure of instrumentation. What do you think could have possibly going on here?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Paula, I think a lot of these factors could have combined actually to create that so-called perfect storm, where these situations could have resulted in the death of the radiant president and his foreign minister but, yeah, this helicopter was probably a Bell 212, which is an older version of a Bell model that's been really exported number of different countries throughout the years.But this particular version had basically a life that was stopped production -- production life that stopped in the 1998 or so. It was first produced in the United States and then in Canada. But it was first introduced during the time of the shah, the latter period of the shah's rule in 1976, in commercial forum. And it had life before that in the U.S. military. So the actual start of this particular type of fellow copter may have been as early as the late 1960s. So as you mentioned, spare parts would have definitely been an issue for the Iranians. But in this particular case, I think this confluence of spare parts because of the sanctions, plus, the weather in which was a very bad -- the last few days in this particular part of northwestern Iran, all of that, I think contributed to a series of incidents and a series of decisions that the pilot and possibly even the president himself made when it came to flying this aircraft in believe they shouldn't have done so under these conditions, but they did. And unfortunately for them, the result is this crash.",

And I will add, what do you think it means that this was in a convoy apparently of three helicopters and this was the one that crashed? So, only one of three apparently crashed?",

That is an interesting fact very idea, Paula, that we had three helicopters is kind of normal procedure when it comes to transporting VIPs, you have a decoy, you have a helicopter that handles one part of the party and another helicopter that handles and other parts, so that you kind of divide things up in that way to ensure the survival of a government doing that, a continuity of government average.And in this particular case, when it comes to the chain of command on the military side in the U.S. system, the pilot is the final arbiter when it comes to flight safety issues and whether or not the aircraft is supposed to fly and that goes for fixed-wing aircraft as well as for rotary-wing aircraft. And in this particular case, in the Iranian system, you wonder if there was pressure put on the pilot by some one in the president's entourage or maybe from the president himself to fly anyway, regardless of the weather, regardless of other conditions. It's probably the case that the pilot had had experienced buying in bad weather before and had obviously survived that particular incident. Are those particular incidents and so that may have thought that he could get away with it the other aircraft, the other helicopters made it safely, and, of course, there was an international relations component to this as well because the president of Iran will coming back from a visit with his counterpart in Azerbaijan, where they had inaugurated a new dam that was spanning the river that divides the two countries. So there are a lot of factors that could have happened, too, but from a chain of command perspective, the pilot should always be the final one to determine whether or not it's safe enough to fly under particular conditions.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. One of the key things here is visual flight rules as they call the, and the basic idea is that the pilot has to fly according to what he or she sees. I -- and they shouldn't have knowledge of the territory. They have maps. They have an ability to use their radar systems if they have them to navigate through mountains and through dangerous areas like this.The problem that you have in a case of this type is that they may have been pressured or even been told to fly at lower altitudes. And sometimes, low altitude flying can be very unsafe especially in dangerous weather conditions. In the military, you often fly at low altitudes in order to be radar. There may have been some thought that in order to protect the president from potential threats external to the aircraft such as a missile trying to shoot it down or something like that, that they flew what's called nap of the earth, which is basically flying along the contour of the Earth below them, and that could result in some very dangerous practices if you haven't done it enough, or if you haven't practice in that particular part of the country. So there's several things that could have gone on here that could have resulted in this disaster. But the big aspect of Paula is that there are certain rules that they would have to follow and the if they don't follow those rules, then you both radar perspective and from visual flight rules perspective, they would have to make sure that they gain enough to two to avoid mountains and other objects that could be an impediment to their, to their forward progress.",

You often slam down onto the tarmac really quickly and that's because of the altitude and because of the way air pressure works on the aircraft.But for helicopters, they're a bit more flexible than fixed wing aircraft. And in this particular situation, hard landing while possible once I heard weird occurred and under what conditions, I felt it was unlikely even before the reports came in, and was this one it was really a crash that this was anything other than that. And it seems that, you know, in this particular case, they took a situation where they I thought they could probably get away with getting the president to maybe to (INAUDIBLE), maybe even all the way to Tehran, but that's a very efforts clearly was not good enough in this particular case because what you did, and what were they ended up doing was they ended up not taking it to account the vagaries of the weather, the problem with the terrain, and really the fact that craft was just so old that that I think were all contributing factors in this case.",

Colonel Leighton, stand by for us as we continue to follow this breaking news.I want to bring in, CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak, who's joining us now. I mean, look, U.S. President Biden has been traveling this weekend. He was actually here in Atlanta giving a speech earlier, a probably around the time that this news broke, he was briefed, we're told. There's an incredibly difficult and delicate situation for the Biden administration. What more you learning in terms of the kinds of briefing that the president received in the last few hours? KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Yeah, it is delicate and I think that's part of the reason why you haven't seen the White House or the United States generally say anything specific about what's going on on the ground there, as they were working to ascertain what exactly had happened to President Raisi. Certainly, President Biden had received briefings as he traveled about the country today, but I can tell you, Paula, inside the White House, and the State Department, they were keeping a very, very close eye on this with the great fear that this could just add greater uncertainty to an already volatile situation in the Middle East, which is certainly the top item on President Biden's a foreign policy agenda at the moment. And I think for Biden at this moment, the real question is whether this will change anything. Does this portend a change in relations with Iran? Does it portend any sort of adaptation inside the Iranian government when it comes to its posture towards the United States? I think when you talk to American officials, the expectations for that kind of shift are low. So, the question now is what this means for the broader conflict. And, of course, President Biden, since October 7, has overarching goal has been to prevent a wider regional war, to avoid the us getting dragged in closer to direct conflict with the United States. And in fact, the U.S. had held indirect conversations with Iran to that front including reportedly just last week. I think part of the issue today as President Biden was working to figure out what was going on that the U.S. of course, does not have any diplomatic relations with Iran. They were sort of relying on media reports as well as countries in Europe that do have relations with Iran of sort of determine what was going on, on the ground. But, of course, President Biden has a lot of issues on its play on his plate, either directly or indirectly, tie in to whoever is in leadership in Tehran, whether its the crisis in the Middle East or the crisis in Ukraine where around is supplying Russia with drones in the us has worked to cut up that supply chains. A lot of question, I think the white going forward but not a lot of hope that this will necessarily change has been among the nine influence in all of these areas that President Biden has been focused on the last several months.",

[23:30:15] I wonder though, in terms of emboldening the proxy certainly since President Biden has come to office, Iran has continued to put the pedal down on all of its proxies in the region and showed certainly no sign that it was going to hold back. I'm wondering if you had sense any hope from the Biden administration that things could change there. I mean, many have criticized the Biden administration for its stand on Iran and certainly they didn't come to any kind of agreement with President Raisi on being able to show any moderation when it came to emboldening those proxies.",

The rescue teams themselves took 17 hours, almost two to five find the location of this crash, showing just how difficult it was to be able to locate them. They couldn't -- the rescue teams couldn't put helicopters in the air to try and find this location because it was simply too dangerous. So there will be questions about that no doubt, the fact that the president and the foreign minister, were on the same helicopter as well. We know there were three helicopters within this convoy that came from the eastern Azerbaijan province to where the president and his entourage had been at a dam inauguration with the president of neighboring Azerbaijan. We know that there were three helicopters in that convoy to managed to get back. One did not, and that was the one that was carrying the presidents and the top diplomat. Now it is a very inhospitable terrain. So helicopter really would have been the way that they would have transported VIPs. It wouldn't have been practical to go by but by road, for example, it would have taken hours and those roads in that area are certainly not safe either, but there will be many questions about the state of the helicopter, about the decision to go into the air in the first place when conditions were so bad. And, of course, we do know that the rescue teams themselves, had difficulty even progressing towards this site. They said that the fog made visibility extremely the bad. We know that there were sub-zero temperatures at the peaks of some of these, these mountainous areas. And there were concerns about being able to read which dislocation because of the cold.

Some of them have event what if celebrated in some ways.But nevertheless, its definitely a really momentous occasion as the poverty struggle between different factions in Islamic Republic is surely going to heighten now as there be presidential elections within days. And I think a lot of people are will be no be focused on that now, already we've seen the price of the U.S. dollar has risen. That means there's a -- that's been dropping the Iranian rial. So it's already making an effect and definitely we now going to enter a tumultuous period for a few weeks.",

I mean, I believe the Islamic republic itself has about sort of 10, 15 percent support around a society that's based, and if you look at elections, for example, that's the kind of number of the whole population that, that votes its for someone like President Raisi. He's -- he was handed in the presidency in 2021.This was the first truly uncompetitive elections since 1997. So for, you know, usually, Islamic republic elections have never been a free and fair, but they're often competitive. But in 2021, there was no competition. They handed to him. But after say that he's also just a -- he was a sort of an insignificant figure in some ways by which I mean that he was seen as someone who was rubber stamp. He was seen as someone who was a placeholder effectively. He didn't have a lot of political experience when he first ran his first big public spotlight, was it he ran for president in 2017. It was very clear that he didn't have what it takes, frankly to survive in a very tough political competition that can exist in regime has and he had every little charisma have been a bit bureaucratic behind the scenes as, as a percent the judiciary and again, as I said in 1988, he was part of the so-called death panel, which was responsible for sending thousands of Iranian political prisoners, most of them I've already served their sentence to their deaths. So very likely a contender for as a role in a crime against humanity and he was not seeing it. For example, if you look at the protests of the last few years, very few people even protested against him because he was just basically not seen as someone who was important enough in the power structure. Nevertheless, I do believe his death is politically significant because dav arrested he was connected to very important circles of power in Islamic republic. Those in the holy city of Mashhad, for example, where he's from and where he held some very important posts and his father-in-law holds a very important post as well. And some others who did so well in the parliamentary elections, some group of ultra hardliners, but very well in the parliamentary elections earlier this year. So I believe that Raisi's death and how the next presidential elections will play out certainly have political significance and have altered the balance of power veered into factions of the Islamic Republic.",

Ron, just to talk about this for a minute in terms of the Biden administration -- I mean, it must have been quite a day as they continued to get these updates. It's such a difficult time for President Biden as well. As I said, it was just last week that President Raisi, and President Biden gave their blessing for their officials to be in separate rooms, but to be in Oman but talking about how to avoid any more escalation in the Middle East.

So you have so many movie in pieces is at once that the prospect of further instability in Iran, if in fact there, I guess now there does have to be an election.

So as always, the Middle East, more frustrates than creates opportunities for break for those in many ways, the best outcome is just simply avoiding the worst outcome but as you say -- I mean, just one more complication at a time when there are so many moving pieces and ones that have tremendous political implications, not only in the region, but in the U.S.",

And instead of going into the Democratic convention this summer against the backdrop of continued fighting in Gaza, they could theoretically be going into the convention against the backdrop of this historic or transformational agreement between the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Israel, and at least a runway for our process toward a settling or at least managing the Israeli Palestinian conflict.I mean, those are two completely different worlds for Joe Biden and that opportunity is there. Netanyahu sees it in his political interests to be squashing that. But as, you know, as you no doubt talked about, there are great drains (ph) and the Israeli government about that.
