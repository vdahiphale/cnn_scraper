Let's get to CNN senior White House correspondent, M.J. Lee, with more on what Biden has a head here. M.J., the campaign navigating, of course, a sensitive and complicated politically well dynamic. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Brianna. What happened on Saturday has certainly upended so much on both sides of the political aisle. We saw the Biden campaign immediately pulling down at TV ads. They stopped all political communications for a while. The White House had to cancel the president's trip to Texas today. One of the stops was meant to be a fundraiser. And something else that we saw come to a halt after Saturday, the public Democratic dissent against President Biden and questions about whether he should seek a second term, which questions about that had been really growing by the day until Saturday. Remember, even, in the hours leading up to that Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania, the president was having some tough, at times tense, conversations with Democratic lawmakers that were really pressing him on whether he was a viable candidate to seek a second term, whether he could even defeat Donald Trump. And the president had really been bracing for a really tough political week ahead. They knew that there was probably going to be growing dissent. Some advisers had even worried that there could be some prominent Democratic defections on the Sunday shows yesterday. And today, the president has this big TV interview where, again, until two days ago, we had expected the focus would be on his age, his fitness, and all of these questions swirling about him. And we have spoken since Saturday with some Biden allies that are privately hoping, privately wondering whether, in the aftermath of what happened on Saturday, the effect might be that these questions about the president's political future might actually come to a stop. The idea being the Democrats will actually seize this moment and see this moment as really, urgently, the party needs to come together, particularly as they are watching Republicans really rallying around Donald Trump in a new way. We know that it is early though, and obviously, it's not even been 48 hours since the horrific events of Saturday. So we're watching to see how Democrats are watching the tone that comes out of the Republican National Convention. But as for the president in just the coming days, he is still headed to Las Vegas this afternoon after he sits down with NBC News' Lester Holt. But obviously, Brianna, I don't need to tell you that the backdrop of that interview is now so different than what we were expecting even two days ago.",

And nothing reflects those changes more than the party's platform.And CNN senior political data reporter, Harry Enten, is here to break that down for us. Harry, let's start with two of the biggest issues for the traditional Republican base, at least, which is abortion in the sanctity of marriage. How have we seen those change in the platform language?",

My, goodness gracious. That is so untraditional of the Republican Party.And this might be in my mind something that the GOP and Donald Trump have been concentrating on, which is trying to get rid of some of the language that is more divisive, trying to be a bigger-tent party. And indeed, if you look at the polling, what you see is that, when it comes to the issue of abortion, Democrats and Joe Biden are trusted much more on it. Republicans have already won the war, right? Roe v. Wade was overturned. But the fact is the Republican Party wants to drop these unpopular planks in their messaging. And that is something that you're seeing reflected in the GOP platform.",

That was not mentioned at all back in 2016. Now we're seeing that actually mentioned a number of times in the platform. And again, this is partially about Donald Trump shaping the platform. But it's also about understanding what's popular with the American public. We know that immigration is much higher up on the issues of most important problems in terms of what Americans think. And more than that, it's an issue on which Donald Trump does very, very well. He leads Joe Biden overwhelmingly on this issue. So the fact that you're dropping those social issues, the issues that Joe Biden's doing particularly well on, and you're raising issues surrounding the border, which Donald Trump does well on. So they're basically trying to craft a message that appeals to a wider segment of the American public, not just with the Republican base.",

Around conventions, if you go back to the 2016 convention when he also had a big pick like this, they made a very disciplined choice. At that convention, very unlike this room -- that's Donald Trump's room behind you. That is Donald Trump's room. In 2016, there was still talk, you know, Ted Cruz or someone else tried to take it away. And they picked Mike Pence, what, about a week out. And that sent a signal. We're going to middle America, former governor, a member of the House, governor at the time, member of the House, Christian conservative. And then any opposition from the Republican base went away like that. This is interesting in that those three finalists, maybe no surprise to us. Traditionally, Michael Dukakis, my first one, picked Lloyd Bentsen, right, Massachusetts, picked Texas. But Al Gore was picked by Bill Clintons. This -- Trump reminds me of this. He's picking somebody from MAGA, somebody who's with him, deciding I'm in a position of strength. I don't need to address a weakness. We'll see -- and the political pros can answer this better than I can -- if that plays out.

CHRIS WALLACE, CNN ANCHOR, \"WHO'S TALKING TO CHRIS WALLACE\": Well, the one thing I would say about the Ragan assassination attempt in 1981 is it changed the public's view of him. He was very a controversial figure, although he won by a landslide. And it really cemented a bond between Reagan and the American people. Because they saw in a way that you don't normally see of politicians, they saw the make of the man, the measure of the man, and the strength and the courage and the humor of Ronald Reagan in the weeks that passed. Twenty-nine days after he was shot outside the Hilton Hotel, he addressed a joint session of Congress and proposed a tremendously controversial plan, spending cuts, tax cuts. It all sailed through. And I think part of that that was the wind at his back. But it also changes the man. It changed Ronald Reagan. And he famously told Cardinal Cook (ph) afterwards, I feel that whatever time I have left, it's for God. And I -- I -- not to get overly sentimental about this, but you refer to the interviews that Trump has done overnight, he was deeply affected, as anybody would be going through a near death occurrence.",
