And this has turned to a triage situation for Democrats where they feel like they need to move on. It's not going - they don't think it's going to work out for Biden, a lot of them, and they think the most realistic shot that they have of beating Donald Trump is to move quickly toward Harris and to get moving on that right away.And that is yet another problem as Biden tries to hold onto his position here.

Biden would be 86 at the end of a second term. It's very difficult knowing what we do how people age at that advanced age to think that this is going to get any better. There's going to be moments and there's going to be plateaus and things are going to get worse.

The guy who won the Heisman last year. And the people on the field are saying, hold on, let's go with the back-up quarterback here. And this is, obviously, very much with Harris in mind, say, just because the backup through an interception the last time she was up doesn't mean that we switch it out now. She knows all the plays. That - so - so there is this frustration that is - that I get into the story too of a lot of people saying to the donors, you need to maybe back up here and not be putting the pressure on.I think the other thing is that it is hard to believe that Abigail Disney and a lot of these donors, no matter what happens, are not going to be there with their money to fund the effort to stop Donald Trump from coming back.

So this three-stage proposal when it comes to the ceasefire hostage deal.Now what we've heard from a senior administration official is that the progression from phase one to phase two has been problematic. That's really where these talks have fallen down before. And that's effectively going from a six-week ceasefire with some hostages, some Palestinian prisoners released, evolving into a more permanent ceasefire with the rest of the hostages being released. That has really been the stumbling block, we understand, as Hamas has said, that they want a complete ceasefire. And we have heard consistently from the Israeli prime minister up until recently that he was not ready to agree to any kind of more long term ceasefire. But now, as he is saying, that the operation and the more intense fighting phase in Rafah is starting to wrap up. It does appear as though he is more willing to look into this at this point. So, an Israeli source close to these talks has said that they, at this point now, the prime minister will be deciding whether or not to go to the next phase. So, the more detailed phase. The fact that we know from a source that the Mossad director, David Barnea, is heading to Doha. Those talks could start as early as today, this Friday. It does appear as though we are further along than we have been for some time. It is important to note, Paula, we have, though, been here a number of times over recent months. It has appeared that we have been close to a breakthrough only for these talks to stall at the last minute. But the fact that we are hearing from a senior Biden administration official that's - that this stumbling block between the temporary ceasefire potentially to the more permanent ceasefire appears to have been bridged is giving hopes. And we're seeing protests on the streets of Tel Aviv as well, hostage families saying, please sign the deal. Paula.",

Where this is - this is what we've seen in - yes, it goes back like ten years of, you know, happy - you know, happy Fourth of July to the haters and the losers. This is what he does. I mean no one is surprised by it. And this is the Donald Trump. But everybody - that's really the difference, right? Voters go into this knowing Donald Trump. They knew who he was in 2016. They knew who he was in 2020. They certainly know who he is now. And he's up by six points against Job Biden. What does that tell you?",

That's what they were doing before the debate happened. And that's what he needs - they need to turn back to that. Regardless if he steps aside or not, they need to get back to this contrast message because voters have a real serious choice here and I think that they need to be able to see that and I don't think we're seeing that right now.",
