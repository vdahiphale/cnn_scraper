It has failed to rescue a single Israeli hostage, and there are more than 100 inside the Gaza Strip, with the exception of one female soldier.So I guess they're kind of thinking more creatively. This suggestion was put forward by David Barnea, the head of the Mossad, Israel's equivalent of the CIA, first to his counterpart at the CIA, Bill Burns, and then to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The response from the Qataris, who of course have been integral to mediating that first truce, is that this is really a non-starter. Number one, because presumably Hamas leaders understand that they're probably safer underground, under Khan Younis, where they're presumed to be, than in other cities around the Middle East. Just evidence for that being New Year's Day, I think it was, or January 2nd, when that Hamas top commander was killed in a presumed Israeli assassination in southern Beirut. And the other is that they may prefer to go down fighting inside the Gaza Strip when they're fighting against their sworn enemy. But just one final thing to remember, if you cast your mind back 40 years or so, when Yasser Arafat, then head of the PLO, with his forces inside Beirut, they were allowed to leave Beirut to exit, to go into exile, in exchange effectively for Israel's war with Lebanon coming to a close. So although history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, it does sometimes rhyme, so it's not completely inconceivable to imagine a situation where a Palestinian leader might leave. But again, Hamas is a very different organization to the PLO back then, and there's no sense that this is something that could happen. However, the fact that we're talking about proposals means perhaps that at least we are having conversations about conversations, and maybe that can count for progress.",

So, the Pentagon had initially said last week that, look, we never said the Houthis would stop immediately, and that certainly was true.There was a raft of attacks that continued on commercial shipping, even after these U.S. and U.K. strikes on Houthi targets really started to ramp up. Last week, case in point, you had Houthi attacks on U.S.-owned ships Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Two of those attacks actually hit their targets, the ships, though they weren't damaged enough to actually prevent them from continuing to sailing. You even had the president, President Biden, acknowledging that they weren't working, but they would actually continue. Now his answer might be different to that same question, because it does appear that these strikes are having some of the desired effect. In fact, one Pentagon official said that this latest round of strikes achieved the desired effect and removed significant Houthi capability. They also said that, look, there's still plenty of weapons that they have at their disposal. But this latest round of strikes, there were eight targets, go beyond just the immediate threats. Because last week you had the Pentagon saying that they were striking anti-ship missiles that were locked and loaded, targeted or pointed at the Red Sea. Now you're seeing them strike other targets, aerial systems, underground weapons storage, things like that. What these strikes have not done, though, is dampened any of the resolve of the Houthis, case in point. A member of their leadership, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said this in response, quote, \"The American and British must understand that we are in a time of response and that our people do not know how to surrender. Our Yemeni people today are fighting to prevent the genocide and seizure of the people of Gaza, and the Americans are fighting and bombing the people of Yemen to protect the terrorist criminal, the Israeli enemy.\" Now, the U.S. has made clear, obviously, that it doesn't see any justification, not the war in Gaza, not anything that justifies the strikes on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea. We also just this morning heard from the U.K. foreign secretary, David Cameron, who said that the Houthi strikes on targets are illegal and unacceptable, and he said that they will continue. But the reality, though, Max and Bianca, is that the Houthis, at least according to the Americans, are getting a steady stream of ammunition coming from Iran. In fact, two U.S. Navy SEALs were killed trying to intercept one of those vessels destined for Yemen. And, you know, this supply of weapons from Iran is also the same weapons that are being supplied to militaries or militant groups, excuse me, in Syria and Iraq, some of whom are actually -- some of which are actually landing on or around U.S. bases there -- Max, Bianca.",

Donald Trump at 50 percent in the CNN poll, clearing 50 percent here. Haley way back. And you'll notice DeSantis, who of course has dropped out of the race, he's at 6 percent in that poll, 8 percent in the Monmouth poll, which might give you a reason why he left. He really had no shot in the state of New Hampshire. DeSantis' supporters, their second choice for the GOP nominee, look at this. They don't go to Haley. They go to Donald Trump, 62-30 percent for Haley. So DeSantis' exit doesn't in fact help Haley. It probably helps Donald Trump, which is not necessarily something he needs, because he was already ahead. He's probably a little bit more ahead now that DeSantis has left the race. If these polls are right, and Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire, Donald Trump wins, he's already won in the state of Iowa, what do we see? Won the GOP nomination after losing Iowa-New Hampshire, zero. It's never happened in the modern era. So the fact that Haley has lost Iowa, looks like she's going to lose New Hampshire, not good. Another bit of bad news for Nikki Haley. Look at this. Choice for GOP nominee nationally among likely GOP voters, look at this. Donald Trump at 69 percent, Nikki Haley at 12 percent. That is tied for the largest advantage nationally at this point, basically ever, for a GOP nominee.
