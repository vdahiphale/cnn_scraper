This time it was in Los Angeles, he was acquitted on another charge and the jury couldn't reach a verdict on three others. There were four accusers in all, including a filmmaker who's married to the California governor.CNN's Natasha Chen has our report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The jury found Weinstein guilty of the three counts that were related to the first Jane Doe accuser. And this case involved four women accusing him of rape and sexual assault charges for a total of seven counts to which he pleaded not guilty. But again, the jury only found him guilty on those three counts related to the same accuser. For the second accuser and the fourth accuser. The jury could not come to a decision and those were declared a mistrial. For the third accuser, the jury found him not guilty on that sexual assault charge. Now, the fourth accuser over the course of the trial was identified as Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a filmmaker and the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom. The attorney for Jennifer Siebel Newsom released a statement saying in part while we would have preferred that those jurors had found him guilty on all counts, we understand that it was a complex trial made more difficult by the defense team's argument that a woman who was assaulted must forego her chosen career or be accused of consent after the fact. [00:25:24] That attorney also said that you never know how politics may play into things regarding her client's marriage to the California governor. The attorney for Harvey Weinstein also released a statement specifically referring to this first accuser where he was found guilty on those three counts. The attorney said Harvey is obviously disappointed however, hopefully because with this particular accuser, there's good grounds to appeal based on time and location of alleged events. He's grateful the jury took their time to deliberate on the other counts, and he is prepared to continue fighting for his innocence. Now, this Los Angeles jury deliberated for 41 hours that is far longer than the jury deliberated in New York in his New York trial, where he was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. He is appealing that case. And so, what happens in this case becomes very interesting. Now with these three guilty counts, he could be facing up to 24 years in prison on this trial, and the jury is supposed to reconvene tomorrow to hear more arguments about the sentencing and guidelines, back to you.

Messi is a player who left the country when he was a teenager to migrate, essentially, to Europe in search of better economic opportunity, perhaps, because a European club made him an offer when he was just 14 that no local club in Argentina could match. But yet, he never abandoned the home, never abandoned Argentina and kept his loyalty otherwise (ph) for the Albiceleste, the Argentina national team. And after years of a fractured relationship with the Argentina national team, where it seemed that Messi would often play so beautifully in Europe with trophy after trophy but always misfiring when he -- when he would put on the Argentina national shirt. Well, this year he did not misfire. He really led the team as a captain, as the leader of this group of players to conquer confidently since 1986. So more than any other player, he is the embodiment of his -- of his feelings. And the Argentinians know it. It was a big front page of one of the national dwarf (ph) ships here in Buenos Aires on Monday.
