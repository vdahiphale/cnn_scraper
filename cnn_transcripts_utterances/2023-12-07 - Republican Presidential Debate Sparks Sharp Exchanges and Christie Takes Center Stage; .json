And by the way, in the preseason analogy, I'm waiting for the regular season, which is January 15th in the hour primary. Because Vivek, to me, tonight, showed that he did not understand how private companies work in the technology space with law enforcement. You know this, Laura, better than anybody. He showed to me that you don't know what people do after they leave public office, which is they either join TV, they write a book, they teach at a law school or a professor or something like that. Like, he had no basic understanding of what people do after they leave D.C.

Nikki Haley has, maybe not so much at this debate, but in prior debates, has very directly gone after Trump, has called him the most unpopular politician in America.
