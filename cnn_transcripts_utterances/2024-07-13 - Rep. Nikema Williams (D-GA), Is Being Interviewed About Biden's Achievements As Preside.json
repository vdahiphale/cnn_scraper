I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with the 2024 presidential race at another critical crossroad. Today, President Biden is taking a break from the campaign trail as he scrambles behind the scenes to convince key members of his own party that he can still win in November. Over the next few hours, Biden will hold telephone calls and conference calls with groups of moderate and progressive members of Congress in an effort to shore up support. And in a rally in Michigan last night, Biden was defiant, vowing to stay in the race. Meantime, his GOP challenger Donald Trump is set to hold a rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania later on today, and it comes just two days before the Republican National Convention gets underway in Milwaukee. And as we wait an announcement about Trump's running mate, we'll get to the Trump rally in a moment. But let's begin with Priscilla Alvarez, who is covering the Biden campaign for us. Priscilla, what can you tell us about Biden's efforts to keep his campaign alive, and what kind of phone calls he is having today?",

Priscilla Alvarez, thanks so much.So, as President Biden fights for his political survivor -- survival, rather, his challenger, former President Donald Trump is set to hold a rally in battleground Pennsylvania today. All eyes are on Trump as we await his pick for vice president. The most likely candidates right now, senators Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. CNN's Alayna Treene is joining me now from Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump's rally will be taking place. All right, lots of anticipation on who Trump's pick will be. Might it happen while you're there or during the convention? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN CONGRESSIONAL AND PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS REPORTER: Your guess is as good as mine as right now, Fredricka. No. I mean, the anticipation, the suspense of when this announcement will come continues to build, it could happen tonight. When I talked to Donald Trump's campaign advisers as recently as this morning, they said they are still weighing when this is going to come. Now, I will tell you that they view as of now, Monday evening, that is when Donald Trump, for the third time, is going to be officially nominated as the Republican party's presidential nominee. That will happen Monday evening. That is what they view as the deadline for when he needs to make that announcement. So, really, we're looking at just about two or three days here until we will know who his running mate is. Now, you mentioned the top contenders that Donald Trump is considering. They have consistently been at the top of his what I'll call short shortlist for vice president. He addressed this yesterday while speaking to a conservative radio show. Take a listen, Fred. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (via telephone): I watched Tim Scott on television yesterday. He was fierce and great. He was great. I watched Marco over the weekend on television, he was incredible. J.D. has been great. You have a man named Burgum, who is a fantastic governor in North Dakota, and you know, it's a state that's very, very prosperous, very successful, and he's done a good job there. You have -- You have some terrific people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

His opinion on who he thinks is best to serve alongside him really depends on who he sees best defending him on television, as well as who is in his ear, lobbying these different men to be his V.P.Now, I do -- you know, I just want to point out that here in Butler, this is on the border of Ohio, that is where Senator J.D. Vance is from, and we've also gotten some indications that some of the speaker lineup at the convention next week could show that Vance may be actually the top candidate in the running right now. You have people like Donald Trump Jr., as well as Tucker Carlson, both very fierce defenders of J.D. Vance, who have been pushing Donald Trump to choose him. They will be speaking both Wednesday and Thursday. Wednesday is the night that his vice-presidential nominee is going to deliver remarks on stage in Milwaukee. And on Thursday, you'll have Donald Trump delivering those remarks. And those are the nights that these people are going to speaking as well. So, I think some tea leave reading there for you, Fred.

I watched that rally in Detroit yesterday. He was on fire. He spoke like the person who we need on the campaign trail between now and November 5th to bring it to Donald Trump, call him the liar that he is, a failed former president, and he also laid out his vision for the next term, signing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, making sure that we can codify Roe v. Wade, giving women the protections that we need when Trump has bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade. So, there are real things at stake in this election.

Overnight, I'm told that the Israeli minister of defense, as well as the head of the Israeli military general, Herzi Halevi, the top officials at Israel's Internal Security Service known as the Shin Bet, they all huddled overnight multiple times, multiple discussions, to assess that intelligence, and determine whether or not they could proceed with this strike. One of the key considerations was assessing whether or not there were any Israeli hostages potentially in the area. They ultimately assessed that there were no hostages in the area. And early this morning, around 10:30 in the morning, a massive explosion happened in that area. The Israeli military striking that area, killing 71 people, nearly 300 people were injured in this blast. And you can just see, based on the smoke emanating from this area, as well as the size of the crater, that clearly a very large munition appears to have been used in this strike.

I just am a Republican and so I don't know exactly what their bench looks like.But what I will tell you is that I think history is going to look at this period of time for Democrats. And if they just try to play safe and either run, Joe Biden or just kind of run whoever looks like they're next on the list, instead of trying to find somebody that is a once-in-a-generation leader, somebody that can build consensus, win votes on the left, win votes in the middle, even win votes on the right, like me, that just cannot stand Donald Trump. If they do that, not only will they win this election, but they will win for a significant period of time. Because I think, once America finds a candidate or a leader that they can really trust and believe in, they will -- they will become addicted to that.",

They're, just a few weeks away from their convention. They've got a lot of work to do, soul searching. I do think some of the -- some of the weapons used to kind of shape away from removing Joe Biden, of money and name I.D. and whatnot, are really irrelevant at this point. I don't think money is going to be an issue for if the Democrats find somebody, like an Andy Beshear or somebody else. Or even if Kamala Harris decides to step up to the plate and America gets to understand who she is and she comes back towards the middle, I think there's an opportunity for name I.D. to be through the roof. I think there's an opportunity for earned media to be through the roof.

There's no poll out there of legitimate status that really shows that Joe Biden's debate kept him even or helped him climb ahead or climb from behind.

And it's added -- more travel bookings. You can book cruises and flights through Costco. So Costco, you know, it has to keep innovating. Competition in retail, of course, is really, really tough.
