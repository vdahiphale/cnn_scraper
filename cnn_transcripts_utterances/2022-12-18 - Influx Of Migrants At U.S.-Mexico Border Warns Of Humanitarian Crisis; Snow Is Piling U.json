It has been extended multiple times. On April 1st, CDC announced plans to stop the order, saying it was no longer necessary due to the decrease in COVID cases.

Homeland Security officials recently had warned that they anticipate a likely increase in migrant flow immediately when the policy is lifted.Here at the White House, officials have long known that the Trump era policy would end at some point. But it took on additional meaning when a judge last month ruled that Title 42 needed to end by December 21st. That is Wednesday. On Friday night, a federal appeals court blocked a challenge from some Republican-led states that would have kept the policy in place. And the White House has said they have a robust effort underway to try to manage the border in the wake as they are expecting Title 42 to be lifted. The White House has been trying to make clear that the lifting of Title 42 does not mean that the border is open and that they are going to work to try to manage migrant flow. The Department of Homeland Security has released a six-point plan detailing some of these efforts, including surging of personnel and resources to the border to help with processing. They have also established or they're in the works of establishing some temporary facilities to help with this processing and also ramping up on the ground and air transportation to try to move some of the migrants and process them as well. Additionally, the Biden administration has asked Congress for more than $3 billion to address border security issues. And what White House officials consistently say is that the only way for these issues to be fixed is if comprehensive immigration reform is passed on Capitol Hill. In the coming days the White House is certainly facing a very steep challenge when it comes to this expected flow of migrants that could begin on Wednesday and flow into the coming weeks -- Arlette Saenz, CNN, the White House.

To put that in historical context, those numbers have not been as high during the season for at least a decade.

Officials once again encouraging people to mask up while they are indoors. Several cities around the country have issued new guidance, not a requirement, that people wear a mask when they are indoors or in crowded places.

On the other hand, the majority, as you know, is based on the fact that there are 18 Republicans who won districts that voted for Biden in 2020.

Qatar said about 30,000 migrant workers built the seven stadiums, thousands more were needed to build the metro, the airport terminal, hotels and other supporting infrastructure. And yet FIFA has declared Qatar the best World Cup ever and it expects revenues of about $7.5 billion. That's $1 billion more than the Russia World Cup a few years ago.
