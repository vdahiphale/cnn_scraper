We're indoors and out with the candidates all across Iowa with the opening contest of primary '24 just hours away.Also tonight the role evangelical voters are expected to play in Iowa and beyond. I'm joined by one evangelical leader, Bob Vander Plaats tonight. And later the rising discontent in Israel 100 days since Hamas attacked and took hostages with progress, the freedom stalled, and the conflict already widening. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We're now 24 hours away from the first vote to the 2024 presidential race. 24 hours away from the start of the Iowa caucuses most of which convene at this time tomorrow night, just getting started of what is normally poll closing time in most other states. One of the many things we'll talk about tonight which set Iowa apart including this year, a blizzard in the final days of the campaign and record cold temperatures expected tomorrow tonight. A number of significant endorsements tonight. Florida Senator Marco Rubio announcing he's backing the former president and not his home state governor Ron DeSantis. Former candidate and North Dakota governor Doug Burgum today doing the same and former Maryland governor Larry Hogan endorsing Nikki Haley. New polling from the \"Des Moines Register\" showing her now running ahead of Governor DeSantis but still a distant second to the former president who's nearly 30 points ahead. But polling also shows him with a significant lead in how enthusiastic his supporters said they are. 88 percent saying they are extremely or are very enthusiastic compared to 62 percent and 39 percent for DeSantis and Haley respectively. John King is going to join us in a bit to look deeper into that, but first, for all the last-minute campaigning, CNN's Kristen Holmes is with the former president, CNN's Kylie Atwood is with Nikki Haley, CNN's Jessica Dean is with the DeSantis campaign, and in the CNN Weather Center, Chad Myers is on the one key factor not on the ballot. Want to go first to Kristen Holmes in the town of Indianola, just south of Des Moines. So what is the Trump campaign's closing message to Iowans tonight?",

You can't sit home. If you are sick as a dog, you say, darling, I've got to make it. Even if you vote and then pass away, it's worth it.

It's going to be a new experience for them.Are they as determined to show up as he needs them to be? Because even though he is winning by 30 points in recent polls, the \"Des Moines Register\" was 20 points, they are concerned that that margin is actually smaller and they need a big margin to win, not just obviously to win the delegates, but also because they want to set the tone for the primary season and also stop any moment up that they are seeing from his GOP rivals namely Nikki Haley in New Hampshire.",

Now Nikki Haley, for her part making her final pitch just here a few moments ago on the eve of the Iowa caucuses hitting similar themes that we've heard from her throughout her entire campaign. The need for school choice, the need to defend America's borders with more resources, the need to defend Ukraine in order to prevent wider wars from occurring, and also reminding voters in the room here of the electability argument that she has been making, reminding them that in the last seven out of the last eight presidential elections Republicans have lost the popular vote. She said that isn't a good thing and she's telling them that she's in the position, she's best poised to be the one to change that, citing those theoretical polls that we have seen with her up against President Biden, saying that she's the one who can win, saying that Trump and DeSantis just don't do that. Now of course her team is looking ahead to tomorrow trying to figure out what her schedule will look like. But I do want to note that they still think that there are Iowans who haven't made up their mind. Nikki Haley asking the room here this evening if there's anyone who has seen her for the first time. And there were at least a dozen folks who raised their hand. So that's significant because even though it looks like it's baked, it looks like she could be gaining steam, they still think that there are still folks that they could still convince to come to her side as they battles it out with Ron DeSantis to come in number two here in Iowa.",

They feel like that is a thing that that they've got going for them.

So take you to 8:00 tomorrow night, nine degrees below zero, windchill 31 below in Des Moines, probably 28 below up in Sheldon and Okoboji. This is a widespread cold event and a lot of the rural farmers have to take care of livestock. They have a lot of things to do to keep livestock alive, not just drive around the town. In 25 minute, Des Moines, you will get frost bite if you have exposed skin. Now talking about where the high temperature was in 2004 when 16 degrees did affect turnout, and we're talking somewhere around 20 degrees colder than that for the high temperature tomorrow. Another thing is going on here I think probably not seeing the departure from normal because you look at Twitter and they say, oh, it's Iowa, it's winter on the way. 30 degrees below normal will be the high temperature tomorrow. This is not just normal. It will be warmer in Fairbanks than it will be in Des Moines. One last thing I have to talk about. This entire winter has been above normal by a large margin in Iowa.

They will fill in.So you mentioned the poll a little bit earlier. Let's just look at the last Iowa poll. Right? A very reliable poll over the years, not necessarily be picking the winners in 2016. Ted Cruz passed Donald Trump and in '22 Santorum passed Romney. But, but, never have you had a lead like this. Donald Trump at 48 in the last poll. If you go back five months, he was at 42. So he hasn't been out there as much as the other candidates, hasn't spent as much money as the other candidates, and yet he goes from 42 to 48 over the course of five months. DeSantis flatlined and down a little bit, from 19 to 16. And Haley does have some up at the end. Do you call it momentum? That's the big debate. Right? She's up to 20 percent, and still a 28-point gap between the two of them. But this is what's interesting when you look at the poll. We talked about how Trump supporters tend to be more enthusiastic, more excited, more locked in, more dedicated, look at this. 88 percent of Trump supporters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about their candidate. If it's going to be as cold as Chad Myers says it's going to be, you want your people to be very enthusiastic. DeSantis, that's not a bad number. 62 percent say enthusiastic or very enthusiastic. This is a problem sign for Haley. We'll see what happens tomorrow, but some of her voters are more moderate Republicans, some of them are Democrats or independents. They're not usual caucus-goers. If they're not all that enthusiastic, and it's horrible out, do they show up? We'll know tomorrow.",

I mean, I think even voters who feel incredibly motivated to go out and vote for Trump, you know, would reasonably look at a 30-point lead and say, do I have to go stand in that gym in negative 25-degree weather when he's clearly going to run away with this.

If there's any hope in the Republican primary to stop Trump, I think that ship has sailed, but if there's any hope there can't be three tickets out of Iowa, there can really only be two.
