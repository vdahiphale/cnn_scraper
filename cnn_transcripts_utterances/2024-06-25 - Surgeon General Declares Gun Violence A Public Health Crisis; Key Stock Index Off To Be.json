That's how he puts it.Here he is, earlier, talking to CNN's John Berman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Over the last decade or two, this problem has been worsening. And we have now reached the point where gun violence is the leading cause of death among kids and teens, the leading cause of death. That is something that we should never take as the new normal. There's nothing normal about that. But I also want people to understand through this advisory that impact of gun violence is far more far reaching than we may think. Six in 10 Americans are worried about a loved one being shot. Half of our kids are worried about a shooting in their school. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

JOSEPH SAKRAN, TRAUMA SURGEON &amp; CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, BRADY UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE: Yes. Thanks so much for having me. Look, this advisory by the surgeon general declaring gun violence a public health crisis is historic and something that, frankly, health care professionals and the gun violence prevention community have been calling on for many years. I think what it does is that it underscores the urgent need to address the devastating impact of gun violence on communities across the nation. As we just heard in your clip from the surgeon general, the leading cause of death in children and adolescents is gun violence. Think about that. It's not motor vehicle crashes. It's not cancer. It's not poisonings. It's gun-related injury. And so we have a responsibility to declare this a public health crisis, which many of us have been calling on.",

When you think about this advisory, right, it's another step in the right direction.And it does a couple of important things. It acknowledges the severity, right? It recognizes that gun violence is a major threat to the health and safety of the public akin to other crises like smoking, drug use, infectious diseases. It also emphasizes the need for rigorous data collection and research to better understand root causes and the impact on communities. It allows policymakers to call for the development and implementation of evidence-based programs and solutions that will allow us to reduce these gun-related injuries.

And then last week, you had the Supreme Court deciding that a bump stock ban is unconstitutional.

[13These are not just numbers and statistics, right? These are moms and dads, their brothers and sisters. And the impact is not just on the patients that we're seeing, but on the families and the communities. I think what we have to realize is that tackling this public health problem requires more than one solution. There is no one solution that's going to solve this. It's going to require, really, a multifaceted approach that cuts across different sectors and allows us to really come together to provide the type of comprehensive solution that's required to make communities safer. And I think we sometimes forget the fact that, as Americans, we have a lot more in common than we have that divides us. And that includes responsible gun owners, who, in fact, you know, are onboard for the majority of common-sense gun legislation and programs that will help us ensure that our children are not being gunned down on our streets.",

And part of that legislation included an investment of $140 million, right, in primary health care workforce that was supporting, right, clinicians to be able to better care for patients with mental and behavioral health issues, right? That is just one example of many things that have been done by the administration, but also by health systems to try to really tackle this from the different angles, right? And that's the -- that's the key. If you're talking about, for example, suicide or unintentional injuries or violence within cities, all of those different components have gun-related injury may require a variety of solutions, right, to ensure that we're providing the best medical treatment, which is prevention.",

And 2024 off to a great start.We're not quite halfway done with a year, but the S&amp;P 500 is already up nearly 15 percent. Goldman Sachs says that is the best start to an election year on record. And listen, this is really good news for millions of Americans, right? Everyone who's got money in the market, other directly owning stocks or indirectly in their 401K plans, in their college savings plans. And history shows that election years tend to be good ones for the stock market, especially when the incumbent is running for reelection, which is what we have this year. This is also the first time since 1892 were both major party candidates have previous presidential experience. So maybe that is helping the market a little bit. Because remember, investors like stability. But listen, there's a lot of other factors out there that have nothing to do with the election. There's the AI boom that has catapulted Nvidia and other tech stocks it's affected. Corporate profits have never been higher. Inflation has come down significantly without that long-feared recession. And Wall Street is still holding out hopes for interest rate cuts later this year. You put it all together and it's been a very impressive start. I think, if anything, though, you've got to ask whether or not investors are paying enough attention to election risks, right? I mean, poll after poll shows this is going to be a very close election. And again, investors don't like uncertainty. And some experts are concerned about an election that is so close that it's contested. That could cause uncertainty and social unrest. So it's also possible, Boris and Brianna, that investors just haven't started paying attention to the election yet. That should change very soon though, of course, especially with the Thursday presidential election -- debate here on CNN.",

It's one that the former president violated 10 times during that criminal trial. Well, now there's a little bit more leeway coming from the judge herein New York, Juan Merchan. He's essentially now saying that Trump is able to talk about the witnesses who testified in that trial. That is something that he could not talk about, certainly during that trial. Remember, he was railing and wanting to rail against Michael Cohen, Stormy Daniels, other witnesses that actually took the stand in his trial. So that is now allowed. However, the judge did say that, look, this is still ongoing. He has not been sentenced yet. That sentencing is set for July 11th. And so there are still going to be restrictions in place. Donald Trump cannot talk about the prosecutors in this case. He cannot mention any of the jurors' names, if they know of any. He can talk generally about the jurors in the trial, but not mention any names. So there are still some restrictions in this case to protect the identities, protect -- protect the people who are part of this a criminal trial ahead of that sentencing set for July 11th.
