Yes, people in middle America look at New York, and they look at L.A. And they say, Look at the glitz. Look at these limousine liberals telling us what to do. But that's the reality is. And at the same time that the Trump campaign comes out and says, Look, he's going to raise $25 million, three hours later, they come out and said, We're going to raise $33 million.

He understands that there's a real humanitarian crisis, but he also understand where -- that Israel's -- you know, their need to act in the way.

I had a chance to meet with them two days ago and supporting them in this difficult time. Obviously, opening up the ship channels to the port of Baltimore; helping those who have been impacted: all the dock workers, all those who are impacted downstream by the closures. And of course, rebuilding the bridge. I can say it's going to be a long road to go. This is a very difficult, involved conversation. I'm with the governor, having daily briefings. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in there doing the work. We want to make sure we're taking our time to do this safely. We can't yet give a timeline. We know it's going to be a long period of time, because there's so much involved. We're basically talking about a ship the size of the Eiffel Tower with a bridge on top of it. Debris in 50-foot water. Currents, wind, power lines nearby. This is a very difficult, involved situation. But I know that we have some of the world's best experts on it right now.",

And we think that can be done a lot faster.And we have to be calling for bold action, not just for the bridge rebuild. We have to be calling about bold action and all hands on deck to clear that shipping channel and doing the salvage work of pulling the bridge out. So I don't know the timelines. I'm not an expert. But we have to find a way to make sure that that is done as quickly as possible so that we can have terminals open again in the port of Baltimore, as well as supporting, you know, the associated areas. So in Baltimore County, we actually have Tradepoint Atlantic, which is another large maritime industrial site. We're using that both for bridge clearance but also potentially to help take some of that load that would otherwise be going to the port of Baltimore, one of the largest roll-on roll-off for vehicles. But Tradepoint has some of that ability there. We're looking at all hands on deck to figure out how how we can keep things moving.",

And I hope this doesn't become something that's partisan and logged up. I'd like to see Congress move quickly.

That's about as good as it gets, right?Look, you -- you talked about the storm over the West Coast. That's our big story, but let's at least get to the more immediate threat first and foremost, right? What's happening across New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. This is where we have critical fire danger today. Winds picking up, dry conditions. You know the drill. Do not burn any open fires within the area. So what about the big story? This is the storm system that's going to bring a deluge of rain into Southern California. It's going to ramp up tonight and into the day on Saturday. So that's the main concern, Los Angeles to Ventura, as well as Santa Barbara, eventually into San Diego, as well. Another piece of energy kind of slides inland towards the intermountain west, but the rainfall totals here right along Santa Barbara, just those mountains that are basically perpendicular. Or I should say, parallel to the coastline. Could see three to six inches locally, but upwards of one to three inches near downtown L.A. and San Diego. So flash flooding a concern.
