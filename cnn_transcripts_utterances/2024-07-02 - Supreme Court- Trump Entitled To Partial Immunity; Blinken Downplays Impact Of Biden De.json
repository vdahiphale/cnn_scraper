      "sentences": "All right, 5Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Supreme Court has spoken. In the highly anticipated ruling, the justices may have reshaped the criminal cases against Donald Trump and redefined the role of the presidency. The court granting Donald Trump significant, but technically partial immunity from special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion case. And dramatically expanding what the president can do without fear of legal consequences. But Chief Justice John Roberts writing in the majority opinion, quote, the president is not above the law but Congress may not criminalize the presidents conduct and carrying out the responsibilities of the executive branch under the Constitution. Trump praised the decision on social media. He called it a big win and said that it clears the stench from the Biden trials and hoaxes. President Biden, who now assumes an unprecedented shield of immunity for himself after this ruling, had this to say: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This nation was founded on the principle that there are no kings in America. Each -- each of us is equal before the law. No one -- no one is above the law, not even the president of United States. But today's Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, that fundamentally changed, for all, for all practical purposes, today's decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits or the president can do.

      "sentences": "All right. Joining me now to discuss his Marcus Childress. He is former counsel for the January 6 Select Committee.Marcus, good morning to you. A very significant day yesterday, the court going farther than many expected that they would go in offering immunity here. You worked inside the January 6 committee. How do you see this impacting the January 6 case? MARCUS CHILDRESS, FORMER JANUARY 6TH INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL:  So moving forward, I actually do think there is some hope, although it has uphill path forward for Jack Smith's team on January 6, and the reason is because, look, the court really said that there's official and unofficial acts and the only official acts that have said are off the table for immunity are the core executive powers that the president only as by himself, right? So if he had shared responsibility with the vice president or Congress, there's a presumptive immunity, but that means that the Jack Smith's team can rebut that immunity in the lower courts. And so I think were going to see now is a fact intensive evidentiary hearing where Jack Smith's team can put forward evidence to show that maybe it was candidate Trump, not President Trump that was acting out leading up to January 6. And Judge Chutkan can make a factual determination based upon a Supreme Courts ruling of whether certain facts should come in to evidence. I think the big elephant in the room during court yesterday was that Supreme Court was making a ruling without necessarily considering the facts and circumstances of what actually happened leading up to January 6. They are making a ruling about presidential power without looking exactly what candidate Trump was doing between November of 2020 and January 6 of 2021. And I think that's how the lower court is going to distinguish the ruling from yesterday with what actually happened in 2020.",

And I think that's where the lower court is different. I think lower court, district court, which is where I've practiced most of my career, it is very fact intensive where you're applying facts to the law. I think when you get to the appellate court and when you get to the Supreme Court, it becomes more of a legal exercising, a little bit more academic and less fact intensive of what's actually happening on the ground. I think that's where some of that frustration can come through. I mean, even myself felt some frustration sitting in the room yesterday hearing the opinion being red, knowing the facts and circumstances that led to January 6, but yet hearing the Supreme Court say that you want a president that can have energy and exercising their role, right? It's like do you want energy and overturning an election? I don't think we do. And so, that's where I think that the district court can take those words of energy and presidential power and apply and say, this was not presidential power to take care and measure the laws are faithfully executed. This was energy as a candidate to make sure that he remained in power. I think there's a -- there's a key line from a blessing opinion, which is another January 6 court opinion then the dc circuit where Judge Sreenivasan said, and I'm going to read it, right, when a first-term president gets to seek a second term, the campaign to win reelection is not an official presidential act, and I think that is a key theme that Jack Smith's team will probably lean into when it gets down to the lower court and were seeing these evidentiary hearings.",

Now, whether there's an order that comes down from the court that makes terminations of what facts are actually official or unofficial, I think that's where got that takes time, but the evidentiary hearing itself, I don't think should take very long to start. And if anything, you might find Trump's team trying to delay because they're not ready, or maybe they need more time to prepare.But I don't really see those arguments carrying the day because this case has been put on pause since March or even earlier than March since December of last year. And so, I would expect that before, you know, September, October, we're having a full evidentiary hearing that could last a weeks honestly because the special counsels office has a very high hurdle to clear to show that there isn't presumptive immunity for certain actions and that there is no immunity for certain actions. And to do so, they have to put for fall all the evidence that they leaves no doubt and the lower courts mine when it goes up on appeal that this is an official act and not an official presidential act that deserves immunity.",

It's kind of tough to read their arguments, but I imagined that in every case involving former President Trump or even folks who are acting at the direction of foreign President Trump. We're going to see new motions arguing that it was either an official act or that I was carrying out an official act.

Then there was this European diplomat who talked to CNN and they said, quote, it was obvious that he was old. We aren't worried about his policies. If you have a president who works three hours a day with a good team and makes good decisions, that's okay. So that's kind of what you are -- what you were talking about there. I think my question is a little bit about the optics and I know this is something that you think a lot about because one of the big arguments Donald Trump's making against President Biden is the President Biden is week on the world stage. And there is the reality that the presentation of strength from the United States is something that has an impact on how both American and European adversaries act on the world stage. What impact do you think that has?",

You know, there are countries like France, the UK, Germany, lots of European allies that see the big advantage of having the U.S. president really leading on democracy around the world. If you don't want that, then you look to present Biden. You probably think you're in a better position now.You want -- if you want the American presence, be your world leader, of course, you want their faculties to be about them. They have immense military power and immense economic power, but, you know, I think that that comment that you saw there in the CNN piece about in terms of policy, there's lots of very strong people around the president who foreign leaders deal with. And they were, was pretty strong. It's just a question of now, you know, seeing a situation where Donald Trump looks stronger against Biden making him more of a likely candidate to be the world leader, and can you work with him? I think there are countries I was in France yesterday, and if the far right does well next, weekend, as we expect, they would probably prefer to see Donald Trump type figure running the world where you can focus more on your national economy. You're not so focused on the global economy. So just depends where you're coming from and it is moving further right here. So in the past, they would have said, you know, Europe would want Biden and the centrist as they would see it, it's just not the case so much now, so they're really what sort of world leader they want.",

I mean, look at that. I just how perfectly circular and huge it is still an incredibly strong category five hurricane, at least thankfully right now, exiting some of these Windward Islands and then getting into the open Caribbean Sea there. It's got 165 mile per hour winds. So, it is a strong category five, storm sitting about 700 miles away from Jamaica and headed that way as we go through the next day or so, it rapidly intensified again yesterday. They did over the weekend and went from tropical storm two major hurricane in just a couple of out 24, 48 hours. And then yesterday, it rapidly intensified again from 120 miles per hour, category three storm to this immense 165 mile per hour category five storm. And it keeps rapidly intensifying because these ocean waters are incredibly warm. We're talking middle and upper 80s. This is more typical for late August and early September. This is why it's kind of acting like the peak of the hurricane season. As it continues its track, it was able to dodge some dust before the Windward Islands, there's some dust in its way as it heads to Jamaica. So we'll have to see how that can play with the intensity it might come down a little bit, but you're still looking at a major hurricane headed towards Jamaica by Wednesday. Your hurricane warnings and affect their watches for the Cayman Islands and then eventually it makes it towards Mexico by the end of the week -- Kasie.",
