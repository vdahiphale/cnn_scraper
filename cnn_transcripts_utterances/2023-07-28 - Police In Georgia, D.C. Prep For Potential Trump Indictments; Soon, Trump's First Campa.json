Trump keeps railing immediately after these new charges for example were announced and suggesting he's simply a political target in all of these. Is this a new playbook he's engaged in? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF CORRESPONDENT:  I mean, he is trying to argue that this is a prosecution that is tainted politically because he is the Republican frontrunner. Of course, we know that when launched his campaign last fall, we were told by sources at the time that was in part because they anticipated he was going to be facing some potential legal exposure. And also, what you are seeing from him today is he is now claiming on Truth Social that he voluntarily handed over the surveillance footage that he's now accused of seeking to delete. Of course, we should note, that is not the case. He got subpoenas for this. And that is actually what's laid out in this indictment is that his attorneys found out there was a draft of a subpoena that would require this footage to be turned over. They were notified about it. And that's when Trump called his new co-defendant, where the indictment implies that they discussed what he laid or sought to do, which was to delete the server, as he said to one of the other employees. And, of course, a few days later is when they got the real subpoena, the final grand jury subpoena for this footage. I think Trump is also forecasting that he doesn't think that meeting went well between his legal team and Jack Smith's team with regards to the January 6th indictment that we believe is looming, because he is saying he doesn't believe it will make a difference publicly.",

In reality, this all could have been avoided, in particular relating to this classified documents case, because if he had just given the documents back when they asked for them, then he would not be facing these charges.And I think particularly the nature of these documents, that Iran document, is so concerning to see his lack of care for our nation's top secrets and our men and women in military who are in harm's way protecting our country and that he would so recklessly hold on to a document like that, and not just hold on to it, but then flaunt it and show it off to people.

This is not a political issue, President Biden says, it's a family matter. Going on to say, Jill and I only want what is best for all our grandchildren, including Navy.Now, as for why the president is choosing now to acknowledge this child, who is four years old and lives in Arkansas, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN it is because last month, the child's mother, London Roberts, and the president's son, Hunter Biden, largely resolved a protracted and bitter court proceeding over child support. Hunter Biden agreeing to provide the child with some of his paintings, which she is able to either keep for her own use or to sell for proceeds. He had previously agreed in 2020 to pay about $20,000 a month in child support. It is unclear how much he will be paying under the new agreement. But, Wolf, it does come also as the president has been under scrutiny for not acknowledging this grandchild, from both The New York Times Columnist Maureen Dowd, who published an op-ed earlier this month, urging the president to acknowledge this child, and from GOP presidential candidates, like Governor Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley as well.
