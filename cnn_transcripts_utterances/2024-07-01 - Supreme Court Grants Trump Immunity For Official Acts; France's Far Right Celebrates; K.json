Those are the markets and these are the main events. A giant decision from the US Supreme Court ruling former President Trump is entitled to some immunity from criminal prosecution. Political deal-making underway in France, the center and left parties try to stop the far-right from taking power. And Boeing will by a major supplier as part of its safety reputation overhaul. Live from New York. It is Monday, July 1st, I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this  is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening once more. Tonight, Donald Trump's allies are celebrating after the US Supreme Court says he has some immunity from criminal prosecution. The court ruled in a six to three opinion, a president cannot be prosecuted for official acts. The decision will further delay that federal election subversion trial against the former president. Republicans calling the ruling a victory for the former president. The Biden campaign says the ruling hands Trump \"the keys to a dictatorship.\" Katelyn Polantz is with us now to explain more. Katelyn, I think you have to go into details of what exactly the US Supreme Court said here, but crucial to this really is the definition of what official acts are.",

They can't ever be taken to trial. There is an immunity there. That's what the Supreme Court said today. But the Donald Trump legal advisers, the people around him who are cheering this as a win for him, it is only a partial win in a lot of ways. It is a win on his delay strategy because it sets up a situation where the Supreme Court opinion is directing a trial judge to do a lot more hearings, look into things, potentially have witnesses, make decisions about the lines of immunity in this case, and then Trump's team could have more appeals. That's why there could be many delays pushing a possible trial against Donald Trump in this case well after the election potentially into a Trump presidency, if he were to win. But the US Supreme Court did not give Donald Trump everything he wanted. And in fact, said, Julia, in many different ways, a lot of what happened after January 6 that Trump is charged with, the allegations in that indictment for the 2020 election conspiracy, a lot of that is very likely not protected as an action of the presidency. Things like him using the fake electors to try and hold onto the office, pressuring state officials, using campaign speech to egg on his supporters -- all of that though, is going to have to be sorted out by the trial judge and they're going to have to look very closely. There is going to be reactions coming in the coming days from the special counsel's office, as well as from that trial judge, Tanya Chutkan in Washington to see exactly how this moves forward. The case remains in existence. US v. Trump with Donald Trump as the criminal defendant. There is just a long road of things ahead before this could go to trial -- Julia.",

The former president's lawyers could use the decision to challenge some tweets that were entered into evidence, as well as parts of Hope Hicks' testimony, too.

I think there is good news and there is bad news in this because it is not all about Donald Trump, let's be clear. What it says is that no president is fully above the law on all occasions, but there is, as Katelyn was saying an enormous gray area over what constitutes an official act, what gets absolute immunity, what gets partial immunity, and what is personal behavior, too and has no immunity.",

The court just said that is associated with a core function instructing the attorney general. It is out-of-bounds. He is absolutely privileged with that. And so I think that is one thing that they clearly held that it couldn't be prosecuted for. They contrast that with his pressure on Vice President Pence with respect to the electoral counting the votes and said that he might be -- he might be immune, he might not be depending on whether a prosecutor can prove that prosecuting him for this interference would not interfere with the authority of the presidency, whatever that means. So they made one thing that's clear that's out of bounds and they also added to that something that I deeply disagree with, which is a decision to say that it can't look at the communications with the Justice Department even as evidence of the other potential crimes. So it is just right out of the case and you can't in other words, see the whole forest if you've taken some of these trees out of the way and that is what they've just done. They've taken that particular thing out of the case entirely,, it can't even be used as background evidence of what was going on. And so every time the upper or lower court finds something immune, you can't even talk about it is what is suggested by the decision.

He has said he will not take the premiership if they do not. Clearly, if they don't have the absolute majority, it means that they can't bring in all kinds of new legislation that they are hoping to on law and order, on immigration, on tax cuts Julia, remember, this has been one of the keys to them winning, were doing so well in this parliamentary elections so far. To your question about what Emmanuel Macron does, whether or not Jordan Bardella is the prime minister or there is another prime minister, this is going to be if the far-right doesn't have an absolute majority, a hung Parliament, which is going to lead to a great deal of stagnation in terms of getting anything done over the rest of his presidential term. If Jordan Bardella is the prime minister and the far-right do have an absolute majority, on this stage, some polls suggest that they might, then you can expect pretty much gridlock because the policies that the far-right are going to be bringing in are the very policies that Emmanuel Macron one is going to be opposing and vice versa. Regardless of what comes out of this second round, Julia, there is a great deal of consternation here in France and head scratching about why Emmanuel Macron made this particular decision because there had been a theory that the idea had been that this prevented a run, a serious run on the presidency in 2027 when Emmanuel Macron's second term is up. But the fact is, the far-right as it is now going to be the largest parliamentary group, possibly with an absolute majority will in any case, come out more legitimate over the course of the next couple of years, than it had been before. So there is, when you speak to his MPs, to the mayors who backed Emmanuel Macron's very risky political gambit, you'll remember eight years ago, to sweep aside the traditional left and the traditional right, and bring the centrist force multilateral to power.

MADOWO (voice over): Protests broke out across Kenya last month against a proposed finance bill, largely driven by young people organizing on social media.

Human Rights groups accused police of shooting dozens of unarmed protesters including some who were fleeing. No one has accepted or denied responsibility for the killings. Our crew filmed shocking scene like here left of your screen, a man running away is shot in the back with a teargas canister at close range. These protesters standing over a man who is apparently dead, police fire a non-lethal round directly at them. Nairobi's Police chief seen here commanded the operation. His officers clearly contravening their own rules for the use of force. CNN analyzed the deadliest two hours when most of the protesters are believed to have been killed. Keep an eye on the man in white overalls waving his arms earlier in the day, 25-year-old Erickson Chalamutisya (ph) was supposed to be at the butcher shop where he worked, his mother said, but ended up here. CNN's camera captured him dancing until shots rang out. Police advanced towards the protesters, more shots and people run aways. Amid the chaos, we spot Erickson again, he is lifeless on the sidewalk. Around him are the protesters also on the ground. As the smoke lifts, one man has been shot in the head. People rush to help, but police keep firing at them. A bag is thrown in the air as the smoke grenade goes off, but that protestor escaped. We were on the scene as this unfolded. MADOWO (on camera): There are three bodies lying on the ground. After we heard live ammunition coming from Parliament, a police truck is on fire and the protesters appear to be pushing the police, overwhelming them, getting closer to Parliament. MADOWO (voice over): Unknown to us at the time, Erickson's body was being carried away behind me. His white overalls soaked in blood. We obtained his autopsy report. Erickson was shot in the back and bled to death. Moments later, another injured protester is carried away, but he is lucky, he survived.

I'm returning once more to our top story. The Supreme Court ruling Donald Trump has immunity for official acts he took as president. Republicans are celebrating the decision as a victory. The chair of the Democratic National Committee says it underscores the stakes in November's election. And it comes at a time when some Democrats are doubting whether President Biden should remain in the race. His campaign team have been trying to reassure donors after his poor debate performance last week. A CBS News poll last week also showed that 72 percent of voters think that Biden should not run. And a growing number of Democrats are starting to agree. The President is apparently considering a high-profile interview in the coming days to prove his fitness for office. That's according to one of his senior advisers and that the campaign is also trying to determine the true fallout from the debate. Stephen Collinson joins us now from Washington.

I think also that he is -- and you mentioned the idea that he could do a high-profile interview, he's going to come under increasing pressure from Democrats to be out there every day, much more than he has been so far.

Now the deal will cost the playmaker more than $8 billion and will pay -- Boeing will pay $4.7 billion worth of stock and take on more than $3 billion of Spirit AeroSystems debt. Pete Muntean is in Washington, D.C. Pete, this is also part of perhaps trying to shore up the reputation and shore up the production line too. But it does come in a week where we're talking about some kind of settlement, perhaps with the Department of Justice this week coming as well.",

Small comfort, though, perhaps, to the families of those that were lost in the Boeing crashes in2018 and 2019 in light of the ongoing safety concerns and that hearing that you mentioned last month have said, look, there needs to be some kind of criminal prosecution here. Boeing needs to be held responsible, and there needs to be greater accountability fast forward to this week, and it looks like a DHA settlement in the works. It's -- the latest development in this really big saga, Julia. And this is according to the families of the 346 who died in the 737 Max 8 crashes of 2018 and 2019, they say that Boeing is close to this deal with the Department of Justice that will once again keep it shielded from a criminal trial. That could be a lengthy affair that could air Boeing's dirty laundry in public. You know, families say through this deal, Boeing would face a small fine, few years probation, settled with a corporate monitor to oversee safety efforts. And they've been pushing the Department of Justice to go after Boeing for a long time, but they say this resolution is not really what they wanted. So far, Boeing, the Department of Justice, both not commenting on this.",

Rightnow, Europeans who create an Instagram or Facebook account are given a choice. They can pay up to $14.00 a month to go ad free, or they can agree to targeted advertising. The European Commission says this choice forces users to give out personal data without providing them a less personalized but equivalent version. Meta rejects the E.U.'s finding, if it holds up, the company could be fined up to 10 percent of its global revenue. Clare Duffy is in New York for us. So, what the regulators are saying is basically, you can hit them with advertising, but it doesn't have to be personalized and rely on the individual's data. The problem, of course, is that advertising is worth less money to Meta.",

And so, I think that's a real risk to meta. I mean, of course, there's this risk of a $13.5 billion fine if Meta is indeed found to be in violation of the digital markets act. But even more than that, if it's forced to offer a less personalized version of advertising on Facebook and Instagram, that could mean a real hit to its bottom line over time, which could be a real problem for the company. I think to the other thing that sort of tricky for Meta here is that that subscription offering, that ad free subscription was offered, was launched as a way of complying with a different E.U. regulation. The E.U. had ruled that tech companies needed to get consent from users to do targeted advertising, but a court had said that they could offer subscription models as a way of getting that consent or sort of sidestepping the need for that consent. So, Meta is sort of dealing with kind of conflicting regulatory requirements here in the E.U.",
