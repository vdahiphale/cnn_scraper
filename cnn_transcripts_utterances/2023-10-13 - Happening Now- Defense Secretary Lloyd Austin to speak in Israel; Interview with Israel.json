My experience in working with the Israeli forces is they are professional, they're disciplined, and they are focused on the right things.And so, I expect that going forward they will continue to exhibit that same degree of professionalism that we've seen in the past. But, you know, Matt, we've seen this before. The International Community fought ISIS, who would -- in some cases was embedded deeply in built-up areas.
