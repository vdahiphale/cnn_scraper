And you need him on board completely to go to rallies, go to fundraisers. But she is seen as a little bit more progressive, you know, a different generation and younger Democrats are more liberal.

I'm sure people can Google that.And so I think the Trump campaign, they have to be careful not to go too hard and say, hey, this is just a EI pick. That's what House Republican campaign chief Richard Hudson told his members saying, hey, let's not go there. That is that is kind of code word for her race. And so just attack her on the policies, that's fine. But I think what the Trump campaign is calling her laughing Kamala Harris is not going to necessarily cut it.

And so I think they want to negotiate better terms or get a debate on Fox News, and see if they can box Harris in for that. They would think that that would be more friendly to them. But I think that they know that they have a much stronger debater on their hands than Biden did. The reason that Harris is the nominee -- is the presumptive nominee is because of how badly Biden did and so they're worried about that. And they also during remember that debate with Hillary, you had Trump, you know, imposing physically only a few feet away.

And those are a vote. That's a voting bloc that Republicans wanted to target. And so I think there's a fair chance that if Harris had been thepresumptive nominee before the Republican Convention and Trump had picked his VP, he would not have gone with Vance. And so they expected Biden and kind of a youthful, contrast with Vance, and I think they're there -- the strategist I talked to say, Vance is just a doubling down on his populace MAGA base. It doesn't bring in a ton of new women or Hispanics or black voters, which they had to hope to target. And so they think that he is definitely the future of the MAGA movement in terms of being a populist, but you still have to win in November. You can't worry too much about 2028.",

A week ago, I went through the process I had tickets. I, you know, you had to put your identification and it had to match your passport. Bridges closed midday, the waters, the river close to obviously. And so there was all sorts of security precautions over this long river and leading to the Eiffel Tower. So in terms of the biggest security threat that I could imagine for the Olympics, which would have been this opening -- open opening ceremony with the world watching. They did a terrific job.

But temperatures will start to go down.So, at least, at this point, I think we'll take anything we can kind of get to help bring those containment numbers up. So, let's take a look because we've got a lot of fires. It's not just that one particular fire in California, over a 100 active wildfires across all of the west. But yes, one of the more concerning areas is going to be that Park Fire especially because of how quickly it has grown. You take a look at these numbers, burned over 300,000 acres. Keep in mind that on average since it started, that means it's burning 50 football fields per minute, to kind of put that in perspective. So, you can understand how quickly this fire is spreading. One of the concerns today, you can see all these red flag warnings that we have in effect for today. But likely, a lot of these continuing to Sunday as well, winds about 30 to 35 miles per hour gusting that can easily take the fire that's already there and spread it very quickly. Another concern is going to be the smoke. You've got all of these air quality alerts for numerous states, from multiple fires spreading that smoke, which could in turn cause some breathing problems for a lot of the folks there. You can see here is that wind begins to take a lot of that smoke and shift it. So, as the wind moves, so does that smoke. So, you're going to see it start to spread in a lot of areas, maybe that have had to break the last couple of days, that may be changing as we go into the weekend. Now, we talked about temperatures. That's one area where we are going to see an improvement. Take a look at this. Sacramento, 102 yesterday, high of only 83 today. So, a definite improvement there, Los Angeles, Fresno, Reno also seeing that drop in temperatures, the only downfall is, it's going to be temporary. Because you'll see, as we head right back into next week, those temperatures go right back up again to above average. And this is Sacramento, but even some other areas, Portland also going to see their temperatures begin to jump back up as we get into next week. So, again, the hope is at least this weekend while we have that brief reprieve and the temperatures that firefighters can take advantage of that, and maybe bring some of those containment numbers up. Because the outlook for today and tomorrow does have the potential for some thunderstorms, dry thunderstorms. Some of those storm outflows can be 60 to even 80 miles per hour, which would definitely spread those fires quickly.",

CNN's Whitney Wild has more on this developing story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WHITNEY WILD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  There is a lot more to learn as this case unfolds, but CNN is digging into the background of the accused deputy here, Sean Grayson. And what we've learned is that he was employed at six different law enforcement agencies between August of 2020 and July 2024. We've also learned that while he was working for one of those agencies, the Logan County sheriff's office, he was accused of inmate intimidation. That incident occurring in January of 2023. We've also learned that Grayson was cited   for failing to stop a high-speed chase after a supervisor directed him to do so. That was also while he was working for the Logan County Sheriff's office. That incident occurring in September of 2022. We have also learned, according to a CNN affiliate, that he was discharged from the army for misconduct. Although, the details of any alleged misconduct are not yet clear. We reached out to Grayson's attorney who declined to comment on that question. And then further, we have learned that he was charged twice for driving under the influence, once in 2015 and once in 2016. And he pleaded guilty to both of those charges. There are, again, many questions about the timeline here leading up to his employment at the Sangamon County Sheriff's office. He has since been fired from that job. But the Massey family is asking for much more accountability, a deeper dive into how he was hired and why he was hired in the first place. Meanwhile, they are speaking out about how this trauma has upended their lives. SHADIA MASSEY, SONYA MASSEY'S COUSIN:  Sonya meant the world to me. I loved her so much. This tragedy has been too much on my family. Her kids -- her daughter cannot sleep at night, you all. She's in one household, I'm in another household. For her to go to the bathroom, she has to be on FaceTime with me. For her to get a drink of water, she has to call us before she gets out of her bed. You know, this is the hardest thing that we have ever been through as a Massey. It just breaks my heart that our family has to go through this.",
