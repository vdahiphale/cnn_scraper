Sources tell CNN that reopening the Erez Crossing in northern Gaza and ramping up were -- aid, rather, were sticking points during the contentious called between Biden and Netanyahu. We'll have more on that in just a moment. Now, today marks six months since the Hamas attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Hamas killed more than 1,000 people. More than 250 people were taken hostage and moved into Gaza. WALKER: Yesterday in Tel Aviv, protesters condemned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and called for new elections, and for Hamas to release all of the hostages. Six months of fighting has left more than 30,000 Palestinians dead. That is according to Gaza's health ministry, including 12,000 children. It has also left the enclave facing a humanitarian crisis. We have team coverage this morning. Nic Robertson and Ben Wedeman are standing by. We will begin though with Camila DeChalus, who's traveling with President Biden in Wilmington.

And he insisted that he do it by that evening.Now, we know that the Israeli prime minister eventually their security's cabinet approved measures to allow that to happen. But this really just demonstrates how Biden is expressing both publicly and privately his frustration towards the Israeli government and how they're handling that humanitarian situation in Gaza.

And people here -- these soldiers are coming here today to remember it. It's six months and the impact is real and the trauma is real. These are people whose families have empty spaces at the table today.Now, we've been along the border today. We can see there continued strikes going into Gaza, in the Khan Younis area. And we've also been to the Erez border crossing, that pressure President Biden put on Prime Minister Netanyahu to open up the border crossing to allow aid to go through. The prime minister's office had originally indicated that trucks, aid trucks would go through today, Sunday. We've been there as of an hour ago, no trucks have moved towards the border and we don't get any indications that that's actually going to happen. But I think really for so many people in Israel today, this is what today is about for a lot of them, particularly those who lost loved ones, particularly those who lost loved ones here at the Nova Music Festival, particularly those. And I'm just going to ask Matthias (ph) to follow me over here to this image over here. This is not somebody who was killed. This is somebody who was taken hostage here from the festival. And still you see posters around here demanding for him to be released. This is a trauma of six months on that Israel finds itself living with. Inside of Gaza there's the trauma of the lack of food, the trauma of the airstrikes, and the trauma that's being affected on people's daily lives there. More than 33,000, according Palestinian authority, has been killed. And I'm just listening and I can hear another detonation of a strike going into Gaza. So, what to say when you stand in the midst of the reminders of so many killings? This is a story, this is a situation that for so many Israelis they don't know how it's going to end and where it's going to end, and similarly across the border inside of Gaza, six months on. Yes.",

That step will happen on Wednesday when the House sends those articles over to the Senate. And then the jurors will be sworn in the very next day.

That's where we are, Victor. And in fact, it could happen. BLACKWELL: Now for the Democrats, they could vote to keep the speaker where he is, to keep him with the gavel, the gavel with him rather.

And he collected a bunch of now.What we'll know, though, in a few weeks, Victor, is the structure of the money. How many of them were gigantic donors and how many were sort of lesser donors. One thing that the Democrats have made a point of talking about is that they've gotten their money from hundreds of thousands of small donors. You know, so when they go out and they ask people to give them, you know, $20.24 or so some other kind of small amount that's really more about voter mobilization. The money is nice to have but what they really got is a locked-in voters, especially in some of the battleground states.

Let's put up the Democrats' numbers here, 192 million cash on hand, bringing 90 million in March. \"The New York Times\" has this analysis that a PAC supporting Trump has spent since he left office in 2021, more than $100 million in legal fees.

First of all, the fact that so much money is going for his legal defense is going to make it hard for some donors to write one more check. You know, it's also going to make it very difficult on the ground for Republicans out in the various states and counties who are counting on some of this money to realize that, you know, for every dollar that got donated, far less than $1.00 is going to make it down to the local level.One saving grace in all of this for Trump and the Republicans is that Donald Trump has virtually 100 percent name recognition. So, the money that they have can be spent really very -- in a very targeted kind of a way. They're not introducing him to any constituencies of what you see is what you get. A lot of people already know all about what they like or don't like about Donald Trump. And so, it won't take as much money as it might otherwise have taken to sort of get him up on a national platform. That's the one saving grace though.

And one of the things -- I will go so quickly -- is that the Sun is 400 times the diameter of the Moon, but it is also 400 times the distance away from Earth. And so, you're going how does this tiny moon cover up the disc of the sun. It is that distance that compensates for that size. And so, you move far enough away and we get that.So, at first contact it's like that is when the Moon takes that first nibble out of the Sun. And then we'll begin to see it. And sometimes people go, well, this is kind of underwhelming, nothing's happening. But as we move to second contact, that has been the beginning of totality. This time, because we're in solar maximum, we may see these pink prominent -- prominences all around. It's like we may even see these like bolts -- some people say we may even see a solar flare. And it is the only time that we can see the beautiful Sun Corona is during totality. Then third contact, the moon starting to make its exit. We'll put those glasses back on. And then fourth contact, the whole things over within a couple of hours. But something to remember is that we have to have a new moon. I don't know if you've been watching. There's been this beautiful waning crescent that's happening. A new moon, and then the Moon lines up perfectly between the Sun and the Earth. And we've got total solar eclipse. So, I just want to say everybody be safe. Last thing, if I can just share this thing, is that one of the great cultural stories before we understood the science came from the Batammariba Tribe. And they thought anytime the Moon covered up the Sun, that that meant that the -- that the Moon and the Sun were fighting. And that the only way to bring the light back was for people on Earth to stop their quarreling and to make peace. That could be something really amazing uh to happen tomorrow amidst this great celestial event.",

White Ranch, Colorado 96 mile per hour wind gust. Several 80 and 90-mile-per-hour wind gusts in that state. Even Oklahoma though picking up wind gusts above that 60- mile-per-hour range.And it's those high winds that are going to help fuel the fire concern for today not just in Oklahoma, but again, you can see a lot of the surrounding states have that elevated and critical fire threat for today, but also for Monday as well. Now, on Monday, that's not the only concern we're going to have. We also have the potential for severe storms across the Southern Tier, especially Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. That is very likely going to cause some problems for folks down there who were hoping to view the eclipse. Obviously going to be better viewing the farther north. You can go especially into places like Vermont and Maine. The main concern with the severe threat is going to be large to very large hail talking possibly up to tennis ball size, guys. And then, yes, the potential for some tornadoes. So, people leaving the eclipse may have to keep that in mind as they're looking at their exit route after seeing the eclipse.",

And you know, when you think of all these great players at Connecticut, and they're wonderful, they all went and played with other future WNBA players. And so, they're saying you have to win a championship or Brandon Stewart said this, you have to win a championship to be -- you know, to be one of the greats.Caitlin Clark is one of the greats. What she is doing has never been done before in women's basketball. And why, instead of this conversation, why they're not saying thank you Caitlin, why they're not saying you know, understanding that a rising tide lifts all boats. I remember Tiger Woods getting little of this before he went into the PGA Tour. Pretty quickly the PGA tour players were like, oh we love you, Tiger. So, I guess this is a human nature. But what Caitlin Clark is doing at Iowa, she stayed home and has built a program where she'll be the only WNBA player of course on that roster and UConn is just loaded. So, I think it's a little bit of apples and oranges. And why aren't we celebrating one of the greatest things that happen not just in basketball, women's basketball but in women's sports and frankly in American Sports. We have fallen in love with what we've created, the girl next door.

It reminds me a lot of the Women's World Cup team in 1999, the soccer Brandi Chastain and Briana Scurry and Mia Hamm, et cetera.So, I think -- I think Iowa, of course, they'd love to win the game. But if they don't win the game, I still -- I think it's basically the same. South Carolina, Dawn Staley, you know, she played on our Olympic team, wore the red, white, and blue, carried the flag in the opening ceremonies at an Olympics, and just doesn't recruit, she reloads every year in terms of the talent that wants to play for her. She is the best coach in the country. She is the one that is the gold standard. And how wonderful the storyline is here, right, of this one great player as you said a few moments ago, Victor, leading into the segment, and this great coach and great team. Not that Iowa doesn't have a great coach in Lisa Bluder.
