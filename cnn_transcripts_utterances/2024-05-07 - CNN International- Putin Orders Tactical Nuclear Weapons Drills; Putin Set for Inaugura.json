      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM, I'm Max Foster. These are our stories, our top stories this hour.Just a few hours ago, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi cast his ballot in the country's general election. Modi is seeking his third consecutive term. The election started on April the 19th and is expected to last until June the 1st. Nearly a billion people eligible to vote. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has landed in Guatemala where he will meet with the country's president later today. He'll also attend a series of meetings with regional leaders on migration. And the launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft was scrapped just two hours before liftoff due to a technical issue with the Atlas V rocket. It was due to take off on Monday night with two NASA astronauts on board headed to the International Space Station. Now, for the first time since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has announced it will hold military drills involving tactical nuclear weapons. It's a potentially dangerous escalation by Vladimir Putin who's often threatened to deploy nukes on the battlefield but could now be putting Moscow on a path to actually using them. Russia says the drills are ordered in response to what it calls provocative statements and threats from Russian, or rather, Western officials. Just last week, French President Emmanuel Macron again said he would not rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine warning European security is at stake if Russia wins the war. And on a visit to Kyiv, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine would use British-supplied weapons however it likes including to strike targets inside Russia. The U.S. has previously downplayed Putin's veiled nuclear threats and now it seems it's no different. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: It's just reckless and irresponsible for the leader of a major nuclear armed power to be saber-rattling the way that he is with respect to potential use for nuclear weapons. I can tell you we've seen nothing, even despite the reckless rhetoric that would cause us to change our strategic deterrent posture. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Putin won the presidential election in March by a landslide but faced no real opposition, of course.Most EU countries, as well as the United States, will not have a representative at his inauguration. Clare joins us now. I mean, just for people watching, the idea of nukes being used on the battlefield will strike fear through many people. And also, words of America saying, don't worry about it, won't really resonate.",

      "sentences": "I mean, this is -- that is in Moscow's interest, right? They want to keep up, they have a clear interest in keeping up that level of fear that as a nuclear armed power, which is already, frankly, waging an unprovoked conventional war in Europe that they could escalate. Beyond that, that fear has been there all along.It's informed many critical decisions from Ukraine's allies when it comes to which weapons to provide and when. And this threat coming just one day ahead of the inauguration in response ostensibly to those comments from Macron and from David Cameron achieves that. However, there is, I think, more concern than the U.S. is publicly giving off. Our own Jim Sciutto reported a few months ago that Russia came really close to using a tactical nuclear weapon in late 2022, and the U.S. had been sort of actively preparing for that. So this is a fragile time. Russia has, of course, withdrawn from pretty much all of the post-Cold War nonproliferation architecture with the U.S. It's refusing to engage on any nonproliferation talks. So it certainly is a concern, even though at this point the U.S. says it doesn't see any evidence that they are preparing to use nuclear weapons on the battlefield. And the threat itself was relatively nonspecific. They've begun preparations. It's happening in the near future. We don't know exactly when, but it is still something that the West is watching really closely.",

The Lithuanian foreign minister in a post on X saying that they would not be taking part in Putin's fake inauguration theatre. Ukraine has called on its allies not to recognize the results of the election. But I think Putin has set out his store here. They're not actively trying to court the presence of foreign diplomats. This is more about presenting him to the Russian people with this new mandate, even though, of course, we know that he came to power having stifled all opposition and criminalized pretty much all dissent.",

The Israeli military says it's now in control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing, one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid into Gaza. Meanwhile, medical officials in Gaza are reporting at least 15 people have been killed in the latest Israeli airstrikes on Rafah. Israel warned civilians in the eastern part of the city to evacuate. On Monday, the White House says it doesn't support Israel's decision to shut down Al Jazeera's operations in the country. The Israeli government says the network's activities violated state security.

That's what the Foreign Press Association has called the Israeli decision to shutter the local offices of Qatari news network Al Jazeera. This video obtained by CNN shows Israeli officials raiding and confiscating the channel's equipment in Jerusalem.

It is critically important and the United States supports the critically important work journalists around the world do. And so, and that includes those who are reporting in the conflict in Gaza.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: More people detained here at UCLA according to the pro-Palestinian organizers here on campus. We also learned that some of these protesters decided to have a sit-in at the building right here behind me and eventually were forced to exit the building by authorities in riot gear. They also held a march around campus where they were chanting their demands the demands that we have been hearing for weeks which include divestment and transparency from the university. After this march and the protest around campus the university did announce that classes would be moved to remote classes and so of course a lot of the organizers say that's exactly what they wanted to see. They called it disruption and that's what they wanted from the university. This obviously all comes after Thursday when authorities essentially cleaned up the encampment that had been here on campus for about a week and that morning we did see the chaos and the violence and more than 200 people arrested. After that cleanup I spoke to some of the pro-Palestinian organizers who told me that this wasn't over for them and that's exactly what we saw.
