The big question, will Trump used this moment to make his return to Twitter? Let's go straight to CNN's Steve Contorno, who's following DeSantis's upcoming announcement live from Miami.

Well, of course, today he becomes one official. He became one yesterday. And so that is the question here is how he distinguishes himself from Trump without alienating his voters, but shows that he can still be, you know, that dominant force in the Republican Party that he was once seen as. That is obviously going to be the biggest test for him going forward. He's been polishing up his stump speech. He'll be trying that out on the campaign trail.

And so now that he is actually becoming a declared candidate, can he do exactly what David was just saying? Can he meet the hype? Can he -- how is he on the campaign trail? But as he does that, as he has to try to make gains, not just with Republican Party donors, which he seems to be very popular with, can he peel away support not only from Donald Trump and build that his own Republican base, but can he do that with an eye towards the general election, as you mentioned, Jake? And can he build support? I mean, he didn't have the same record that he does now, having the six week abortion ban, some of the things he's done on guns. I mean, he's a very extreme record.

And I do want touch one thing that you said. You mentioned at the top of your show whether or not Donald Trump would get back on Twitter tonight. That is something his aides have been urging him to do, to get back on Twitter since he was reinstated. They believe that it's easier for him to take control of the narrative in this GOP primary if he is back on Twitter. And I will tell you, three months ago, a Trump adviser floated the idea to me of actually getting him back on Twitter the night of Ron DeSantis announcement.

The only thing that has changed is now we have a Democrat in the White House instead of a Republican.I have said, though, moving forward, of course I am willing to negotiate about what next year's budget looks like. We have to do that every year any way by midnight, September 30th. We certainly should have that negotiation. But it should be separate on the fundamental question as to whether or not America will pay its bills. We must avoid default. That cannot be negotiable. But sure, we should negotiate about what spending looks like next year and the year beyond. But let's be clear, when we talk about the national debt, there are two sides of that equation. There's the spending side, but there's also the revenue side. Unfortunately, too many of my Republican friends want to pursue tax cuts for the richest 1 percent that only add trillions of dollars more to the national debt.",

Although I must say, in the case of this inaugural poem, which I'd love to speak about for a moment, that the job of the inaugural poem is to speak to everyone at a moment where the country is doing its democracy, if you will. It is transferring power, it is on the stage with the entire elected federal government on that stage. And that is what Amanda Gorman, I think, in a very extraordinary way, for a very young woman, who has served as a role model to many, managed to talk about our complexity at the same time that she brought hope and aspiration. And that's, I think, the job of the inaugural poem. So my answer to what do they fear is more questions, because I really don't know. TAPPER: Certainly we can understand a parent who thinks that some book has sexually explicit content that should not be available to a 7- year-old, an 8-year-old, a 9-year-old.

If we're going to tell American history in all of its fulsomeness, we have to include the many people who are part of American history. And I think that that is what's important, as well. You know, the American Library Association tracks what they call book challenging, what we may call book banning, and it has been increasing at a tremendous rate. In the speech -- graduation speech at Yale that you mentioned, I told the graduating seniors that five times as many books had been banned now compared to 2019 when they entered college in the first place.
