The ICC has accused them of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including starvation as a method of warfare and murder, persecution and other inhumane acts.

And it all comes to these countries complying. 124 countries that are signatories to the Rome Statute do have an obligation.And we've actually seen other countries not doing so when it comes to any leader that has faced these kinds of arrest warrants. I mean, it basically puts Netanyahu in the unsavory group of the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Sudanese President Omar al- Bashir. And it's quite interesting to note that South Africa didn't arrest Omar al-Bashir in 2015, even though South Africa is part of the Rome Statute. Mongolia didn't arrest Vladimir Putin earlier this year. So again, it comes down to this type of commitment. Now, interestingly, the ICC had floated the idea of these arrest warrants back in May. Then Israel came out challenging the ICC based on jurisdiction. The ICC said that that was a premature challenge, leaving the door open for now Israel responding again. But at the end of the day, it does come down to compliance. You mentioned these crimes and war crimes against humanity. These are very vital. This is very serious. It does put Netanyahu in a very unsavory group. Yoav Gallant also faces these charges as well. And so do Hamas leadership. Now, Mohammed Deif is on that list as well. The IDF says that he was killed earlier this year, as well as two other Hamas leaders. And really coming out with very strong condemnation. I mean, we've heard from Netanyahu calling this anti-Semitic, talking about the ICC as being politically biased and discriminatory. The U.S. that is not a signatory does mean that Netanyahu and Gallant will be able to travel to the United States. So that is one thing that I guess does create some kind of buffer. But also importantly, when you see the Netherlands, the likes of Canada, Italy, as well as France saying they are going to comply, it does make Netanyahu's life and world a lot smaller.",

And you've got to remember that we've even been covering the story for over the past year in terms of how much humanitarian aid has been going into Gaza that is part of the charge using starvation as a method of warfare.There are a lot of other questions around breaking international law, which has been in discussion and frankly been flagged by many humanitarian organizations for quite some time. And this is the ICC's international response to a lot of what we've been seeing over the past year. Again, seeing the Hamas leadership part of the charges as well is quite important. But the timing obviously has been flagged by the United States as well as Israel. I also want to refer to the major reaction that we've been seeing. Josep Borrell, which is the vice president of the EU Commission, says that he hopes that member states are going to be complying and committed to the ICC's decision. The Palestinian Authority says that the decision now restores hope and confidence in international law. Max, I want you to take a listen to what Palestinians are saying after these arrest warrants were issued. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): This is a great decision, but by God's grace, it's implemented. And Netanyahu faces the darkest day as he's committed many crimes against the Palestinian people. He's killed our children, destroyed our homes, our women and our children.

According to our affiliate CNN Brazil, the federal police alleged that Bolsonaro had full knowledge of a plot to prevent Lula and his government to take office in January 2023 and that that plot included even plans to kill Lula, his vice president Geraldo Alckmin and the Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The prosecutors have presented their final investigation report, which is hundreds of pages long, to the Supreme Court in Brasilia. [04:10:00] It will now be a decision for the Brazil's attorney general to rule whether to present formal charges against Bolsonaro and essentially put him on to trial. If we were to go on to a trial, it would likely take place next year. But this scandal is already making headlines today. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
