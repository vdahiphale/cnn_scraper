And essentially said that he was being sarcastic when calling certain democratic leaders childless cat ladies.I'm going to read for you some of what he said. I know I think we're still working on getting that sound because he just made these comments. But he said, quote, \"this is not about criticizing people who, for various reasons, didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.\" He also went on to address some of the criticism we heard from celebrity Jennifer Aniston, who actually had made a remark saying, I hope your daughter does not struggle with fertility issues. J.D. Vance hit back at that during this interview as well and said that those comments were disgusting and that again, he wasn't trying to talk about or not be sympathetic to women who struggle with fertility issues, but that this was more about how Democrats in his terms have been, quote, \"anti-child.\" But look, I think this is him really trying to clarify and clean up some of these remarks and put them into context. When I've talked to his team about this and to Trump's team, they said these were comments from a long time ago. They were taken out of context. You know, this was an interview he did with Tucker Carlson. He didn't say much more beyond that during that interview. But there are other times where he went into this more at length. And this is him truly trying to, you know, set the narrative straight. And I will also argue that Democrats have really seized on this as well. And so they've kind of been given the last 24 hours or so since these remarks resurfaced to fill that space and fill the oxygen by going after J.D. Vance on this. This is them trying to put this back into context and make sure that, you know, this is what he's saying he means. And so we'll see more from this interview soon. But like I said, he's really trying to contextualize these and clean it up a bit.",

And when you listen to those remarks yesterday, they were some of the most forceful comments about the war that we have seen thus far coming out of the White House. She said that she told the Prime Minister that she had serious concerns about the civilian casualties, the humanitarian suffering in Gaza. She said, we cannot look away. I will not be silent. And that prompted Israeli officials, including one, as you said, that was traveling with the Prime Minister, saying that those comments could end up being interpreted by Hamas as there being daylight between the U.S. and Israel.[14:05:13] And they sort of raised the suggestion that that could complicate the ongoing negotiations for a ceasefire and hostages release deal. The Vice President's office is now clearly trying to reject that notion. This is what an aide to the Vice President said in part in a statement. They said, I don't know what they're talking about. President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered the same message in their private meetings to Prime Minister Netanyahu. It is time to get the ceasefire and hostage deal done. This is clearly, Boris, only the beginning of the Vice President's transformation from vice president to vice president that is now seeking the presidency. You know, up until Sunday, the Vice President's office has always been very sensitive to any comments that she might make, anything she might do, that could suggest that there is daylight between the president on policy issues and the vice president. And I do think we are going to see in the coming days and weeks whether that stance begins to shift a little bit as she is quickly trying to come into her own and build out her candidacy.",

The former President is at 48%, Harris at 47. And this is a poll that was fully conducted after Biden withdrew from the 2024 race. It does also show favorability has improved for both candidates, six points for Trump, a jump of ten points for Harris.

That poll means nothing, a one point lead. The fact is that Kamala Harris has now tied it up again. It's almost like we're back to where we were before that disastrous first debate when Biden's performance was extremely subpar. So that's good.And we need to remember people -- number one, they don't follow vice presidents. We do. You know, the uber political activists and reporters, you know, we follow presidents, and vice presidents, and senators and all the rest. But Americans don't do that unless a vice president is moving up, as Kamala Harris is now doing. So she's not well-defined. And what's going to define her? She fears that it will be a massive attacks and negative advertising from the Trump people. But what could define her much better and much further would be the selection of this vice presidential candidate. She can really shape her image in ways that will help her enormously. And yes, other presidents have done that, too. I can just cite one example. Bill Clinton. In 1992, there was a debate going on as to whether he was a liberal or whether he was a moderate. So he picked somebody that surprised the political community. He picked Al Gore, who was clearly seen as a moderate, even a moderate conservative senator from Tennessee. It helped to define Clinton as a moderate. It helped him win the election.",

But I do think that you can have a safe pick who brings in electoral votes. That's the whole ball game, is winning 270 electoral votes.So bring in a state that's not quite there for you. And the running mate, the research shows, can add a point or two or three, depending on the year and the circumstances. Hey, these races are really close in the swing states.
