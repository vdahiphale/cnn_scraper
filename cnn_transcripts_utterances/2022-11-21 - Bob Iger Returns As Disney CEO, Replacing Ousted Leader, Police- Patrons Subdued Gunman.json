One of the nation's largest railroad unions has rejected a tentative deal brokered by the White House. Negotiators are now facing a deadline in early December to reach another deal. This news once again, though, brings the country back to the brink just ahead of the holidays. And the Association of American railroads estimates that it could cost the U.S. economy $2 billion a day if rail workers really do end up going on strike.Now to a story that has all of Hollywood buzzing right now. Disney's Board of Directors is ousting its CEO, Bob Chapek, after a short and rocky tenure. It's now just his -- it's not just his ouster, it's who they're bringing back in that's also getting a lot of attention, Bob Iger, the company's longtime leader who had retired now coming back to run the media empire once again. Matt Egan joins me now with much more on this. Matt, what's happened, and what is happening?",

And then just two weeks ago, Disney unnerved Wall Street by revealing mounting losses at a streaming business at a time when investors don't really have patience for that. So, the board decided that they want to ride out the storm in the media industry by going to a trusted hand and it doesn't get any more trusted than Bob Iger.I mean he's one of the most successful CEOs of his time. He built Disney into a real media empire, right? He went out and acquired Lucas Films, 21st Century Fox, Marvel, Pixar, he launched Disney plus. Wall Street is loving the fact that he's back. Disney shares were down on the year dramatically but up 7 percent this morning on this news. But the fact that he's coming back is a surprise even to Iger. He had previously dismissed this idea. Listen to what he told Kara Swisher back in January about this. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KARA SWISHER, JOURNALIST: But one of the things -- CNBC polled 10 media executives anonymously about their 2022 predictions, and one was that you'll return to Disney.",

They say those two surviving roommates. They are not suspects in this case. They're also saying that they need to clarify some of the speculations, especially around the people that interacted with Kaylee and Maddie. If you recall, we know that Ethan and Xana, they went out to a party, and were back home at around two in the morning. But Kaylee and Maddie, they went to a sports bar. Then they go to a food truck. There was that video that was circulating with them interacting with that man on a food truck. They're saying that man is not a suspect. Then they took a ride home, the driver, not a suspect. And then they called another man, and they're saying he is also not a suspect. But there's still, of course, a question of who did this and they're still really not saying much, Kate.",

It wasn't an illegal concession, no concession is, but it was made with sincerity. The chances of the Secretary of State changing 550 or some votes is so tiny, that I just didn't want to change my view on life and politics about trying to be authentic and sincere.And there were a lot of people that wanted to send us a lot of money, which was great. And maybe I'm crazy for turning that down. But we also had a lot of people out there in the country that were going to be insincere about generating a tremendous amount of money and using it for other things that had nothing to do with this race. And so we made the decision that we will concede, and I made that call to Representative Boebert a little bit before I went on the air on Friday afternoon. Again, if there's more than a handful of votes, and I mean, literally a handful of votes of the change, we'd all be shocked. Again, the -- it was a sincere gesture. It wasn't a leak one, so if somehow the Secretary of State's office deems that we see more votes than the current representative, will be the one sworn in on January 3. There'll be a lot of legal wrangling between now and then I'm assuming, but again, I just don't see a path to victory as we laid it out.",
