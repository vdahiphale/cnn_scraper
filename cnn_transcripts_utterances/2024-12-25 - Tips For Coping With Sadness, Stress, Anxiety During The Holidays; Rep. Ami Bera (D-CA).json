Guests like President-elect Donald Trump, First Lady Jill Biden, Prince William and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy also on hand.This holiday is also of course always a time filled with plenty of food, parties, joy, fun, gifts, all the good stuff. But for some, this time of year can also bring with it a lot of sadness and a lot of anxiety. And it turns out it is quite common. You are not alone if you are dealing with the holiday blues right now, but there is help on the way. Joining us right now is Jeff Gardere, clinical psychologist and professor of behavioral medicine at Touro University. It's good to see you. Thank you for coming in. So -- DR. JEFF GARDERE, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST: Thank you Kate. Great to be here, Kate.",

And a lot of that has to do with the stress of all of those great things that you said that we should be celebrating. For some people it's just a little bit too much, too many unrealistic expectations of having to be present, having to be there, having to be smiling, too many of the sentimental memories of days gone by or people that we've lost or that inability for whatever reason it may be, Kate, to be with family and friends during the holiday.

Or even more importantly, sitting at the kitchen table or sitting at the dining room table and leaving an open place setting for that individual. Have a libation for them or just talk about what it is that they meant in our lives.So this way it's not just about grieving, but more importantly, celebrating the memory of the significance of that individual in our -- in our personal lives as well as that in our families and in society.",

Congressman, let me play what Jonathan Dekel-Chen told me.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE: But clearly over the course of the last three weeks since President-elect Trump came out with a very strong statement with a deadline of January 20th, his inauguration, clearly all of the sides, the intermediaries, Egypt, Qatar, Hamas and Israel have put into motion a negotiation process that had been stalled for months until that statement. There seems to be an urgency on all sides that's been missing for a very long time to get this done.

I mean, the amount of starvation there is pretty incredible. And then there's a real possibility of a very different Middle East. You've seen Hezbollah decimated. We've just seen what happened in Syria.Iran really is in a very precarious position.
