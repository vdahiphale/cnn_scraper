And we know from one of our sources that General Motors and the union has made significant progress on key issues. And that's important because over the last three weeks, General Motors has been struck three times while the other two, Ford and Stellantis, have been struck twice. Is it enough to avert another targeted strike against General Motors and the rest of the Big Three? We'll see. But we'll only know at 2:00 p.m. today.",

But then a step back, looking at the broader economy and Ford, Stellantis, and GM, estimates put losses at nearly $4 billion. So that is losses to the automakers. That is lost wages. That is losses to dealerships and consumers.But the number $4 billion really encompasses just the first two weeks. Remember, we are already in the third week. There have been additional plants that have been targeted to strike. But we know that General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis say that they're all putting record deals on the table -- record offers to the Big Three -- but apparently, not enough quite yet to avert a strike or expand targeted strikes. On the wage issue, though, it's important to note that folks who are on the picket lines -- the 25,000 that are on the picket lines, as well as the more than 3,000 that have been laid off because of the ripple effect -- they're eligible for strike pay from the union, but that's only $500 a week. That is not really what their wages normally are. So a good, sort of, stopgap for now but these folks, at the end of the day, want to get off the picket lines.

That is when the suspect kicked mopeds and scooters that were parked on the street and ultimately, confronted Carson, asking \"What are you looking at?\" Carson reportedly tried to de-escalate the situation.

And as regulators and law enforcement officials sort of are playing catch-up, and I think doing a decent job at this point, I think we'll see more of this to come.

The project he named, he happened to own a lot of it. I thought that was awfully self-serving.And then, at the end of our interview when he thought the cameras weren't rolling -- and this was all recorded -- he started slagging the other players in crypto, talking trash about, including one of his biggest business partners, Tether. I just -- it gave me the chills. I thought if this is the king of crypto, is this a kingdom of sand? This is not a real business. What are we talking about here?
