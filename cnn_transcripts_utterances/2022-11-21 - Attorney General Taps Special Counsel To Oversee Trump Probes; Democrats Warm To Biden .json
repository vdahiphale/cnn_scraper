You know, I talk to people in Trump's orbit and they said that they pretty much knew that this was likely going to happen if he did announce that run on Tuesday night -- so not unexpected for them.I do wonder, though, because Jack Smith has got a complicated task ahead of him now when he's dealing with what he's overseeing. Because it's the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation but also aspects of the January 6 investigation. You know, how complicated is his role going to be looking at those two things?",

So there's already been a lot of work done.It's a much more -- it's a more complicated case in my judgment. The Mar-a-Lago case is much more straightforward. Now the question of whether or not President Trump improperly removed documents and, particularly, classified documents, and have them in possession in Florida. And to me, it's a much more straightforward case -- a much easier case to prosecute and present to a jury than perhaps a January 6 case. But -- so, clearly, these are distinct cases. Obviously, there are complications in both. But this is a very experienced prosecutor and he'll be well-supported, well-staffed. And by all accounts, he'll move these two prosecutions forward and hopefully, we'll have some action and some decisions sometime in the very immediate future.",

The question -- the timing is interesting -- eight -- I guess eight years after the fact. Why is it being -- why are we just now hearing about this?

Of course, that's assuming he's the nominee. That is according to conversations of 24 Democratic- elected officials and top operatives, and White House aides. Instead, Democrats are more worried about a non-Trump opponent.Asked how they would feel about Biden's chances against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or other Republicans who could make a generational argument without bringing Trump's baggage, one operative said, quote, \"Not great.\" Another said, quote, \"Uneasy.\" Let's bring in our colleague, CNN senior reporter Isaac Dovere.

And, in fact, what you see is a lot of Democrats getting a kick out of the initial reception that Trump's announcement last week has gotten from Republicans, which is people saying that they are not really interested in him running -- a lot of elected officials on the Republican side. And so, Democrats get a kick out of that.What they then think is uh-oh, does that mean that we're going to get another Republican -- someone who would be younger, who would be fresher than Donald Trump, and what would that matchup look like? And that leads to a lot of questions about where they should go. But when President Biden and other people around him look at the results of the midterms they say this is another stamp of approval from the voters saying they like what Joe Biden is doing. They like who he is. You see Roy Cooper, the governor of North Carolina, saying to me that it's not about favorability ratings but that Democrats need to look at voters responding to what Democrats did -- what they got done. And yet, you still have people like Congresswoman Annie Kuster from New Hampshire, who said to me that she's still in a wait-and-see period. She doesn't know.
