The idea that people would pay money to create false information to make their opponent look bad, other campaigns have done that. The Steele dossier is a good example of that with the so-called Trump pee tape, and everything else. So it is the unfortunate reality.What they need to do is then tie that to the false business records, and I don't think that they're going to be able to do that with this witness. I think he's doing a very good job of setting the scene and giving all the background and he's going to be able to corroborate a lot of what Michael Cohen said, but it's not going to get to the ultimate issue.",

The key question here is how far can state abortion bans go when it comes to a woman suffering a medical emergency? The eventual decision here could very well set an important precedent for all of the states now pushing restrictive abortion bans now that Roe is no longer in place.CNN's Joan Biskupic, she has much more from us from Washington outside of the Supreme Court. Joan, the -- it seems that the state of Idaho, the argument they're making in pushing back against the Biden administration's case here is that they say that the Biden administration is essentially crying wolf when it comes to their restrictive abortion ban.

The Center for Reproductive Rights has brought lawsuits against Texas with their extreme bans and Idaho and Tennessee, and talked to so many more women across the nation who are already suffering. They're going to emergency rooms. The doctors there are afraid to give them the emergency health care they need, which can be abortion when it's indicated.And so what we will see is more of what we have now.

Amanda had a much-wanted pregnancy. Into her 17th week her water broke. She lost all her amniotic fluid. This is something that a 17-week fetus cannot survive. And yet she was turned back from the hospital. They were afraid to give her an abortion because Texas, among other things, has a 99-year prison sentence for committing abortion.And so she was sent home. She was sent home to suffer until she in fact got an infection. She got sepsis, and she was in the intensive care unit for three days fighting for her life. This is what happens when doctors are afraid legitimately of criminal laws on abortion. And that is why it is so important that the Supreme Court say yes, the Biden administration is right. When you shop in an E.R. and you are pregnant and you're in a health crisis, you deserve emergency care.",

Ultimately, he made the decision that he was going to move forward despite the threats against his job, and I will say, I talked to a number of Republican senators yesterday who were supportive of this package, and were applauding Speaker Johnson, arguing that this was a really brave move that this was a move that showed that he was growing as the leader. But it is also a testament to the fact that Schumer and McConnell behind-the-scenes were continually having conversations trying to figure out a way forward, trying to figure out the best package possible, and ultimately, what they passed last night, despite the fact there are some changes from the original Senate bill, it really largely reflected the bill that was passed in February. There were additional Republican votes that they were able to get some Republicans view Donald Trump's comments as not really against this package, instead, saying that they felt like there was room to vote yes on this package. Obviously, we have talked  repeatedly in the past about Donald Trump's grasp over the Republican Party in the Senate. But this was a huge moment for lawmakers and really a huge moment to show what can happen when lawmakers work together across the aisle.",

Whether that time frame should be longer.So there is an additional runway for the time that they have to sell off this company. Otherwise, it will be unavailable on US apps. Now, I will say that this was kind of interesting vote for lawmakers. You know, if you think about the Senate and it is an older body, lawmakers were really grappling with what to do here and it is kind of funny, I talked to Senator Mike Rounds about this and he said his granddaughter was actually texting him a couple of weeks ago when the House passed this asking her grandfather, are you going to vote for that? Trying to figure out what he was going to do. And ultimately, senators decided that this was the right step. Obviously, the president is expected to sign this bill today, but it will be we really interesting to see what unfolds in the months ahead.",

That's fine, but it is still an order of the court.You don't get to violate it because well, I thought it was necessary to violate it or well, I felt the need to violate it. None of that is going to fly to me, so I think Tim is right, I guess that's the best argument Donald Trump could have about why it was not as flagrant, maybe as it would have been if he had done it after the hearing.

I mean, what if Donald Trump continues to violate, what if the judge continues to reprimand him, continues to fine him, and what if this happens four, five, six times? So it is possible there could come a moment where this is a reality. I think it is the right thing for the Secret Service to think about those possibilities.
