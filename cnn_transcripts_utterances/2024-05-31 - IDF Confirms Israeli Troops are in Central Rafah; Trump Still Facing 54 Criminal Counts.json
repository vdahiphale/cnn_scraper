      "sentences": "It really doesn't. I mean, Donald Trump's defense team strategy throughout this has been delay, delay, delay. They were unable to successfully delay the Hush Money case.Obviously, we saw the 34 guilty verdicts yesterday, but the other cases, they've been quite successful in delaying through motions and otherwise. So I'll kind of tick through them. So first we have the special counsel. He has brought two cases, one here in D.C. involving January 6th, interfering with the electoral count, and then the one down in Florida, classified documents. The January 6th case is indefinitely paused. The Supreme Court has to rule on whether or not Donald Trump has immunity from criminal prosecution. If he does have some immunity, maybe it'll go back down to the court to find out exactly what official acts might qualify for immunity. So that could take a while. The judge in that case has already said even if she gets the green light to proceed to trial, it probably wouldn't start until at least September, but it's still getting very close to the election. Then we have the case, the classified documents case down in Florida, also brought by the special counsel. That one's been moving forward, but at a very slow pace here. The judge has been criticized for moving slowly, but also in fairness, there are a lot of thorny issues to work through with the classified documents issue. That one has also been indefinitely paused, very unlikely it'll go to trial before the election. And then there's the Georgia case. That is on pause as well because they're dealing with appeals issues. The Georgia Court of Appeals has agreed to hear an appeal where the lower court said Fani Willis didn't need to be disqualified despite her romantic affair with the lead prosecutor, but now that issue is going to go up to the appeals court.",

So we'll likely be getting that decision within the next four weeks.But even if they issue their decision soon, the judge in the case here in DC has already said, look, even if I get the green light to proceed with this, there are still a lot of pre-trial motions that would take a while throughout the summer. It's very likely that she won't get an immediate green light, that there may be some issues to work out as to which official acts could potentially qualify for immunity. So it seems like that one's going to be slow going unless the court just flat out says, no, the president does not have any immunity, which kind of seems unlikely. KEILAR: Yes, very interesting. And we'll be watching very closely for that in the next four weeks. Jessica, thank you so much for getting us up to date here. We are in, of course, unprecedented territory.
