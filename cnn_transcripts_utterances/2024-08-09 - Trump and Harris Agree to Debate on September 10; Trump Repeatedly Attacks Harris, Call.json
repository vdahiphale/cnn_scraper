It's 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Washington.Both U.S. presidential nominees have agreed to face off on the national stage of the debate on September 10th, but Kamala Harris has yet to reveal whether she'll commit to the other two debates suggested by Donald Trump. On Thursday, Trump tried to reclaim some of the spotlight from his rival with a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The Harris campaign is calling Trump's rambling remarks a public meltdown. CNN's Kristen Holmes reports from Florida. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump gave a very wide-ranging press conference on Thursday, speaking for more than an hour, calling Kamala Harris his now-rival, barely competent, calling her names, attacking Tim Walz, her now- running mate on the Democratic ticket. But he spent a lot of the time really doubling down on this new narrative that we've heard from the Republican Party. And that was part of why they did this press conference today, that Kamala Harris will not sit down for an interview, that she will not take questions from the press. Here's what he said about this today. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She's not doing any news conference. You know why she's not doing it? Because she can't do a news conference. She doesn't know how to do a news conference. She's not smart enough to do a news conference.",

Of course, he had agreed to that, then reneged. Now he is saying he will, in fact, do that debate. The other thing that was asked of him, partly by me, partly by other reporters, was why he wasn't campaigning more, why his campaign doesn't seem to have changed. And he said that he didn't need to campaign, that he was leading by so much. But if you talk to his senior officials and advisors, they know that's not the case. They know that there's been a change in this ticket and in this race, given the enthusiasm we now see around Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the enthusiasm that is there that wasn't there for President Joe Biden. But clearly, Donald Trump getting under his skin, what he is seeing on the other side here with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, part of that being the crowd size. He said there wasn't that much enthusiasm on that side. When he was asked about the fact that there was more bigger events for Harris than we had seen for Joe Biden, he instead lashed out at the media, saying the media inflated her numbers and downplayed his numbers. The one thing is clear, he was out there, he was talking to reporters, and he is definitely on the offensive right now as we are heading closer and closer to November.

It all comes as Harris is trying to draw a major contrast with Trump when it pertains to labor issues.Her new running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, also spoke very bluntly about the contrast between the Harris campaign and Trump. Take a listen. GOV. TIM WALZ, D-MN, U.S. VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We know that unions built the middle class. The rest of America has to. You know who doesn't believe that? Donald Trump. This guy doesn't know the first thing about unity or service. He's too busy serving himself. Again and again and again, you've seen it. He put himself above us.

Former President Donald Trump is also seeking to make his own appeals to working-class and rank-and-file union members heading into the November election. The Harris campaign has said they plan on spending hundreds of millions of dollars across battleground states to directly appeal to union workers.Those type of workers will be key in battleground states like Michigan, but also in other blue-wall states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as Harris is trying to replicate Biden's victory in those three states in this November election. Now, Harris, while she was on the ground in Detroit, also talked about the commitments she's making relating to presidential debates against Donald Trump. Harris told reporters that she is committed and looks forward to seeing Trump at an ABC debate on September 10th, but then she added that she's happy to talk about other debates that could take place after that period. It comes after Trump himself has said that he's committing to three debates, one on Fox News, another on ABC, and one on NBC. Harris has yet to commit to those two other debates aside from ABC News, but she has said she's looking forward to debating Trump and laying out the contrast in their record and vision for the country heading into November's election.

After a year of pushing to move forward, now in the wake of the Supreme Court's sweeping decision on presidential immunity, Jack Smith's team say they need more time to figure out how to proceed. A delay would mean any further action in the case could take place only in September, the earliest. That's a short time, of course, before the presidential election.A source said the Trump defense is happy to provide the extra time. Now, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt are leading a new push for negotiations between Israel and Hamas. They released a statement saying, in part: There's no further time to waste, nor excuses from any party for further delay. It's time to release the hostages, begin the ceasefire and implement this agreement. Israel says it'll send a negotiating team to Cairo or Doha next week. Hamas hasn't responded. The entire region is on edge, bracing for possible Iranian or Hezbollah retaliation against Israel after the recent assassinations of senior Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. Elliott is following all of this for us. I mean, the language we're getting from the mediators is the same we've had all along, but, you know, it's the progress that matters.",

He who plays with fire may expect destruction. That was from Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defense minister. So for now, it's just the war of words that's escalating. But certainly President Macron, in a conversation with the new Iranian president, was saying that, look, retaliation needs to be taken off the table. We had kind of mixed words from the president, saying that if the West wants to prevent a war, then it should focus on getting a ceasefire. But then you have the mission to the United Nations from Iran saying that, you know, punishment is coming, and we've seen stuff from, you know, for example, Hezbollah's leader Nasrallah, you know, posting on Twitter, you know, maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow, maybe in a week, and that making Israel wait is part of the punishment. So still very much on edge. A retaliation is expected. What form that will take, how large it will be, and what response from Israel that will engender, we really just don't know.",

Five out of five competitions were able to happen and take place in the River Seine, with 100 percent of the indicators on the competition venue, strictly speaking, that were really impeccable.
