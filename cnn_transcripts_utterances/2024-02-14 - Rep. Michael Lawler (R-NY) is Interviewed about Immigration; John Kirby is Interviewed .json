This is what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): If those 10 Republican Senators - or congressman from the state of New York stood here and said, we have to look out for New Yorkers, our state is being hit hard with this, other states are as well. If they banded together, they would have the political clout necessary to deliver for our state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, in fact, we have invited Governor Hochul to come meet with the New York Republican delegation. She has thus far refused to do so. So, I don't take any lectures from Governor Hochul, especially when she has enacted sanctuary city and state policies in New York where the right to shelter is being interpreted to mean that illegal immigrants get housing, where they're taking $2.4 billion in the state budget, cutting school aid to public schools in New York to fund illegal immigrants in New York City. So, I take no lectures from Governor Hochul on that.But, at the end of the day, look, we have a crisis. Since Joe Biden took office, nearly 10 million migrants have crossed our southern border, most of them illegally. Ninety percent of them have been released into our country within 36 to 48 hours of being detained. In just the month of December, you had over 300,000 border crossings.",

They negotiated, but ultimately, they could not pass a bill that included a border deal.

And that's basically what those comments were all about.The president is 100 percent committed to our -- to our NATO commitments and to security on the European continent. As you heard him say again yesterday, we'll defend every inch of NATO territory if it comes to that. And anybody that thinks that Putin's not serious about those threats need to look a little closer at what he's been saying. Not just this Tucker Carlson interview. Look at his speeches, look at his writings over recent years. He absolutely bristles at NATO on his border. He absolutely bristles at the idea that NATO could be stronger and more relevant, which it is right now. And he has threatened some of our NATO allies. So, we've got to take this seriously because, I'll tell you, if you think it costs a lot right now to support Ukraine, think about the cost to American blood and treasure if, in fact, he goes after our NATO ally, and then you've got American troops on the ground involved in combat.",

We - we do agree that it's important to get humanitarian assistance into the desperate people of Gaza.
