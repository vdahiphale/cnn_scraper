The war in Israel has taken a new turn, Donald Trump's former chief of staff reportedly flips on him, and the House is still without a speaker as the Republican Party implodes. That's tonight on Newsnight.And good evening. I'm Abby Phillips. It has been an extraordinarily bad day for MAGA Republicans and their leader, and perhaps the biggest development in the serial indictments against Donald Trump. Mark Meadows has reportedly been given immunity to testify in the federal election interference case, that according to ABC News. And on top of this, just hours before, another of his co-defendants in the Georgia case pleaded guilty. That now makes four. In the civil case against his empire, his former fixer directly implicated him for fraud. Trump and Michael Cohen came face to face in the courtroom for the first time in five years today. But even as Trump faced some of his most significant legal setbacks, he appeared hell-bent to flex his influence over on Capitol Hill. Just hours after Republicans chose their third candidate for the speakership, his candidacy ended abruptly with a Trump Truth Social post. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

If there is one thing who people who know him consistently say, it's that he says different things to different people. So, I'm cautious about this reporting in the sense that I do think that he is cooperating to some degree, but I think he's trying to pull off this balancing act, where he can give DOJ just enough but then try to keep this public image of somebody who's aligned with Trump and aligned with the Republican Party. I will be curious to see how this plays out in the coming days, because his team is pushing back in saying he didn't flip, he didn't turn on Trump. I don't know if that is, in fact, the case.",

He also wrote this, the people asking questions about the election were only reacting to what they were seeing, actual evidence of fraud right there in plain sight for anyone to access and analyze.

In many cases he was pulling the strings. He was organizing the meetings. But on the other side, Mark Meadows is a known liar. Not just as someone who knows him, but what he wrote in his book.

But if he is a cooperator in some degree on very similar charges at the federal level, what would that require? I mean, would it mean that Georgia prosecutors would have to know about that cooperation? Would they still charge him even if they knew about it? Could this complicate their case going forward? ROCAHAnd, you know, I don't know if they are or not, but in an ideal world, they are and they're communicating about this. I mean, it may be that Meadows couldn't get a cooperation agreement if he is cooperating federally in Georgia. You know, they're doing things in a different way in Georgia than the Department of Justice does normally. And maybe he's just hoping if he cooperates in the federal case, he will get some credit eventually in Georgia. He's also trying very hard still to move his case to federal court, right, and he would far prefer to have everything there. But, you know, I hear the things that Alyssa's saying about him, and you know, as a prosecutor, I'm like having seizures, right, because you're hearing someone not credible, changes what he says. And I think as a witness, though, they can still deal with that, right, because he's not going to be an island. He's going to be with lots of other people who are saying lots of similar things about what they told Donald Trump about the election not being fraudulent and about who really wanted it.",

What this division that you're seeing playing out in public actually isn't new. My entire time in Congress, this was a dynamic that existed within the GOP conference. The difference is the -- we'll call them the moderates for the sake of argument, the people that are kind of like, you know, let's work together as a team, they're actually standing up and fighting back for the first time ever. If you think back 12 years to anything the Republican majority since 2010 tried to do, there was always a group of people that was, you know, taking it down. You look at the Obamacare repeal and replace bill, which I actually think the one we had created was good until the far right came in and said, no, we want to make sure there's no protection for pre-existing conditions. They're always coming in and throwing bombs. And now you're actually seeing the regular folks actually fighting back against that. And right now, look, Mike Johnson, I mean, I'll tell you, the guy started out fairly normally and then went really deep into Trump when he realized that's what it took to get re-elected. So, he may have the same issues Jim Jordan does as long as the so-called moderates continue to try to fight back. I think we're going to see a point eventually, if I had to predict where this was going to go, it's either going to go into people need to just elect Patrick McHenry, who frankly everybody likes, he's just reluctant to do it, he doesn't want to be speaker. I don't blame him. Or, ultimately, a deal has got to be cut with the Democrats. But we'll see. I think Mike Johnson will be a good test for everybody to see if kind of a regular name, not really a controversial name, can win this. And if he can't, then I think we're going to have to start thinking outside the box.",
