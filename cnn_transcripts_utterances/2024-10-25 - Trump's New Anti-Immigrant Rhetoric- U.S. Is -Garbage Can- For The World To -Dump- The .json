They had vowed to respond and retaliate. We are now seeing that happen. As the IDF says that they are hitting military targets in Iran, as there are reports, tonight, of explosions happening and being heard inside the capital city.I want to go straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is live for CNN in Israel. Jeremy, obviously, just a few days ago, we had both been in Israel. We were waiting to see how Israel was going to respond, as officials had been meeting. What is the latest that you're hearing on what the IDF is carrying out tonight?",

But Israeli officials are taking pains to emphasize that these are only military targets, that they are not striking at any energy targets, nuclear or oil facilities, which we know had been considered by the Israeli government, earlier in this process. I do expect that we will get a fuller accounting from the Israeli military of the targets that they struck, and the number of aircraft potentially that appear to have been involved in this strike. What I can tell you, from speaking with Israeli officials, is that this decision to carry out these strikes on military targets was the process of weeks of deliberations, within the Israeli security cabinet, as well as weeks of consultations, between Israeli and U.S. officials. One Israeli official describing this to me, tonight, as a, quote, very diligent decision-making process. Another Israeli official telling me that they went after targets that, quote, posed the threat or could pose a threat to the State of Israel. Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, in a video statement, tonight, saying that Israel has the right to defend itself, and that it is now prepared for all offensive and defensive scenarios. But for the time being, Israel's Home Front Command has yet to make any changes in its guidelines. And for now, the situation in Israel is effectively normal. Kaitlan.",

Of course, the U.S. had been advising Israel on how to respond, trying to kind of restrain what that response would look like, whether they were striking military targets, nuclear sites, oil facilities.Do we know how much that factored into the weeks of planning that you were just talking about for this response that we're seeing right now?",

We'll check in with you throughout the hour. I also want to bring in CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent, Alex Marquardt, who is here with me. Alex, we're looking at a live image, right now, of Tehran, watching where Israel is responding inside of Iran, the certain targets. Jeremy just mentioned, the 100 U.S. troops who are in Israel, deployed, because they're required to work that sophisticated defense missile system that has been deployed to Israel. When it comes to that and how U.S. officials are waiting to see what this response is going to look like. What are you hearing from sources in Washington?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the overarching hope, Kaitlan, is that whatever we see, tonight, could be absorbed by the Iranians, and that they would not instigate another turn, if you will, and launch another salvo of rockets, missiles and drones, like we've seen over the course of the past few months. That may be wishful thinking.So, I think very -- a lot of this depends on what we actually see, in terms of the targeting, the damage that is done, tonight, by the Israelis. And we should caution everyone that it might not just be one evening. This is something that could drag out, over the course of several days. That remains very much to be seen. But Kaitlan, I want to pick up on something that Jeremy was saying. Because I do think that over the course of the past 24 days, since that October 1st strike by Iran, with those 180 ballistic missiles, there has been not just these consultations, but essentially a negotiation that was underway, with fairly significant pressure, from the Biden administration, on the Israelis, to not go after some of those bigger targets that would lead to more escalatory action by the Iranians, getting them to essentially commit to these military targets. And they have done that tonight. We understand from both the IDF and the White House, saying explicitly that only military targets are being struck. And in return for that, they essentially got that THAAD air defense system that you've been talking about. Very sophisticated. It is something that can take down, with extremely high precision, short, medium and intermediate -- and intermediate range missiles. But they also got more oil sanctions against the Iranians. We saw more F-16s arriving in the Middle East, just today. And you'll recall, Kaitlan, there was that strike by B-2 stealth bombers against Houthi targets just a few days ago. So, there are quite a few actions that the Americans have taken, against enemies of Israel, in recent days, and in defense of Israel, essentially, in a way to make them feel comfortable that they could -- that they don't have to go into Iran, in a much bigger way. So, there is certainly a hope, in Washington, tonight, that what we're seeing now is kind of the extent of the target set. Kaitlan.",

But it's for Iran's attack on Israel on October 1st, which we all watched play out.And it was kind of every single day, what was this response going to look like? And we heard a lot of warnings from the Defense Minister, in Israel, saying it's going to make your jaws drop, what this is going to look like. I mean, I think it's a real question of whether or not, since it's 4:30 in the morning, if we have a good picture of what this looks like, right now.",

But as you -- as you point out, Kaitlan, there has been -- there have been repeated examples of defiance, of the Biden administration, by Prime Minister Netanyahu.

There's also major developments happening here, on the campaign trail at home, I should note. Right now, Donald Trump is flying to Michigan after he taped a three- hour interview with Joe Rogan. He's just apologized to the crowd that you see waiting on him, in Michigan, asking them to stay up late, because he's running several hours late to that event. He hasn't even landed yet. Meanwhile, on the left side of your screen, you are looking at Houston. That is where Vice President Harris is about to bring two very famous Texans, Willie Nelson and Beyonce, to help her deliver a message to voters that she's hoping will go far beyond the Lone Star State. We're going to bring that event to you live when they get on stage. Now, you might be thinking to yourself, Why are they in Texas? It's not a battleground, certainly not in the presidential race. They've got a Senate race happening. But this is not why Harris is rallying there with just a 11 days left in this race. What her campaign is saying, tonight, is that Texas is ground zero, when it comes to this fight over reproductive rights. They've got one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, in Texas, of course, as you know. We've heard stories from women there. And Harris is hoping that issue is going to propel her to victory in a race that right now could not be closer. CNN's last national poll, the final one that we'll do of this presidential race, finds this contest is completely tied up. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was also on his own, in Texas, today, hammering away on immigration, and also repeating a line that he rolled out yesterday that pretty much sums up his closing message.

And I think that was to be expected. The first wave, from what we heard from Iranian reports, targeted primarily the west of Tehran. We're trying to figure out now where the second wave of strikes may be targeting. And I think throughout the course of the evening, we could expect to see more. In fact, Kaitlan, as you and I were talking about earlier, we could not only see more tonight, but we could see more in the coming days. And this could be a multi-level attack, not just air strikes, which we appear to be seeing now. But you could also see cyber strikes, among other kinds of attacks, from the Israelis. Now, the U.S. has been coordinating closely. There is no U.S. role, we should emphasize, in this operation tonight. But the U.S., we are told by American officials, has been well-aware of what Israel is planning. And both American officials and Israeli officials making clear tonight that the targets are military targets. We are told that President Biden has been briefed on this Israeli operation. He is in Wilmington, Delaware. And perhaps indicating the level of concern, or at least comfort with what they know about the Israeli plan, we are told that there are no plans to convene a meeting in the White House Situation Room.

Meanwhile, on the right side of your screen, Donald Trump is over three hours late, right now, for his rally, in battleground Michigan, a very important state when it comes to holding on to the blue wall. We have new video from our reporters on the ground that shows some people in the restless crowd are beginning to head for the exits, despite a video message from Donald Trump, asking them to stay up late for him. My political sources are here with me at the table tonight. I mean, obviously things happen, Scott.
