Earlier, they asked to re-hear parts of the jury instructions, starting with a metaphor about rain that was used by Judge Juan Merchan.Judge -- rather, John E. Jones, a former federal judge and a former chief judge for the U.S. Middle District Court of Pennsylvania is with us. He's also the president of Dickinson College. Judge, thanks so much for being with us. So let's talk about -- JOHN E. JONES III, FORMER FEDERAL JUDGE: Great to be with you, Boris.",

      "sentences": "Thank you. Of course.Let's talk about this rain metaphor. It can really be boiled down to using common sense and inferring that, just because you don't see rain doesn't mean it didn't rain because you can use context clues to determine that there was rain. What do you think jurors should gather from this metaphor?",

      "sentences": "Well, let me tell you where I think it's going, Boris. And this is a sort of semi-educated guess based on the questions. I think Paula Reid said this very accurately a short while ago.They're looking at that first meeting that took place, quite obviously, in 2015, the one where Pecker testified that he said I'll be your eyes and ears for the campaign. And they're trying to figure out, did Donald Trump at that time launch or set in motion, using the words that Paula used, and they're quite accurate, this -- this scheme. Because the two competing narratives basically are, from the defense's standpoint, nothing to see here. We pay people off. You know, hush money is the coin of the realm, that's what we do, or was this a scheme that started in aid of the campaign? Now, we know that the former president doesn't leave a paper trail, right? So they need to have inferences. And that's why they're zeroing in on that particular instruction. Can we infer from other facts that are shown that, in this case, that the former president had a hand in that scheme as it went forward? That's the decision that they're trying to make. I think they factored out a lot of the things that, frankly, counsel spent quite a bit of time on. For example, I don't think they're toiling over Stormy Daniels, nor are they toiling over perhaps the fact that these are -- these we're not legal fees or were legal fees. I think they've figured that out. They're looking to see how culpable is the former president? And can they have a through line that gets this to the point where they start to make those -- those check payments.",

      "sentences": "Sure. So moments ago, Judge, we spoke to a former Trump attorney, Tim Parlatore, and he relayed the idea that it's time for the defense to re-examine the gag order and to push for the gag order to be lifted, something that Donald Trump is wanted now for just about as long as it's been imposed on him.The argument is essentially that the jury has been selected, so there's no, really, tainting the jury pool. And the witnesses have already testified. So there's no witness intimidation. Would you agree? Would you think that Judge Merchan might be open to reexamining the gag order?",

I heard him say that.You know, if -- if they asked Judge Merchan to reconvene court while the jury was deliberating, saying, by the way, we want you to lift the gag order, he would look at them and say, are you kidding me? While the jury is deliberating, there's no way I'm going to touch that. I mean, that's just nothing that he wants to touch at this point. They'd get their heads handed to him by Merchan if they attempted to do that. I just --you know, I don't -- I think they'll let that alone.",

Still not clear if she will attend the annual Trooping the Colours Ceremony next month. But Buckingham Palace says King Charles will attend in a carriage instead of on horseback as he receives treatment for cancer as well.
