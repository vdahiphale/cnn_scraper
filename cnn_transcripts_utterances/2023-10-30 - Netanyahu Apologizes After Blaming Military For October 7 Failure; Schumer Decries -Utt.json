And it does seem that they were -- that the IDF, and they're not saying how they got this intelligence, but they got intelligence, leading them to understand where she was, so that they could put together this operation, to go in, on the ground, and rescue her. She had a medical check, we're told. She was fine after the medical check. We've seen video of her, with her family, celebrating, hugging her grandmother, her family all around her, celebrating. I mean, for the family, this was something, a moment that they thought they might never get. They thought she might never be returned to the family. So, a huge moment for them.

So, I think, it's a very important step, if you will, in this operation, because the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister, the IDF, have all said all along that this is about not only getting -- destroying Hamas, but it's about getting the hostages.

There were multiple prime ministers, from that period, through to today, about four or five prime ministers, depending on when you start. But most of the policy, through that period, was shaped by Netanyahu, during one period that he was Prime Minister, beginning 2008-2009, and then when he picked back up now. And the policy was a sort of practical coexistence, with Hamas, and learning to live with Hamas, even though there'll be Military skirmishes. That was the policy. Israel was misled. I mean, they misled themselves, in a sense, not deliberately, but they were -- they were fooled, into believing that Hamas was serious about governing when Hamas was, in the meantime, building the capability, to launch a sort of genocidal attack, against southern Israel. So, Netanyahu's policy, and the Israeli government's policy, across many prime ministers, was a failure. Of course, there's leaking. It's politics. You know politics here. People leak against each other -- people, there's finger pointing.

In the days that followed, his family believed that he had been killed. But then came this weekend, and Word, from the Israelis that in fact, he had survived. That news was followed immediately by the realization that he is being held hostage, by Hamas, likely trapped in or around the same parts of Gaza that we now see being targeted by the Israelis.

But we are told now it's near the Al-Quds hospital, in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Red Cross Society. They said, quote, \"The building is trembling,\" and that those sheltering inside were experiencing fear and panic. Of course, it's the middle of the night, right now, there. We are still trying to learn more about what happened here. All of this is coming as humanitarian organizations are warning of what they say could be a catastrophe, in Gaza. This is the Head of Surgery, at Gaza's largest hospital, telling CNN that doctors there are overwhelmed, with no space, to deal with the constant influx of wounded people that they are seeing. Dr. Sai'ida recorded, and sent us this video, showing rows of patients, who are lining both sides, of a hospital corridor. There's no room for them. While the United States has been touting the arrival of aid, entering Gaza, surely, it is not nearly enough. Even the U.S. has acknowledged that. And also, one former State Department staffer says that he believes the U.S. needs to take more responsibility, for the civilian casualties. Josh Paul worked in the Bureau within the State Department that's responsible for arm sales. He resigned, in recent days, over America's support of Israel's response, to the October 7th attacks. And he joins me now. Josh, thank you, for being here, tonight. I was reading your resignation letter. It's quite lengthy. And in it, you accuse the U.S. of basically having a blind spot and blind support, for Israel, of supporting the occupation, and rushing into short-sighted, destructive and unjust policies. That's what you say, in your letter. Can you just kind of walk me through what led to this decision, for you, to resign? JOSH PAUL, FORMER DIRECTOR, STATE DEPARTMENT BUREAU OF POLITICAL- MILITARY AFFAIRS: Yes, I've worked in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, for over 11 years. This is the Bureau, responsible for arms transfers, to partners, around the world. I have never seen a circumstance before, in which there is a clear risk, of civilian casualties, resulting from U.S. arms transfers. And in fact, we are seeing that manifesting, on the ground, with thousands of Palestinian civilian casualties. And yet, no questions asked, not even a debate, about whether or not we should provide the arms that are being used to, to commit to those, I believe, human rights violations, but certainly to kill those civilians. So, faced with the massive scope, of the crisis, that we are seeing, in Gaza, the massive scope of civilian casualties, the fact that I also believe that the policy has not led to peace, for Israel, or for Palestinians? It has been a dead-end policy. And -- but absent the ability to have even a discussion, about that, before shipping arms, I felt I had to resign.",

He was also determined to be quote, \"Non-deployable,\" over concerns about his well-being.

In our -- in federal law, you can be prohibited, from purchasing a firearm, if you've been adjudicated a mental defective. So, that means you were involuntarily committed by a court. In this case, if he voluntarily went to an institution, for two weeks of treatment, that would not preclude him, from ever buying guns.

It requires you to be already in custody, before a Police officer can basically require you, to be submitted to a mental examination. That never happened here either. We had sheriffs, who received disturbing information, from the Army, went out to his house, in an effort to try to talk to him, to conduct some sort of an assessment. He refused to speak to them, which is his right. So, at that point, they really didn't have a lot of directions to go.
