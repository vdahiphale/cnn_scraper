Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEE JAE-MYUNG, DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF KOREA LEADER (through translator): My wife suddenly showed me a YouTube video and said the president is declaring martial law.

      "sentences": "So, as South Korea continues to deal with the turmoil created by President Yoon Suk Yeol declaring martial law. Lawmakers are moving to impeach him, but his ruling party plans to oppose that move. How likely is it that the opposition parties will get enough votes to impeach him?NILSSON-WRIGHT: I think it's very hard to say at this point. This is quite a tightly run thing. Essentially, they need eight additional votes. They need to peel away eight votes from the conservative governing party. But the statement from Han Dong-hoon, the leader of the governing party, has been pretty unambiguous, saying that he will work to ensure unity on the part of his own party members, to ensure that that impeachment measure does not go through. And then we are in a very difficult predicament, because this stalemate looks set to continue. And of course, you have to recognize that all of this is happening against the backdrop of acute public anxiety the fact that ordinary South Koreans came out onto the streets of Seoul when the martial law announcement was made in protest against the president's actions. There is a public appetite, I think, to do everything possible, including street demonstrations we may well see on Saturday if that critical impeachment vote fails, that there will be large numbers of Koreans, perhaps in the number -- in the tens if not hundreds of thousands, showing up in the center of Seoul, echoing the so called candlelight demonstrations that we saw in 2016 which led to the impeachment of then President Park Geun-hye. I don't think you can underestimate the extent to which the martial law declaration reminded ordinary Koreans of the experience of the 1980s. And the 1980s were, of course, a critical decade in which, essentially, the democratic movement got its impetus and led ultimately to the overturning of authoritarian leadership. Yoon is intensely unpopular. He was intensely unpopular before he made this announcement. This has contributed to his further what I would describe as a crisis of legitimacy, and therefore the conservative politicians, if they decide not to sign up behind the impeachment measure, may run the risk of being seen as effectively legitimizing this martial law declaration, and therefore we have a situation that is right to exacerbate partisan differences and to create a very volatile situation, not to mention all the concerns that you alluded to, that President Yoon might be minded to introduce another Martial Law order. There are questions about what the opposition can do in the face of failure if that impeachment measure does not go through, and I think that's why foreign governments, not least the United States, are looking at this situation with a great deal of concern and continuing anxiety.",
