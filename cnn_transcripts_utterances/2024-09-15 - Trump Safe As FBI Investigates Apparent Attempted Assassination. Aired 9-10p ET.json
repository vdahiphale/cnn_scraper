One man is now in custody. CNN has identified him, and we'll have more on that in a moment. Today's attempt occurred as the former president and a donor were golfing at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida.Specifically, authorities say they were walking between holes five and six, which we're going to show you on -- on a map. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says it received calls of shots fired by the Secret Service at about 1:30 p.m. Secret Service spotted the engaged man. They've now detained as an agent was walking the course ahead of the former president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, authorities released some photos, these photos earlier today of what they say was found in the bushes where the man was seen an AK-47 style rifle, two backpacks and a GoPro video camera.Sheriff Bradshaw told reporters today that the man they have detained was about 400 to 500 yards away from the former president when he was spotted, whoever he said that with the rifle and the scope, quote, that's not a long distance. The former President later said in a fundraising e-mail that he is safe and well. We've got a team of reporters on this tracking all of it for us tonight. I want to bring in first, Kristen Holmes, who's been in contact with the Trump campaign tonight. So Kristen, Trump's campaign managers releasing a letter after this apparent assassination attempt targeting Donald Trump, what are they saying?",

      "sentences": "Just to give you a layout of how exactly security is right now at Mar-a-Lago since that first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, several of the roads are closed around the Mar-a-Lago resort, so it's not entirely possible to set up and watch from nearby the Mar-a-Lago resort itself, just because of these road closures that they put into place because of this first assassination attempt.There's even some highway exits that are closed off at various points when Donald Trump is in town, which, of course, obviously he was. Now that doesn't mean that people couldn't potentially spot the motorcade traveling. He now travels with a full motorcade. It wasn't always the case before the first assassination attempt. That includes a large van, that includes, generally a CAT team, counter assault team. It also includes an ambulance. That is not something that is generally given to a former president, but they have beefed up the security around him. So there is potential there that someone could have spotted the motorcade driving along various routes in West Palm Beach, keeping track of his movements that way. Obviously, the other thing we know is that Donald Trump flies in a very branded plane that is put onto the tarmac pretty front and center in Palm Beach. You can see it from the side, driven there myself, around the side of the private Air Force -- airport area where he lands that plane. You can see it from the road. So -- so there are obviously indications that you would know he was in town, that you could know his potential movements. It would have to be someone who is paying very close attention. Another reminder here is the fact that he is a former U.S. president, not a sitting U.S. president, which means that he doesn't put out a schedule. He doesn't have to have any sort of daily schedule. And on top of that, he doesn't travel with a press pool. So it's not as though any reporters are 100 percent aware of where he is at all times that we know who he's playing golf with the way we would with a sitting president, they release those names, generally. They release if he's going to play golf. None of that would be something that would be information that needs to be disclosed with a former sitting -- former president. So all of this to say that, yes, of course, there are potential ways that someone could surveil the former president, but it would have to be, would be more difficult given the scenario, given the street closures, given the expanded security, and just the fact that he doesn't have this public information that is easily accessible to any civilian/.",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, we know a lot about Ryan Routh, in part because he seems to be very, very active on social media. I'll start with what we have heard officially from law enforcement. There was a press conference this afternoon with the sheriff, Rick Bradshaw. And he said that this person, the person that's -- that Brian Routh, who is under arrest, is someone obviously they believe is connected in some way to the shooting.They did not name him or identify the -- the suspect in the shooting, but that's what we're told is -- is -- is a situation at this -- at this point. They arrested him this afternoon, Anderson, up several miles north of Palm Beach County there after he had fled. Now what happened was there was a witness who saw him reach, go -- run to a car and flee the scene after the Secret Service had fired these shots. Now what the Secret Service says is that they saw, an agent saw a rifle barrel sticking out from near the bushes, and they fired shots in that direction. We don't know if he was struck. It appears that he may not have been. But what they found there at the scene was a backpack. They found a GoPro camera, which appeared part of his intent was to film his attempted assassination of -- of the former president. And of course, they've also found an AK-47 variant there at the scene. Now we've learned a lot more from some of his social media, Anderson. He's very active supporting Ukraine, obviously. And -- and he's also been very, very critical of Donald Trump. At one point in one of his social media postings, he -- he copied President Joe Biden's social media account and called the MAGA movement, the former president's MAGA movement as MASA, which is Make America -- make -- Make America Slaves Again. [21:10:26] That's one of the comments he has on one of his social media. He's a -- he owns a affordable housing company in -- in Alaska, I'm sorry, in Hawaii. And he's believed to be sort of self-employed. Now we did -- one of our reporters did talk to his son, Anderson, this evening. And I'll read you just a part of what this person, his son, whose name is Oren, said in defense of his father. He says he believes, he hopes, that everything has just been blown out of proportion. It is not like my father to do anything crazy, much less violent. He says he is obviously he doesn't know everything that happened in Florida, but it doesn't sound like the man I -- I know to do anything crazy, much -- much less violent. He's a good father and a great man, and I hope you can pray -- portray him in an honest light. Obviously, a lot more information is going to emerge about Routh in the next couple of days, Anderson. He's probably going to be facing federal charges, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. He's now obviously being held by the -- by the Palm Beach County Sheriff and -- and the FBI who's investigating. One of the things that they're looking into are those social media posts, which might give us obviously a -- a motive of -- as to why he carried out or attempted to carry out this attempted assassination, this apparent attempted assassination, according to the FBI, Anderson.",

Number two, we don't know right now how he determined that today would possibly be available to him to do this assassination, looking at what I see now, that -- that -- he's -- he made a mistake, but he was not unsophisticated.This is a very sophisticated attempted assassination. He's got defensive gear. He's got the GoPro. He wanted this to be a performative assassination. So -- so how did he know, and -- and how did he acquire that knowledge where Trump was. And then -- and then third is access to being so close. We -- we are all familiar with security perimeters now, because we have gone through this just a few months ago in Butler, Pennsylvania, the -- the area was not part of the security perimeter because it was not a public event and -- and how did he get there? How did the car remain there? Those are the questions I have. This was great act by the Secret Service agent who took advantage of his mistake, because he was showing his -- his rifle. And -- and -- and the closeness by which our -- our election, our democracy and Donald Trump all change. It's just -- it's not reassuring, honestly.",

It seems to me, I'm just from that. It looks like he's creating blockage, essentially, from any incoming fire. He's a great -- it seemed to me, and maybe I'm totally wrong, that he wouldn't waste time taking those plates out, putting them on, you know, into a vest around him that he -- he's using, he would -- it seems like he was set up to use those as a shield, because those ceramic plates, as we all know, those are for -- that for rifle fire.

      "sentences": "Right, Anderson. And I think one of the things that obviously that this is going to be part of the investigation, but what it -- what it suggests, as you pointed out, is that, look, he knows exactly what happens once you fire shots, right, if he were -- were able to fire off a shot. And at this point, it does not appear that he was able to -- to fire a shot. But he knows that if he does, that immediately brings gunfire from the protective detail.And so he was trying to figure out a way. This suggests, Anderson, for a way for him to at least be able to survive those first rounds and perhaps fire get -- get more shots out. Now, the variant of the AK-47 that he had, he had a scope, it is possible that he could have been able to -- to get to the former president, so especially as the former president was coming towards him, the -- the distance, according to the police, was about 300 to 500 yards. And so the -- the closer the former president gets, and because of the vantage point of where the person was, it is possible that just a -- a little while longer waiting there, the former president would have been within the distance to be able to be struck by a bullet. And so that's what's so scary about this particular situation. And -- and as you pointed out, Anderson, this person seemed to at least be prepared enough to be able to -- to -- to survive those first initial response shots from -- from the Secret Service, if he had been able to fire a shot.",

If he had the training, the rifle, along with the scope, easily could have made that distance. But as you stated, did he have a clear line of shot to the President? Obviously, golf courses have rolling hills, have bunkers. Whether he would have been able to see the -- the former president and clearly take a shot, it's unknown.One of the things they're going to really look at is his training, and the FBI will conduct the investigation to look into was he preparing for this? Was he preparing for a long shot? Did he go to -- to the rifle ranges? Did he go to outdoor ranges? Was he looking at different variations of distance? Could he have made the shot with his -- with some training on this rifle? Yes, he could have, probably easily, if he had line of sight on the -- on the former president, I think could have very easily taken the shot, and with a rifle of this caliber, it would have done some tremendous damage.

Now there is a visible increase of security around Trump's property, though it is important to note that some of the security measures were put in place after the first attempted assassination of the former president in Pennsylvania.As my colleague, Kristen Holmes, noted earlier in this hour, there is one street, Southern Boulevard, which connects to the mainland and Palm Beach, that is open to the public. However, there are two security checkpoints that are in place. Anderson, there is one island, a small island that you have to cross in order to get out anywhere near Mar-a-Lago. That island, which is normally open to the public, has been closed tonight. Folks are usually allowed to park their cars there, and they're able to get a look at Trump's property. However, that is not the case there. Now, once you -- if you're even able to make it out onto the barrier island, you really cannot get anywhere near Trump's property, because the Secret Service has closed South Ocean Boulevard, which runs along parts of the perimeter to Trump's Mar-a-Lago property. Again, they closed that after the first attempted assassination. And it's expected to be closed through at least November. We're told that any time that the former president is out here, the Secret Service goes -- make sure that that area is closed. Now we are about 10 to 15 minutes from where this incident took place, at the golf course. And Anderson, it really took us a considerable amount of time to get from that location here, in large part because there were so many streets around the golf course that have been closed as a result of this investigation. And so it was just difficult for us to make our way east of where this incident took place. Again, Anderson, we expect a lot of these security measures to remain in effect as this investigation unfolds and the security measures that were in place before today, again, we expect those to essentially be kept in place through at least November.

      "sentences": "Yes, this is really underscored. What we've been hearing, really for a number of years from sources, from Secret Service officials, who do lay out some of the challenges that they have faced when it comes to golf courses, and in particular when it comes to Donald Trump, who we know loves golfing and loves golfing at his own golf courses, and certainly the way this incident unfolded today just gives you a sense of the challenges they're facing.For starters, this course is bounded by three major roads. They're open to traffic, they're open to pedestrians. It's very close to the airport. And Donald Trump's courses are semi-public. They're open to members and paying guests, even when the President and now the former president is there playing a round of golf. So this is essentially a porous environment, and for a president or a former president, that really does present a major challenge for the Secret Service. Now, when Donald Trump was the sitting president, I -- and I covered him down in Palm Beach frequently, the access to the perimeter of the golf course was much more limited. Certainly the public roads remained open, but the sidewalks did not. That changed when he became the former president. And we heard that directly from the Palm Beach County Sheriff earlier today, saying that if Donald Trump had been the sitting president, there may have been more of a perimeter around him. So it all sort of speaks to the fact that these open courses, these open areas, really do present a major challenge for the Secret Service. The President essentially doesn't have anywhere to go if trouble arises. There is no armored suburban sort of trailing him in a way that there normally would be for a president. It is one of the only times they're able to walk outdoors at any sort of length, and that's certainly you don't want, as the Secret Service, to be able to tell a president, no, you can't do that. But it has raised some new questions about the security and the security protocols around golf courses and presidents.",

Would anybody, you know, was it there for a long period of time? Did anybody take any notice of it? We don't have answers on that yet. How -- how has the Secret Service handled previous presidents at golf courses?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting, because, as you know, if -- if Donald Trump had been president and there had been sort of a perimeter established around this golf course, they probably would have identified a stray vehicle, sort of pulled over to the side of the road very close to one of the holes where Donald Trump was playing, because that wasn't the case. The perimeter wasn't there, and they weren't able to detect it until the person had sort of crawled through the bushes and up until the green.And it's interesting, because when, for instance, Barack Obama played golf pretty much every weekend here in Washington, but he played at base -- at Joint Base Andrews, which is obviously on a military installation. It has a perimeter already built in, and that wasn't necessarily as much of a concern for Donald Trump. He has his own golf courses, and certainly he prefers to play at his own courses as president. Just as an example, his courts just outside here in Washington is right on the Potomac River. That presents another security challenge for the Secret Service. One of the holes on that course goes right up into the -- onto the river. And so I -- I don't think you can expect the Secret Service to tell Donald Trump that he can't play at his courses. But as we heard from the sheriff earlier today, the expectation would probably be that there will now be a lot more people around the perimeter, creating a perimeter, making it more secure going forward.",

DIRECTOR FOR THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION: Well, the big question, I think, is, and it's been discussed, how did he know to be there at that time, at that location? I mean, there's only three ways he would know. He's very lucky, and he -- he had a lucky guess, or he's been surveilling Donald Trump, or setting up a stationary surveillance or moving surveillance, or he has some information that he shouldn't have had, because apparently Trump this is a last minute decision to go play golf that day. So the third option is pretty disturbing, and I hope that's not the case. But, you know, that -- that would implicate a third person, if that were the case.",

If he knew when he went off that he was going off, he would have time to pre-position himself. So, you know there -- there are other possibilities, but I, you know, that -- this is -- this is -- there's a parallel investigation going on, obviously, on him in general. But I think there's a -- a -- a much or at least -- at least as robust investigation on who knew about his schedule or how that information could have gotten out.",

And -- and though he's older than we've seen more recently, in terms of -- of the sort of 20 something white males, he -- he knew how to do this. So to me, the GoPro is shows a level of sophistication, a level of planning and -- and that he not only wanted to document the assassination attempt because of those -- of the plates and -- and the defensive posture that he clearly was anticipating that they would either find him or he would be engaged by law enforcement that he -- he wanted that to be filmed as well. So for me, the thing that I am very curious about it, as -- as I've been saying is, given, for example, that his son has said, you know, this is coming out of nowhere. Now that's a son, and we take it for -- for, you know, the fact it is his father. I am very curious about where he was after the Butler, Pennsylvania assassination attempt, because in -- in this world of increased violence, of political violence, you worry very much about copycats. And if there is evidence, or if we learn about behavior that changes, he shows up in Florida, he's staking the place, then we have to be very worried about as we already are given the threat environment of the -- of the weeks ahead. And that's -- and that's the sobering aspect of this in so many ways.
