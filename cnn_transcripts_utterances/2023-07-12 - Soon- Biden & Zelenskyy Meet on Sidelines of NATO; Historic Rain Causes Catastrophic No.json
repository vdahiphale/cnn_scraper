They are meeting comes in the wake of Russian airstrikes on Kyiv for a second consecutive night. And Zelenskyy's frustration over NATO's decision to provide guidance, but not provide a specific timeline on when the alliance will be ready to bring Ukraine membership.

What the Ukrainian president is going to go home with.And they are very concrete measures that are being announced today. He is just come out of a bilateral meeting with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, thanking him on his Telegram channel for some of those extra launch pads for the Patriots systems, the missiles as well. All part of the 700 million euro package that Berlin announced yesterday. So, concrete military aid, that is going to be at the heart of the bilaterals that continue. He is now meeting with the British prime minister, and we expect him to meet with a number of key NATO leaders ahead of his meeting with President Biden. And beyond those actual bits of military equipment and aid packages that he is getting from several NATO allies, there is also what's being dubbed a NATO light package being announced by G7 leaders later on. That is going to be beyond the military aid itself, as crucial as it is for the counter offensive, Rahel, much more about the political, financial, economic support that can be given to Kyiv as Western allies try to help it to be integrated into their world -- Rahel.",

What they have announced and Jen Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, was very clear about this, that it was a substantial step. You understood it had it taken a lot of negotiation because there had been a lot of division between NATO allies, even on what has been offered, which is turning what was a two-step process for Ukrainian exception into the group into a single step process, the removal of the so-called map, the membership action plan for Ukraine.But it is, of course, the lack of a calendar that is so frustrating. Ukraine, even as it tries to pursue its counteroffensive, and that was likely to dominate as well in this bilateral meeting with President Biden later. You are also going to be hearing a lot more about the concrete support that the United States is giving, and specifically I think of those cluster munitions that have been so controversial to other NATO allies, dividing as they do the alliance. Remember, these are mutations that are banned by about 100 countries in the world, including several NATO allies. And yet, the United States is delivering them, it says, because it wants to help specifically with the counter offensive, helping Ukraine get past those Russian defenses. So crucial, something that Ukrainians welcomed as potentially a game- changer, Rahel.",

In an expert of Wray's opening statement, he seems eager to try to sidestep partisan concerns, which raised in part: I want to talk about the sheer breadth and impact of the work of the FBI's 38,000 employees are doing each and every day, because the works of men and women of the FBI do to protect the American people goes way beyond the one or two investigations that seem to capture all of the headlines.

Right now, the NATO meeting in Vilnius is dominating the headlines. Yet, this missile launch has prompted response from the sidelines of that NATO meeting from both the president of South Korea and the president of -- and the prime minister that is, of Japan. Here in Japan, we have been hearing from the chief cabinet secretary who actually said that he will make an overture to Beijing and protest as to what happened in North Korea. Again, North Korea wants to stay relevant. As far as the specifics of the launch, there are some things that are worth noting. First of all, this missile was in the air for 74 minutes. That is seen as a long period of time, and perhaps a suggestion that the North Korean military program is having some kind of advancement, having some kind of success. In addition, this is a missile that has the potential to cross the Pacific Ocean. In the case today, it was launched at a degree, at a trajectory, that ensured a shorter range flight. But it certainly illustrates the potential. We also have heard from Japanese official who expressed concern that now, North Korea indeed does have the potential to strike Japan, where I am now, with nuclear warheads. As far as how this is all being received, Rahel, I wouldn't say it's one of alarm, but as we have seen over time, it is awareness that North Korea is again trying to assert its power.",

And, basically, it did not have, it doesn't have automatic membership for Ukraine. Remember that President Biden told CNN as well that that is not something he felt Ukraine was ready for. What he -- what he and the administration would rather be preparing folks for is a pathway for Ukraine, an action plan that could be in there. However, there was no timetable yesterday. When we saw President Zelenskyy anticipating that language without the timetable and specifics, into a blistering statement criticizing NATO allies before his arrival. Now, this security package can assure Ukraine and, speaking to administration officials, they feel it will assure Ukraine. This is coming after the administration also delivered cluster munitions as well to help Ukrainians defend their civilians. That is the administration's argument. And the security package, we expect, will be even more assistance to continue to assist that Ukrainians in the short term, as well. We know that the Biden administration has released many different arms as well as funding packages, this will be the latest step in that effort.",

The administration has been saying that pathways should still be established for Ukraine. But one argument that we heard, even on the heels of the summit here yesterday, was that when you immediately admit Ukraine into NATO, remember that an attack against one NATO member basically is an attack against all. And throughout this entire process, throughout since Russia since invaded Ukraine, the president of the United States has had to have a balancing act here of providing assistance but committing to not sending troops on the ground. When you admit a member into Ukraine and attack against one is an attack against all, and one of the primary kind of concerns of the president here is not to bring the United States into a direct conflict, an escalation with Russia.
