Phil, thanks so much for that coverage.Let's bring the conversation back in the room with our great reporters, including two White House correspondents at the table. We just show you the illegal border crossings into Quebec. These numbers are nowhere near what you see at the southern border, but it has become a thorny issue for both governments. How do you deal with this? And to Phil's point, the President in the bilateral meeting was almost small talk, but saying how lucky he felt that our neighbor to the north is a democracy. And you have a problem, you have an issue, maybe some tension, but you sit down and you say, OK, what do we got to do? You know, this is a pretty quick resolution of something that -- if you look at the U.S.-Mexico border, is always a very thorny political issue.",

So there is a lot for them to discuss. But I think that the idea of two democracies, of, you know, the fact that Trudeau is a strong ally on G7 and NATO related issues makes this an easier meeting to have, certainly, than some others. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: This kind of deal and rule has been debated and talked about between these two countries for years now, going back multiple administrations. It has to do with something called the Safe Third Agreement, right? And it basically did allow Canada or the U.S. to turn migrants back, vice versa, back to the U.S. or vice versa. The difficulty here is that when you talk to advocates is whenever you sort of restrict crossings at a legal port of entry, or in this case, an unofficial port of entry, do migrants then take a riskier path which then may result in more illegal crossings? It's something that we've seen at the southern border in past administrations too. You tighten one door, vulnerable families seeking sanctuary might find another one as well. But that 15,000 window for refugees in Canada, the Biden administration and the Biden White House is breathing a sigh of relief for that because they're hoping that can then be a window not just we may think of this as the northern border, but also for those trying to cross at the southern border, which we know has emerged as a prime political vulnerability for the President.",

But, you know, even House Republicans are having an issue, John. They had to postpone markups of eight immigration bills next week. Their leadership telling them hold back just a little bit because there's not broad support in the Republican House conference to get these passed.

One of the potentials is Liz Cheney, who is a never Trumper, which means she probably would never get on a debate stage because she wouldn't sign a pledge, I don't think, to support Trump people the nominee. But she went after DeSantis, who in that in an earlier interview or a questionnaire returned to Tucker Carlson, referred to the Ukraine war as a territorial dispute. \"I would have a hard time supporting any candidate who was unclear about the importance of America's defense of Ukraine. Be hard for me to imagine supporting anybody who thought that it was a territorial dispute.\" One of the challenges for Liz Cheney is, though we still don't know, is she going to run or is she just going to comment on the race on the sidelines?",
