This is the statement coming from - from the IDF of what we're talking about. \"During IDF operations in the Gaza Strip, three terrorists were eliminated. The IDF and ISA are checking the possibility that one of the terrorists was Yahya Sinwar. At this stage the identity of the terrorists cannot be confirmed. In the building where the terrorists were eliminated,\" this goes on to say, \"there were no signs of the presence of hostages in the area. The forces that are operating in the area are continuing to operate with the required caution.\"One thing we know is just how American officials have talked about Yahya Sinwar, his role in - Jeremy, in the - in the hostage and ceasefire negotiations. And I was just looking back, I mean, Tony Blinken saying very clearly that Yahya Sinwar has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the ceasefire. And again, you're getting at what - this adds to one of the reasons why this could be so significant and just how Tony Blinken and multiple U.S. officials have put this at the feet of Yahya Sinwar for so long.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And beyond that, Kate, I mean, Sinwar is just an enormous presence in Gaza. He was feared in Gaza long before he even came Hamas' leader in 2017 because he was in charge of the unit that effectively went after people who they viewed as potential collaborators with the Israeli government. He's a very feared figure within the Gaza Strip. And that has been part of his power inside of Gaza.And beyond that he has, of course, been intimately involved in Hamas' military and its terrorist operations. And of course, he is one of the last senior leaders of Hamas who still remains alive. We saw that the Israeli military has taken out Mohammed Deif, the head of the al- Qassam brigades, Hamas' military wing. And that left Yahya Sinwar, of course, not only in charge of Hamas' political branch following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, but also very much in charge of Hamas' military operations as this war has stretched, now - is now entering its second year. And Sinwar, you know, beyond the fact that, of course, he is reviled by Israelis for his role in October 7th, for his role in multiple other attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, he has also increasingly taken - drawn anger from Palestinian civilians in Gaza as well. I have increasingly seen, in the scenes following bombings in Gaza, following the deaths of people in Gaza as a result of Israeli military strikes, people expressing anger not only with the Israeli military, the Israeli government, but also cursing Sinwar himself. And that reflects the fact that, of course, he has been hiding in tunnels, or at least that was the understanding, that was the belief over the course of the last year while enormous suffering was happening above ground. And of course, over the course of the last year, he has refused to surrender his weapons despite the fact that the Israeli military has clearly devastated not only Hamas but, of course, the Gaza Strip. And so his death will have enormous implications for Hamas' hold on power in Gaza, for its - the continuation of its military operations against the Israeli military in Gaza. And it could also, of course, have enormous implications for those ceasefire negotiations which you were also referencing. We know that Sinwar, in the past, has been one of the more hardline figures within Hamas. That's why there was so much concern following the death - the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, that perhaps now with Sinwar in charge they would take an even harder line. We know, of course, that the Israeli government itself has also been an obstacle to moving those ceasefire negotiations forward. So, Sinwar is certainly not the only player in these talks. But his death, if indeed it is confirmed, will send shockwaves throughout this region and it will have enormous implications for the hostages, for the civilians in Gaza and, of course, for the future of this war.",

Jeremy Diamond, if you are still with us, again, the significance - OK, we do not longer - we no longer have Jeremy with us. And then Cedric, if you are still with us then I'll put this to you, from just a military, strategic standpoint here, Israel has killed the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in the last several weeks.

And not only have they done - have they - if this is true, have they conducted decapitation strikes that go all the way up to the top of the Hamas organization, the Hezbollah organization, but they've also gone into the mid level. And in Gaza it was more of a kinetic action in most cases to go after them. I - in the case of Hezbollah, they went after them, of course, using the pagers and the walkie-talkies, in addition to the airstrikes.So, you've got this confluence of events that's happening, John. And what's going on with the Israelis is they are basically fulfilling a plan that they had developed over the years to go after all the different leadership elements in these terrorists groups. They know that decapitating these groups is one way to at least limit their effectiveness because they're, in many ways, top-down organizations with some degree of independence in their cells. But that independence in their cells means that they will lack coordination with - minus a senior leader like Yahya Sinwar. So, this is very significant if it turns out to be true. It will be another move in the Israeli direction to basically try to eliminate the threat as much as they can. And that is, in essence, what this plan was, to decapitate these various organizations and make them far less effective when it comes to attacking Israel.",

They are saying that they have killed three terrorists and they suspect one may be Sinwar.I want to bring in our Nada Bashir, who is joining us now. You've done extensive reporting on the Palestinians who are in Gaza, who have been dealing with this war that has just left a huge humanitarian crisis.

So, I think that it's a matter of hours and not many hours we'll have a confirmation whether it is Yahya Sinwar or not.But all the Israeli officials I speak to say that it is 99 percent that Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, the mastermind of the October 7th attacks, who was responsible for murder of 1,200 people on October 7th, among them, more than 43 Americans is dead.",

It was a routine patrol that encountered three armed men between the houses, exchanged fire and kill them. And only then they realized that this person, at least one of them, might be Yahya Sinwar.And what it shows you, that Sinwar was moving between hiding places in the last few months. That what he has been doing. And he was moving in a very small group with only two bodyguards. And this is how it happened. It was not some, you know, sophisticated operation. This is not bin Laden in (INAUDIBLE). This is a coincidence.

      "sentences": "Yes, well, in terms of the official statement from the IDF, what they are saying for now is that they have killed what they describe as three terrorists in the Gaza Strip. And they say that one of those may indeed be Yahya Sinwar. They say that they are, quote, \"checking the possibility\" of whether or not it was him, but they say that for now the identity of those three men cannot yet be confirmed.They are also saying, and this is very notable and very important, that there are, quote, \"no signs of the presence of hostages in the area.\" And also notably that this exchange of fire, this incident where this man who may be Yahya Sinwar was killed, that this happened in a building. And I just want to hone in on that for a moment because over the course of the last year, the working assumption has been that Yahya Sinwar has been underground, that he has been in the maze of tunnels beneath Gaza. Some of these tunnels going as far as 50, 60, 70 meters underground. And the notion that he would have been above ground here shows that he was moving hiding places, that he was above ground rather than inside of a tunnel. And in addition, the fact that there were no hostages present also potentially breaks another major assumption that we have had over the course of the last year, and that is that Sinwar was believed to be hiding underground with a group of hostages, potentially a dozen hostages or so, that he was effectively using as a human shield so that should the IDF find out his location and want to take him out, that they might think twice before dropping one of those massive 2,000 pound bombs in order to kill him. But in this case, the Israeli military is saying that this man, who they believe may be but don't yet have confirmation of whether this was Yahya Sinwar, was not surrounded with any hostages in the area. This would, of course, be an earth-shattering moment in this war that has lasted now for a year and ten days since that October 7th massacre of which Sinwar was indeed the mastermind and certainly was the man who ultimately gave the go ahead to carry out that attack that saw the killing of some 1,200 Israelis, the majority of whom were civilians. And of course, beyond that, he - his decision to launch that attack unleashed a war that has seen more than 41,000 Palestinians killed according to the Palestinian ministry of health, over the course of the last year. And while certainly those Palestinians were killed by Israeli bombs and bullets, there's no question that even inside of Gaza a share of people view him as also partially responsible for the death and destruction that has been wrought in Gaza since October 7th of last year.",
