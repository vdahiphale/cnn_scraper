And despite that speech coming just two days before the South Carolina primary, Trump actually spent little time attacking Nikki Haley and instead trained his fire on the rival that both he and his campaign are most concerned about. And that is Joe Biden. And I think his focus on the general election really underscores how the former president and his team view this primary. They see it as Donald Trump's to lose and that Nikki Haley is standing in the way of him being able to unite the full Republican Party behind him and become the presumptive Republican nominee.But look, he geared his message last night to the crowd before him. He was speaking to a group of religious broadcasters. And he argued that Democrats and Joe Biden are persecuting Christians across the country. He said that the greatest threat to the United States is not from foreign adversaries, but he said it comes from, quote, \"within.\" Now he also spent a lot of time during that speech talking about abortion, which is very notable because Donald Trump is really refrained from discussing abortion on the campaign trail. He's told many advisors and those close to him that he does not see the issue as a political winner. But I think given the room, given the Christian audience that he was speaking to, he felt comfortable in doing so. He touted his role in overturning Roe versus Wade and his stacking of the Supreme Court with three conservative Supreme Court justices. Take a listen to that message. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And I was able to bring this issue, for the first time in 54 years, back to the states where everybody agrees on both sides, everybody agrees that's where it should be, back in the states.

This is a political loser. We're talking about Matt Gaetz. We talked about how we talked about, we can't be the party that's against family formation. There's no question about it. And I think Donald Trump going on and even addressing abortion last night will be used against him. That's going to be replayed over and over again. But I think it was also notable that he didn't just talk about how Democrats looked down on Republicans. He acted like we're at war with -- on religion. He talked about how they shame us, but he also talked about how they're coming for our crosses. He was really, really aggressive in his language and made this an all-out war.

That's just - that's the problem. Those are the three problems that he's got to deal with, whether Nikki Haley voices them or not.So, I'm going to be listening for how effectively she voices those concerns, what she says about how far she intends to take it. Does she want to bring those concerns to the convention? Is she going to stop after Super Tuesday? Is she going to stop at all? Does she think that one of those could be -- one or some combination of those problems create a knockout blow, in which case she might step forward. She's always talking about these polls showing that she does better against Joe Biden than Donald Trump does.
