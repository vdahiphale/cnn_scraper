So we will see if others do the same, but he's waiting, clearly. It's not as if he's not around. He's waiting clearly, to see how it goes. And then potentially is one of those who could potentially have a conversation. I'm not suggesting that he is going to be a yes, necessarily. But the fact that he didn't vote at that time, gives you a sense of some of the really intense behind-the-scenes conversations that are happening, and now on the floor conversations, quiet conversations, that are happening as this vote goes.

And so that notion of a primary challenge could cause some fear. The reality is, though, think about that. If a primary challenge is successful from the right in some of these battleground districts, those districts are at risk falling to Democrats next November. And you have got such a slim majority, that it could hand the House majority to the Democrats.

This is now two weeks without a speaker of the United States House because the party that runs the House took out one of their own. And the fact that those people were willing to do that speaks volumes about the way that the Republican Party has been pulled towards them in recent years, because Jim Jordan, when he first got there, was called the legislative terrorists by John Boehner, because he was willing to go green very much not that far. And those people followed in the mold. The reality is, I don't think these nine, like, they are people to want to govern the country. And they need a speaker to govern the country. (CROSSTALK)",

And the answer is, this is the Republican Party data. This is the party that Donald Trump is the runaway front-runner in for president of the United States; 70 percent of the Republican voters are also election deniers and believe that there was something amiss in the last election. So he really reflects the base of the party. And that's point number one. Point number two is, the first principle for most legislators -- and I love Adam Kinzinger, because he was willing to do his duty, and he put it ahead of his own political well-being. That is unusual. There's a reason why that book \"Profiles in Courage\" was a slim volume, OK? That's not what politicians do. They first calculate what they need to do to remain practicing politicians and get reelected. And so the pressure campaign, while it may not succeed for Jordan, has been pretty effective; 55 people were against them going into the weekend, and you have got Moulton, a little more than a dozen now. Now, he may not get there. And as Kasie Hunt mentioned before, there are members -- there are members there who are institutionalists. There are members that are who really are moderates and care very much about the appearance of what's going on now and the reality that the House can't function. I wouldn't be surprised, if Jordan can't put this together in the next few ballots, that there's going to be a move to get the House open BY perhaps giving more authority to the speaker pro tem, because I think those people know it can't go on, and the Republicans can't seem to agree on anyone. McHenry is -- Patrick McHenry is broadly popular. It wouldn't shock me if that happened here.
