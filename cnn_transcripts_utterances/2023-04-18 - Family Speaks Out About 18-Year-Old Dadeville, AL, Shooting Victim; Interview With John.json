Andrew Lester is quoted by police as saying he shot Yarl after he rang the doorbell and then pulled on the door handle. He also said the two never exchanged any words. Yarl, who is now home from the hospital, told police he never pulled on the door before he was shot. And in Upstate New York, 20-year-old Kaylan Gillis was shot and killed after her friend accidentally turned their car into the wrong driveway. Officials say a man fired two shots at their vehicle from his front porch while they were leaving. 65-year-old Kevin Monahan faces second-degree murder charges. And the local sheriff told CNN he's shown no remorse over what happened. And the 12 jurors are now seated in the defamation trial against FOX News. Dominion Voting Systems are seeking $1.6 billion in damages from the network, accusing it of perpetuating false claims that its machines rigged the 2020 election against Donald Trump. FOX denies the accusations and calls the lawsuit a political crusade. Boris?",

His mother, LaTonya says that she was struck twice when shots rang out. And when the venue turned the lights on after the shooting, she saw her son on the floor soaked in blood. The high school senior died just minutes later. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LATONYA ALLEN, VICTIM'S MOTHER: It was a nightmare. A nightmare.

Now LEAH, the Alabama law enforcement agency that is leading the charge here, they say that there is no public safety concern. But they have not named a suspect. They have not named a motive. They will not answer any questions about if anyone is in custody. They are, however, asking for patience as they work to piece together this investigation. They're also asking for folks to send in pictures and videos, anything that might help investigators. We did get this statement real quick from officials. Special agents did not recover any high-profiled rifle ammunition at the scene. However they did recover numerous shell casings used in handguns. Agents right now they're completing interviews.
