      "sentences": "Beijing is hitting back at Washington`s statements about the suspected spy balloon. The Pentagon said on Tuesdaythat China refused a conversation with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin following the downing of the balloon. Well, now, China`s defense ministry is saying they rejected that call because the conditions were not right, given the U.S.`s, quote, irresponsible and seriously wrong approach. We`ve seen Beijing`s rhetoric hardened significantly after the U.S. military shot down the balloon, after initially expressing regret for what they claim is a weather balloon that flew off course. Beijing is now accusing the U.S. of overreacting and violating international practice. The contrast between what Beijing and Washington are claiming is only getting starker. You have China on one hand doubling down on its claim this was a civilian balloon that took an unplanned course that was out of their control. On the other hand, the Pentagon has said it has 100 percent certainty that the downed Chinese balloon was not being used for civilian purposes. CNN has reported that U.S. intelligence officials believe the balloon is part of an extensive military run surveillance program that involves a fleet of balloons spanning five continents. China`s ministry of foreign affairs said that claim is, quote, likely part of the U.S.`s information and public opinion warfare and accuse the U.S. of being the world`s largest surveillance reconnaissance country. The Pentagon has said that maintaining open lines of communication with China are particularly important in moments like this. The question still remains as to whether this balloon incident will lead to long-term damage to the relationship between the U.S. and China that is already extremely tense.

But this region is no stranger to earthquakes so why was this one so devastating. This is one of the strongest earthquakes to hit Turkey in about a century and it was followed by dozens of aftershocks, some almost as powerful as the initial quake. And then there`s the question of how shallow this earthquake was at the epicenter, just 18 kilometers deep, causing severe shaking on the ground. This is an earthquake more powerful than the one that hit Haiti in 2010, causing utter devastation. And this region is located on a major fault line. In the disaster zone, thousands of homes have collapsed. Now many of Turkey`s apartment blocks are built to modern design standards but still about 20 percent of its urban environment is not. And then when you take a look at Northwest Syria, well, that country has been battle scarred. There, many of the structures were extremely susceptible to collapse. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The answer is 57 and Super Bowl LVII kicks off this Sunday, marking the 57th edition of the big game. It`s estimated that two-thirds of the U.S. population watched last year`s Super Bowl. That`s more than 200 million people, and that`s why a 30-second commercial during this year`s game cost $7 million. So, yeah, all eyes will be on Glendale, Arizona, this Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles. Some watch the game for the commercials. Others watch for the halftime show, which this year will be headlined by none other than Rihanna. But no matter how you look at it, the Super Bowl is big business. In fact, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce said last Super Bowl they hosted here in 2015 generated about $720 million for the city, but they`re expecting close to one billion dollars for this one. And for the first time, the area is expecting more than a million visitors to the city at the same time, with so much action happening in one place, keeping the event fun and safe is a major concern for security experts.
