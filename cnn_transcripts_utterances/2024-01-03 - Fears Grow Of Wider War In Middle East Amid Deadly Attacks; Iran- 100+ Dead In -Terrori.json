In Iran, a suitcase bomb followed by a second blast at a top Iranian general's grave killed more than 100 people, according to Iranian state media. That general, Qasem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. airstrike ordered by former President Trump four years ago today. Soleimani, whom the Pentagon says was actively planning attacks on U.S. service members and diplomats at the time and had been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops in Iraq. We are also closely watching Iran-backed Hezbollah, a group the U.S. considers to be terrorists, as Hezbollah vows a, quote, limitless response in revenge for the assassination of the top Hamas leader in Beirut, much of which is under Hezbollah control. Although Israel has not acknowledged responsibility, a U.S. official confirms to CNN Israel did order the strike against Hamas's number two, as retaliation for the brutal October 7th attack. In the Red Sea, the Houthi-led Shia militias of Yemen, also backed by Iran, continued to fire missiles at commercial ships, after a U.S. helicopter sank three Houthi boats last week. In Gaza, meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are facing winter intense without basic essentials, including food, as far right extremists in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are publicly pushing the idea of forcing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to leave Gaza for good. We'll tell you more about that and the U.S. pushed back in the next hour. All of this as Hamas and other terrorists in Gaza continue to hold more than 100 hostages seized from Israel. Today, the IDF revealed one of the hostages was already reported dead by his kibbutz, killed in a botched rescue attempt last month. Sahar Baruch was 25 years old. He had been a member of kibbutz Be'eri. We're going to start with all this news, with the deadly blast in Iran. CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Israel.

And while Israel hasn't outwardly claimed responsibility nor denied responsibility, of course, a U.S. official has told CNN that the Biden administration understands Israel was indeed behind the strike, and that the Biden administration was not informed ahead of the strike. Now, of course, there is mounting concern around the potential for the significant development to see an escalation in the conflict more broadly in the region. We have, of course, seen those continued skirmishes on Lebanese southern border between Hezbollah and the Israeli military from the outset of this war. We have today heard from the Lebanese government, the Lebanese foreign minister saying that the Lebanese government more specifically does not want to see a war break out. They want peace on their southern border, and they are trying to convince Hezbollah not to wage war with Israel. Meanwhile, we've also heard from the U.S. State Department spokesperson Matt Miler saying earlier today that the U.S. is no more concerned around the potential for this war to escalate as it has been from the outset of this war and responding more specifically to Nasrallah's comments, saying the U.S. says it is not in Hezbollah's interest, nor is it in Israel's interest to see this war escalated more broadly in the region -- Jake.",

And these criminals and individuals have been coming in for years, Republican, Democratic administrations.Let's talk about HR2 because that's the House Republican bill that calls basically to resume some of the Trump era policies, including building the Trump era border wall. It would strongly increase restrictions on who could apply for asylum. Critics of that say it would essentially gut the asylum process. It certainly would restrict it. That deal is not going to get 60 votes in Senate. Whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing, I leave it to you. But it won't get 60 votes in the Senate. It won't get signed by a Democratic Senate -- Democratic president. Is there a compromise on border security that's being negotiated right now that you would allow to be voted on even if a majority of House Republicans are not behind it -- something that would improve situation -- the situation at the border even if not to the point that you want it to be improved?",

You can't, for example, just reform the asylum program and leave the broken parole process unrepaired. Then you would have a loophole that we do absolutely nothing. You canjust reinstate \"remain in Mexico\", even just that action would stem the flow estimated at about 70 percent. But you have to also end catch and release. All these things work together and so, you can't just pick and choose from them from a menu and expect that you're going to solve the problem. I'll quote to you one of the sheriffs of Terrell County down here, a border county who has to deal with this crisis every day. He had lunch with us today and he told us, he said he was -- before he became the sheriff, he worked for the U.S. Border Patrol for 26 years. He said he had worked through four administrations who were doing great work, but it took less than six months for the Biden administration, in his words, to unwind 100 years of progress that the U.S. Border Patrol had accomplished, six months. These are policy choices that got us in this situation and what we're demanding is that the policies change for the good of every single American citizen.",
