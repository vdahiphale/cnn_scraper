Ukrainian officials say a mandatory evacuation order is now in place. About 5,000 people, including dozens of children, remain there. CNN's Alex Marquardt has more from eastern Ukraine for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  In the fierce defense of Bakhmut the neighboring town of Chasiv Yar has become a busy thoroughfare. The main supply route for Ukrainian troops desperately hanging on to the eastern city. MARQUARDT (on camera):  Cars, military vehicles bombing up and down this road going to and from the front. You see this armored vehicle right here. The V sign for victory. We are so close to the front that, as one resident who is still here said, you could walk to the Russian positions. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  In the town center we meet an artillery unit. They've been fighting for two months. Loud booms echoing every few seconds from their Ukrainian colleagues firing on Russian positions.",

We need to wait for reinforcements to come and then kick them out.\" Whether Ukrainian reinforcements are indeed coming to save Bakhmut remains to be seen but so far, there is no Ukrainian retreat. Ukraine's military admits they're being battered by Wagner mercenaries that have made gains as they press ahead in and around the city. Ferocious street-to-street fighting has left many dead on both sides as the Wagner troops, along with Russian soldiers, try to encircle Bakhmut. Chasiv Yar has been regularly hit in recent days as well. Now, fresh trenches are being dug -- fighting positions that Ukraine may soon have to use. Amid all the blasts some pile into a van to evacuate while others who feel they can't or simply won't leave gather in the center waiting at a bus stop for a water delivery which never comes.",

In regulating corporate behavior, in my reading, the strategy gives a nod and a wink in the direction by stating that the administration supports future legislative efforts here to impose robust, clear limits on the ability to collect personal data and sensitive data, but also legislation to set national requirements to secure data with standards and guidance developed specifically by NIST.",

Total deposits fell about 2 1/2 percent at the end of last year to $19.2 trillion. Today's higher interest rates are making deposit accounts a lot less attractive since people can get better returns putting their money elsewhere.All right, looking at markets around the world, Asian markets finished higher. European markets also moving up after their opening. On Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour also leaning higher here. So a positive mood in equities around the world. Stocks closed higher yesterday. The Dow up 340 points -- the best day in almost a month. Markets rising after one top Fed official said it's likely interest rate hikes could stay at 25 basis points rather than something bigger, although that's just one Fed speaker's view. All three indices are on their way to a positive week. Banking giant Citigroup announcing it will cut hundreds of jobs across several divisions. And mortgage rates climbing for the fourth week in a row. An average 30-year fixed coming in at 6.65 percent. Also on inflation watch, gas prices rose two pennies overnight to $3.37 a gallon. All right, Tesla announcing plans to expand production and build a new plant in Mexico, but shares fell nearly six percent after Elon Musk failed to offer details on a new generation of products during this investor day on Wednesday.
