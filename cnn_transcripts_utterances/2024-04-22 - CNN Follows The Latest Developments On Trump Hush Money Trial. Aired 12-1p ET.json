This is CNN's special coverage of the Hush Money trial. A conspiracy and a cover-up. With those words, New York prosecutors began their opening statements in the Hush Money trial of Donald Trump. The prosecutors laid out a detailed timeline of what their case will be, saying they will use eyewitnesses, a paper trail, even an audio recording of Trump himself to prove that he interfered in the 2016 election and then lied about it in his business records. Trump's attorneys began their statements by saying the Manhattan D.A. should never have brought this case, and they stressed that the story being told by prosecutors is not as simple as it seems. The opening statements went on for a little more than an hour, wrapped up just minutes ago. Court is just getting back into session now, and the first witness is about to be called. Things are moving very quickly here. That first witness is expected to be David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer magazine. Prosecutors say that in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Pecker agreed to be Trump's, quote, eyes and ears to find scandalous stories about Trump and then pay people to kill those stories, to keep them quiet. As for the defendant, he is sticking to his guns, says all of this, as he is wont to say, is part of a political witch hunt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, Katelyn, first, to begin with, and I believe, well, this was just moments ago, Trump and his legal team re-entering the courthouse there. Katelyn, as I was listening to the accounts of the prosecutors' opening argument this morning, it struck me that the story they're laying out is less arcane than we might have imagined going in. The elements of the law here are complicated, as they often are, as the fraud allegations relate to federal election law. But the story they're telling is a far simpler one.",

There was an allegation. There was a suppression of the story that was the basis for the allegation. Then there was a misstatement of the repayment on the books and records. Very straightforward, blocking and tackling. Everyone can understand that. And there was motive. The president was motivated to do this in the aftermath of the Access Hollywood tape. And this was a pattern and practice based on Karen McDougal and other things. So, I think they made out a very nice, easily followed story. And I think that's what they need to do. They have to just keep coming back to it. It's almost like a rock and roll song. Verse, she loves you. Verse, she loves you. Verse, she loves you.

But when they decided to enter it on thebooks and records of the Trump organization and misrepresent those books and records to the state, that's a very different matter than a private transaction between two consenting adults, if you will. And that's why I think you heard Blanche, the attorney for Trump, say he's not guilty, but maybe he's just not probable cause convictable. So, he's sort of hedging his bets, trying to say he's innocent on the one hand, but maybe not. Maybe we can get a jury here on a hung jury.

      "sentences": "And as you said today with David Pecker, that's really what I think they're a little bit anxious about. And that'salso part of why you've seen Donald Trump so frustrated about the gag order. We saw him all weekend posting on Truth Social any interviews he did slamming the gag order that was placed on him. Because one of the key things in that is that he's not able to attack witnesses. Of course, I'd argue that the gag order is actually pretty lenient on Donald Trump. There's only a few areas that he's not able to speak about. He's largely able to attack the judge in this case, the Manhattan district attorney. But he has been very focused on him not being able to go after witnesses. He believes personally that it's unfair that his former fixer, Michael Cohen, can get up there and talk about him. He's not able to speak about him. And also, of course, they may hear from Stormy Daniels, as well. That's really why we've seen a lot of frustration with Donald Trump with that aspect of it. So, I think so far they've kind of anticipated what was laid out today with these opening statements. I think really what they're now looking ahead toward and trying to calculate is what will this testimony look like. And part of that as well, Jim, just to, you know, sum it up, is really -- this is going to be kind of embarrassing for Donald Trump. A lot of this is very personal to him. Even though Donald Trump's attorneys think that this case, out of the four criminal indictments that he is facing, is the weakest, it is also the most potentially embarrassing for him because of the salacious details expected to come out.",

You have a story that prosecutors are telling here, and that story is one that folks can understand, right? It's a bad story. Trump doesn't want to get it out, pay some money to kill that story. And by the way, prosecutors argue it's not the first time or only time he and his team did that. But on the law, can you explain to viewers who aren't lawyers what's the law that they say was broken here? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this was a tough case for the prosecution, for the district attorney to bring, Jim. From the beginning, this was one reason why it took so long for them to bring it. This is why the Justice Department investigated this. There were two looks at this, one during the Trump administration and then early in the Biden administration. And the federal government decided to bypass this and to not go forward with the prosecution. And so, part of what the story that is being built by the prosecution and now by their questioning of David Pecker on the stand right now in New York is that they falsified these records. There were 34 records that the prosecution says were falsified, which is illegal in New York. And what they're doing is, this is normally a misdemeanor. Something to falsify business records in the state of New York would normally be a misdemeanor. But what they've done is they've connected it to the election. They're saying that the story here is not just the falsification of business records, but that this was intended to affect the election, which New York is saying, the prosecution is saying, is what makes this a felony. And so, that is where they're going as they're going through the questions with David Pecker, going through the entire story of not only the Stormy Daniels payment, but also some of the pattern that had been established during the many years that Pecker and Donald Trump knew each other and worked with each other. And apparently, according to the story that the prosecution is laying out, having a sort of a symbiotic relationship whereby he would do favors for, where they would do favors for each other.",
