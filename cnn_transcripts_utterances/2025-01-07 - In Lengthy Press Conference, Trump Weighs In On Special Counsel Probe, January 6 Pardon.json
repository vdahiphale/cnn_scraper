Most of these big, great houses have been knocked down in Palm Beach. Just about all of them, actually. And they, you know, you build ten mansions on one site, but we saved it.

This is ten times worse. When I got elected because of the border the first time, and I think I got elected largely because of the border the third time, and the second time I did equally well. Well, not as well as the last time, but I did very well. And I will say this was too big to rig, you know, you know the expression? Too big to rig. They couldn't do it. They tried, but they couldn't do it. I didn't get very much from Congress at all. I just said that we're being invaded, and I took the money out of the military. Much of the wall I built 500 -- over 500 miles of wall. Much of that wall was built through money that had put into the military. We took it out because we couldn't get things from Congress in those days, and we took it out, and that wall was built largely with money coming from the military. So, very simple. I went to the military -- I said, our country is being invaded by very similar. Nothing like what's invading our country now. They weren't releasing prisoners into our country and they weren't releasing mental institutions in. But some -- some bad dudes were coming in, right? And I said, our country is being invaded. And I took that money largely from the military. I was sued nine times by the Democrats in Congress, and I won all those suits and we built five -- we ended up building 571 miles of wall. Once that wall was built, they start going around it. So we're going to add another 200 that would have been up in three weeks. And then we had a very unfortunate election result.

But great respect is being shown to our country again, and we have a great country, but we have to run it properly. It's going to be run properly. We want to get back those hostages for Israel and for us. You know, we do have people that are hostages being held.

I should note in this press conference, when a reporter later asked, why are you bringing this up?Obviously, it's a signature achievement of Jimmy Carter. He's about to be lying in state here in Washington, Trump said he was asked about it, but Trump brought it up in his opening remarks. It's something that he's been quite fixated on behind the scenes, from what I've heard from -- from sources in the past few weeks on this issue, complaining about Chinese influence. Obviously, this was a signature achievement of Jimmy Carter's. He believed it improved relations with Latin America for the United States, and still, it's one of his biggest accomplishments that people talk about. But Trump there saying that he would not rule out using military force to retake it, is not something that should be treated as with bluster. I mean, Trump is coming into this White House and is intentionally staffing his administration with aides who will not block what he wants to do or what he ultimately seeks. There were many instances in his first term where he wanted to do something, but advisers either convinced him not to or Republican lawmakers did. That is not going to be the same Washington that we are encountering in 13 days from now when Trump takes office. So I would treat everything he said there quite seriously. I mean, moments after he said he wanted to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, Marjorie Taylor Greene is saying that she's going to advocate for that. But I do want to say one of the biggest things that stood out to me from that press conference, from moments when Trump got out there before he even started taking questions, is the level of anger.",

There's a reason it was announced on Fox News today. Trump was watching it as it came out and had an idea that this was coming. And so, certainly, I mean, we're seeing a lot of big tech companies and big tech founders making the trip down to Mar-a-Lago. Now, Facebook and Meta are part of that. And so we're seeing all of that part of this. That is also what I'm saying about how we should be taking what Trump is saying seriously, in the sense of he is coming into an area where big tech and big business are trying to appease him and listening to him, and certainly trying to make sure that Elon Musk isn't the only person who has major contracts that he's able to secure with the federal government. But what he's saying about Greenland there and saying not ruling out military force to David Sanger is notable. But then he said that he believes the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. This has been something he has been thinking for eight years. It was brought up by \"The Wall Street Journal\" when they first reported it during his first term. But he also threatened economic coercion against Denmark, saying that he could level tariffs against them if they do not refuse to -- to provide it or sell it to the United States. That is certainly going to be an avenue. I mean, Trump's national security aides, secretary of state, incoming, potentially, Marco Rubio, the national security advisor, Michael Waltz, those are all comments that Trump is going to be committing to and keeping up with when he takes office.",

It is an out and out lie.Now, we'll never get a complete inventory of the number of guns brought by people to the Capitol that day, because most of them were permitted to leave before later being arrested. But there have been numerous cases in which people carried guns on Capitol grounds and were convicted for it. I have a list in front of me. Mark Mazza, two loaded handguns on Capitol grounds, five years in prison. Guy Reffitt, more than seven years in prison carried a handgun on Capitol grounds. Christopher Alberts had a pistol during the riot. Seven years in prison. Jerod Bargar pleaded guilty, had a pistol there. John Banuelos charged for allegedly twice firing a pistol in the air on Capitol grounds. Roger Preacher, pistol in his waistband. Mario Morris of Texas convicted of having a pistol in his waistband at the Capitol. So, the not one gun thing is out and out false. Now, on the Ashli Babbitt case -- look, it's subjective of whether she should have been shot. I can't fact check that, but the president- elect is certainly leaving out some pertinent facts here, specifically that Ms. Babbitt was a rioter who was trying to enter a shattered window of the House speaker's lobby had been warned not to do so, was carrying a knife.

We'll wait to see, because obviously the Justice Department is going to respond to this, I would presume basically this report from our understanding, and we learned a lot from a filing that came out last night. Trump's attorneys and the attorneys of his allies/co-defendants in Florida reviewed this over the weekend. They got to go to the DOJ, go into a conference room and actually look at this report.The understanding is, as they laid it out in this filing, is that it's two parts. On the election interference case and the classified documents case. They were arguing, in part, that the classified documents case shouldn't come out because of the Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira. They still have charges pending against them. But Trump's attorneys signed on saying none of this should be able to come out because Jack Smith's not supposed to be special counsel, which is Judge Cannon's findings as well, which is why the classified documents case is no more. Trump found out during that that she says right now, temporarily, this report cannot be released. They can't. The Jack Smith can't even transmit it to the Justice Department, is what she's arguing. We'll see if that holds. Obviously, there will be appeals. We're told it could come out really any day now, potentially by the end of this week. But they are fighting very hard. And he is very angry that even part of this could come out. What I've heard from people over the last few weeks is that a lot of this has to do with the Mueller report coming out and how Trump felt about that, because it went into details about his aides and whatnot. So we'll see if it ultimately comes out. But I mean, he came out and I think so much of what we heard was there was this underlying level of anger about this and the sentencing in New York.",
