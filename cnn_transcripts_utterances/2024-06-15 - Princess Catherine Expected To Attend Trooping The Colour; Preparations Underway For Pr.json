And it happens every year to mark the king's official birthday, the second birthday really for the monarch. It's always celebrated on the second June of the year, on the weekend, simply because monarchs aren't always born at the right time of year for the U.K. weather. So ideally, in June, it is sunny. I expect we're going to get a downpour pretty soon, though, Anna. But all eyes on the Princess of Wales and what she'll be wearing and how she will be looking.

But only a part return to work at this stage. So we're told that she'll start to appear at some engagements in the future. But will take it as a case-by-case basis on the advice of her medical team. But today is a really joyful occasion and actually have to say, Trooping the Colour, also known as the king's birthday parade, is one of the best events in the royal calendar, because you've got all the pomp and pageantry. But you also have all the family united for that amazing balcony scene at the end, when you have them all waving.

And I think that really is unprecedented. Normally, we don't know anything about royals' health. For example, the queen's father, we didn't know he was very ill until he did pass away. And we weren't given much insight into the queen or the Duke of Edinburgh. But this is a new openness. I think we're seeing a new royal family with this openness, with speaking directly to the public. And I think that's most of all because, as Kate was saying, she understands how many other people are going through what she's going through. And both she and the king want to be a beacon.

If Putin had thought that the delays in the European Union, the delays in the United States early this year, putting together big financial bundles for -- to support Ukraine, the war going forward, it would be a mistake for Putin to interpret that, that he had all the time he wanted in the war.

Putin, a couple of days ago, said that Ukraine can have peace if it gives up on the four provinces that Russia has illegally annexed, seized and annexed. And if Ukraine gives up on its aspirations to join NATO, which is clearly a nonstarter. And we heard that from U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin speaking about that just yesterday, at the NATO summit in Brussels. But the idea is to find a coalescence of views.

The man had entered the U.S. through the southern border and requested asylum, raising no red flags when initially vetted by immigration officials, but it was the later discovery of their potential ties to an ISIS affiliate that set off a flurry of urgent investigative efforts by FBI agents and analysts coast-to-coast. No specific attack planning was detected, sources said, but senior U.S. officials decided late last week to arrest the men and begin proceedings to expel them from the country, rather than continuing surveilling them to determine any possible plot. The FBI investigation continues, sources say, along with a renewed focus on threats from central Asia.",

O'LEARY: The scope of the problem is really massive. The problem since September 11 continued to metastasize. The enemy has not stopped. They're committed to causing violence and harm to us. We have to be committed to protecting this country. Now security experts say that groups like ISIS-K are focused less on training operatives abroad to send to the United States but more on online radicalization, trying to find the so-called lone wolf. Of course, that kind of threat is much more difficult for law enforcement here to identify if you have a group of people communicating with each other that can result in possible detection. Much more difficult if you have one lone individual who might not telegraph to anyone what they're potentially about to do -- Josh Campbell, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
