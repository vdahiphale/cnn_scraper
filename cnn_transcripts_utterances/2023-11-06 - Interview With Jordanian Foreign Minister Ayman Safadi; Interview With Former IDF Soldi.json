I get the view from Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, after crucial meetings with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Then, under the radar, Nada Bashir reports on extreme settler violence in the occupied West Bank. Also, ahead, a former IDF soldier brings us his eyewitness account about how the last Gaza invasion changed him forever. Plus, two professors talk to Michel Martin about how American college campuses have been a flashpoint and how they are trying to bridge the divide. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israel comes under mounting pressure to pause as the death toll in Gaza passes 10,000, nearly half of them children, according to the Hamas run health officials there. But not even Israel's staunchest ally seems able to convince them to stop of that humanitarian track. President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu by phone today, this after the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spent the weekend crisscrossing the region for urgent talks in Tel Aviv, Jordan, the West Bank and Iraq. He concluded today in Turkey. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We know the deep concern here for the terrible toll that Gaza is taking on Palestinians on men, women and children in Gaza, innocent civilians, a concern that we share and that we're working on every single day. We've engaged the Israelis on steps that they can take to minimize civilian casualties. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this is the message in which we're working.

Hamas is fighters, but Hamas is also an idea that was born in the conditions of misery that the occupation and the failure by the whole International Community to solve this crisis have put us on. So, the only path to guaranteeing the security of all, which we want, which we've worked for decades for is to find a just peace that will fulfill the legitimate rights of Palestinians and address the legitimate concerns of Israel. This war is not doing that. It's killing innocent. It's killing women, children. You've seen the images, and those images are in every sitting room of millions of people, not just in the Arab world, across the whole International Community.

Do you think that there is a deliberate plan, as many people do believe, that the settlers who are in charge, essentially, of the government, are wanting to, under this cover, you know, create their own ideological end to have the West Bank for themselves?

So, it's a message that this has got to stop. What we said is that whatever we believe will help end this madness, whatever we believe will help because of peace to which we've dedicated years and effort -- of efforts we will do. So, everything is on the table. And as far as we believe it will help us in our efforts to end this war and to push towards a comprehensive just peace that will once and for all make sure that we never are in conditions where Palestinian civilians or Israeli civilians will have to live the inferno that we see unfolding before our eyes. And I just want to say to all our partners, all our friends in the International Community, their message has been consistent that Israel should act within the realm of international law. Well, it is not. And obviously, it's not listening to advice of its friends, and it's not listening to the genuine calls that are coming from people across the world to say what they're doing is simply war crimes. So where do we go from here? I think it is within Israel's view to decide where we go from here. Continue with this war and we will pay the price for generations to come. Stop this war. Let's all bite the wounds. Let's all say enough -- that enough killing and really come together and see what -- how -- what is the path that will make sure that none of us have to go through this again. That path is peace.

I have to say, the Jewish studies and Middle Eastern studies have had a long and very fruitful collaboration on campus. So, we have relationships. We coach each courses. I'm co-teaching the course with Professor Jonathan Smolin from Middle Eastern studies this term on the 1967 Arab Israeli war. And so, he spoke. And then, we have another course on Israel Palestine taught -- co-taught by Bernard Avishai and Ezzedine Fishere from government. So, we offered this as a panel to demonstrate to the college, students and faculty, how we come together in this moment. We model for them what it is to be a scholar, what it is to be an academic and an academic institution to discuss the issues thoughtfully, not to look for condemnations or to speak about emotions, but to think in context, what can we as scholars contribute to the analysis of this moment and also demonstrate how we should think in this moment.

And also, as Professor Heschel mentioned, we have students from different, you know, backgrounds and different political, you know, views positions that are in our classes, and they come to our classes because they feel like we are able to maintain a conversation where their views are respected. And also, we're not imposing any of our views on them. And we try to encourage them to form their own perspective when they look at how Jews and Arabs work together throughout the 19th century in the Middle East and other parts of the world, how they defended each other's causes. I mean, it's a history of common struggle as well, sometimes in relation to, you know, European colonialism or various forms of biases. So, we also, in our work, try to present different kind of history of living together that -- and students come to this from -- you know, Jewish students, Palestinian students, and they know each other and they come with us on our study abroad. There is a connection between them. So, when these things happen, they are still talking. And this is important. I asked the students, are you still -- you know, how so and so? You know, I'm asking the Jewish student about how Palestinian student is doing, you know, and vice versa. And I think it's important that we play that role, that we play, you know, engage intellectually, explain the complexity of histories and conflicts, but at the same time, to maintain a community of care. We are here to support them. We are here to listen to them. And we want them to support each other as well.",

They feel that they can't express their, you know, legitimate, you know, fear, anger, concern. I mean, on the one hand, you have the Jewish students who are deeply afraid and legitimately so. And then, you also have Arab and Palestinian and Muslim students who are deeply afraid for different reasons. And I can imagine where they might look to you to be a spokesman for them. And I'm just interested in your take on all this. EL-ARISS: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I engage them and we create forums for them, also to go to the students in their own comfortable safe spaces so that people can come and talk to them and ask them and see how not only what they think, but also how they feel. So, we're very, very -- you know, very much doing this. But I think also there is a frustration. It's understandable that there is frustration that the political resolution of this conflict has not happened. The emphasis has been on like security measures and containment and management rather than a real political solution. And I think it's important for us also as academics, we understand the frustration that the political solution through talks, you know, historically has fumbled, but also we need to -- what else do we have, I mean, for us, other than conversation, other than engagement, other than engaging the other and trying to show the other side your perspective, and do it in a way that brings them in rather than alienate them at the outset?",

You wrote, you know, that some of your soldiers were feeling doubts at that time, then you wrote your own thoughts on a piece of paper, and you wrote this, I wrote that some members of my team had been tallying the number of soldiers killed and discussing whether this operation was worth the losses. I think it could be worth it, I wrote, as long as we decisively eliminate the threat. That's the lie they told us, and the lie that's being repeated today, that we can decisively eliminate the threat of Hamas through a military operation.

And he said this openly. He said, the only way to decisively defeat the terrorism that Hamas represents is through creating an alternative and creating hope. And that means working towards a political solution. And our current government has been fundamentally committed to opposing a political solution and to preventing the creation of a Palestinian State and preventing Palestinian independence.
