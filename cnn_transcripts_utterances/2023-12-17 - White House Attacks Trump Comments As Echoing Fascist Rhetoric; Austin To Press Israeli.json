      "sentences": "That's right, Fred.And the invoking of Adolf Hitler was the Biden campaign saying that the rhetoric from the president is very similar to other authoritarian regimes, but the White House also slamming the former president for his comments on immigration yesterday. And in a statement this morning, a White House spokesperson saying, \"Echoing the grotesque rhetoric of fascist and violent White supremacist and threatening to oppress those who disagree with the government are dangerous attacks on the dignity and rights of all Americans on our democracy and on public safety. It is the opposite of everything we stand for as Americans.\" That has been the resounding message from the White House and from the Biden campaign. And in marking the stark contrast between President Biden and his predecessor, former President Donald Trump on the issue of immigration, of course, this is all very delicate as border security and immigration have been liabilities for President Biden going into the 2024 presidential election, but in opportunities like this one, the White House making clear that what the president -- that what the former president is saying here is dangerous. And the president, Biden had actually recently this month put out a statement through his campaign, through his re-election campaign on a travel ban proposal. This is something that former President Donald Trump did in the first days of his administration. It's something that he's proposed doing, again, that being -- reinstating and expanding a travel ban on people from predominantly Muslim countries, and the president took the opportunity then to issue, for the first time, a statement through his re-election campaign, calling it \"cruel.\" So clearly, this is something that's top of mind for President Biden, and for that campaign in condemning his predecessor on his proposals when it comes to immigration.",

The IDF says it is large enough to drive a vehicle through and also has electricity and communications. Officials say the tunnel ends less than a quarter of a mile from the border with Israel, and that discovery comes as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is planning to meet with Israeli officials tomorrow in Israel. The White House is looking for Israel to define milestones for its war against Hamas as civilian casualties continue to mount. And today, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron and his German counterpart called for peace writing in \"The Sunday Times,\" quoting now, \"We must do all we can to pave the way to a sustainable ceasefire, leading to a sustainable peace. The sooner it comes, the better -- the need is urgent.\" -- from that article. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv for us, so Jeremy, what more are you learning about Secretary Austin's trip?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, there is no question that Secretary Austin's trip comes at a critical moment in Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and also at a critical juncture in the US efforts to pressure Israel, to ramp down the current intense phase of fighting to something less intense and less deadly for civilians in Gaza.The Secretary of Defense is expected to be joined by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General C.Q. Brown in a sign of the seriousness of this visit, and during their meetings with Israel's defense establishment, the Secretary of Defense will be pressing the Israeli War Cabinet for specific updates on their progress in their war against Hamas, how far they think they have to go still to destroy Hamas' military infrastructure, and also specific milestones that they are looking at before they can transition to the next phase of the fighting. And what the Secretary of Defense is really going to be pressing for is exactly when they can start to transition to that next phase. US officials have been envisioning a transition to a less intense phase of fighting that's going to be focused much more on special operations, raids, intelligence driven, much less bombing campaigns than what we have seen currently in Gaza, and we saw that last week as the National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan was meeting with his counterparts also making this very same point. All of this, of course, is against the backdrop of mounting civilian casualties in Gaza and growing international pressure not only from the United States, of course, but from other countries who are either calling for Israel to conduct more targeted operations, or calling for a ceasefire altogether. The US certainly does not fall in the latter camp, but these are very serious, very intense conversations, and it is very clear, as we saw last week from President Biden's comments that there is a lot of daylight between the US and Israel in how they see the next phases of this war, and this visit will be crucial to trying to bridge that gap.",

The Israelis say that over time, they want to go do this. And quietly, they are saying they think this phase of the operation only lasts two or three more weeks, but they will not say that in public. You heard Jake Sullivan, when he was in Israel, talk about the different phases of these operations, and made it sound as if there wasn't a huge rift, but we know that behind the scenes, there is great concern, and that is only accentuated now by the fact that the British and French Foreign Ministers have published an open letter that has basically said we need to get to a ceasefire. That's not a position the US takes, so we are now seeing a gap between the US and its two biggest and most important European allies.",

Because isn't it difficult to even see value in precision strikes now, especially after reporting of the dumb bombs -- you know so much, I mean, the disparity of casualties.So the US, in other words, David, seems to be in a really difficult position here.",

What is the proportion?How does Israel justify the proportionality argument if it can't say, we've gotten these people? And the challenge for the United States is the day after as David and Jake Sullivan and others are talking, so what happens after? Is Netanyahu -- and you're starting to hear this talked about out loud -- is he the prime minister able to do that for 20 years? I think that's the challenge. The challenge of the United States is that we're stuck with Netanyahu. Netanyahu, in my lifetime has never budged. I mean, I don't -- so you don't see them. I think that's the challenge. I think that's why you see this sort of contradictory approach by the Biden administration is, is that gap between a strategy that's not working and is causing lots of harm and Israeli leadership that is not likely to look for a long-term solution for the Palestinians.",

Cardinal Becciu was center of a disastrous Vatican property deal in London's Chelsea neighborhood that lost the church millions of dollars. The Cardinal also was found to have misappropriated funds when he sent hundreds of thousands of euros to a self-described property consultant, Cecilia Marogna, who claimed she could free a kidnapped nun in Africa. But instead, according to Vatican prosecutors, she used the money on personal expenditure, including on high-end fashion brands. The Cardinal was also found to have sent funds wrongly to his brother who ran a charity in Sardinia. Now, Cardinal Becciu has always maintained his innocence and is going to appeal the verdict. He was one of 10 defendants to stand trial, a trial which lasted two-and-a-half years in the Vatican. All the defendants pleaded not guilty. Now this trial is seen as part of Pope Francis' long running attempts to bring transparency and accountability to the Vatican's notoriously murky finances. This trial was a vital step in that process. It shows that the Pope has made significant steps and made significant progress, but given Cardinal Becciu's highly influential and important role in the Vatican, it does show there is still much more to do.
