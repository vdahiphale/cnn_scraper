Candidly, probably, if he's successful and if that survives the inevitable legal challenges, this would permanently reshape how we address border security at -- you know, at -- immediately at the border and asylum claims. But very quickly, as you and I've discussed before, the central bottleneck, and really the crux of this crisis is our inability to handle all of these claims and give people the hearing that they're entitled to under current law.What the administration is looking at doing is saying, how do we bypass that requirement? If we give a hearing, the net result would be -- it would eliminate that bottleneck. At the same time, though, you know, individuals who probably -- some individuals who have a valid asylum claim who are fleeing persecution would be unable to present that claim in the United States.",

When an individual gets into the United States, such two feet there, we have -- we've not had a problem apprehending those individuals. Vetting them.The problem is they make an asylum claim. And by law -- by existing law, we cannot deport them from the United States until an immigration judge has determined that they do not present a valid claim. So, what the administration is trying to do is eliminate that requirement. That's what the Senate bill would have done. That's what -- if something like this is enacted, that's what this executive action would do. Basically, said that individuals who crossed between the ports and unlawfully entered the United States are no longer eligible to present a claim. Now, look.

Know, in December alone, we had 300,000 individuals apprehended at the border. So, we're in a completely different environment.Look. At the end of the day, this is a political football. And from someone who was focused more on the operation and policy side, that politics has always undermined the effectiveness, and really does a disservice to the men and women at the border patrol in a dice who have very difficult jobs but can't get the tools they need because of the political paralysis, right, that happens in Congress. You said it at the outset, even if the administration is able to implement this change, there are still massive resource constraints. Just last week, a leaked out that ICE was looking at cutting thousands of you know potentially -- you know, from individuals free from detention. They're looking at pulling resources from other critical national security and public safety operations you know by the department. Put it to shift them over to border security. This is not going to solve our problems. Congress does need to act. But again, the politicization of border security and immigration has just kind of always undermined our ability to have effective border security.",

      "sentences": "Well, the arguments continue. Both sides are presenting their arguments. And, John, the school district, of course, is arguing that their policy is in compliance with a CROWN Act, the law here in the state of Texas that prohibits discrimination on the basis of hairstyle. And so, the George's attorney is arguing, of course, that the policy is not in compliance with the CROWN Act.But let me get you up to speed about what all of this is about and why these two parties are in the courthouse that you see behind me because this legal battle started months ago between Barbers Hill Independent School District and Darryl George. Now, George is the 18-year-old that has a locs hairstyle, and he has been suspended for months because of his locs hairstyle. Now, here's what the school policy says. It's strict, but it does allow for a locs hairstyle, but it restricts the length of the hairstyle for boys. It specifically states, \"boy's hair will not extend below the eyebrows, below the ear lobes, or below the top of a T-shirt collar.\" Now, last September, the school district went to the court and asked the court to make a judgment. Ask the judge to rule on if their policy was in compliance with the CROWN Act. Again, this is the law that protects hair -- hairstyles here in the state of Texas. It doesn't allow schools to discriminate based on the hairstyle that student is wearing. Now, George, as you heard him moments ago saying that this is much more -- that his hair is much more than just the length or just the style. He was talking about his roots and his ancestry. That's why he wears his hair the way he does. Now, the school superintendent took up a full ad in the Houston Chronicle. And that says in part \"The problem with relaxing standards without any regard to academic implication is the precedent it creates. Our military academies at West Point, Annapolis, and Colorado Springs maintain a rigorous expectation of dress. They realize being an American requires conformity with the positive benefit of unity and being a part of something bigger than yourself.\" And, John, it was that phrase, being an American requires conformity, that has triggered a lot of people in this country and a lot of support for this case, John.",

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of CNN's \"CHASING LIFE\" podcast. GUPTA (voiceover): These days, it feels like multitasking is a mandatory way of modern life. We're in the middle of one thing and then, ding, a text and you pivot to another thing. But here's the truth. We're not as good at multitasking as we think we are. In fact, multitasking is actually a misnomer. Most brains aren't actually structured to simultaneously do two things that require active attention at once. So, when you multitask, your brain is actually switching focus back and forth between each task. And studies show that often leads to mistakes. Completely focusing on a single task at a time can improve performance, improve memory, all while also reducing feelings of stress and anxiety, and impulsiveness.",
