The commander in chief just spoke with CNN's Erin Burnett in a crucial battleground state of Wisconsin. You might remember the Badger State serving as a key part of the blue wall that collapsed in 2016, sending Donald Trump to the White House and was rebuilt by Democrats in 2020, sending Joe Biden there. Today, the president is back in Wisconsin for the fourth time this year, trying to pitch his economic policies while also taking direct aim at the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Biden standing in Racine County this afternoon to announce a $3.3 billion investment from Microsoft to build a new artificial intelligence facility. The location, interestingly, is the exact same site where in 2018, then President Trump broke ground on Foxconn, which was supposed to be a significant project, an electronics factory that sadly largely failed to materialize. But despite President Biden's optimism on the economy, polls consistently show Americans disapprove of his handling of it. And that is where CNN's Erin Burnett began. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he said in the middle of that, the polls are wrong. Trust me from my travels, we have a vote, a group in Milwaukee just north of where the president was today. And when we visited, then there used to be a lot of factories in their neighborhood. Those factories are gone. They're -- they're dealing with COVID. They're dealing with inflation. They talk a lot about the cost of living in the cost of groceries. Just last week, I was in Michigan talking to auto workers, auto workers who are prepared to vote for President Biden. They believe he's the most pro-union president. But even they, they've seen beleaguered when they talk about the cost of groceries and how hard it is, and they can't move out of their house because they want to upgrade, but they can't afford a newer house, a bigger house right now because of mortgage rates. So the statistics back up the president's argument that economy is much better and is growing and is strong, the strongest in the world. He is correct.

He needs to continue to bring gas prices down, the summer months are going to be very telling for that, but gas prices need to come down. But the other thing is he needs to continue to draw the contrast with President Trump. Today's event was a perfect example of that. This is -- President Trump was there six years ago, and the company pulled out and let the community just imperil at large. And then here comes President O -- or President Biden, excuse me, to bring -- to invest in this community, to bring in more jobs. So continuing to draw that contrast is also helpful for him.",

That's the perception voters have that they don't understand us. Meghan just made I think a fascinating point in an area where the president can make inroads, making the point that Trump talks. I do. Trump talked about infrastructure week ad nauseam, Biden did pass a historic bipartisan infrastructure law that will create jobs and it will create roads and bridges. Today's announcement in a place where Trump promised, didn't deliver. Biden says he's promising those auto workers I talked to, they remember President Trump promising to keep an Ohio plant open. He didn't follow through and Biden did help keep Illinois plant open. So there are opportunities there in the contrast with Trump, the problem for the president is, you know, people don't see it.

The question is, can he turn around perceptions? And it looked at the Democratic coalition is a lot more complicated than the Republican coalition. And right now, to Meghan's point, take their names out of it. Right now, voters are looking at the state of their life and they want change. They want something different. Biden's challenge is to make the contrast with Trump to say, you don't want that. You may want change, you might be mad at me about some things, but you don't want that. He hasn't made that argument yet in part because we have six months.

Now, you've mentioned several officials have been privately talking about their frustration at this on public platforms, they are being a little bit more diplomatic about it, although we did here from Israel's ambassador to the U.N. He was speaking to Israeli media. He called the decision deeply frustrating, although he also acknowledged the political realities that President Biden is facing. The real question becomes, does Israel heed the warning? There have been many instances where the Biden administration has really tried to pressure Israel, has warned Israel, and Israel has gone about doing things in the way that they see as being the best solution for them. So it remains to be seen whether they will heed the warning, but we have seen, Jake, over the past few months, the impact that these 2,000 bombs have the number of civilian casualties, entire city blocks flattened, households destroyed. And so, the Biden administration really making it very clear that they do not want to be a part of that if it goes ahead in Rafah, which is something that they have described as a red line and have been warning Israel against for months.",

And that's really two more days from now without getting fuel. Now there had been some pieces of trucks getting in from Erez in the north, but again, the capacity and the amount that is needed, keep in mind 500 trucks day hey, on average, before October 7th, so obviously we are now in a drastically different reality, hundreds of thousands of people in an absolutely desperate and critical situation.

It -- there are lots of teachers who are teaching very one-sided views of the conflict, and in the course of teaching a very passionate, partisan view of the conflict, they end up reducing things to Jews being the bad guys in the story. And when kids hear that process through their adolescent or pre-adolescent brains that Jews are the bad people, it ends up resulting in bullying.
