It's her first time in the parade. Mickey Mouse has been on the parade route for forever. But it's about, gosh darn, time that Minnie Mouse is part of it. Now I'm here with my dear friend, Marshall, the fire dog from Paw Patrol, and Nickelodeon. And the bottom line is this. We've got 17 giant balloons, 22 floats. We have a whole slew of other balloons.

I will be out there with my anemometer. I'll be taking the wind speeds. I'll be taking the temperatures. I'm going to go back to my weather camp days, back when I was a teenager. And even if it's raining, which is what we expect, the good news is it's probably not going to be that windy.
