Scott's team conceding his upbeat optimistic campaign had failed to gain traction in a not-so-optimistic race. In the meantime, Democratic candidate Dean Phillips, who is challenging President Biden, says he's ramping up that longshot bid. Phillips told me on Saturday that he is willing to invest as much of his multimillion-dollar personal fortune as it takes, although he claims he doesn't think he will have to. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You heard him there say he's potentially going to invest as much as it takes. He's a multi -- has tens of millions of dollars. Now, he also talked to me about super PAC money because there's talk that super PACs supporting him might air ads in places like Michigan, which is also a critical swing state.

This seems a little risky for the White House.What are your thoughts? CATHERINE LUCEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, certainly, yeah, he's a -- he's not going away. And I think one of the key things that you're seeing with Phillips is that he is highlighting Biden's biggest weaknesses, right? So he's talked about Biden's age, which we know from voters is a real concern, and he's targeting the economy or so-called Biden economics. So, you know, Biden's economic achievements, which we also know a lot of voters don't feel like this economy is working for them. So, yes. I mean, if you talk to people around Biden they'll say this isn't serious. This -- you know, he can't go the distance. Can he get on the ballot in various states? But certainly, the fact that he is making noise and highlighting these weaknesses -- potentially, in key states like Michigan -- is something that's not helpful to the president who is currently locked in basically a tied race with former President Trump when they're matched in hypothetical polling. This isn't helpful for him right now. [05:35:03] HUNT:  Right. I mean, we know regardless of how it comes together, the 2024 election is going to be razor-thin. We know those margins in these critical states are so small. But anything like this could make a difference. All right --",

But what I learned when I went up there to talk to him is that getting rejected by the Democratic Party wholesale has basically caused him to double down, escalate his attacks on the president, commit to spending more of his own money if it's needed, to take super Pac money. I mean, it seems like he wants to kind of take this as far as he can until at least, he says, Super Tuesday. What's the potential for damage here?

Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina, has been critical of Phillips and said his moves disrespect Black voters.

Escaping heavy pressure here, taking off for a 13-yard run for a first down. And that would set up Matt Prater for a chip shot field goal as time would expire in this game. Arizona picking up their second win of the season -- 25-23 the final score. And it went like that this weekend. It was a weekend of surprises. The Texans and the Bengals in a thriller here. In the end, this would come down to Houston rookie CJ Stroud showing the poise of a veteran, leading his team on a 55-yard drive in six plays over the final 93 seconds.
