Sources telling CNN that they have arrested Duane Keith Davis, also known as \"Keefe D.\" He was arrested this morning, according to sources, in connection with the killing of Tupac Shakur.We do know, in July, the Las Vegas Metro Police Department served a search warrant on Davis' wife's home. What they were looking for with any evidence linking to this crime. They were looking for anything that could show motive as to the killing of Tupac Shakur. And specifically, we know that in this search warrant, police were able to obtain multiple tablets, an iPhone. They took five computers, USB drive, photographs. We know they have been looking into this case and have been investigating this case since it happened in 1996. At the moment, we do not know what Davis has been charged with. We are expecting a press conference later on today to get details from authorities. But again, this is something that happened in 1996 and police have been looking into for years now. Duane Keith Davis, he described himself as one of the only witnesses to this shooting. If you recall, Tupac Shakur was in a car. They were at a boxing match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. They were in a car and, all of a sudden, there was another car that pulled next to them and the shooting began. It is unclear exactly who shot Tupac. But again, this is a huge development in this case years later, as we now know that there is someone arrested in connection to this case -- Boris?",

You imagine, there are many witnesses there.And it came after a fight at the MGM Grand that was caught on a security camera in which there was always suspicious that some of the folks involved in that fight may have been involved in Tupac's shooting. Talk to us about the challenges of looking into a case like this with nearly 30 years of cold evidence.",

The memories of the witnesses. The value, whether people's memories have gone stale or cold. But you don't now know, right? The reality is that you're investigating a case for longstanding, presumably, police have done a very diligent job, have information not just based on the arrest today, but information they've gleaned over the course of a number of years and connecting the dots. They have information that this particular suspect, verbal statements he's given, the memoirs of his own that have been out there. We don't know, Boris, who police have spoken to in the course of getting to today. How they have connected to this person here. How other information may have been preserved that police have. Remember, we have the public reports but we don't know the in-depth information that police have gleaned. So, yes, in any prosecution, even if you have a murder that occurred yesterday, there are challenges. However, they're pretty good at putting together cold cases and a there's been a significant amount of convictions predicated upon cases that are decades old. We'll see what the nature of the evidence is or at least get a look into that when there is a press conference that is held that announces more with respect to what that evidence could be.",

But now we're told by the police chief in this news conference today that there are nine administrative investigations going on right now. Four officers have been arrested. But that's involving something besides the Brave Cave. In September 2020, a man was arrested and brought to the police department building where officers wanted to conduct a search. They believed he had some drugs on him. When the man started struggling, they brought out tasers. They started to tase the man over and over, according to the police chief. That actually activated the body cameras the men were wearing. A supervisor realized that this incident happened. Opened an app, and did realize that that did not follow department policy. Had that body camera destroyed in an effort to avoid the video being logged into the server. The mayor says they're now taking a hard look at the entire police department because they're concerned, just like the community is, about what's going on at the police department. Take a listen.

To put it in terms that you can relate to, this is not a time for just an annual check-up. This is time for a full-body MRI to diagnose and reveal any dysfunctions or wrongdoing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It looks like, I believe, from what I've seen, 198-232 was the final vote here as the vote was closed.So that was a pretty resounding rejection for the speaker. You saw a number of those members, roughly more than 20, it appeared. We'll see what the final number actually was here. But the speaker wanted to demonstrate to his members that he tried to do what these members of the hard right wanted. He tried to move on some of these individual long-term bills first before going along with spending cuts. And trying to paint them as the ones that are being unreasonable here within his conference. And he tried to pressure them to back down. Ultimately, he agreed to move forward on the plan. So he's trying to show he did everything he could to get Republican support for a Republican-led plan, to help them to leverage in negotiations with the Democratic-led Senate, which is moving along bipartisan lines here. So he was unable to get this across the finish line. And that is what has been a lot of concern among McCarthy allies, that they won't have a negotiating position with the Senate. They don't have a card to play in these talks to keep the government open. Now there's not a House bill that they get approved. So that leaves the speaker to decide, pretty much continue to fight, continue to dig in, try to get the White Houses to somehow agree to their demands. If not, how to deal with Democrats and potentially risk his speakership.",

They don't know if McCarthy can give them what they want.Some say get rid of the impeachment inquiry altogether, perhaps then we can save you from the speakership. That is something that seems unlikely that the speaker would do, given were his conferences of the moment. The position of the Democratic leaders on that is simply noncommittal. That's what Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic leader, just told me earlier today. But also this, Brianna. Hakeem Jeffries said that Speaker McCarthy needs to put the Senate plan on the floor of the House. That's what the Democrats are positioning this moment right now. Put the Senate plan on the floor. But McCarthy opposes it that Senate plan to keep the government open because it funds money Ukraine. It does not cut spending as he wants. It doesn't have border security measures, which is why people are concerned that it -- about a prolonged shutdown could happen here if this deal - if there's no movement from the speaker.",
