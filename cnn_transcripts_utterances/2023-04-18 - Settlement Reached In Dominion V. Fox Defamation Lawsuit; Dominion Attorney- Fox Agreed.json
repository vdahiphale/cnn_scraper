I'm Jake Tapper.Moments ago, we learned there is a settlement, a settlement in the high stakes trial between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox. Dominion was suing Fox for $1.6 billion, saying that the network showed complete and utter disregard for truth and facts and accuracy when they allowed guests and hosts to push false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election had been stolen from Donald Trump. CNN's Oliver Darcy is outside the courthouse in Delaware. Oliver, what do we know about the settlement?",

Opening statements were set to begin at 1This, of course, averts a trial that would have been an agonizing process for Fox News. You would have seen top stars like Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson have to testify along with Rupert Murdoch, the aging Fox chairman, he's 92 years old. He would have had to come down to Wilmington, take the stand. And so, none of that's going to happen because there has been a settlement reached.

And so it looked, you know, like this trial was going to happen, and people were, you know, going into court earlier at 1:30 for opening statements. There was that unexpected delay. We did see our CNN's Marshal Cohen in court. He saw a Fox lawyer, take out a piece of paper and show it to Dominion lawyer. Then they went outside the courtroom. It was unclear what was discussed.

You know, it gave us a view inside Fox that frankly, we have never seen before.

It's really showed and highlighted the fact-free universe in which Fox operates, which, actually, to some degree would have made this process of this trial of war to have happened, more agonizing for the network, because the network is used to sailing through controversies by misleading viewers, bad faith attacks on critics, attacking the media. Those things, Jake, would not have been allowed in a trial, the judge would have compelled Fox to put forth a honest, fact-based narrative for the jury.And so that would have been a very uncomfortable position, I think for Fox, especially given the hand they had been dealt. I mean, it was very clear that they were dishonest about what happened in the wake of the 2020 election. The judge already ruled that they had broadcast false material so it would have been up to the jury basically to decide whether they had broadcast that false material with actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth. And I got to say, and I talked to a lot of First Amendment lawyers, Dominion had really assembled evidence from messages and emails that showed that, you know, potentially they did. Crossed that line into knowingly broadcasting false material, which would have been actual malice and which would have probably resulted or potential resulted in Dominion winning this case, Jake.",

This is even outside of the court of public opinion, and we've seen a lot with all the things that would have been entered into evidence, text messages, confirmation that what they believed was very in contrast to what they actually said on air.But the second, the judge said, look, you're not going to be able to cloak yourself in the First Amendment and tell this jury that everything you ever say is protected speech without consequence at all. That was really the probably the beginning of these serious settlement discussions because then the leverage and the power dynamic instantly shifted in favor of Dominion because then they all they had to prove, Jake, was not that what you said was false, check. They've already determined that. But instead, that you had either actual malice, meaning you know what you said was false, or you had every reason to believe that what you were saying was false. And you said it anyway. And finally, you also have the notion here that you can't do a cleanup crew. The judge had already admonished the Fox team on this very point. Just because you maybe had a fact checker later on a different broadcast or at some point in the future. Try to say, well, actually, here's an alternate reality or the truth, as many of us know it. That doesn't mean you didn't either earlier, defame someone. So this is what happens and many, many trials across the country all the time that once the reality of a jury of 12 deciding the fate to the tune of, well, a billion or more in this case, suddenly the party say, you know what?

Of course, we're all very interested to know the number here.The reason that Fox settles, the reason any party settles is because jury trials are inherently unpredictable. There is inherently an element of risk here. And I think from Fox's point of view, I'm -- you know, we'll see what the price tag is here. If I had to guess I would guess it's quite hefty because they were looking at major problems. First of all, they could get hit with an enormous verdict. If this went all the way through to a jury verdict, given the strength of the evidence against them. The second thing is they were looking at a potentially disastrous spectacle where they're leading hosts, journalists, reporters would have to take the stand to be cross- examined about their own contradictory statements.

The judge found that the evidence here was so strong that as a matter of law, Fox's coverage was false. The only disputed evidence was going to be. Was it knowingly false? The other thing is Dominion, by going through the discovery process here, has exposed the lies behind Fox's reporting because of Dominion undertaking this lawsuit. That's why we've seen Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson's and Rupert Murdoch's texts and emails.

It's also about the message that this dollar amount sends to Fox News into the public about Fox News' lies.",

It's not as if it was a jury. Verdict in the finding of damages where they can then go back and then litigate through a protracted proceeding and try to maybe even take it all up the Supreme Court and a variety of ways. This is what they have agreed upon, and they are stuck with this number. It will also factor in, though, if you're talking about Fox News and what their overall bottom line will be. If you imagine what kind of pool of money you're going to have access to, in order to be able to pay out settlement, you're factoring in not just before you in front of you on this main plate of this trial, but what might be down the road. And it's going to significantly impact what is now available as part of that overall pot down the road. And so this shaving of about half of the amount that was requested before now opens up more room for Salman opportunities for Smartmatic to then say, well, hold on, I'll take the other half that you may have been willing to pay, and anyone else who comes along. It does not guarantee they'll get it. But it does sweeten the power dynamic and leverage that now Dominion has to say, if we can get one judge to essentially say what you have said is a lie. The jury will not even hear your argument about why it's not a lie or the first amendment that bodes well for their ability to persuade the next set of litigants about this issue.",

Fox agreeing to that historic paycheck in light of all of the lies that channel allowed, pushed during and after the election of 2020.We're going to have more from Wilmington, Delaware, in a moment, but let's turn to our national lead right now. Two cases of young Americans shot only because they accidentally showed up at the wrong house. A New York man has been charged with second degree murder after police say he fired two shots into a car that had turned into his driveway on Saturday night. Officials say the group and the car realized they were at the wrong home in their rural New York neighborhood, north of Albany, and we're trying to leave when one of the shots killed 20 year old Kaylin Gillis. The shooting happened just days after a Black teenager in Kansas City, Missouri, was shot twice by a White homeowner after going to the wrong address to pick up his little brothers. We're covering both of these shocking incidents, starting with CNN's Lucy Kafanov in Kansas City. And, Lucy, the suspect in the case in Kansas City, 84 year old Andrew Lester, he turned himself into police this afternoon. But we're learning he was -- he was just released?",

He finally did.We just learned that he has posted bond and been released, according to the sheriff's office spokesperson. Bail was apparently set at $200,000. Some of the conditions included prohibiting Lester from possessing weapons of any type. He may not have any direct or indirect contact with Ralph Yarl, the 16-year-old who he was accused of shooting and Lester's phone is now subject to monitoring and it is not clear at this point, Jake, whether Lester is going to appear in court for an initial hearing. We're obviously trying to continue to speak to the legal representation of Lester. In terms of the charges that he's facing, we know that he is, this is five days after he allegedly opened fire on this teenager for showing up at the wrong address. He is apparently facing two charges he could be if convicted on those charges facing life behind bars. We know that he has been accused of shooting Ralph Yarl through a glass storm door with a 32 caliber revolver, according to a probable cause statement that CNN obtained, Lester told investigators that he was in bed, that night on April 14th when he heard the doorbell ring. He apparently grabbed this weapon walked up to the door. He said, after opening him the main door, he, quote, saw a Black male, approximately six feet tall, and he believed, quote, someone was attempting to break into the house and shot twice within seconds of opening the main door. Lester said no words were exchanged. Ralph Yarl told officers that he heard the man say, don't come around here before shooting him twice. We are right now by city hall where we are expecting a protest in support of Ralph Yarl to begin any second now -- Jake.",
