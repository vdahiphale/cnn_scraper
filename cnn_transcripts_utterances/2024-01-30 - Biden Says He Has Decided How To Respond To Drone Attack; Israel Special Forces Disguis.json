A warning, some of what you're about to see is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israeli forces disguised as Israeli civilians and medical staff storming a hospital in the occupied West Bank, weapons drawn. As they move through a hospital corridor, one man is temporarily detained. Shouts of \"army, army\" ring out through the hospital corridor. Several are wearing hijabs. Two of the operatives could even be mistaken for new parents, baby carrier in tow. A dozen Israeli forces infiltrated the Ibn Sina Hospital in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, killing three Palestinian militants affiliated with Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Israeli military claiming this man, Mohammad Jalamna, planned to carry out a terrorist attack in the immediate future, without providing any details. In a statement, the Israeli military said: For a long time, wanted suspects have been hiding in hospitals and using them as a base for planning terrorist activities and carrying out terror attacks. While they assume that the exploitation of hospitals will serve as protection against counterterrorism activities of Israeli security forces. Legal experts say that the Israeli commandos may have violated international law by disguising themselves as civilians and medical personnel. One of the men targeted, Basil Al-Ghazawi, was being treated for injuries from a rocket explosion. The hospital said he was sleeping in his bed when he was killed. He and his brother, Mohammed, also killed by Israeli commandos in the same hospital room, where affiliated with Islamic Jihad.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society says that Israeli tanks have now entered the front yard of al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis. They say that the Israeli military's firing live ammunition and smoke grenades at the hospital's front yard. Displaced people and staff are being evacuated at gunpoint, according to a hospital official. Now, the Israeli military hasn't commented on this yet, but in the past, they have said that Hamas uses these hospitals for their military purposes and they have been urging this hospital's evacuation.

But there is also, of course, concern over the ethics and safety ofthis trial, and the reliability of Musk's company Neuralink itself. Let's bring in Amy Webb. She's the CEO of Future Today Institute, and CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Amy, to you first. Musk's startup is not the first company to do something like this, and to be frank, Musk himself has a mixed success record in terms of effectively leading companies and promising to dish out life-changing new technology. Is Neuralink worth the hype, do you think?",
