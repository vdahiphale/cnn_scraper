And let's not forget the other states that he's visited in the last 10 days. In the last 10 days. There's a stark difference from what we've been doing and what the other side is doing, stark difference. And so the President is committed, he's going to continue to do that. He wants to engage, engage directly with the American people. 600 people at the church yesterday, 600 people at the event in Harrisburg, that's a pretty good start. And that's just a continuation.

The ABC interview was about 20 minutes long. The speeches that he's given at rallies have been about 20 minutes long with a teleprompter.The event in Philadelphia was relatively limited in his discourse and his ability to talk about different topics. We are seeing him speak to the press later at the end of the NATO summit. But I'm wondering, do you think the White House or the campaign should have approached this more aggressively from the start to tamper down any frustrations or questions, those coming from some of your Democratic colleagues?",

But I did think he really got back on stride pretty quickly.And so, I understand I've got colleagues out there, reporters, columnists and the like, got a lot of questions. Voters have questions too. And I think he needs to continue to answer those. And I think he has been doing that. But the best way to answer it is to do what he's doing. He's gotten back on the campaign trail. He's out interacting with the public. It's a little unfair from my perspective because I've had a chance to interact with him in private recently, the first trip to Philadelphia a few weeks ago. And he was really, you know, I thought he was doing great. So I think it's just a question of making sure that the public gets to see that. But then the key part, I think, is that we've got to get back. We've got a campaign to win in November. And, you know, before all this popped up, you know, we were out there, the Democrats, the president, making the points about the great things that he's done in this presidency so far. I think the first two years of his tenure were probably about as good as you can see, maybe since a president like LBJ and the Great Societies. There's a lot of great things to point to, 15 million jobs, you know, holding down on the prescription drug costs, infrastructure improvements, roads, bridges and the like. And there's a lot of positive things. We've got to make sure we get him out there. And the other big thing I think we have to make sure we do is it can't just be macroeconomic descriptions of what he's done. We have to explain to people so that they know how it's affecting their pocketbook or will affect their pocketbook and personalize it in that way. And I think he's going not just to the battleground states, but around the country to try and make those points.",

And, you know, there's been a lot of speculation about other names, especially, you know, governors and senators and the like.My gripe with that has been that there's been no analysis of the mechanics. You know, for example, I think it's like 220 million or so that's in the Biden-Harris campaign. If you pick a new standard bearer, the money doesn't just shift over. So you'd have somebody starting from scratch to raise the money. The campaign apparatus, the computers, the offices, the leases, all that stuff, that doesn't just shift over automatically either. The new campaign would have to pay for that at fair market value. And then you're talking about people very talented out there. I think the Democrats have a great bench. But, you know, many of them are like single-digit name recognition outside of their particular state or region. Is it really fair to expect somebody, no matter how talented, to build a national campaign, build national name recognition, reestablish the type of campaign funding you need to run a national campaign, and do all of it in less than three months? I think that's a very tall order. And by the way, the good campaign things that I just mentioned that the Biden-Harris team can run on, they don't necessarily have that national record that he's got. I think it's, there's a lot of assets with the Biden campaign that we've been overlooking for the last 10 days or so. I think it's time, certainly for Democrats, I'm hoping we can get back to focusing on that in the near future.",

You know, when I go home to my district in Prince George's County, Maryland, the support for him is just as strong as ever, maybe a little stronger.I think there's some resentment at the way he's been attacked, especially from seniors. And the support for Kamala Harris, I think is really strong as well, because I think there's been a lot of somewhat disrespect with respect to her and her record. And I think, you know, that's the backbone of the political party is the African-American vote. So I think we need to be very careful about overlooking that. I've got colleagues running their districts that aren't predominantly African- American. So I want to respect where they are. But the points I just mentioned about the mechanics, the logistics of somebody else coming in and taking over, those are universals. Those are constants. I haven't heard anybody really addressing those. And, you know, when I open up the newspapers and I see editors calling for him to step down or they're throwing out other names out there, none of them have spoken on this issue, which is, I think, a fundamental piece. If you can't explain how somebody else can come in and put together a campaign that's actually got a better chance of winning than the Biden-Harris team, I think you need to rethink your position.",

Angela Alsobrooks, the Democrat running in Maryland, I think is, you know, ahead in the polls that I've seen. I think she is running a strong campaign there. I think we really have the potential to win these races and maintain our positions in the White House, the Senate, and regain the majority in the House. But we're not going to do it if we keep fighting with each other over these kinds of things, you know, up to the Democratic convention and beyond. We've got to -- we have to play together as a team.

      "sentences": "What was an extremely contentious mood in the room with frustration evident among the press corps for how hard it was to get very basic answers about whether the president had been seen any more than three times by this specialist, who this specialist, who has specialist in neurology, but also expertise in Parkinson's, and who they had been treating.I asked specifically about the role of Megan Nasworthy, who is listed in the White House visitors log as the person that Dr. Cannard, the specialist from Walter Reed, was visiting on the White House complex a handful of times. He was also listed as having visited Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who's the president's personal physician. Karine Jean-Pierre, the press secretary, noted that he's also the head of the White House medical unit, so it could be plausible that he was treating other people. But when asked specifically for yes or no answers on whether the president was seen on any other occasions by this specialist, there was no answer on that. And that was, I think, one of the most frustrating responses to the press corps and one of the reasons why you saw a few correspondents erupt there. And so there are still many more questions than answers on this front, especially when it comes to the president's medical records, which he said on television this morning that he had released in full. And that's still something that hasn't happened. So we await more information from the president and the White House. But where the president's political future lies, it's been clear that he's been working the phones with Democrats, with leadership. The White House could not say whether he had spoken with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries since Jeffries convened that call with senior Democrats yesterday, and at least a handful of them called for Biden to step aside. But they did rattle off a number of Democrats who do support the president, suggesting that, you know, that it was a relative few who held that view, and that as far as any Democrats who might have misgivings about the president's acuity and age, that certainly the White House had not told them to say otherwise -- Jess.",

It's the fact that he still hasn't named his vice presidential pick as well.This was supposed to be a really critical two weeks for former president Donald Trump. You're going to have the rollout of his vice presidential pick followed by that convention in Milwaukee. At one point there was actually going to be the sentencing as well on Thursday, but obviously because of that Supreme court ruling that got pushed to a later date. So he was supposed to be really taking control of the media narrative. And instead he has been largely out of the spotlight. And as you noted, that's not a familiar place for the former president. Now, people close to Donald Trump say it's not going to impact the timing of his announcement, but as somebody who has covered Trump for a long time, he is somebody who pays very close attention to what is on the news. What is the center of the media narrative? And it seems unlikely with all of this focus on Joe Biden, particularly around the fact that Thursday, for example, Joe Biden will be giving that press conference. Obviously, everyone will be tuning in that that would be a time that he would announce his vice presidential pick. Now, according to his team, they've given themselves a deadline of Monday, but one source said it could come as late as Monday morning at the actual convention. Before that, he does have two rallies, one here in Miami at Esmeralda resort where we are, as well as one in Pennsylvania on Saturday. And right now just remains unclear when that vice presidential announcement is actually going to come, but they are building up a lot of suspense around it. Donald Trump himself.
