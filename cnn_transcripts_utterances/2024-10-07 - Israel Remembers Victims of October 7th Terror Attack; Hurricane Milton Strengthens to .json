Thousands of people gathered for a music festival near a kibbutz. The music, the celebration, the joy shattered by the sight of rockets in the sky. Attendees ran looking for safety and, instead, found unimaginable violence as thousands of Hamas terrorists invaded Israel from Gaza. In the hours that followed, members of Hamas and its allies killed 1,200 people, wounded thousands more. Hundreds of others, they kidnapped, forcing them back into Gaza. Twelve months later, more than 100 still remain in captivity. In the year since that day, Israel has sought to destroy Hamas. Airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza leaving more than 41,000 Palestinians dead. Israel is now fighting Iran-backed terror groups on multiple fronts in Gaza, in Lebanon, and in Yemen. The region and the lives of those in it forever altered by an attack that the Israeli president today called \"a scar on the face of the earth.\" One survivor of the massacre at the music festival described what it was like to return to those grounds today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROEY DERY, OCTOBER 7TH TERROR ATTACK SURVIVOR: It's been a few times since then. It's like you live the last moment again with them again.

And at this point, of course, we're now in a -- they're in a three -- a three-front war in the Middle East with the administration backing them up. But not seem to be able to really pressure them to act in any different way that they may want to. I mean, what are your reflections? What's your reporting about the state of things inside the White House and on this issue? ERIC-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Joe Biden has been pretty clear that he's very frustrated with Benjamin Netanyahu and has not been able to get him to agree to even come close to agree to a ceasefire or an end to the hostilities. Last week, the White House felt pretty good that they kept the Iranian missile attack from escalating into so much more. But that is the range of victory that we're talking about when it comes to how the Biden administration is looking at this. So, it's obviously, then, a difficult thing politically for them, but it is an incredibly difficult thing in national security terms. And what all this is. We are in an unprecedented situation. This war is the longest war that Israel has ever been in. It -- we do not know where things might end up with Iran. And any violence between Israel and Iran is not a good situation. And obviously, there's what's going on in Lebanon now, this attack on Hezbollah. And the -- we can forget, because it's not at the forefront of the news every day, that the fighting continues in Gaza and that 100 hostages are still being held. And that I don't think it's -- at times the hostage families have been frustrated with him. Now I think it's almost every day that they're frustrated with Netanyahu. And that, in some ways, that the American political discourse overlooks the fact of how much of Israel, as opposed to what Netanyahu is doing.",

And so, what you're seeing is that Kamala Harris is trying to straddle both those sides of the party.She met with Muslim and Arab groups in Michigan in a private meeting last week. She's going to speak out about October 7 this week in her \"60 Minutes\" interview. That's premiering tonight. She is also basically saying that we are allied with the Israeli people, but not necessarily allied with Netanyahu. Now, Donald Trump has basically said, I want Netanyahu not only -- not to deescalate, potentially escalate and get it over, as he said quickly. Now, Democrats argue that could then further spiral the conflict. MATT GORMAN, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: No, it's true. I mean, look, for what -- for how much? Of course, October 7 changed the Middle East. It also changed Washington in a lot of ways. I mean Alex is right. The GOP largely aligned behind Netanyahu and Israel. And we're seeing right now the \"60 Minutes,\" at least the clips that have leaked out from Kamala Harris's interview that aired tonight, really put those divisions on display in terms of the -- allied with Netanyahu or the Israeli people. Also, her answer on whether or not she was able to influence the Israeli government, I thought, were very interesting and somewhat incomprehensible.

They acted kind of physically, optically late to recognize what a potentially damaging storm this could be.And also, I think that that is kind of where my critique lives. It seems like Trump beat them there in terms of being on the ground just like you've got to do with East Palestine with the train derailment in Ohio a couple of years ago.

This is new as of 5 a.m. update from the National Hurricane Center. We do have hurricane watches in place, where you see that shading of pink and watches for tropical storms intensity across the Big Bend and into the Florida Keys. But this is what the area we're really focusing in on. Tampa Bay in particular. We know this area is so vulnerable. Here's the official forecast track. This is important. It has slowed down considerably since yesterday when we were talking about this storm. And we do anticipate a landfalling major hurricane sometime late Wednesday into early Thursday morning now. So that's stalled by about 12 hours. Very important information there, as well, in terms of the preparation ahead of the storm. This is the first initial storm surge forecast from the National Hurricane Center. I'm going to point this out. Eight to 12 feet near Tampa Bay. That is higher than the actual realized storm surge values from Hurricane Helene, not two -- two weeks ago that set record values here for this region. So, we know that there is still destruction and debris on the ground. So, this is something to consider, as well. It's raining already ahead of the storm. Flash flooding will be a major concern, along with the traditional tornado threat that comes with landfalling hurricanes, Kasie. A busy week ahead.",
