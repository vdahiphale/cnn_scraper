We've seen Russia's military statements in the past acknowledging these attacks, admitting they are behind these, this sustained campaign on civilian infrastructure again. But what's interesting here is that you hear President Putin talking about the motivations. Oftentimes in the statements we see from Moscow there seems to be a strategic reason given for these attacks. But President Putin seems to be admitting this is simple revenge. It's a tit-for-tat.

He believes those lands belong to Russia. He goes on to make these accusations against the West saying that they only care about Ukraine and not about Russia. What do we take away from all of this? I think, first of all, just how personal this conflict is of course for President Putin. We're not talking about military strategy here in these comments, we're talking about personal offense in many ways. And you also get from this, Kim, that these attacks are going to continue. Ukrainian officials, their allies say the attacks on infrastructure in Ukraine could amount to war crimes because of the civilian suffering.

Perhaps that comes in volume two, so perhaps those are to come next week.We found out that Harry and Meghan take aim at the royal family again, a lot of the same things. I think the most damaging claim really being that there is unconscious bias when it comes to race within the royal institution. That is not something new. We knew that already. They also have, of course, a deep contempt of the media, of the British media. And not just the tabloids, they really went to town on this one. They accused actually the royal rotor of journalists of being an extended PR arm of the royal family. There was some unseen footage of the couple. There were some beautiful anecdotes, I think of the beginning of their relationship, how they met, their first date. We found out how they -- how the proposal went down. There were some beautiful shots of their kids as well. So some nice moments. But within some of those anecdotes, some thinly veiled digs really at members of the royal family. Meghan at one stage talking about how she met the now Prince and Princess of Wales for the first time that she was barefoot wearing ripped jeans very informal, and she said she went for a hug and she didn't realize she says that this is really jarring for a lot of Brits, suggesting that hug wasn't welcome. Also saying that the formality on the outside of the royal family very much carried on in the inside and that surprised her somewhat. Prince Harry also says, of the men in the royal family, I'll let you work out whether this is a dig at his father or his brother. But he says there can be a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit with the mold as opposed to somebody you are perhaps destined to be with. So, lots to get upset about, but no mega bombshells there.",

Although you're right, some people are calling for that. More interesting, perhaps is why they want to use those titles given they have such high criticism for the institution of the royal family that those titles represent.It has been interesting to see some of the reaction, particularly in terms of the newspaper. Daily Telegraph. So, I'm not just going for tabloids. Sussex's TV show claims are a direct hit on the Queen's legacy. A lot of criticism as to how the commonwealth was dealt with, which is of course one of the big legacies of the Queen. You can see it here in the Daily Mail as well. In terms of the public, I'm not sure that what was said in this interview, or sorry in this documentary series as it's being called, will really change any minds. I think those that support team Sussex still will. I think those that didn't like team Sussex still don't. Take a listen to people in Windsor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what are the odds of that? Probably 20 percent at best, maybe. But again, he and Argentina are very capable, specifically because Messi has probably been better at this World Cup than he has at any of his previous four World Cups, and that's a remarkable statement given that he's 35 years old. But it's true. And his Argentina teammates love playing for him. They're well structured around him. They feel inspired to fight for him at what is probably his last World Cup. The Argentine fan presence has been overwhelming here in a good way. So, Messi's last shot at a World Cup might just be his best.",

It's just been pretty obvious that he's nowhere close to the player that he once was. He looks kind of like immobile and just like, doesn't really impact the game in a positive way that much.And yet he is Cristiano Ronaldo, so it was a huge call to bench him for that round of 16 game. But the manager, Fernando Santos, he pulled the trigger and it absolutely worked out. And I'm assuming that we'll see Goncalo Ramos, this 21-year-old who scored a hat trick in Ronaldo's Place. We'll probably see him against Morocco in the quarter finals. And Portugal are absolutely better without Ronaldo in the team right now. What I would say though, is that this upcoming match against Morocco is going to be a lot different than Portugal's last match against Switzerland was, and if it plays out anything like that Spain/ Morocco match did and with Portugal having a lot of possession and Morocco holding firm and kind of sitting back. I do think you could see Ronaldo make an impact off the bench here in a tight game if his, you know --",
