It all relates to the provision of electricity, the rolling blackouts, the load shedding, as it is called. You're going to hear that phrase quite a lot during the course of this program. You'll also hear more positive aspects about the economy, the tourist industry.

It is now more than 90 hours since a devastating earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria. The death toll has now surpassed 20,000 tonight. Temperatures are plummeting again and while hopes are fading, rescuers aren't giving up. There have been some remarkable moments of success. In just the last hour a 17-year-old girl was pulled from the rubble alive. An arm raised in triumph by a man freed earlier today, but these moments are tempered by growing desperation and frustration. Mass graves are being dug to bury the victims. Many survivors left homeless desperately needing help. In Turkey, aid is arriving from dozens of nations as anger grows over what critics call a slow response to the disaster. And right across the quake zone, family members and friends wait in anticipation for any word about missing loved ones. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh spoke to one of them. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us -- shares us rather how the White Helmets and other volunteers are responding to their desperate needs. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Rescue workers sings to little Mina (ph), talks and share stories with her. He goes on and on chatting about anything to distract her from the horrifying reality that she is being extracted from the ruins of her home. Mina is eventually pulled out safely. Her family has also survived, rescued by members of the White Helmets, a group of first responders seen as heroes in this rebel-held enclave of Syria. Nearly 12 years of war has made the group experts on the grim task of retrieving people from collapsed buildings. Syrians living in opposition- controlled areas battered by the government of President Bashar al-Assad and feeling neglected by the world have come to depend on only themselves, even in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. The result is catastrophic. Here, there is a shortage of everything, even body bags. This man has arrived with just one bag to hold all four of his dead relatives. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) ABDELAZIZ (voice over): \"We hope that countries would come to our rescue,\" he says, \"But there is only our community that came to help us. Nobody else. We have no one to help us.\" And for the thousands of wounded pulled out of the rubble, they face a healthcare system on the brink. Another volunteer group here is the Syrian- American Medical Society, doing its best to provide care on the ground, but equipment and supplies are scarce and countless deaths, they warned could be prevented if they could just get the basics. And for those survivors unharmed but made homeless, vehicles are now shelter, sidewalks or beds, shivering in olive groves is all that's left.

It was during the State of the Nation Address that he also appointed a Minister for Electricity. It was a long address, in which he went through the various woes of the country, and indeed addressed the question of the power cuts. The events, however, got off to a chaotic start, which I'm told is not unique. Lawmakers heckled the President from Economic Freedom Fighters Party. It was expected and then they tried to rush the stage and had to be escorted out by Security Services. Everybody I spoke to during the week said this is what was likely to happen because it's not the first time that the group had disrupted the address. Then President Ramaphosa began. He vowed to deal with the blackouts. There have been outages every day in 2023. The President said the issue has had significant economic effects. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Firstly, what we're before we get to the nitty-gritty of your optimism, what did you make of the State of the Nation tonight?

And the analogy here would be the strategy and the plan of the SONA, what we heard this evening, then you divide people and the structure, the Cabinet, and then you need to allocate financial resources, the budget speech, which is going to happen in due course. As far as the strategy and the speech goes, yes, it was a great speech. You know, you could compare it to that of the monasteries, it gave a good picture of what's happening in the South African body politic, and it listed the imperatives of the day.

It's outrageous in fact. We could be growing as fast as some of our neighbors. And yet, we've got this massive install base, a large economy of over $400 billion, but we are lag off and we actually a bit contributed to the slowdown in African GDP growth. So yes, the electricity issue is huge. However, one has to look at the data. You know, Richard, in God we trust everybody else, please provide us with data. The data tells us that since September last year, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange has grown by 20 percent. A large proportion of our corporate customers are growing headline earnings in double digits, their return on equity is significantly higher than the cost of equity. Businesses are making flat. There are businesses that are failing, they are struggling, but let me say this, there are businesses that are succeeding as well. So it's a tale of two cities in that sense, Richard. Thank you.",

And when he was asked about it, he -- he hinted that thre was progress but it was behind closed doors, that he wasn't ready to discuss it and I think in the margins what we're understanding is that while fighter jets haven't been removed from the agenda.  This is according to the British, according to the Dutch. There isn't yet a united commitment to put them on the agenda and remembering that that what it took with tanks, that Britain went first. Then after a lot of pressure, the United States put its tanks on the table, then Germany followed suit and all the countries that Germany had sold it's Leopard 2 tanks did the same.  It sort of feels as if we're in the same, sort of, diplomatic space although not so far advanced along it.  There is some reticence for supplying fighter jets and what I understand from defense officials is that they don't really think that fighter jets are the right thing yet for Ukraine, when it doesn't have it's air defenses fully securing it's airspace. It would be potentially, you know, they could face a loss of these aircraft in the skies. So President Zelenskyy, I think, seems -- seems happy and reassured that he's got the support that he came for, that he's got the conversation going.  He's got the ball rolling in his direction.
