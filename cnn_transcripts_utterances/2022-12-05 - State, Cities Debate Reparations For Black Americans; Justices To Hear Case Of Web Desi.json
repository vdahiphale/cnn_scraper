Because that was really the spur I think for this latest round of coming to terms with it. So many different institutions and jurisdictions are trying to sort of figure this stuff out. You have places where it's relatively contained, like Georgetown University where they had, in the 19th century, sold off 272 enslaved people to pay off some debts. And they now have said that the descendants of those particular people can go tuition-free and they're going to put some money into a fund for them as well. That's relatively contained. Then you have these broader questions like what they're grappling with in Rhode Island and in California. It raises really interesting and important questions. And so, whether it's at the lower end of just placing a marker, renaming a street, taking down an offensive monument, or at the higher end of actually trying to calculate financial reparations, it's a long overdue conversation.",
