Her boyfriend, Chris Van Heerden, will be joining us here in a moment. This all coming as Vladimir Putin is punishing mourners arrested at memorials for Alexei Navalny with military registration summonses, according to an independent Russian human rights group. One detained man telling Russian media that authorities threatened to break his fingers if he didn't sign the military papers. And that comes as Russia continues to gain ground along Ukraine's eastern front. One soldier seen here hoisting a Soviet victory flag over a newly captured village after a key victory seizing the eastern city of Avdiivka.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy referring to four separate parts of the frontline where he said Ukraine was doing -- sorry, someone background here. You're hearing in Kherson a constant artillery jolt, and its dark round. People give the lights off, so don't become a target.Now, one of the areas that's been mentioned as a place of potential Russian progress claimed at the highest levels in Moscow by the defense minister speaking to Vladimir Putin is in fact just across the river from where I'm standing, a placed called Krynky, which has been a place where Ukrainian pushed across the river trying to get towards Crimea, held that position a great peril, many losses, and now Russia yesterday claim that essentially clean the Ukrainians away from there. Ukraine denied that vehemently and even drone video of rush and putting up a flag and then fleeing that particular area. But still, it's one of four places where Russia claims they're putting a lot of pressure on the Ukrainians. Another one is near Avdiivka, where Ukrainian commanders say Russia still has enough strength to keep pushing forward on to the next village. There's pressure to the south of that two, near an area called Marinka and also to the north of Avdiivka near Kharkiv, an area called Kupiansk all bad news for Ukraine being no doubt. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy talking about all those four separate areas, whilst also saying, look, in the last week, we've taken out seven Russian fighter jets, but Kyiv now having to thread this complex balance between being as candid as they can to their Western partners about how that lack of Western aid is translating into real losses of territory and men on the battlefield, but also keep morale high. But still, its fascinatingly awful frankly, for those watching this war, Brianna, on Ukrainian side to observe how many places now its clear Ukraine is under intense pressure, Brianna.",

[19:40:09] FOSTER: Well, when any member of Congress, Democrat or Republican makes an incorrect or false statement, that is a problem and they have to fully own that. And so, I think that did help feed into this culture of distrust and partisan bickering. But I think my job is to stay squarely focused on the people that I worked for, the American people. If there was evidence of wrongdoing, I would be side-by-side with my Republican colleagues in pursuing it, but there is no such evidence. And if there's not, it is not an appropriate use of taxpayer resources to continue to pursue something merely for political purposes when the Oversight Committee needs to be doing investigations into things like price gouging, needs to be tackling problems like the cost of prescription drugs.",

And it comes as an exclusive CNN investigation has revealed a shocking attack on a U.N. aid convoy trying to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza. Katie Polglase is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE PRODUCER (voice-over): This is how desperate the people in northern Gaza are. This aid truck filmed at the end of January is one of the last enter the region. And here's why -- aid so often caught in the fighting. Now CNN can exclusively reveal that this truck carrying vital food headed for northern Gaza was hit on February 5th by an Israeli shell, despite an agreement to provide a safe route. CNN has seen the internal U.N. incident report and the correspondence between the U.N. and the Israeli military that show the route of this convoy was agreed upon in advance. And with starvation imminent for many across Gaza, experts say hitting a food truck is a potential war crime. JANINA DILL, OXFORD UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE FOR ETHICS, LAW AND ARMED CONFLICT: Looking at it with the available facts, it's really difficult to see how this could be a legal attack. And so at minimum, it would look like a very serious violation of international humanitarian law, whether it's also criminal, then depends on questions of intent.",
