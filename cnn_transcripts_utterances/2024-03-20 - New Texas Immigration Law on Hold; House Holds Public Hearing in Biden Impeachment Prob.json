I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington.We begin with the breaking news, a response to Donald Trump's claim that it's impossible for him to get a $464 million bond as the appeal plays out. The New York attorney general's office is telling the appeals court to ignore that argument. CNN's Kara Scannell is joining us from New York right now. So, Kara, what exactly did the New York attorney general say?",

That is the sworn statements by an insurance broker and Trump's top legal officer saying that they both have their own vested interest in this and that their testimony should be discounted. They're also saying that Trump had said that they approached 30 insurers, no one would do it, no one would do it based on using real estate to support the over half-a-billion-dollar bond that they'd have to put up. So, the attorney general's office is saying, well, maybe they should try to get a couple of insurance companies to come together or provide more information to the court about what the terms are. Just -- they're trying to get under the hood to understand if Trump just doesn't want to take the terms that are being offered or if they really can't get a deal. Now, the A.G.'s office also saying that what Trump could do is that he could post his own property to the court. He could turn over real estate to the court as the -- to satisfy this judgment as that goes forward. It's not clear if that's something that Trump's side would be interested in. I have reached out to them this morning, haven't heard back. But this all comes as the deadline is ticking. Trump's grace period in which he would have to post this bond is on Monday. They are hoping the appeals court will grant their motion to say he doesn't have to post the full amount or doesn't have to post money at all until the appeal is finalized. We are still waiting to hear from the appeals court what they are going to do in that case. And, if not, the attorney general's office has been pretty clear that they are ready to move forward to try to seize some of his assets and possibly properties as soon as Monday Wolf.",

I think you're going to see mixed messaging on it. You will see him speak to certain audiences and message it in a certain way. But I think he knows that he cannot win without courting suburban women voters. And, look, he's also got to look at Latino voters. And, Latinos, sometimes, they are very conservative on issue -- on the issue. Some of them vote more conservative. They're Catholic. So I think he's trying to figure out what's the fine line here on how to push this messaging where he doesn't ostracize a very significant voting population.",

Regardless of whether you live in a red state or a blue state, this is affecting all of us. And it's not what Republicans are supposed to do, right? A federal abortion ban? Part of the logic of overturning Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs decision, was that it was supposed to be a state decision. And I think that, regardless of what Donald Trump says and how much he waffles and mixes the messages, he's still going to have to answer for the fact that it was the judges he appointed who led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. And I think that's something that, while he may be having mixed messages, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are not going to be mixing their messages and are going to be having him accountable for the decisions he made, the judges he appointed and what they have done and the -- and what it has wreaked on America.",

He had a very good night. There was a little bit of concern as to how exactly Bernie Moreno would pull it out. There was a little bit of late surging from other candidates. And you have to remember that 2022 is still very much at the front of everyone's mind. There is a reason that Donald Trump hasn't endorsed more candidates moving forward, because he had a bad run in 2022. He was blamed for a lot of the losses because he picked candidates who would win in the primary and lose in the general. They didn't want to endorse somebody who was going to also possibly lose in the primary, particularly if he got behind them in a state like Ohio, which has gone consistently to Trump by huge margins. So there was a lot of waiting to see how exactly this was going to play out. They were very happy last night when they saw these results come in.",

So he knows that he's going to get a rise out of his voters on this, and he's going to kind of conflict the messaging on this issue. But the reality is, like, I was there when we have talked to him about why his words matter when shootings at the synagogues have happened. I have been there. He has been specifically told about how to use language that doesn't in -- fuel this rise of this hatred. And so I think, when you see him make statements like this, it's to ostracize the Jewish people. But I don't understand the get here. You're going into an election.

I think it's very smart for him to be doing it this early. One of the things that I think any community hates is when, in the last two months of a campaign, somebody shows up to seek the vote. And, look, on the issue you were talking about before, which is the Jewish vote and the claims that Trump is making regarding Democrats and Jewish support, how do you take this guy seriously when he is literally, not figuratively, using Hitler rhetoric to describe Latinos, to describe immigrants, when he is talking about poisoning the blood of America. That is not coming out of context. That is not coming in a vacuum. Those are Hitler words. Those are -- it's the same type of rhetoric that Adolf Hitler used.

We have got more on the story from CNN senior national correspondent Ed Lavandera. He's on the scene for us in El Paso, Texas. And CNN senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic, she's here with me in Washington. Ed, lots of back-and-forth going on over the past 24 hours. It's getting a bit confusing.

And one of the things that we're hearing, the common theme that we're hearing from law enforcement organizations all across the state right now is that it doesn't appear that there is a great deal of an appetite or a desire to go out and have law enforcement officers solely enforcing this law and asking people for documentation, immigration documentation that proves their legal status here in the country. They are saying that, if it does come up in the course of investigating other crimes that it would then be enforced. But the idea of sending out law enforcement officers to go around and start asking people if they have entered the country illegally does not sound like something that sheriffs and police chiefs are going to be ordering their agents to do here on the ground.

These are all temporary preliminary orders, and what's going on right now, Wolf, is a hearing that could lead to a more formal order. I know all this legal zigzagging is a bit complicated, but the bottom line is, right now, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit is hearing arguments from the state of Texas and from the Biden administration and from immigrant rights groups about whether the law should take effect while appeals play out. Which side would be harmed? And let me just read something from Justice Sotomayor yesterday when the Supreme Court acted that I think tells you kind of the stakes. She dissented. She was one of three liberals who dissented. And she said: \"The court invites further chaos and crisis in immigration enforcement. Texas upends the federal state balance of power that has existed for over a century in which the national government has had exclusive authority over entry and removal of non-citizens.\" Now, what the three judges who are hearing this case right now, Wolf, as we speak, are trying to decide is, while we wait to have the merits of this issue over whether the state of Texas or the federal government has final authority over what's happening at the border, should the law take effect? Which side would actually be harmed? So it's a question of harm. And, right now, the Texas solicitor general, a man by the name of Aaron Nielson, is trying to convince this panel that, if this law does not take effect, Texas as a state would be harmed. The Biden administration, Department of Justice lawyer, will then come up next and say, no, it will actually be the administration and its supremacy over immigration and people at the border, the rights of migrants, they will be harmed if this takes effect. April 3 then will be a hearing in the Fifth Circuit on actually the constitutionality of this law. But, right now, we're at this very critical stage of, can this law be enforced?",
