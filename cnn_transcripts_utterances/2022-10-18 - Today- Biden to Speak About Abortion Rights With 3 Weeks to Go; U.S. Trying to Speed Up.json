I'm Christine Romans.Just three weeks to go until the mid-term elections. Today, President Biden will zero in on abortion rights when he speaks at a speech in Washington. The White House hopes the issue will continue to galvanize voters. The latest CNN poll finds it's the economy, inflation, voting rights, guns all ranked ahead of abortion in the minds of voters. CNN's Jasmine Wright is live for us bright and early in Washington. Jasmine, what do you expect the president's message on abortion to be?",

The president, officials say, is going to make the choice clear for voters, that they can go with the Republican Party who wants to ban abortion, he's going to say, or go with Democrats who don't, who want to codify Roe v. Wade.Now, of course, the president has talked about abortion since the ruling came down over the summer, really trying to drum up the Democratic base, hoping that they'll come out and support their candidates, of course, because control of the Senate and control of the House for the Democratic Party is on the ballot come November. Now, of course, two things stand in contrast here. First, we talked about a majority of voters are not listing abortion first as their main voting issue. It's the economy. Something you can see on the screen here, something the president and his White House have struggled with inflation. Second, what today is going to look like. We're not expecting him to show up with a major candidate that's on the ballot on November. He's only event with the candidate this week we know will be with John Fetterman of Pennsylvania when he comes there for finance vote. That is likely to be closed door. Now, kind of folds into this series the president has been doing, not holding major Democratic rallies with candidates ahead, of course, last week, we saw him on the West Coast. The White House defended his schedule even though it's right on showing up with races that are very, very tight across the country. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOSUE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president is going to get out there, as we have said multiple times, to make sure he's talking directly to the American people about how we are delivering -- for delivering on our promises, delivering on how we're taking inflation seriously, delivering on making sure we're creating the jobs that the American people need at this time. So, he's been on the road nonstop and he will continue to be on the road nonstop. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has weakened gun laws and flooded our streets. He has weakened our privacy rights and our -- and women's rights. He has denied women access to reproductive care.

You haven't seen voters mobilize like this before because they haven't had this right removed before. On inflation or on the economy, the Republicans are zeroing in on that. The number one thing on voters' minds, in poll, after poll, after poll. Rare gas prices are getting better. You're seeing Democrats start to do a little better.

Michigan it already is. There is a separate ballot issue that Democrats from the time that that decided it was going to be on the ballot have been mobilizing behind it. While candidates are more nuanced, they have lots of reasons that voters go for one candidate or another.

The people are getting snowfall, they're surely taking note here that we're just a couple of months away from winter officially getting underway.

Aiming for 54 in the afternoon hours of Tuesday. This generally warming trend over the next several days where we climb up above average. If you're not a fan of the colder air over the next few days, expect temps to be above average by this time this week. So, false fall across the area of the eastern U.S. which sparks a rebound in the coming several days. But notice the western U.S.,. we've touched on how warm it's been here. Fire weather conditions have been active. Up to 97 large fires the vast majority across the Pacific northwest. Generally wet weather pushes in. Friday, Saturday, Sunday we expect to see wet weather across the northwest and improving fire conditions there as well.
