We have been back there to see how they do their jobs. First they sort all the ballots and then they start verifying signatures. So that's why this process takes a little longer than maybe some other places. They are very diligent about doing this to make sure that they have the count correct.

But so far all is well. There were problems with the printers that people used. And what's interesting about the printers here is that people can come in without a ballot, they sign up, they show their ID, and then they have 12,000 different ballots that the printers are able to print. Some of those printers about -- in about a fifth of the places to vote, some of those printers were not printing dark enough ink and that was a problem so people had to do a couple of different things to make sure that their vote counts.

But they did get infrastructure. They did get a lot of Covid relief. They did get a historical bipartisan gun bill passed. And they're - then they took action on the executive level around student loan debt and around marijuana and around climate. And so as long as Dems keep delivering what the voters want, I think we will be successful again in 2024.I also think that if Republicans show up, if they take the House and start shenanigans and throwing red meat out about trying to do all these oversight hearings, that's not what the people want.
