And the Russians are saying this happened in the early morning hours of today, as the general and an aide to the general were leaving that building. I'm going to get out of your way and you can see the actual scene of where all of this took place. And you already mentioned, that the entrance to that building where all this happens, the second entrance down from here, was badly damaged in that explosion.And the Russians are indeed saying that they believe that the explosive device was hidden in an electric scooter parked right outside that building, and that there were about 300 grams of TNT inside that explosive device. They have already said that they found remnants of that explosive device. And one of the other things that they've said as well is that they believe that it was detonated remotely. Now, we do know at this point in time that the Ukrainian Security Services have claimed responsibility for this. A source saying that to CNN, that Ukrainian Security Services were behind this. The explosion, despite the fact that 300 grams of TNT might not sound like very much, seems to have been substantial. We can see that there's a lot of workers here, on the ground, investigative committee of the Russian Federation on the ground. Some others have cordoned off the area. But one of the other things that we're seeing as well, if we pan over to the other side, is that the explosion was so strong that it damaged the building on the other side of the road. You can see there that windows have been smashed by this explosion that took place. There was an eyewitness report that we have seen, some of them on Russian media saying that they thought that maybe some sort of cement truck had unloaded a lot of cement or what something very heavy had fallen down on the ground. So clearly, the people who live in this area very much heard this explosion at it -- as it took place, of course, at the beginning, not exactly clear of what it might have been. The Russians have launched a criminal investigation into all this. You can see the investigators, and we've seen the investigators on the ground here, not just civilian investigators or from the police authorities, but also military investigators of as well. Of course, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, very important for the Russian military, very high up in the Russian military. He was the head of Russia's nuclear, biological, and chemical defense forces. And the Ukrainians had actually indicted him in absentia just yesterday, the Ukrainian Security Services accusing the Russians of using weaponized chemicals in the war in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov for his part, in the past, had accused the Ukrainians of doing the exact same thing. So certainly, someone who was on the forefront as far as that conflict between Ukraine and Russia is concerned and someone who the Russians, of course, for their military was extremely important.

CNN spoke to a member of Congress just a short time ago, and he lamented how little lawmakers can do to fix the problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KASIE HUNT, CNN ANCHOR of \"CNN THIS MORNING\":  Do you think that this has become normal in America? And is there anything that can be done about it? REP. MARC VEASEY, (D-TX):  I think that people are frustrated with it, but what I really think has happened here is that, it's another case of the groups. And when you talk about the groups and the groups being out of control in D.C., the king of the groups is the NRA. They have way too much power, way too much control over Republicans, and even legislation that 80 percent, 90 percent of the public supports, we can't get through because the Republicans would rather listen to this group than listen to the American people and get some things done. I don't think that it's going to cure everything if we pass some of these more common sense gun safety legislation packages. But at least, we're showing the American public that we're trying to do something about this, and we need to do that. Look, there are a lot of guns that are just floating around out there, that are on the black market that have been stolen, guns that the police aren't even -- that the police don't even know have been stolen. But it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do anything. We have to pass just some basic common sense gun legislation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He appears in a position not just to get huge benefits for his companies from that access, but he's also been put in charge of gutting government regulations and the size of the federal government. That could be a very competitive disadvantage for some of these rival tech firms.So that's why you're seeing them all flock to Trump. They're all trying to win his favor. They understand as well that he responds to flattery. The question here though I think, is that there are massive ethical questions about all of this. Donald Trump, after all, ran for office saying he was going to help working Americans, the Americans who can't afford their groceries, yet he spends almost all of his time in the company of millionaires and multi-billionaires. And it seems that there is a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on to benefit a lot of these corporations. So, I think one of the subtexts of this administration is the way that there will be huge conflicts of interest playing out just because of the way Trump does business in this transactional manner. But he's loving it, of course, as you mentioned, he has all the trappings of the presidency, foreign trips, calls with foreign leaders. He has already seized control of future foreign policy in the Middle East and in Asia. And this is wielding power without responsibility. I think once he's in the Oval Office, all of his actions will have consequences and political blowback. He may not be enjoying it as much when he gets back there.",

Only once before in American history has a president, Grover Cleveland at the end of the 19th century, won a non-consecutive second term before Trump. Trump therefore has the opportunity that most presidents don't have of starting his second term from scratch. Most presidents are still haunted by the decisions they made in the first term. Even though they get rid of some staff, it's essentially the same presidency.Trump has had a time to sit back and reflect on what he wants to change from his first term. He has found cabinet picks who won't restrain him, as some of the establishment officials did back during his first four years in the White House. So he is in a very advantageous position. The question is, can he be more disciplined than he was in his first term? Can he bring more than half the country with him on some of his major policy issues? If as we saw in the past that his volatile personality, his easy taking of grudges gets him off track, that could be much more difficult. And we should also remember that, effectively, although he's going to be very powerful when he takes office, Trump will be a lame duck. He only has four more years in the White House. He can't constitutionally run again. So he has a short-term period, I think maybe a year, a year and a half before the midterm election start to really put his stamp on his second term and to leave a very strong political legacy.",

I mean, obviously, people are concerned. I would be concerned if I look up outside in the evening and I see several drones just kind of hovering over my home. And then you have the federal government saying nothing to see here. Everything is fine. There's no national security threat that we know of.Do you think the federal government, first of all, is doing enough, not only just to reassure the public, but also in terms of trying to get to the bottom of this quickly? D'AMICO:  Well, I think it's, as people in Britain call it, a wind up. I think it started with, first, FAA changed the ability to fly drones at night. They made it easier. Before it wasn't allowed, they have a waiver. They just said 400 feet and below, lights on, and you had to have visual contact with your drone if you were controlling it. That caused more drones to be flown at night. I think as soon as politicians started telling people get out and look for drones, that's where a lot of misidentification started happening. I did it when I first got into the counter drone business. I thought planets, I thought airplanes were drones, and my guys were telling me, no boss, that's a planet, that's a plane. It gets really tough. But then I think as everything started spinning up, more people started flying drones, either looking for drones or trying to add to the chaos. And now, it's just a composite of all that, and the conspiracy theories getting thrown in there are just really making a bad, bad mix up. And I think the government was behind this. I don't -- I think it wasn't on purpose. I think they didn't think it was a big deal. And the more and more media attention that came to this and outrage from folks, I think they're caught behind. And now, they're getting systems up there to at least talk about what they're seeing or what they're doing.",

If you were in this classified briefing, Rob, what would you be asking?D'AMICO:  Well, again, there's certain systems out there around airports, around military bases, that do track drones. Do you have any information from those systems to show what drones are out there and about how many? A lot of the areas in New Jersey are rural that aren't covered by any of these systems. So hopefully, they're putting systems there. But I would start like looking really into, can you tell us how many drones legally are flying? Because most of these are legal. And then, if they start looking at other things, like, can you absolutely tell us that you have no military things going on? And I don't think the military, if they did have something, if it started causing this, I think they'd shut it down immediately. But the biggest thing now is this nuclear warhead, which -- in my former team, the hostage rescue team, one of our missions was nuclear take back. [08:40:00] So we are trained in how to look for nuclear devices or warheads, and this is absolutely not the way, because when you do that, you don't want to cause panic. You do it through vehicles that bring in air and do sensors. You have people walking. You don't need drones to fly around. You can drive, you can use regular manned aircraft that have sensors on them. So you don't need to do this for nuclear devices. But the conspiracy side of it, again, it's going to get fueled by \"This classified briefing.\"",

People are now being told to go out and shoot, or put lasers on them, and that's going to be, with all the misidentification, someone is going to either shoot a manned aircraft or someone is going to shoot at an actual drone and miss it, and that bullet is going to land somewhere and it could hit somebody. So, I think the chaos of that, and that's the last thing you want to do, is shoot at a drone, point a laser at it, because 99 percent of the time, either you're going to miss and that bullet's going to go somewhere, or it's a manned aircraft, and then you're going to have bigger issues.",
