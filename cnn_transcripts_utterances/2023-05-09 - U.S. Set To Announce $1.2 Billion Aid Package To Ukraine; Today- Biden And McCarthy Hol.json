      "sentences": "Yes, best kept secret. Commanders here not saying and troops on the ground don't know. Certainly, you do see a fair amount of movement of military equipment around here but is it more or less than normal and what does it mean? Part of the psychology in the buildup to the counteroffensive is to keep the Russians guessing. They've got a lot of extra troops in the front line.After all, today is the Victory Day parade in Moscow. Nothing more than Putin would like to gain another bit of territory on the ground here that has been so unable to do so far. And a lot of that focus was on Bakhmut, which wasn't far from here, so Ukraine and Russia watching both -- watching each other very, very closely. But I think when you try to analyze when and where that counteroffensive comes, from the Ukrainian perspective they're really going to see what Russia will have done over the past couple of days just before the Victory Day parade when it's so important for Russia -- their next moves -- and then perhaps Ukrainians can take a look -- an assessment. But as long the Russians are guessing what Ukraine's next move is -- as long as they've got lots of troops in the front line stretching their supply lines and sapping troop morale -- those troops not knowing when that counteroffensive is going to come -- that is to the Ukrainians' advantage and they can play that out for as long as they feel it takes to find the best place to attack the Russians. And I think today is kind of one of those many inflection points -- Victory Day parade. Russia wanted to get some gains. It doesn't appear that they've got them on the ground. So the next gameplan is really in Ukraine's hands now. Russia's had its move if you will. And this is how it looks around here. Perhaps an uptick. Aircraft overhead here today, bombs dropping, shelling on the front line. A bit more than normal? Does it make a difference? You know, military keep this all very close to their chest but they're watching, for sure, for that opportunity of when and where to go.",

Chicago winning the draft lottery last night despite having just the third-best odds of 11.5 percent. The Anaheim Ducks, who were the favorite with a 25 1/2 percent chance, ended up falling to second. The Blackhawks have picked first overall just once in franchise history, selecting Patrick Kane back in 2007. This year they're expected to take 17-year-old phenom, Connor Bedard. He just finished up one of the greatest junior hockey seasons of all time scoring 94 goals with 100 assists in just 78 total games played. All right, and finally, dozens of student-athletes at Iowa and Iowa State are under investigation for breaking NCAA rules by gambling on sporting events. It's not known yet if any of the athletes are suspected of betting on games in which they participated. The University of Iowa released a statement saying it is fully cooperating with the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission investigation. CNN has reached out to Iowa State and the NCAA for comment but have not yet heard back. And this comes less than a week after Alabama fired its baseball coach Brad Bohannon following a report of suspicious bets made at an Ohio casino involving his team, Christine. So who knows if these two stories are just the start of something big, but it's not good.

Once again, the White House is in a standoff with House Republicans, trying to force spending cuts before raising it again. The U.S. could default on its obligations as early as June first.Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets finished mixed. The Hang Seng falling more than two percent after data showed China's export growth slowed in April. European markets slightly lower this morning. And on Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour are also leaning down. Markets finished mixed after a pair of Fed surveys showed more lenders have toughened up -- stiffened their standards. The S&amp;P 500 finished higher after coming off its worst week in nearly two months. On earnings watch, Nintendo, Airbnb, and Fox Corp. are all set to report today. On inflation watch, gas prices fell a penny overnight to $3.53 a gallon. All eyes will be on Washington though as President Biden addresses the debt ceiling crisis with party leaders. That happens later this afternoon -- gearing up for this high-profile, high-stakes meeting at the White House to negotiate raising that debt limit. If Biden and McCarthy do not come to an agreement the effects on the U.S. economy and the American people would be brutal. Let's bring in Seema Shah, senior global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors. First thing, Seema, nice to see you. Today is this pivotal meeting at the White House. How do you think this is going to play out in terms of investors and the public? SEEMA SHAH, SENIOR GLOBAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS (via Skype):  Well look, I think the next few weeks are clearly going to be very rocky -- significant volatility for markets. The two sides are so polarized and there's such significant conflict between the two that I don't think you can dismiss the risk of default, but it does seem somewhat unlikely. It's neither sides -- it would not be good -- positive for either side, of course, if there were to be a default. So we do think they'll come to an agreement but you almost need to have more volatility and more pain to come in order to bring them right to that agreement. So I think it's going to be a difficult couple of weeks but we are hopeful, of course, that this will pass without too much concern.",

There's little -- very little demand for that because of the concerns around the debt ceiling. So it is starting to peg through.But as you said, as long the equity market is coming across pretty firm there is very little pressure on Congress to come to some agreement. So you do need almost panic stations to arise in order to push them over that line.",

But I think it goes to show that the impact on market volatility at a time when it is already vulnerable -- it cannot be exaggerated. It is quite a dangerous situation, especially when we think that there is a risk, of course, that the U.S. economy could be approaching a recession.

So as long as the labor market stays so strong it's very unlikely that the Fed will cut interest rates. So it looks strong today but the pressures are growing because of Fed tightening. So as long as the Fed keeps rates on hold at such high levels, the pressures will grow for the U.S. economy. And that is the main reason why many --",
