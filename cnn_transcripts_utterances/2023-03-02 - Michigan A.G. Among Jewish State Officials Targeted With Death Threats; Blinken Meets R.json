This as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets face to face with Moscow's top diplomat for the first time since Russia's invasion. And significant turbulence rocks of flight from Texas. What caused the plane to plunge, terrifying passengers and sending seven to the hospital? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin this hour with a death threats against Jewish elected officials in Michigan. This comes at a very, very dangerous moment following a dramatic rise in anti-semitic attacks across the country, as well as threats to government leaders.

According to the information from the FBI, the charges that are filed there in the -- in Detroit, he is said to have owned a number of weapons, he made threats, saying that he was ready to travel back from Texas to carry out these attacks on Jewish elected officials in the state of Michigan.And a number of things that jumped out to the FBI investigators as they were looking at this, he appeared to have this sovereign citizen ideology, which is something that we've seen in a number of these cases around the country. He claimed that there was a nine mile radius around some Michigan address that he was going to declare as a state of New Israel. He said really just a one of the threats that the FBI cited in the criminal complaint against him, he said, \"I'm heading back to Michigan now threatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan government.\" Again, a very concerning threat, something that we've seen around the country. He's due in court, Wolf, on these charges on Friday.",

Then there's a order of protection in 2023. We know he has a gun registered to him. A girlfriend accused him of stealing a gun from her which was under investigation by the Michigan State Police when these threats came in.

And of course, all of this is turbocharged by the availability of all of these people to easily become heavily armed.

They also say it only took about 10 minutes.However, it seems as though in that -- in those 10 minutes, in that very short period of time, Secretary of State Blinken did make some very important points for the U.S. side, number one, pertaining to Paul Whelan, who the U.S. of course says is wrongfully detained here in Russia. The U.S. side saying that Secretary of State Blinken made clear that there is a serious proposal to try and get Paul Whelan out of Russian custody on the table. And he urged Russia's Foreign Minister to take up that offer and release Paul Whelan. The other one, of course, is the New START Treaty, that the Russians have suspended their participation.

That's clearly our policy. But that doesn't mean that we're going to give them everything. And actually, F-16s are actually a really smart place to draw the line, in my opinion, because it's not really what the Ukrainians need. They're going to ask for the world. Of course, they're going to ask, they're going to ask for everything that they can get, I would too, if I were in their position, but what they really need right now are more tanks, artillery ammunition, small arms ammunition, the things that you need on the ground to take back territory from the Russians, a few fancy fighter jets are not going to win this war.",

There is a fringe group of Republicans represented by some extremists like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who want to cut off support for Ukraine, but it really is a fringe group of extremists. The risk, the danger, is that, you know, people like Fox News personality Tucker Carlson are taking their rhetoric and getting more Americans behind this fringe group of Republicans. And so, Republicans throughout the caucus are feeling pressure from their constituents. But when they talk to me, they're fully supportive of this. We need to win this war, we need to send a message to Putin that he's not going to go any further than this.

I think they were taken aback by the invasion.But of course, they do see the U.S. as a common enemy. What we need to do is keep them on the right side of history. You know, Xi Jinping thinks that China is going to be a world superpower, I disagree with him. But if he wants to be a world superpower, that he has to do the right thing, he has to set an example for other nations. And that means following the rule of law. He doesn't want to be in a club of autocrats and dictators, essentially war criminals like Vladimir Putin, who are losing their war.

AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: What I think, Wolf, that -- what I think was the most important argument that defense made is, look, if he was trying -- Alex was trying to distract from anything, whether it was his financial issues, whether it was the allegations of financial crimes, he would have done what he subsequently tried to do, which was to have someone try to kill him so that his son Buster could recover insurance proceeds. I think that's a very powerful argument for any jurors sitting there having a hard time believing that this man is so monstrous that he would kill his wife and his son. Here's an alternative theory, yes, he may have done something crazy, but that crazy was to try to kill himself, hire a hitman who turned out to be like a distant cousin to try to kill himself rather than kill the people that he loved the most.

So, powerful arguments by both the prosecutor. But I think, again, the defendant gave those jurors that don't want to find, you know, Paul -- Alex guilty, they gave them an alternative. And this alternative is, yes, he may be a bad person, he may be a liar, he may be a drug user, but look what he did to himself.

      "sentences": "Yes, this is a very serious one because the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, has pointed to the house ethics investigation that hasn't been long expected is something that he would look at if they were to find something that could be untoward or very damaging, that potentially this could spell the end of George Santos's career in the House. Now there is still some time about how this will have to play out. They just announced today opening an investigation which appears to be a rather sweeping one with a pretty wide scope looking at everything from alleged unlawful activity with respect to his 2022 congressional campaign failing to properly disclose required information with the House, as well as looking for alleged federal conflict of interest in connection with a role with a firm that provided fiduciary services, as well as engaging in sexual misconduct with someone who had sought employment at his office, though he has denied some of those allegations, a lot of which he denied as well. But this committee was a bipartisan one and voted to open this investigation.And if it were to find something that potentially Republican leadership could not live with that, then we could we could possibly see the House move forward with any action to remove him from office. And so all along, George Santos has said he will not resign. He said he has been elected by 142,000 voters in his district. But to expel him would require two thirds of the House to do just that. Republican leadership is not there. But can this ethics investigation changed their approach to him? That's what we'll see in the weeks and months ahead, Wolf.",

So, sure he should be.I think what Manu got out there that is so important is the scope of what has been put forth of what is being investigated. That alone should give him pause. Now, we've seen for months now, George Santos seems almost impervious to public pressure around any kind of decision to abandon his post or leave the House, Wolf. We have seen in the past other members do face mounting pressure when they are in the midst of an ethics probe that may cause them to make different decisions about their future. We don't know if Santos will choose that or not. But when this is wrapped up, and we learn more about what the ethics investigation finds, perhaps, then I do think as Manu noted, there's going to be a lot of pressure on Kevin McCarthy on whether or not that requires additional action.",

This year, it is an entirely different field. There's no leadership of the Republican Party here. Unlike years before, there are no Senate Republican leaders here, no House Republican leaders as well, but it is the presidential candidates so different.This essentially has become the Trump show. You walk through the hallways here, so much paraphernalia and other supporters of former President Donald Trump. While other presidential candidates, other Republican hopefuls are actually going to Florida this weekend, skipping this annual CPAC conference as it's known to speak at a Club for Growth conference, the Club for Growth, of course, a very influential anti-Tax Group here in Washington. They decided to host a competing event that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, and several other leading Republican governors and others are appearing out. So, Wolf, in a nutshell what it shows us, there's a simply as a dividing line in the Republican Party, Donald Trump at the middle of that between those who want to send him back to office and those who are looking for a fresh start. So, unusual compared to many years here. There is a pretty empty crowd and a shortlist of speakers going into this weekend, Wolf.",
