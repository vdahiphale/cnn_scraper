But, of course, we know that they are sustaining heavy losses in these infantry -- wave after wave of infantry tactics that we're seeing the east do potentially mean that they will have to replenish their forces, not to mention perhaps ramp up their numbers in Ukraine if they are planning a spring offensive as Ukraine has consistently been warning.But as for the comment that you had from the deputy head of the defense intelligence in Ukraine, he says they're expecting not only another wave of mobilization but a bigger one than before -- between 300,000 and 500,000 men. He said this would be part of what they expect to be that spring offensive on the front lines in the east, in particular, and perhaps in the Zaporizhzhia region in the south as well. Look, Russia has not announced this yet. It is clearly very risky for Russia to do this. You saw the public opposition last time -- that exodus of fighting-age men. And conversely it is also, by the way, in Ukraine's interest to talk about it because it would be widely interpreted as a sign of weakness if Russia was to do this again, Christine.",
