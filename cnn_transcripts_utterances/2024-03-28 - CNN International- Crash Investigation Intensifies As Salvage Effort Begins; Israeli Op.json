Thank you.Well, when it comes to those victims, the men who lost their lives in the collapse, CNN's Maria Santana has been speaking with some of their families, and she joins me now. What are you hearing, Maria, from their families, from their relatives? MARIA SANTANA, CNN EN ESPANOL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Hi, Erica. Well, for so many of them, this is such a heartbreaking moment. Up until yesterday, I spoke with family members that were just clinging into hope, hoping for a miracle, even after hearing from authorities that their loved ones were presumed dead. Dorlian Castillo Cabrera, 26-year-old from Guatemala, was one of the men have recovered yesterday. He did not have any children. But, we did speak with family members who told us that he had been working for Browner Builders for about three years and he loved his job, and that a part of his dream why he moved to the United States was so that he could help his mother. Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, a 35-year-old from Mexico, was the other victim. That was recovered from the waters. We do not have that much information about him. Mexican authorities have said that these families, there have been two Mexican nationals that were killed in this incident, but their families have asked for privacy and that they are respecting those wishes. For these families, this might offer a moment of closure, but for four others, just more uncertainty as these recovery efforts have been paused. Miguel Luna is a man from El Salvador. He has three children and three stepchildren, we are told by his family members. He had been living for 19 years in Baltimore, just an integral part of this community. We also spoke with the brother of Maynor Suazo Sandoval from Honduras, and he told me that his brother was just such a friendly, lovable, joyous person, and that his dream was to continue building businesses. He had already established businesses in Honduras and here in the United States while he worked for this construction company. But, right now, their main focus is the recovery. And this is what he told me about why it is so important for these families to be able to get their loved ones back. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARLOS SUAZO SANDOVAL, BROTHER OF MAYNOR SUAZO SANDOVAL, &amp; BROTHER OF BRIDGE COLLAPSE VICTIM (Interpreted): They have found cars, but they have not yet moved any cars because there is a lot of steel framework, and they must be careful because they are human beings. Even if lifeless, we, the family members, need them to rescue the bodies at least to see them and have him handed over to my family, his entire family. He was the breadwinner for his children right now. God is going to provide for us too. So, we can get together as a family and see how we can help each other, because at this moment, his wife is left with his girl and everything. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we heard a spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister say that they could -- if Hezbollah continues to target Israeli forces and civilians, that Israel can copy and paste Gaza on to Lebanon. So, we're talking about a possible repeat of what Israel is doing in Gaza, in Lebanon.Now, the United States, France and other countries have been trying to de-escalate, sort of lessen tensions between Lebanon and Israel. But, it appears that that's not working very well either. Now, it's important to keep in mind that Hezbollah is much better trained, much better armed, more disciplined, and more experienced than Hamas in terms of fighting the Israeli military on the ground. So, a war between Lebanon and Israel would certainly be catastrophic for all parties concerned. Erica.",

Thank you.We are also monitoring Manhattan federal court. That's where former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried will learn pretty soon just how much time he will spend in prison. The FTX founder was convicted in November, of course, on fraud and conspiracy charges for his role in the collapse of the company he founded. If the prosecution gets its way, he could potentially spend the rest of his life in prison. Sentencing set to begin, that hearing rather is set to begin in just over an hour. CNN's Kara Scannell is live in New York this morning with more. So, prosecutors are asking for 40 to 50 years. We know Sam Bankman-Fried's attorneys clearly do not want to see him behind bars for quite that long. What are we expecting? What is the thinking this morning, Kara?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, a lot at stake, obviously, this morning for Sam Bankman-Fried. Prosecutors are looking for 40 to 50 years in prison. Their reasoning is they say that Bankman-Fried had stolen more than $10 billion from investors and customers of FTX, and from lenders of its sister hedge fund Alameda Research. They also -- he went to trial in the fall, and they also in that trial put forward evidence when he paid more than $150 million in bribes to Chinese officials and made more than $100 million in illegal political campaign donations. They say that he has been motivated by, they said, unmatched greed and hubris, and they say his lack of remorse is galling.So, they are asking the judge to sentence him to 40 to 50 years, saying he has orchestrated one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history and the biggest ones since Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Now, Bankman-Fried's lawyers are saying they don't think he should serve more than six and a half years in prison, calling the decades-long recommended sentences barbaric, and saying that Bankman-Fried was not out to enrich himself. And they also point to the bankruptcy recovery efforts where one of the bankruptcy officials has said that they expect that investors will get back about 100 cents on the dollar. So, they're saying that people actually didn't lose that much money. Of course, prosecutors can test that. Big thing to look forward today will be if Bankman-Fried addresses the judge. If he acts contrite, they are going to appeal the conviction. But, what he says to the judge about his motivations or a state of mind will be something the judge will take under consideration. And Bankman-Fried's attorneys have submitted dozens of letters of support from people that have known Bankman-Fried. At the same time, prosecutors have put forward dozens of letters from victims, and it's possible we will hear from at least one victim today who will address the judge. Certainly, a lot at stake for Bankman-Fried. He has been remanded in federal custody since August when the judge revoked his bail, finding he had engaged in witness tampering while he was out on bail. So, he will not see daylight. It's just a question now of how many years that will be. Erica.",

Bankman-Fried was convicted in November of stealing more than $8 billion, and engaging his employees in a cover- up. He is facing decades in prison.Sara Fischer is CNN's Media Analyst, and Senior Media Reporter for Axios, and joins us live this morning. Sara, good to see you. So, if we take a step back here, there are a number of things that will be considered at today's sentencing hearing, including the impact that Sam Bankman-Fried had. There are a number of people who say they were defrauded. Walk us through what that will include. SARA FISCHER, CNN MEDIA ANALYST, &amp; SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS: Well, the number one thing here, of course, is damages. So, those -- about $10 billion of funds that have gone missing from FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange that SBF has been accused of funneling that money in to take some risky bets. Now, the key here, Erica, is thinking about historical comparisons. If you think about Bernie Madoff, that was a $20 billion Ponzi scheme, and he got 150 years in prison. The difference, though, is that a lot of lawyers think that we're going to be able to get that money back, those $10 billion of customer funds to those customers. And so, that's a big case that the defense is going to make. Yes, this was a very, very exploitive nature, but the people getting their money back might make it not as bad. Now, the prosecution wants 50, 60 years. Defense is arguing five or six. Obviously, you will expect it to be somewhere in the middle.",

And so, I think the age factor is not going to play very well for the defense.The other issue on the good person front, Erica, is that typically when you are in a situation like this, your pretrial behavior has a huge impact on what happens to you during sentencing. And his pretrial behavior was not great. But, recall, he was doing tons of press, appearing on all these stages, dodging questions.

And really, it marks a unique moment in presidential politics, as you have three Democratic presidents teaming up around the goal of trying to defeat a former President, Donald Trump. Now, the campaign this morning announced that this fundraiser has already brought in more than $25 million for this night alone. That's with the people attending in person as well as online donations. And it comes as you have really seen Biden with his cash advantage against Trump heading into the general election.If you take a look at Biden's fundraising, he raised $53 million in the month of February alone. This $25 million is nearly half that. And he goes into -- he has come into the month with about $71 million and his campaign coffers is even higher than that when you consider all the Democratic accounts. Compare that to former President Trump, who currently has about $33.5 million. So, really, this fundraiser is just another step in the campaigns as they are trying to build their operations to take on Trump. Now, as you noted, there are some star-studded attendees who will be there, Queen Latifah, Lizzo, Ben Platt, all among the musical guests expected to perform. Stephen Colbert will moderate the discussion between the three presidents, really giving some insight into how they are viewing this campaign as they're preparing for that matchup against Trump in November.",

This is just the tip of the iceberg.COREN (voice-over): But, the burnings, beheadings, and indiscriminate artillery and airstrikes are doing anything but stamping out the resistance. Rebel fighter Yaw Lay (ph), who fought alongside Phoe Tay and Thar Htaung that fateful morning, says what happened to his friends has only strengthened their resolve. Hey, brother, raise your three fingers, he jokes, mocking the salute symbolic of the country's resistance movement. No more three fingers, yells one of them and laughs. He moves on to another group of pro- junta militia resting in the shade. Revolution, he cries. It's bullshit, they respond. Moments later, the man filming asks a soldier wearing a military junta uniform of a PDF, a reference to the opposition People's Defense Forces. Yes, he replies. This brief exchange caught on camera is about two rebel fighters they had just captured a few hours earlier. Before dawn, on the 7th of November last year, rebels, part of the PDF, staged an attack on the pro-junta militia stronghold in the village of Myauk Khin Yan, Gangaw, in Magway Division. But instead, the rebels were ambushed coming under heavy fire. Platoon Commander Ninja says as they tried to retreat in open fields, several of his fighters were injured while others were cut off from the group, including 21-year-old Phoe Tay and 20-year-old Thar Htaung (ph). NINJA, YDF FIGHTER (Interpreted): The last time I saw them, they were hunkering down about 50 meters away from me. COREN (voice-over): A few hours later, Ninja's Platoon received a message from a villager saying two of their rebel fighters had been caught alive. Video obtained by CNN shows the two young men bound and bloodied, relentlessly taunted by the militia. The revolution must lose. PDFs are dogs, replies Phoe Tay. How many dogs have we killed? Aren't you PDF dogs? We're dogs, repeats Thar Htaung. The video then shows them being dragged on the ground, their arms and legs hogtied in chains. The next clip, too graphic to show in full, reveals the young men hanging in chains from the branch of a large tree over a fire, being burnt alive. Their screams heard over cheers from the militia as the prisoners writhed in agony as flames cede their flesh. An eyewitness to the execution told us the militia had ordered one person from each house to watch. VOICE OF ZAW ZAW (Interpreted): When I got there, they hanged them on the tree and poured gasoline and diesel on their bodies. The rebels were moving and screaming and said they apologized. But the militia replied \"apologize in your next life.\" COREN (voice-over): Cross referencing more than a dozen interviews with witnesses, villagers, resistance fighters, family members, and experts with analysis of the video and pictures from the day using open-source techniques, CNN has found evidence that the military and its allied militia were responsible for the killings. The junta denies the claim, stating the video was fabricated. However, they do admit an attack took place that day and that its troops were stationed in the village. CNN spoke to both fathers who confirmed their sons had been killed. They said they encouraged their boys to join the revolution and fight, but to die like this will haunt them forever. VOICE OF MYINT ZAW, FATHER OF PHOE TAY (Interpreted): I got a chance to watch the video, but I could not finish it. I stopped because I knew it was going to break my heart. COREN (voice-over): The brutality of this execution, however, is not a one-off case. Since the military junta staged a coup in 2021, the level of depravity among its soldiers and aligned militia has increased in response to the mass losses and defections it's suffering on the battlefield. The junta's recent announcement of compulsory conscription, a clear sign it is facing enormous pressure. As fighting engulfs two-thirds of the country, experts believe the military is using fear and intimidation to try and control a defiant population.",

That's according to a study in the journal Nature, which found that meltwater is actually draining away from the poles toward the equator, and all that extra mass is basically tapping the brakes on the spin of the Earth, which could force scientists to subtract a leap second in likely the year 2028. Leap seconds are used when atomic clocks and the earth rotation are out of sync by about a second. Some fear that leap seconds could actually wreak havoc on computers. Remember all the concerns over Y2K? Now, while it was a dud with negligible impact, the concern certainly was not. So, we'll continue to watch that.Meantime, Germany's Kennel Club is warning the future of the dogs and one of the country's most popular dog breeds could be in jeopardy. Maybe you know them as sausage dogs or hot dog dogs here in the U.S. German lawmakers are now considering a bill that would target so- called torture breeding of these pups.
