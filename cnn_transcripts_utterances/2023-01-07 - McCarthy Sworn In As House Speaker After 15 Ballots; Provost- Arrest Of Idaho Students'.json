That's a key committee. Most of the public doesn't understand what goes on in that committee. But that's essential. Gave those folks a seat at that table. That's a big mistake. There are other mistakes that they've made here too, as I was pointed out, the motion to vacate the chair. You know, it just empowered these guys, you know, for example, OK, I love the idea of passing appropriations bills individually, and the House should do that. The problem you have is the United States Senate. They don't pass bills individually, and you will end up with yet another omnibus. So, while Speaker McCarthy made those concessions. It's almost as if they pretended the United States Senate doesn't exist. I have heard suggestions that they were going to cap defense spending. Well, hello. You know, there the Armed Services Committee, there the Appropriations Committee at the Senate. They're all going to have a say on this matter. How can that -- how can those types of concessions be made to a group now of this chaos caucus? I mean, it's almost as if it's easier, it's almost better to be an opponent to the Speaker than to be an ally, because look what these guys have extracted out of him.

Security on campus will remain heightened as classes resume Wednesday.Bryan Kohberger is the only suspect in the killings of four students in their off campus home on November 13th. Kohberger has been charged with four counts of first degree murder and one count of felony burglary. He was arrested in his parents' Pennsylvania home on December 30th. Now, court documents are giving us some insight into the investigation, leading up to his arrest. And an affidavit shows police found DNA on a knife sheath at the crime scene. A roommate described a masked figure with bushy eyebrows and phone records show the suspect was near the victim's home at least a dozen times before the killings. And surveillance video recorded a white sedan. Police found a white sedan at nearby Washington State University. But look, there are still questions about what motivated the killings and why these victims were targeted. Joining us now to discuss is retired FBI special agent, Jennifer Coffindaffer.

And they say that they will continue to observe this ceasefire for the rest of Christmas Day here in Ukraine, regardless of what the Ukrainians do. But the reality is that Ukrainians never agreed to this ceasefire in the first place. So, they have carried on business as usual. Case in point, the Russians say that they managed to shoot down a Ukrainian drone over Crimea where -- whereas, the Ukrainian say that they've taken plenty of incoming across the front line, including particularly heavy fighting in Bakhmut, where some of the really most serious battles are taking place in this war right now. And there are dead and wounded, according to the Ukrainians. As I mentioned, it is also Christmas day in the country today in the Orthodox faith. [07:50:00] And so, we went to one of the most famous Orthodox churches in Ukraine today for Christmas mass. And this was a church that was formerly being used by a branch of the Orthodox faith that formerly had links to the Orthodox Church of Russia. But since the war began, the Ukrainian government has put some of the leadership of that branch of the Orthodox faith under investigation, alleging that they are still under the influence of the Russian church. And so, as a result, they are no longer the tenants of that very famous church. Instead, it's been handed over to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. And so, mass was celebrated inside that church in Ukrainian for the first time in a very long time. And people traveled from across the country to be there to mark this historic occasion. And people told me that look, this year, in particular, Christmas is very important, given the war -- given how difficult things have been over the past year, and they need to pray now, perhaps more than ever.

LIEBERMANN (voice over): And in this case, it applies not only to the birthing parent, but also the non-birthing parent. Up until now, the birthing parent got six weeks off, and the non-birthing parent didn't get any time off. Instead, now both will get 12 weeks of parental leave. So, three months in order to plan and begin a life with an extended family. And crucially, this applies not only to a birth, but also an adoption and to long-term foster care. So, the military is trying to offer flexibility in this case. LIEBERMANN (on camera): The military also says these 12 weeks don't have to be taken all at once. And it can be broken up with additional leave or other kinds of leaves. So, there is flexibility in here intended to allow for family planning, and that's why this is so crucial. LIEBERMANN (voice over): Family Planning is one of the most often cited frustration for military families about what military life is like. And this is intended to address that. To give families first more time off after a family expansion, but also -- expansion, but also more flexibility and what they can do with that time. We saw earlier this year the army takes some steps to try to address similar issues. LIEBERMANN (on camera): At the time, General McConville, the chief of staff of the Army said, we recruit soldiers, but we retain families. This is that same idea to address the needs of families in the military by giving both parents three months off after the family is expanded. Alex and Amara?",

Hi, Andy.ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR (on camera): Yes, good morning, guys. So, you know, there is never been a conference championship game played at a neutral site like the Super Bowl is every year. But there is a good chance that, that is actually going to happen this year in the AFC. So, with the NFL making the Bills-Bengals game a no contest. That means Buffalo and Cincinnati are going to have one less game in the standings. SCHOLES (voice over): So, seating will now be based on win percentage. And if the Chiefs beat the Raiders today, they are going to be the one seed in the AFC, and get the buy in the first round of the playoffs. But yesterday, the NFL owners, they approved scenarios to help fix potential competitive inequities since the Bills or Bengals could have gotten that one seed before their game was canceled. So, the big news is the AFC title game is going to be held in a neutral site if one of these three scenarios happen. If the Chiefs and Bills both win this weekend, a Buffalo vs. Kansas City championship game would be at a neutral site. If they both lose and the Ravens win, again, a Buffalo versus KC game would be at a neutral site. Or if they both lose and the Bengals win, then, a Buffalo or Cincinnati versus Kansas City championship game would be at that neutral site. Now, also because they're playing one less game, you all, the Bengals are already AFC North Division champions based on win percentage. But if the Ravens beat them on Sunday, and the two teams playing the wild card round, they're going to have a coin toss actually to decide where that game is, Cincinnati or Baltimore. SCHOLES (on camera): Bengals coach, Zac Taylor, he actually criticized the changes, saying, you know, it felt like they've benefited everyone, except for Cincinnati. Well, of course, wait and see if any of these scenarios come to fruition. According to multiple reports out of Indianapolis, they actually turned down hosting a potential AFC title game because they have a volleyball tournament in town that weekend. Guys, Atlanta has been thrown out as another possibility, but we'll wait and see if that happens. It almost be like a mini Super Bowl, having an AFC title game in a different city because you'd have fan bases traveling in. And, you know, it would be -- it would be pretty neat if that had to happen, of course. I'm sure those fan bases would have loved to have the game at home.",
