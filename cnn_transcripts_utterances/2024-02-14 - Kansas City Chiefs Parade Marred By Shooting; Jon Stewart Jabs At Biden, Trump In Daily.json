Because of something that has become increasingly a common occurrence here in this country. No other country has the problem that we have when it comes to gun violence in this country. It's happened again. This time, a joyful gathering ended with shots fired and people fleeing for their lives, frantically calling loved ones.

But their inaction is costing people their children, their wives, their husbands, their -- and, you know, this thing day, I -- not to touch a sensitive point with Charles, but I went to six parades in Chicago when the Bulls won the championships. I went to the Cubs championship. And it was always such a wonderful day because the entire community would come together, people of different races and backgrounds, rich people, poor people, all because this was a community celebration. And you bring your kids. And to have that disrupted -- obviously, the worst are these school shootings, because you send your precious children to school and you expect them to come home, and those are the worst.

It's not like if you don't talk about it, they're not thinking it. They're thinking it. So, what do you do about it is the real question. And I think more than anything else, if I could climb into Jon Stewart's head, what he's saying is do something about it.
