We begin this hour with news that the Florida Republican Party has scrapped its own loyalty oath requiring candidates to pledge support for the party's eventual nominee. It's a promise frontrunner and former President Donald Trump has flatly refused to make all along and this move by the Florida GOP is seen as a major defeat for Trump's closest rival in his home state, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and a big win it is viewed as for Donald Trump. Meanwhile, as Trump's legal woes continue to pile up, federal prosecutors have now asked Judge Tanya Chutkan to place a limited gag order on the former president. They want to prohibit Trump from continuing this \"disparaging and inflammatory or intimidating attacks\" on people involved in his federal election interference case, that includes the special counsel, Jack Smith. Yet, Trump still leads the Republican pack, up by more than 40 percentage points in the latest CNN Poll of Polls. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is on the campaign trail in Iowa. Jeff, we're about four months from the Iowa caucuses. The race is on. You're at a key event tonight in Des Moines. What do you think we're going to hear tonight?",

But the candidates have been campaigning throughout Iowa throughout the day and the weekend, everyone except, of course, former President Donald Trump. He has largely been campaigning in a far less robust way than he did before.But the other candidates are trying to make their case trying to find that opening, and when you talk to Republican voters here, Jim, there is indeed a large amount of open minds really to a person. We've been speaking with that throughout the day, a lot of open minds that people of course like the policies of the former president, but also many want to turn the page. But former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley was addressing a couple different events earlier today. One key theme came out, that is age. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What has Congress done for you lately? Nothing. It is why we have to have term limits in Washington, DC. They don't know when to leave and it is time for them to be gently pushed out. Right? And there is a second reason why I think we need to have mental competency tests for anyone over the age of 75.

However, I do understand, there are many Republicans who have concerns if the former president were to be convicted of a crime, then that brings a whole new ballgame. But look, the position of many Republicans not just in Florida, but across the country is whoever is the party's nominee, it is incumbent upon Republicans to coalesce and unite behind that person to take on whoever the Democrats put forth, because that's the whole purpose of the party: It is to unite on the issues that bring us together and not the personalities that divide us.",

But I do think it's an opportunity to underscore just how dangeroussomebody like Donald Trump is, in whatever role even as -- even in a role of somebody who's been convicted of, frankly, or has been accused and possibly convicted of several crimes. The fact that Jack Smith asked for this even just a limited gag order, I think, is the realization that Donald Trump is somebody who is a danger to our whole justice system. We've already seen how he and then his supporters can ruin people's lives. Just from one thing that Donald Trump says about something, the prosecutor, witnesses I think, is what they're mostly worried about, it is a downhill battle from there.

And for any of the Republicans in the House to basically hold hostage these important budget talks for promises of furthering this impeachment probe is completely wrong. Look, I'm a firm believer that members in Washington can walk and chew gum at the same time. But we're running up against a spending deadline that needs to be the first priority, and they can further move on with the inquiry into President Biden.

That basically is an admission that they paid a ransom.MGM, though, on the other hand, did not appear to pay the ransom and we're seeing these widespread outages in MGM, not in Caesars. But it's ironic here that when these - for Caesars, paying the ransom is a gamble, right? Because you pay the ransom and you gain access to your systems, right? Well, one, it's not clear that the hackers will actually do what they claim they will do if you pay them the ransom. Two, there could be legal liability. It's not illegal to pay a ransom, but it is if it is a sanctioned group. For example, say it's North Korea.  But the last point is that once you pay a ransom, you put a target on your back as a company who is willing to pay a ransom, right? Other hackers take note.
