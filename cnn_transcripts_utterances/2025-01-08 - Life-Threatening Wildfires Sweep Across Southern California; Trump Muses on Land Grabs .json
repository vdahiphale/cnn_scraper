Pay attention to the legend at the top portion of my screen, and you can see how they drop in numbers. But then the cycle repeats itself overnight tonight and into the day tomorrow. We expect this extreme fire behavior to continue, at least for the next 24 hours. Maybe that brief window in time during the course of the daylight hours today. But the strongest winds, again, occurring overnight because of just the sheer nature of how Santa Ana winds work and operate here in Southern California, driving up and over those mountain tops, funneling through the valleys and the sides of these mountains, almost creating this wind tunnel effect. Remember, when it gets squeezed, wind between these canyons, that's when the wind accelerates even further. And so, when we have those peak winds this morning, that is where we anticipate the most erratic and most intense and most dangerous part of this ongoing wildfire situation in L.A. County.",

You know, I've been following this like everyone else, but we're hearing, unfortunately, the same things that we've heard over the last several years. This is apocalyptic. We've never seen fire behavior like this. It's moved so fast. And the wind is so powerful. It's all the things that you've already been talking about. I thought one of the telling pieces of video were the abandoned vehicles. That tells you that people felt so imperiled that they exited their vehicles because of a traffic jam and ran. We saw similar things in the Paradise Fire several years ago. The difference was many of those vehicles were burned over before they were even able to push them out of the way. But this really looks almost like the Lahaina Maui fire. It started as a brush fire. It's moved into the interface area and into neighborhoods, and it is really wind-driven.",

Don't have a number, don't -- don't know the severity.You're going to get that information probably later today when the fire department and the incident command gives an overview. As far as firefighter injuries, we're seeing the very typical things -- strains, sprains, eye injuries, smoke inhalation. The other piece of this that I think is really important, if you don't live in the area, don't go sightseeing. And the smoke is a toxic soup. It's not just the brush that's burning, but homes are burning. And homes contain plastics that are built from petrochemical compounds. And the firefighters right now, not only the exposure to the wind and the flames and the heat, but the respiratory exposure is incredible. And if you do not have to be in that area and breathe that environment in, don't. It's dangerous.",

But rather, they have had to focus on life-saving missions. What insight can you give us into how firefighters think about this kind of a weather pattern, and what that means they have to do now, and when they may be able to change that mission? RICE: They're watching what's in front of them and finding opportunities, and they may be little -- to make a little save here and there. But right now, their primary mission are moving the citizens, the civilians, and the residents out of harm's way. That is the most important thing that they're doing. They will find places where they can begin to make a stand. But it's going -- it's going to be small. Their main focus right now is saving life and getting people to safe harbor.",

And we can't.And right now, the firefighters on the line, these men and women, are going to put in 24-, 36-, 40-, 48-hour shifts. They're not going off the fire line anytime soon. And that -- that's just the way it is. Everyone is at the mercy of the wind right now. And until we see a shift in the wind or a drop in the wind, it's -- it's just not going to -- it's not going to let up a couple of interesting things. The governor's Office of Emergency Services pre-positioned 65 engines and over 120 personnel throughout L.A., Orange, San Bernardino and Ventura County prior to the fires. CAL FIRE pre-positioned 45 additional engines and six hand crews. So, the wind event was anticipated, and resources were moved in. But when you have weather like this, with sustained winds, you know, over 40 miles an hour -- 40, 50 miles an hour -- gusts that are reported into the 60s, 70s and 80s, you're not going to control that. You're going to get people out of harm's way and find your opportunity to begin to bring control to that situation. But it's -- it's going to be a little bit of time right now. And the daylight hours, and the reports for today, and the weather reports for today, and what's observed are going to be critically important.",
