A third U.S. president will be entering center stage, along with the potential next U.S. vice president facing the biggest test of his political career.Hello and welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper here once again at the Democratic National Convention where all eyes in this massive arena and around the country will soon be on Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. Just appeared here for a walk-through before he formally accepts the vice presidential nomination later tonight, in front of an adoring and roaring crowd of delegates. Governor Walz will be introducing himself to much of the nation after being propelled to the national spotlight, just a little over two weeks ago. Walz, a former assistant high school football coach and teacher and national guardsmen and six term U.S. congressman is facing some scrutiny over missteps, gaffes, and exaggerations about his life story, particularly his service, which Republican veterans in Congress today are accusing him of, quote, lying about. More on that in a second. We'll see if Governor Walz addresses any of that tonight. The campaign says a governor will be highlighting values instilled from his upbringing in Nebraska and will say how those roots its helped shape his service in the Minnesota national guard, which he enlisted at the age of 17 and served honorably in the national guard for 24 years. We are also hearing former football players coached by Walz will be on hand tonight, as his name is entered into nomination. While his star rises in the Democratic Party, people are still talking about the return of the Obamas. Last night, they declared hope is making a comeback. And they brought the house down while ripping in to Republican nominee Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's such a critical speech, with so many people watching. What do you believe he needs to do on that stage tonight? SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): I think people will realize that he's such a great guy. I've known Tim since around 2007. My wife, Gabby Giffords, and Tim, they were freshmen together in the U.S. House. So they got sworn in together. So, I've known him for a while. He's a patriot. He served in the Army National Guard for 24 years. He was a teacher, a coach, in the House of Representatives for 12 years, and then serve two terms as governor. And he's just a really great person.
