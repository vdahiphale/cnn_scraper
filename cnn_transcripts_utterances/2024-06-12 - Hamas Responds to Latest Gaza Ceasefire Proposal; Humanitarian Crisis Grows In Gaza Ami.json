Sources say that in that response the militant group is asking for a timeline on when all Israeli forces withdraw from Gaza and a permanent end to the fighting comes into effect, both possible deal breakers for Israel. Hamas officials say a negotiated agreement on a ceasefire is still possible, but there have been mixed signals as well from Israel, which appeared ready to formally accept the plan, but at the same time maintaining the right to continue on with military operations in Gaza.U.S. Secretary said Antony Blinken remains in the region. On Tuesday, he again said the only obstacle to a ceasefire is Hamas. And Blinken called out the senior leader of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, as having the power to end this war and the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza, or allow the war to continue. According to U.S. intelligence, Sinwar believes, Hamas has the upper hand in negotiations right now with the Israelis. CNN's has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY REPORTER (voice-over): A high stakes life and death waiting game heats up in the Middle East. Hamas has responded to the latest ceasefire proposal from Israel, but more talks are now expected as an effort to set peace into motion.",

That's what we're waiting on.ATWOOD (voice-over): Secretary of state Antony Blinken, who's traveling in the region, said that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to the current deal on the table that was detailed in his speech 11 days ago by president Biden. The pressure now increasingly on one man alone who started this war and could end it, Yahya Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas. Sinwar helped mastermind the horrific October 7th attacks and is suspected to be hiding out in the tunnels under Gaza. Exactly where is unknown. A fresh report out today from The Wall Street Journal details messages between Sinwar and Hamas officials participating in the ceasefire talks in Doha. The exchanges show that the terrorist leader thinks he may have the upper hand in the current negotiations. Quote, \"We have the Israelis right where we want them,\" Sinwar allegedly said in recent messages. These stunning messages, which CNN cannot independently verify, reveal his frame of mind as his war drags into its 9th month. With the Palestinian death toll climbing, Sinwar wrote, quote, \"These are necessary sacrifices.\" And this is why U.S. officials believe Sinwar has had little incentive to broker a deal. Not only will Israel refuse to stop fighting, but the pressure will continue to mount on Israel daily, which Sinwar believes is to his benefit. The Israeli military responded to these messages saying, quote, \"Hamas leaders don't care about Gazans. How many times do they have to say it for themselves before the world believes them?\" And as Blinken continues to push for a deal that could eventually end the war, he took aim at Sinwar. BLINKEN: Are they looking after one guy who may be, for now, safe, buried, I don't know, 10 stories underground somewhere in Gaza, while the people that he purports to represent continue to suffer in a crossfire of his own making? Or will he do what's necessary to actually move this to a better place? ATWOOD (voice-over): Kylie Atwood, CNN Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Again, they only pointed to a cease fire.I was speaking to doctors who were without bandages, anesthetics, the most basic. Obviously, you know, we are talking now, John, about a handful of hospitals in the Gaza Strip that are partially functioning. A handful from what was 36. This has been a systematic devastation of a health system. It has -- we have to go beyond all the words that are shared around the world, and we have to look at evidence on the ground. Evidence on the ground is devastation of homes, of livelihoods, of agriculture, of the economy, of education, of learning, and very much of hospitals. So as soon as there is a ceasefire, we will remain in a crisis for these children. But whilst we're not there, children go to bed at night, there are bombs at night. They wake in the morning. They maybe get one meal a day. Hospitals were overcrowded. And I know we've been talking about this for 8 months, John, and I know a lot of people want to turn off. They have to understand the average child, mother, father, grandparent, they cannot turn off in Gaza. So we do finally need those with power to do, as they say, finally, the right thing.",

U.S. is pushing fellow G7 members who are in agreement to provide $50 billion in loans to Ukraine, using profits from frozen Russian assets. The three Russian warships and a nuclear powered submarine en route to Cuba for drills have been spotted by the U.S. Navy less than 50 kilometers off the coast of Florida. The Russian Navy's newest frigate capable of launching hypersonic missiles is part of this Atlantic show of force by Vladimir Putin, and it comes just days after he threatened to supply high-tech weapons to enemies of NATO amid heightened tensions over Ukraine. Our man in Moscow is Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These are the first images of the Russian flotilla steaming towards Cuba, just 90 miles off the U.S. coast. The Russian Defense Ministry says the strike group, including a nuclear powered submarine, the Kazan, armed with modern Kalibr cruise missiles, is practicing the use of high precision weapons, but it's really about Putin flexing his muscles on the international stage. Led by the flagship of Russia's northern fleet, the Admiral Gorshkov, which Russia's defense ministry says is normally equipped with latest Zircon hypersonic missiles. This is meant to deliver a powerful message to Washington. Russian state television has been celebrating the naval deployment, placing some of Russia's most powerful vessels in Cuban waters. The American media has been discussing the event, reports the Russian news anchor, claiming the Pentagon has no idea where our submarine is positioned. In fact, U.S. officials are downplaying any threat that Moscow has been signaling displeasure that Washington recently greenlighting Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory with US supplied weapons. Speaking ahead of the Cuba naval visit, Vladimir Putin warned of a possible Russian response. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (via translator): If they in the west supply weapons to the zone of combat operations and call for the use of these weapons against our territory, then why do we not have the right to do the same to mirror these actions? I'm not ready to say that we will do it tomorrow, but we, of course, should think about it. CHANCE (voice-over): Elsewhere, Moscow has been stepping up tactical nuclear drills too, staging exercises with neighboring Belarus near the Ukrainian border. Russian tactical nukes delivered from either ground or air can level entire cities, although the Kremlin insists it has no plans at this stage to use them. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow.

      "sentences": "So this was King Charles' first official portrait since his coronation. It went viral on social media because so many people just didn't like it. It did have its defenders too, though, and lots of people have gone to visit it as it hung in a gallery in London, including some protesters who used the opportunity to deface it. They put or they pasted a cartoon over the front of it.This was a protest against the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals. King Charles is patron of that animal welfare group. The protesters claim that the RSPCA are covering up cruelty on farms, something the RSPCA denies, though they will look into any allegations, they say. The painting, luckily, wasn't harmed. It was covered in perspex. No comment from Buckingham Palace, I suspect, or I get the feeling that they don't want to give this story any more publicity than it's already getting. Max Foster, CNN London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
