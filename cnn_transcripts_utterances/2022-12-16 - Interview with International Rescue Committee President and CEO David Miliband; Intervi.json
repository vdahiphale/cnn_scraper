We look back at Christiane's wonderful interview with Cher.I want to welcome everyone to the program, I'm Paula Newton in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Ukraine woke to another round of strikes this morning, the country's armed forces saying in Russia launched at least 76 missiles Friday, and Tu-95 strategic bombers known for their range and speed have been used for the very first time. Now, as you can imagine, power and water supplies continue to be disrupted right across the country, and to pressure from these kinds of attacks and it couldn't be coming at a worse time, as winter plunges the country into sub-zero temperatures. Unsurprisingly, this crisis has put Ukraine at the top of the world's priorities when it comes to humanitarian aid. Now, the International Rescue Committee is putting and now on its new watchlist for 2023. Somalia, Ethiopia and Afghanistan top the list this year. Its goal is to help the charity determine how they allocate their support and resources. And, of course, it also gives the world a heads up about where the most vulnerable people live. And earlier, I spoke about all of this with the head of the International Rescue Committee and former British foreign minister, David Miliband. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I think there are a couple of things that are very significant about therecent developments in Ukraine that you've been covering. First of all, the pummeling of the civilian infrastructure speaks to a wider trend in global affairs. Conflict is increasingly focused on hitting civilians rather than hitting soldiers. And the majority of victims and war are now civilians. That speaks to the increasingly urban nature of warfare, but also to the tactics that are being used by various parties to conflicts. In this case, the Russian military strategy does seem to be to hit the civilian population and try to exert pain that way, having been pushed back on the battlefield. I think it is worth pointing out that the last figures I saw are that 80, 90 percent of the rockets and missiles that are coming into Ukraine are being intercepted. But that still leaves the civilian population extremely vulnerable, both to the direct hit, and then, secondly, obviously, to the consequences and the situation where there is minus, five minus 10 degrees centigrade. They hit the power sector is very dangerous. That leads to the second point, which, is that as you hinted, this is a regional crisis, a global crisis, not just Ukraine crisis. 7 million refugees already crossed the borders into Europe. Europe handling that with a real determination, but obviously, there's a fear that if the Russian bombardment is successful, there will be many more refugees creating more pressure inside of Europe.",

Theweekend after the 24th of February invasion, it was a Thursday, the weekend after, the European Union came together and made startling pledges, really, three years commitment to every refugee being housed, having access to work, kids going to school. And also, there's obviously, on the military side, a very strong European response. I think the threat is so clear and so singular that actually around the Ukraine issue, there's a lot of unity. I think the danger for Europe is that this unity finds its place in other areas. But I think 2022 was a year of stronger European unity rather than disunity.",

And so, I obviously lead a humanitarian organization. I'm afraid that the core front is on the military side, and there is a lot to play for still. There's a lot to play through. I think that 10 months into the war, it's very hard to see the Russians winning, but that's not the same as saying that there is a quick route to a defeat and to therefore, some kind of settlement. I think the Ukraine have held up in an extraordinary fashion, but that doesn't mean that there is a quick end because the decision-making structure in Moscow doesn't give vent to public opinion. It doesn't allow the mothers of the Russian soldiers who have been killed on the battlefield to be -- to have their voices heard. And so, you've got the singularity of decision-making inside the Kremlin really as the only decision-maker in this when it comes to the terms on which Russia is willing to come to terms with the failure of its invasion.",

      "sentences": "Well, let's explain to your viewers, this unique watchlist is emergency watchlists, it's drawn from 67 different data sources. So,there's a real evidence basis for the prediction about which country is going to suffer greatest humanitarian need in 2023. 20 countries only on the watchlist. Those 20 countries account for 90 percent of the global humanitarian need. In total, the U.N. says 340 million people in humanitarian need, 90 percent of them live in just these 20 countries. The core drivers of humanitarian need are conflict, Ukraine being a prime example, they are the climate crisis, and they are the economic shockwaves, including from Ukraine, but also post COVID. Now, you rightly refer to the danger of donor fatigue. And there are two stories here that are important. There are donors, notably in Europe, who are not stepping up to the global needs. They're focused on Ukraine. The Gulf has done very well out of the rise and energy prices. They're not stepping up. But I do have to call out the U.S. government, that's the other side of the story. U.S. government has made really significant progress in 2022 in recognizing the global consequences of the Ukraine war. And it's for that reason that they have boosted their international aid, especially to East Africa, where food prices have grown so significantly as a result of Ukraine war and the blockage on grain exports. A country like Somalia, which is top of our list, 90 percent of its wheat comes from Ukraine. So, you can see the danger. And across the 20 countries of the watchlist, there's a 40 percent rise in food price inflation, in large part because of the Ukraine conflict. So, those global consequences are being recognized by the U.S. They're not being recognized by other donors. And the purpose of our watchlist is not just to sound a warning, it is indeed to be the call to action that you refer to. And we think there are things that can be done. And we are calling on global community to follow where the U.S. has led.",

Just for background, 15 of the 20 countries on theInternational Rescue Committee's emergency watchlist have been there for at least five years. So, you're making an important point about protracted conflict. Now, in the case of Somalia, it's got a new factor on the scene, which is the climate crisis. We haven't seen the kind of drought effect that is hitting Somalia now, we weren't seeing that 30 years ago. I was in Eastern Ethiopia towards the border with Somalia just last month and you can see the consequences across the East African region of successive missed rainfalls. That's a new factor in the equation and it calls for strengthening of the guardrails against disaster. Now, those guardrails are the form of climate resilient agriculture, they're the form of international aid that can help people who are on the brink of famine. But then there are the more -- the deeper, more fundamental questions of governance, which I think you might be referring to, governance in conflict. And that, indeed, is a very long-term problem. What we're seeing in the places that the IRC works is that the tools of diplomacy to regulate relations between nations are not adequate for conflict within nations, and that's where our greatest concern is. 80 percent of the humanitarian needs on our watchlist are affected by civil war. And that's where we need new tools of diplomacy to get upstream and solve some of these problems.",

Please explain that in terms of what that means. You say, nor does it spoke for the concerns outside of the West and the mistakes of democratic countries. The issue here though is everything that you've signposted from IRC, how do you get from, you know, the data that you've provided to action, when even, as you rightly point, out we are in crisis here, of governance not just nationally, but internationally?",

Less than 20 percent of the global population live in whatFreedom House, the most respective thinktank (ph) on this issue calls a fully free and democratic system. So, there is democratic recession. The trouble is that the framing of democracy versus autocracy is really for within nations states, it's not global framing. What I argue is that the global issue is one of impunity versus accountability. Impunity is the exercise of power without accountability. And as you know, power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. So, on the one hand, you have the rise of impunity, on the other hand, you have accountability checks on the abuse of power. That starts with transparency, it involved legal systems, it involves countervailing power against impunity. And I think as we think about international affairs in the 2020s, we shouldn't be thinking about it as democracy versus autocracy in the international realm, we should think about it as impunity versus the rule of law. That is why the Ukraine crisis is so significant. That's why the denial of aid in parts of Ethiopia or Somalia is so significant contrary to the rule of law, is the rule of law that we have to defend at the international level. We don't want new laws. They were written in the U.N. charter and associated documents 75 years ago. They need to be defended. And that's what I think -- that's the basic framing that I think can help at the international level.",

It has been falling for a bunch of reasons, I don't want to get hooked on it. This is the important point, when puberty hits, it awakens the adolescent brain to all kinds of social information. Young people crave that information because they are beginning to make the transition from being cared for by their families to adapting to a social world. What hasn't changed though, Michel, is that the rest of the brain hasn't developed any more quickly. The parts of the brain that help make sense of all that information. Here is your neurological mismatch. You have a very hyperaware brain, an early pubescent brain, combined with the thing a lot of viewers may be thinking about, an onslaught of information.

When we see an increase like this, Michel,we would hope that just as our systems once dealt with broken bones and, you know, car crashes and other facets that pediatricians and emergency rooms were trained to do, we would hope that our current systems would keep up with a shifting risk. One of the issues that's cropping up is, we have not kept up. There is a systemic mismatch now. So, that mismatch is between the problems young people are grappling with and the systems that we have in place to take care of it. We discovered in the course of the series that between 1,000 and 5,000 young people and adolescents are spending the night in emergency rooms because they are either suicidal, self-harming, or a risk for others, less so that, and there is no place for these young people to go. There are no good community impatient systems, there are fewer outpatient systems than we need. And so, you're winding up with young people in a setting there that is deciding not set up for this kind of case. Separately, you see pediatricians grappling with stuff like complex mental health issues, that's what they've trained to do. That's what I mean by systemic mismatch.",

There is such an absence of specialty care that you have school counselors strapped and primary care physician strapped. And here is the punchline. At least in this story that I did, drawing on research going back a decade, you wind up seeing young kids of color who do not have access to care being misdiagnosed often with diagnoses of hostility and aggression when, in fact, they are suffering trauma, depression, anxiety, the same things those upper class or higher class socioeconomic class kids are suffering from. Why is that? Because of the implicit bias and even outright racism that would suggest a person of color is more hostile.
