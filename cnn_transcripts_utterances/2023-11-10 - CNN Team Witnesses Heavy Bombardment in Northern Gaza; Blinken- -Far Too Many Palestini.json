And a ransomware attack on China's biggest bank may have impacted the US financial system. Live from London, it's Friday, November 10th. I'm Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest. And, of course, I, too, mean business. Good evening, everyone. If you've been watching our air just moments ago, CNN crews witnessed heavy bombardment and flares fired by Israeli forces in the northern part of Gaza, happening around 22 minutes or so past nine in the evening there. You are looking at the video now. The team also saw intense flares over the area near the Jabalya refugee camp. This is the -- this is close to our Nic Robertson's live shot position. Now, that bombardment ending a day when the International Red Cross says that Gaza's health care system is at the \"point of no return\" amid reports of strikes near several hospitals. And a warning, this is graphic video from inside the Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza. The World Health Organization said Friday they had come under bombardment. The director of a children's hospital in northern Gaza says IDF tanks have surrounded it. He said, \"Nobody can leave.\" The hospital is near a neighborhood where ground fighting was reported by both Israel and Hamas. Let's get the very latest for you, bring you up to date. Our Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv. And, Jeremy, we saw, and I'm sure you saw, too, in the last hour, the heavy bombardment from Nic Robertson's live position. Nic was saying that it's closest -- it felt it was close to Jabalya refugee camp. What more can you tell us?",

Thanks very much.While many people are taking shelter inside Gaza's medical facilities, Jomana Karadsheh has more on the overnight strikes that hit several of them. And we want to warn you, the images in her report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Night 34 of this war brought hell to Gaza's hospitals. Death so close for these medics outside Al-Awda Hospital, they recited their final prayers. The hospital says several were injured in these strikes and two ambulances were completely damaged. It was one of several hospitals struck in what was a night of horror for those sheltering at medical facilities in northern Gaza. On a Friday, more heartache came with these devastating scenes at Shifa hospital complex, the haunting screams of those who survived this blast, dazed, confused, searching for loved ones amongst the dead and injured, images that infuriated humanitarians like Norwegian doctor, Mads Gilbert, who volunteered at Shifa in the past. (ISRAELIS screaming in pain on background.) DR. MADS GILBERT, NORWEGIAN VOLUNTEER DOCTOR: President Biden, Mr. Blinken, Mr. Blinken, can you hear me? Prime ministers and presidents of the European countries, can you hear me? Can you hear the screams from Shifa hospital, from Al-Awda hospital? Can you hear the screams from innocent people, refugees sheltering, trying to find a safe place, being bombed by the Israeli attack forces, hospitals that are the temples of humanity and protection? KARADSHEH (voice-over): But this is a war with no red lines, and hospitals are no sanctuary for the tens of thousands crammed into these hospitals desperate to be protected by a war like no other Gaza has ever seen. For weeks, the Israeli military has been calling on civilians to move south to get out of harm's way, they say, but so many have been reluctant to heed the calls. Airstrikes and deaths have followed Gazans to the south. Nowhere is safe in this besieged territory. But as the Israeli military opened up a humanitarian corridor and with intense fighting in the north, tens of thousands had no choice but to run and seeing sort of old dark memories for Palestinians of an exodus from decades past from which there has been no return. But not everyone can leave. The fighting has trapped some of the most vulnerable at two pediatric hospitals where hundreds are sheltering, and doctors are calling on the ICRC to evacuate them. Israeli troops are right outside Al-Nasr and Rantisi hospitals. (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.) KARADSHEH (voice-over): \"The hospital is surrounded by Israeli tanks from all directions,\" this young woman says. \"We were asked to evacuate now,\" she and others with this cry for international protection and a safe passage out. Back inside Shifa, there's no stopping, no pauses for those on a mission to save lives. A father anxiously looks to doctors for good news, only to be told his little boy is gone. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE crying and screaming.) KARADSHEH (voice-over): Never have Gazans felt so abandoned, alone and they're slammed of death and despair. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The hospitals themselves say they're not aware of it, that they deny these allegations. But it has seemed from a very early stage that the IDF has set itself the need in its own determination to, if nothing else, go and check the basements of these hospitals where they say Hamas is holding out. And it appears this is what they are poised to do. And I think in the tactics that we've seen used, the military will maneuver in. And it would seem, in likelihood, because the IDF says they're not -- they're targeting civilians, only Hamas, that they find a way to allow civilians to leave the hospital. How that's managed in a condition and an environment where the hospitals need to continue to treat patients there and continue to receive patients isn't clear, but it does appear that there is a focus on certain hospitals, though the IDF has the intent to encircle those hospitals. The question is do they have an intent to go in them and search the basements. And the healthcare system in the whole of Gaza, according to International Committee for the Red Cross, today, they say that the healthcare system is now at a \"point of no return.\" The Hamas-led Ministry of Health officials in Gaza say 193 health officials killed, 60 ambulances damaged by strikes, 21 of 50 -- 21 of 35 hospitals out of service, 53 of 72 healthcare clinics out of service. It just builds a picture of how critical these remaining hospitals are to the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza and therefore, putting tanks around them that will add to the pressure on the population and the pressure on the hospitals.",

And we do it very slowly, by the way, and this was a complaint that I had before. Now we do it slowly precisely because we want to avoid the unnecessary civilian casualties as much as we can.

There was a case a few weeks ago where a large number of civilians were injured outside a hospital. They were sheltering in the foreground.

This particular situation, we don't have that level of detail from the IDF yet about who fired it and precisely where it was fired from. But they are saying that it was fired at their forces who are close to the hospital.

You know, I think what it will raise concern for some people is that once you bring troops into an area around a medical facility, then you -- then you increase the possibility of clashes because if the tanks sitting in the street, it stands to reason that Hamas is going to try to fire on those tanks and it appears that the IDF is saying that, in essence, this is what happened. That was a misfired munition that didn't hit the IDF troops that it was aimed at. That actually misfired and hit the hospital. The hospital officials have been very, very clear from the get go.

And it's been trying to show from a global stage perspective that China is a global peacemaker. That they could perhaps even be a mediator in all of this. And that's what they wanted to project. Now we know that there are undertones and perhaps even relationship certainly with China and Russia and even more personally with Xi and Putin that would suggest that China has its preference and has, of course, been aligning itself more so with Russia and that conflict.

      "sentences": "Well, it does appear that the U.S. administration is somewhat immune from the -- to these callsfrom the Arab League and other international leaders for an immediate ceasefire. We did -- we know that tomorrow there's going to be an emergency summit of the Arab League in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. And they've already said that they are demanding an immediate ceasefire, but the Americans simply aren't paying attention. They aren't listening to them. We heard the President Biden say that, no, there will be no ceasefire. The U.S. for its part is pushing for what it's calling humanitarian pauses to allow for perhaps more food to get in. But that sort of approach is widely derided in the Arab world as being equivalent to giving somebody who's having the hell beaten out of them a chance to have a meal and then go back and continue to be beaten to death. Most in this part of the world, there is growing frustration what -- to what seems to be a tone-deaf U.S. administration. Now also in Saudi Arabia tomorrow, there's going to be a summit of the leaders of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which includes Muslim leaders from around the world, Muslim heads of state that is, including Bashar al-Assad of Syria and Ibrahim Raisi, the president of Iran. That will be the first time an Iranian Head of State has gone to Saudi Arabia. But as I said, these demands for an immediate ceasefire don't seem to be getting much reception when it comes to Antony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State and President Joe Biden. Isa?",

They do have the weapons, the economic weapons to put pressure on the United States and its European allies. But it doesn't seem that they're considering to use that yet. So, it seems that they're going to be firing a lot of words and denunciations and demands but all of those will be falling on deaf ears. Isa?",

And thetwo chambers are headed for yet another federal funding fight. It will be a major test for new Speaker of the House of course, Mike Johnson, and the process comes with its own political risk. Previous speaker if you remember, Kevin McCarthy was booted just days after the last budget fight. Melanie Zanona is in Washington, D.C. to lay it all out for us. Melania and here we are yet again.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, Speaker Mike Johnson is running into the exact same problems that his predecessor Kevin McCarthydid. And that is why Speaker Johnson is treading very carefully. He is trying to really wrestle with his decision and hear from all members of his conference and at issue here is that the Republican Conference is really divided over what approach they should take. There's moderates who are pushing for just a clean, straightforward stopgap spending bill to keep the government's lights on through the end of this year or early next year. But conservative hardliners are pushing for a much more complicated idea that would extend government funding for agencies in two separate batches. So, setting up really a series of fiscal cliffs. And that option is dead on arrival in the Senate. Democrats don't like it, even some Republicans in the Senate don't like it and it would risk a government shutdown which Johnson absolutely does not want on his watch. But at the same time, he also does not want to infuriate his right flank especially so early on in his tenure. So, in the meantime, lawmakers growing very anxious about what he plans to do so far, even some top Republicans are in the dark but we couldn't get a window into his thinking quite soon because I am told that Speaker Johnson is aiming to release bill text by tomorrow with the hopes of putting a bill on the floor by Tuesday. But at this point, we're told that that bill text still not final. So, some big decisions to make here. A lot on the line and not a lot of time to figure it out.",

The ransomware attack hit ICBC's U.S. arm on Wednesday, and reportedly disrupted U.S. Treasury trade yesterday. The hack has drawn global response. Officials in the U.S. say they're monitoring the issue. Chinese authorities said they've taken emergency measures to minimize risks and losses. Let's get more on all of this. Matt Egan's in New York.

I think what's new and different is the sophistication of the attacks that are coming at all different private sector players, including banks. And, you know, let's not forget that it was actually two years ago, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he was asked what the number one risk is to financial markets. What was so interesting was that, you know, he didn't talk about a liquidity sort of event or a financial crisis or even a war. He said it was cybersecurity and that was two years ago, and the risks have only magnified since then. So, all of this does show how even some of the biggest banks in the world can fall victim to hackers.",
