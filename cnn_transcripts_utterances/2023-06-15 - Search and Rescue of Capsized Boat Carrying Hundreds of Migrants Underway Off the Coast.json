      "sentences": "Hello everyone, I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is One World. Aid workers in Greece say many of the survivors from acapsized boat are overwhelmed, in shock and looking for their loved ones. The search and rescue operation is underway off the coast of southern Greece after a boat carrying hundreds of migrants sank early Wednesday. At least 78 people have now been confirmed dead. The U.N. believes up to 750 people were on board, including dozens of children. The Greek Coast Guard provided these aerial photos of the overcrowded vessel on Tuesday before it sank. It says it most likely capsized because of a sudden shift in weight. More than a hundred people were rescued and brought to the city of Kalamata. And that's where we find CNN's Melissa Bell, who joins us live now. No doubt, a difficult few days ahead for those survivors. A hundred a four people were rescued, and it is slim chance that they will find anymore survivors at this point, Melissa. MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): At this stage, very little at all, Zain. And that's what's so sad, being here in Kalamata, is that there are relatives of those that were on the boat arriving, trying to get news of their loved ones. Some are Syrians who've sought asylum in Europe, who knew that a cousin or a brother or a young wife was on board. And increasingly, it's becoming clear that whatever the fee that was paid will have been paid essentially for them to go to their graves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over): A dramatic rescue at sea. The Greek Coast Guard pulls a group of people to safety, the few lucky ones. Survivors of yet another catastrophe on the deadliest migrant crossing in the world, the Mediterranean Sea. Somehow, 104 people managed to leave this doomed fishing boat alive, but hundreds are thought to have perished, most still missing in the deepest part of these waters just 50 miles off the Greek coast. On shore, medics rushed to preserve the lives of those that survived, all are men. Aid workers tell me others were unable to get out.",

The boat started out from Libya heading towards Italy and called for assistance on Tuesday afternoon, one charity has said. It claims the authorities had hours to reach the vessel, but a rescue operation was, quote, not launched until it was too late. Now, the wait is for news, devastating for families here who think their loved ones might have been on board. This Syrian man spoke to his cousin last week as he waited to cross from Libya and worries that he could have been on the boat.",

But even this is certainly not an easy fight. It says that Russia is putting up fierce resistance, leading to brutal confrontations and, quote, battles everywhere. An army spokesperson says that much of the focus is near the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, with Ukrainian forces gaining some ground. To the south, the senior military figure says that more than a hundred square kilometers of territory has been liberated in the Zaporizhzhia direction over the past week. But earlier Russia claimed its troops repelled two attacks in that area. CNN's Sam Kiley joins us live now in Kyiv. So, Sam, of course, it is early days in Ukraine's counteroffensive.

You can see it here in this clip published by the Wall Street Journal. A Russian soldier who apparently surrendered to a Ukrainian drone on the Bakhmut battlefield last month. The Ukrainian commander confirmed to CNN that when the soldier realized he was going to die, he threw his machine gun aside, raised up his hands, and said he would not continue to fight. He was reportedly working as a liquor store manager before being drafted last year. As Ukraine's counteroffensive pushes forward, NATO's defense ministers are meeting in Brussels, as our Sam Kiley was just mentioning there, to discuss long-term support for Kyiv. NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg says it comes at a critical moment in Russia's war, well now into its second year. Earlier, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin opened a meeting of the Ukraine defense contact group where he pledged America's unwavering commitment to Kyiv and he called on allies to do the same. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Throughout the Kremlins' vicious war of choice, Ukrainian forces have shown outstanding bravery and skill. And Ukraine's fight is a marathon, and not a sprint. So, we will continue to provide Ukraine with the urgent capabilities that it needs to meet this moment, as well as what it needs to keep itself secure for the long term from Russian aggression. And make no mistake, we will stand with Ukraine for the long haul. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Natasha, just walk us through what type of additional lethal aid has beenpledged to support Ukraine as they are in the early stages of this counteroffensive and how the defense secretary hopes that this assistance will change the game on the battlefield. Natasha Bertrand, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yeah, Zain, so the conversation in Europe, really over the last day or so and tomorrow with the meeting of defense ministers from NATO, is really going to be all about kind of tailoring the equipment that these allies can give to the Ukrainians to what they need to sustain this counteroffensive and push the Russians out. Now, the kind of equipment that the Ukrainians really need right now is air defense. That is something that they have said multiple times to these allied countries, is that they need more sophisticated air defense systems. Of course, they really want those F-16 fighter jets, those advanced fourth generation Western aircraft that they could then use, they say, to gain control of their skies, because of course the Russians are continuing their aerial bombardment of the country. So, all of this really, a topic of discussion at that defense contact group meeting today in Brussels. The question of the F-16s is one that they are currently discussing just in terms of how they're going to provide training to the Ukrainian pilots on these very advanced fighter jet systems, something that is expected to begin in the next few weeks, but that will likely take at least a few months to train the Ukrainian pilots on. So, that was a topic of discussion today. And then, of course, there was the announcement that the U.S., along with some other allies, they are going to be providing these short and medium range air defense missiles that they can -- the Ukrainians can use against the Russians kind of at short distances, which is an interesting development. And then, of course you have the question of tanks. Another big ticket item that the Ukrainians really need, of course, are more of those Leopard tanks. Of course, the U.S.-provided tanks that are expected to arrive later this year, those can make a big difference on the battlefield because Ukraine is using them really by the dozens, if not hundreds, in this counteroffensive, and many of them are actually being destroyed. And so, what the Ukrainians need is a bigger commitment from these allies that they can be replenished. And the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin did say that while a lot of the - - well, I shouldn't say a lot, but well, you know, a substantial number of the Ukrainians' equipment is being destroyed because this is a war, it is a very grinding offensive that they are carrying out right now. He does believe that the Ukrainians do have the capability to repair those systems fairly quickly and get them back into battle. So, really, the topic of discussion today and tomorrow, it is going to be about what can we give the Ukrainians that they need right now, but also how can we equip them for the longer term fight? Because as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said in remarks today, this could be a very long fight indeed, Zain.",

One of them was Boris Johnson's birthday party. One of them actually had 200 odd people invited to it who were told to bring their own booze. And this report is more than a hundred pages, and it goes into, trust me, painstaking detail about what precisely Boris Johnson said, what he meant, and what he knew at the time, and whether or not, where he made mistakes, he corrected the record. Ultimately it found that he deliberately misled Parliament and he gave unsustainable interpretations in the words of this report of the rules that he helped to write. For instance, he continues to insist that some of those parties were actually essential work functions. So, in its findings, the Committee wrote in part, we came to the view that some of Mr. Johnson's denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the Committee and the House while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth. Now, as you alluded to, Boris Johnson obviously not happy with this, he released his own scathing statement that read in part, the Committee now says that I deliberately misled the House and at the moment I spoke, I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events. This is rubbish. It is a lie. In order to reach this deranged conclusion, the Committee is obliged to say a series of things that are patently absurd or contradicted by the facts. So, as you pointed out Zain, the Committee here recommended 90 days suspension if he were to have still been an MP. The House still has to debate and ultimately vote on whether they agree with the Committee's findings here. So, this isn't quite over, but at the moment, this sanction for Boris Johnson is more of a theoretical hypothetical one, since he obviously resigned as an MP, a backbench MP last week.",

U.S. has also seen a rise in online scams, one is they offer promises of jobs but end up causing people to be trafficked into dangerous situations. And the Secretary also noted that despite the belief that trafficking mostly affects women and girls, that there has been a rise in men and boys falling victim to it, as well.

Yes, we will get very strong winds along the coast and well inland. The winds are down low to 100 kilometers per hour. The storm is starting to steadily weaken as far as the winds go, but it's still going to carry a very powerful punch as far as the rain goes. So, 130-mile per kilometer per hour gusts is what we're seeing. It's finally picking up some speed. If you remember, this storm has basically just been, just stalled essentially, meandering around the sea and just not moving much at all. So, we had some winds and very high surf, but finally pushing in and it will be making landfall most likely in the wee hours of the morning, local time. So, we're looking at the next 12 hours are going to be the roughest as far as the coastal areas go with the strongest winds, the rainfall, the flooding potential, as well as the storm surge. And then as this storm pushes inland, it's really going to have an impact because we're going to see very heavy rainfall torrential downpours and it's going to be far reaching. So, two to three meters of storm surge right along the coast in this area, right around where it's expected to make landfall. The storm surge will be a little bit less as you go a little bit farther out, but it's carrying a lot of moisture and it's not going to die out. Once it makes landfall, you can see a lot of moisture still within the storm as it goes inland over the next day or two. We're talking about anywhere between 250 to maybe topping 500 millimeters of rain. Well inland along the coast, we're looking at about 250 millimeters of rain and then widespread amounts a little bit less, but major flooding could take place across India and Pakistan as the storm pushes in. Then you can see Saturday evening making it very far inland but by then, areas along the coast, Zain, should be much better as far as the wind and rain goes. But again, the next 12 to 24 hours are going to be the worst as the storm is making its landfall.",

So, aside from the fact, if we think about, you know, the ways in which neighborhoods continue to be segregated, the ways in which things like test scores have been shown consistently to be biased based on race in terms of outcome, the ways in which we know that there's less inherited wealth in communities of color, which means that students are more likely to be working in high school than doing eight trillion billion extracurriculars at the same rate.

And so, I think a lot of people's argument is that affirmative action levels the playing field a little bit more because there are so many other unfair reasons why people get into certain colleges if their parents donate a couple of million to build a new dormitory at Harvard, Yale or Princeton. They obviously have an advantage when it comes to admissions process. So, is that an argument, as well? I mean if you get rid of affirmative action, do you then also have to get rid of legacy admissions, too, just to make the playing field absolutely as fair as it can possibly be?",

So, it's athletes, it's legacies, it's people who are on the dean's list, a.k.a. connected to a donor or somebody else, even if they're not necessarily a donor themselves, and then it's the children of faculty and staff. And what we know is that those students make up the largest number of students given preference and admission, and that those students are disproportionately white elites from the top 10 percent of the socioeconomic categories in the U.S. So, in fact when we talk about a case like Harvard that is arguing where SFFA is arguing that Asian-Americans are being discriminated against because of the admission of black and brown students, if you actually look at the rates of Asian-American students compared to white students, if you include the legacy students, the athletes, and the dean's list students, and the children of faculty, white students who make up that category disproportionately are being admitted at a much higher rate than Asian- Americans, that's where the problem is, not with black and browns.",

Is there any way to make it fair for everybody? CLARKE-KAPLAN: Well, I would argue that in fact, despite how we think race conscious admissions work, it is fair for everybody. I mean, I think it is very telling that the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action have been white women. But the only category that is subjected to this level of strict scrutiny are race-conscious admissions that target black and Latinx students. I mean, we don't say that it's not fair that a student who was able to learn the oboe because their school happened to have an oboe teacher, and who is applying to Harvard the year that they need a new oboist for the band gets an advantage in admissions, though they will, that is another category that is considered. We don't argue that, you know, students who come from Wyoming getting a better chance at admissions than students who come from LA is an unfair thing that we should eliminate, though that is another thing that we consider.

Now, we read through KCNA that the Defense Ministry in Pyongyang had denounced what they called the provocations of the enemies. Significantly, this was the U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, joint live fire drills, which had been billed as the largest ever. It was five separate days of these live fire drills today, this Thursday, was the end day. And it was more significant because President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea attended and he said as Commander-in-Chief, he felt more confident and satisfied with what he saw. So, this appears to be what North Korea is reacting to at this point. Now, we went to cover one of those days earlier this month and it was certainly larger than I have seen in many years. And it was also a more blatant message to North Korea. The scenario was that North Korea had staged what they called an illegal armed invasion and the military drill that we then saw was the U.S. and South Korean joint reaction and counter to that invasion. So, certainly, the messaging couldn't have been clearer to Pyongyang, and they did not appreciate it, slamming the U.S. and South Korea for carrying out these drills. In fact, they have said this is the reason that they have carried out so many missile launches and weapons testing. Certainly, we have seen a significant uptick in the past year and a half. And they also say that's the reason they carried out at the end of last month an attempted satellite launch to put a military reconnaissance satellite into space. They didn't manage to do that, but they said they will try again as soon as possible. Paula Hancock's CNN Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Daniel Penny was initially charged with second degree manslaughter when he was arrested in May. Now, the grand jury indictment allows the case against him to move forward. Penny put Jordan Neely in a chokehold after Neely apparently began shouting at passengers on the subway. Penny, who is a former Marine, claims he was just protecting other passengers. CNN's Brynn Gingras is tracking this story for us. So, this indictment by a grand jury was certainly welcome news by Neely's family members who are at this point, of course, looking for justice, Brynn. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's crazy. And so, this means that, like you said, the case will go forward. However, we don't know the details of that indictment. We thought possibly the Manhattan District Attorney would unseal it. However, we're learning there'll be no comment from Alvin Bragg regarding the indictment, only that it'll move to the next phase in court, which means that Daniel Penny have to go in front in back to court next month. So, like you just said, this is a case that really has brought people very divided on the issues of homelessness and also crime on the subways here in New York City. And that is because it's just raised a lot of, you know, concern about how this all went down. And you just described it to your viewers. And there was some video of what happened on May 1st on this subway car. That video showing -- that video showing Neely actually coming onto the train and what witnesses have told CNN is that he said he was hungry, that he was thirsty, that he didn't care if he died and Penny actually seemed to think that this was threatening to other subway riders and to himself, took it upon himself to restrain Neely, putting him in a chokehold, that chokehold resulting in the death -- in his death. So, listen, this is again something that has been divided by so many people. I want you to hear from Penny himself about why he says he did this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
