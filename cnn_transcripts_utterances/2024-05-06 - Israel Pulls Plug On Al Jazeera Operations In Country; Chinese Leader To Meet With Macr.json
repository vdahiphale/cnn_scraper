But it was clear in this particular election, that apart from addressing the question of inflation, the other issues has essentially not improved. And people are not concerned about the environmental or the immigration debates in the way that they might have been specially immigration in the past.

For Rishi Sunak, I think at the moment, his real only hope is that somehow rather in the next few months, the economy improves, or that he's able to convince people that it's on the correct path forward. But I'm not sure that going down the road of moving towards the far right, sort of playing around and instrumentalizing the immigration question is going to help them at this particular stage.And I think that the other thing that one has to be attentive to is that in 2019, when Boris Johnson won, it was a different context, that the Labour Party suffered one of its worst defeats in history.

That is to say that this is a decision that was made on one particular shipment instead, U.S. officials maintaining that they have the same policy toward Israel. This does not signal a policy change and that security assistance continues to go to the region. Now, according to a National Security Council spokesperson who said the following, quote, \"The United States has surged billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel since the October 7 attacks, passed the largest ever supplemental appropriation for emergency assistance to Israel, led an unprecedented coalition to defend Israel against Iranian attacks and will continue to do what is necessary to ensure Israel can defend itself from the threats it faces.\\ Of course, that supplemental that is referenced in the statement is at $26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict that was passed by the U.S..

And it seems that the government has prioritized going into Rafah. It's the fact that they're beginning it with an evacuation of the eastern neighborhoods of Rafah is probably meant to placate to some level, the panic around the world of what would happen with a full-out invasion. But it does seem that that is taking precedence over the kinds of concessions that would be needed to be made to finalize the hostage deal. And it seems that we've seen these rounds of negotiations for a hostage deal that has collapsed every time.

And Netanyahu of course, does want to stay in power, that's the circumstantial evidence for the sense that Netanyahu would prefer to continue with the Rafah operation rather than reach a hostage deal. We can't be inside his head, but there's another problem and that's that the Israeli public view -- excuse me -- Mr. Netanyahu's decision- making as highly influenced by those personal political considerations about keeping his coalition together and keeping himself in power.

And that is compounded by what has always been a lack of trust in Netanyahu since the beginning of this war. His ratings and his governments ratings have plunged and what we're seeing over recent weeks is a very striking rise in surveys and the portion of people who don't believe what Mr. Netanyahu has been promising, this slogan of a total victory over 60 percent in one survey by the public broadcaster commissioned by the public broadcaster Khan News (ph). Nearly two-thirds of Israelis don't believe that there can -- that Israel is one, just one step away from total victory.",

But any sort of agreed political resolution right now is extremely difficult to achieve under this Israeli government. They don't want anything that the Palestinians would agree to. Now, that doesn't mean it's entirely impossible, but it will require massive, I think a perfect storm of international involvement, including both incentives and pressure at probably from Western allies and Middle Eastern countries. And those -- those countries will have to come together with a policy. Right now, I think the international community has been talking sternly and maybe even in an impassioned way about getting back to the two-state solution. Although even that was in the first few months of the war, not so much recently. But this kind of talk can't rest on rhetoric, it has to be backed by policy, ideally coordinated policies that will involve some sort of political intervention. And you know, there's talk of some sort of participation of other countries in security intervention as well in the long-term, but those have to be part of a comprehensive vision. They can't be sort of piecemeal policy for the day after without thinking about the entire picture on the long term.",

They're also asking people to evacuate if they are in mandatory evacuation zones. Now, we hopped on an air boat with the Harris County sheriff's office we have video of this. They were assessing an area that's right behind me. It was not accessible other than by boat. And they showed us some of the dangers. I mean, we were on this air boat we were going over fences, over mailboxes. The stop signs were at eye level. And the first responders explained some of the challenges sometimes they stretch their arms towards individuals, telling them that they can rescue them, they can take them to higher ground and to safety.
