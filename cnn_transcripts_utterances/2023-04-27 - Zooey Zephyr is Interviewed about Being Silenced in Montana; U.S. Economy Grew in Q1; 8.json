Republicans have since banned her from the Montana house chamber for the rest of the legislative session. Days after she gave that speech, protests actually broke out in the house chamber when Zephyr raised her microphone in solidarity. Police in riot gear responded, ultimately arresting seven protesters. And, last night, this all culminated as Republicans kicked Zephyr out of the house chamber for refusing to apologize.Joining us now is that Montana state representative, Zooey Zephyr. Good morning and thank you for being here. I think a big question people have is, what's next for you now that this has happened. ZOOEY ZEPHYR (D), MONTANA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: So, I was elected to represent 11,000 Montanans in people's house and I left yesterday with my head held high knowing I had made a moral and right choice. And I will walk into the building this morning with my head held high. I will find a place to talk to my colleagues, sit down and to vote on the bills.",

But I do think that this lack of resilience points to an even bigger question, which is - has to do with the nature of suffering itself. Why do we suffer? And why, at the same time, when we suffered, are we grateful for the suffering that we've undergone?So, joy is an antidote to that because we don't want to gloss over suffering and just try and eliminate suffering and just be happy all the time. That can be oppressive and insufferable sometimes and people - you see influencers on Instagram like, just be happy and look positive and -- but bringing joy, using joy as a tool to bring joy to others, like we did on \"The Office,\" that acknowledges the fact that there are ups and downs and we can have suffering, we can also have joy. And that's part of the miracle of being alive.",
