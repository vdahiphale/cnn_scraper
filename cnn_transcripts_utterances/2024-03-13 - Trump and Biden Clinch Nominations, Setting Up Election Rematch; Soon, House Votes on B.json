They may be presumptuous too but that's not an issue here.This morning they have both secured enough delegates to get their party's nominations. They are presumptive because it does not become official until the conventions this summer. So, now, we kick off what might be the most historic and important presumptive election stretch in history. Now, we assume you know they ran against each other before, though they say we should never assume because it makes an ass out of you and me. This morning, President Biden heads to Wisconsin, a key swing state he won once and needs to win again. He will discuss his new tax, health care and climate plans. After Donald Trump, he will take the presumptive road less traveled. Literally, he has not left Florida in days. He is preparing for a key court date and made moves overnight to be prepared to challenge an election that is just barely beginning.

But it was important because it really cemented that status run. And they now have the necessary delegates to formally clinch the nomination come the conventions this summer.But, look, Donald Trump had already been acting like a general election candidate even before Nikki Haley dropped out. But now comes the hard work, and his team recognizes where his weaknesses are. I'm told that they are focused heavily and specifically in seven key battleground states. That includes Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, among others. And their focus is really going to be trying to peel off specific voting blocks from Joe Biden, ones they know that he had a lot of support with in 2020, but they think he can gain ground with ahead of 2024 in November. Part of that is black male voters in Georgia, Hispanic voters in Arizona, working class and union voters in Michigan. They recognize that they're not going to be able to totally change these demographics but they want to siphon off enough support to offset some of the other areas of concerns, like with independent voters and suburban voters, that the know Donald Trump needs to work on. Now, Donald Trump, in response to him clinching the nomination, or I should say receiving enough delegates to clinch the nominations last night, he did issue a video response, and he addressed that the next eight months are going be tough. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're not going to take time to celebrate. We'll celebrate in eight months when the election is over. November 5th, I believe, will go down as the most important day in the history of our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Today, it's Wisconsin, which Biden won by only 20,000 votes last time around.Priscilla Alvarez is following this for us from the White House this morning. What is the pitch to Wisconsin voters today? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Look, this is a battleground state that the president and his campaign have their eyes on. And when he goes to Wisconsin today, he'll be opening up a campaign headquarters to mobilize voters and helping that outreach to voters in the state, but also touting infrastructure projects, yet another theme of his campaign. And after this visit to Wisconsin, he'll go straight to Michigan, another battleground state. This is a pitch that already started yesterday. The president met with the Teamsters, a critical union with 1.3 million members, that the president is trying to secure an endorsement from to bolster his coalition, especially that among unions. It just goes to show that the president and the campaign are really trying to target these battleground states to make sure that he can secure them again in 2024, knowing it's going to be very close margins. And it's all as the campaign pivots toward the general election in earnest. The president saying in a statement yesterday that he was honored to clinch the Democratic nomination and putting out this video in response.

There were a couple of other things, Kate, that I think we should also take note of. He warned the U.S. from sending ground troops into Ukraine. Of course, no one said that they want to send ground troops, but nevertheless, he mentioned that in the interview. He also threatened Poland as well, saying that if they were to send ground troops into Ukraine, that those troops would probably want to stay there, again, the Poles also not talking about sending troops to Ukraine.
