      "sentences": "All right. You've been listening to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly. Not the entirety of the General Assembly, as many of those delegates walked out at the beginning of this very fiery speech from the Israeli prime minister. At one point, he referred to the United Nations as an anti-Semitic swamp, and he said the real war criminals are in Iran, Gaza and Lebanon. So, some very fiery words from Netanyahu.Let me get out to Alex Marquardt at the U.N. Alex, your assessment of the prime minister's speech does not sound like the region is on a path to peace right now if you go by what the prime minister just said.",

Congressman, you've been listening to some of Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech. Your reaction? I mean, he had some, obviously, very fiery language aimed at the United Nations and the people he sees as the enemies of the state of Israel. What did you make of that? REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-MA):  The prime minister's always been a powerful orator, and I agree with his strong defense of Israel's right to protect itself and its citizens. I agree that Israel seeks peace and trade, and Iran seeks the destruction of Israel. I agree that Hamas must have no role in post-war Gaza. But right now, what Israel needs is not just an order. Israel needs a strategist. Israel needs somebody who can connect the righteous objectives of their war, repopulate Northern Israel, get the hostages home, have post-war governance that excludes Hamas and Gaza. They need to connect those objectives with the tactics of the IDF. That's what political leadership is meant to do. Here's what we're trying to fight for. Here's how we're fighting, but then here's how we're going to get that done. And there has been an insufficiently coherent and multilateral strategy from the prime minister. And he needs to take this opportunity to put one in place.",

I mean, how can the Biden administration approach this now? I mean, it seems like Netanyahu's latest cards on the table.",

      "sentences": "I think total victory in Gaza needs to be defined just as much from Sinwar's perspective as from Netanyahu's perspective, which might sound like a startling statement. But what I mean is Sinwar doesn't fear death and destruction in Gaza. Indeed, he welcomes it. What he fears is reconstruction. He fears an alternative to Hamas that offers an agenda of economic redevelopment and security and infrastructure investments and education for the Palestinian people.And if Israel was able to architect a Palestinian-led, Arab-supported, western-backed alternative to Hamas, that is victory in Gaza. He has yet to do that.",

      "sentences": "The United Nations has decades of a shameful double standard when regarding Israel behind it. And so some of that rhetoric is justified by the U.N.'s actions, It's shameful that U.N. delegates couldn't even see fit to sit and listen to a democratic nation talk about its vision and its right to defend itself and its goals to unite the Middle East in peace and trade. So, those delegates should have been sitting there. And they need to stop excoriating Israel to the exclusion of Iran and Syria and North Korea and Venezuela and other states that don't receive nearly the same opprobrium that the Jewish state does.",

It's an honor to have the president with us. And he's been through a lot.
