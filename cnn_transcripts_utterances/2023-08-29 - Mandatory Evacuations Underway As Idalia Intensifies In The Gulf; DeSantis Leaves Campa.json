You look at governor like Jeb Bush, who had two years' worth of deadly storms hitting the state. He faced 8 hurricanes over that stretch, and he was remembered, quite fondly here, for that time that he spent and how he navigated those storms.Of course, one of those storms was Hurricane Katrina, and his brother, President George Bush. People look at his presidency, much different because of how he handled that storm. And that is the sort of the paradox facing Governor DeSantis over these coming days as he navigates Florida through the crisis. He has said that he is hyper focused on delivering for his state. That he has been holding press conferences all throughout Florida's West Coast trying to prepare Floridians and saying that he is willing to put his campaign on hold for now. Listen to what he had to say earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA GOVERNOR: You remember Ian. We were in the midst of a of a governor campaign. I had all kinds of stuff scheduled not just in Florida around the country, you know, we were doing different things. And you know you, you, you do what you need to do. I mean, and so that's what we're doing. So it's going to be no different than what we did during Hurricane Ian. I'm hoping that this storm is not as catastrophic as Hurricane Ian. Was, but we're going to -- we're going to do, you know, do what we need to do because it's just it's just something that's important. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie back in 2016, just weeks before the New Hampshire voters went to their primaries, he had to leave the campaign trail to attend to a blizzard in his home state.And De Santis actually has been campaigning quite a bit on his past response to storms. He talked about Hurricane Ian in that clip. That storm devastated the Fort Myers Beach region and left two bridges totally damaged. He has talked quite a bit on the campaign trail about his efforts to rebuild those storms, Brianna. Of course, that storm also produced images of him wearing white knee-high boots that have become fodder for his political detractors, showing the plus and the negatives of having to respond during one of these kinds of crises.",

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise says he has begun treatment now for what he describes as a very treatable blood cancer. The 57-year- old says he started feeling ill over the August congressional recess. Tests led to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The Louisiana Republican plans to continue working in Washington while undergoing several months of cancer treatment. Also a new call for President Biden in Congress to address New York's migrant crisis. More than 130 top business leaders in New York City have written an open letter backing Governor Kathy Hochul's plea for funds for the migrants, healthcare, education and housing. As well as expedited work authorizations. This comes as New York City is struggling with the influx of more than 100,000 migrants, many of them sleeping on the sidewalks of Manhattan, because the shelters are full. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase, Larry Fink of Black Rock and Jane Fraser of Citigroup are among the CEO's who signed that open letter. And the European Union is sending more firefighting planes and a helicopter now to Greece to help fight what they described as the biggest wildfires ever recorded in the EU. The fires erupted 11 days ago as strong winds and hot, dry summer conditions fueled flames in the northeast forest region. Officials say at least nineteen people have been killed. And an area larger than New York City has now been scorched. Seems like everywhere we look on the globe, we see events like this.",

He was not required to enter a plea, and the judge says that he will continue to be held without bond. If convicted of that first-degree murder charges he faces at minimum, up to life in prison.And there the District Attorney during this initial court appearance alleged that Qi walked in on campus, I should say, and opened fire gunning down an associate professor in the Department of Applied Physical Sciences. That professor has been working on campus since 2019, identified as Zijie Yan. Police have not released any information if there's a connection between Qi and Yan.
