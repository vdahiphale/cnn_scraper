Will we hear similar rhetoric at the former president's rally in Atlanta tonight?Also this hour, Kamala Harris is condemning Trump for fanning what she calls hate and division, arguing he's fixated on his grievances and on himself, the vice president on the trail in battleground Michigan with just eight days to go in the deadlocked race for the White House. Plus, federal authorities are investigating how and why fires erupted in ballot drop boxes in both Washington state and Oregon. Hundreds of ballots reportedly were damaged in these final critical days of early voting. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Will Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And we begin with breaking news in the presidential race. Donald Trump rallying voters in a crucial battleground state tonight as the ugly rhetoric coming from him and his allies is being taken to new extremes. And that's giving new fuel to Kamala Harris, who is now seizing on the divisive message at Trump's event in New York City's famed Madison Square Garden last night. CNN's Eva McKend is standing by at a Harris event in Ann Arbor, Michigan. But first, let's go to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's at tonight's Trump rally in Atlanta. Kristen, as the Trump camp faces backlash for that New York City rally last night, what is the former president saying today?",

Georgia is a state that is critical to this election, but it's also a state where early voting has begun. So, what they are doing is they are targeting various groups to make sure that they are hitting the polls ahead of that November 5th election today. It was faith leaders. We've seen them do this with women and other various groups.And as you noted, comes at a time where Donald Trump's team is really facing an enormous amount of backlash, not just from Democrats, but also from some Republicans over controversial comments that were not made by the former president but actually by speakers before the former president even took the stage last night at Madison Square Garden. We heard a series of vulgar, sexist and racist remarks by various Trump allies that caused really an uproar among both Democrats and, again, some Republicans. Take a listen to just some of what was said. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, I would argue that the Harris campaign has sort of been struggling to find their footing in Pennsylvania, which I believe is a must-win state for either side. You've now given the Harris campaign an opportunity to potentially target that demographic with ads, Spanish and English, to be able to put their door-knockers and focus on heavy Puerto Ricans communities to turn them up -- turn them out, rather.So if you're looking at a one to two percent marginal turnout among Puerto Ricans along, the math tells you that that would potentially be enough for the vice president to win that state. So, it was an unnecessary, unforced error. And I do think it was smart for the campaign to disavow it, to step away and say, hey, this guy doesn't represent us, but my word of caution would be, at this late in the game, you just do not want to make these types of mistakes, Wolf, because every single vote will count, particularly on the margins.",

If you look here in the Tucson area, Joe Biden won that county by more than 90,000 votes. If you're going to win a state by just 10,000, you need some places where you run it up to offset Trump support in the rural areas. That happened down there in Pima County. So, you see the activity now. Trump has no expectation of winning in Pima County. He'd like to win here in Maricopa. But in the places that he knows are deep blue, Trump's challenge, especially in the suburban areas, just try to improve his number sum. That's what we're watching for to see if that happens when we start counting votes more than a week from now.",

One of them is Pima County, which I just showed you, which voted Democratic by overwhelming. That is by far the most populated of the counties along the border.So, the people who live immigration, live the border crisis, live the stress every day, well, in two of the four counties in Arizona, they vote Democrat by big numbers. Now, that is not to say they don't want more border security. That is not to say they don't want the chaos gone and a more organized immigration system, a guest worker program, some other way. They want all of those things. But they don't like -- most of them, don't like the former president's tone, because a lot of them have relatives in Mexico, have Mexican heritage themselves.

Things he was receiving from soldiers from European presidents after 9/11, all of those things of value he has, he must turn over to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the two Georgia election workers he defamed and who he owes $150 million to.In court today is the discussion, the beginning of the discussion over what happens to two pieces of property he's trying to raise arguments to keep. A condo in Palm Beach that he says he shouldn't be able to give to them because he lives there now. They can test that. They say that it's primarily a vacation home. He's not there very often and then the other thing he has for championship rings from the World Series in the '90s and in 2000 around the time he was mayor. The argument in court is that he gave those to his son a few years ago, and even though he still wears the ring from the subway series, they are his son's. Now, the Ruby Freeman/Shaye Moss legal team, they are trying to get as much information out of Giuliani as possible, but he has dodged them many times. They can't see tax returns that might show the gifts. They can't figure out just yet in court if he actually lives in Florida. So all of that is going to come to a head in the next couple of days, even weeks, he's turning over all of the rest of that property within 24 hours and just a portrait wolf of how far Giuliani has fallen. This is a hearing where a judge is ordering him to turn over millions in a courthouse where he was once the top prosecutor and it has his picture from the opening of that courthouse when he was the mayor -- Wolf.",

These are both states that conduct their elections predominantly by mail. And of course, in Washington, we have seen this very hotly contested congressional race and Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez put out a statement. She's one of the candidates, of course, in this hotly contested race saying, I'm requesting an overnight law enforcement presence be posted at all ballot drop boxes in Clark County through election day, southwest Washington cannot risk a single vote being lost to arson and political violence. And, Wolf, these drop boxes, again, we don't know the exact motivation behind these efforts. They have just become targets for misinformation claimed from the right that there is ramping voter fraud that hasn't been proven out, but we have seen a Department of Homeland Security warned that these kind of drop boxes are targets for domestic violent extremists.
