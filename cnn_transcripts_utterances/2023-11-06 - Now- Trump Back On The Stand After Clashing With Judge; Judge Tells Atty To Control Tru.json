      "sentences": "Boris, in the past few moments, the assistant attorney general questioning Trump has focused on questions about his net worth, because at the heart of this case is an accusation that Trump lied about his net worth to get more favorable terms on loans for certain properties, as well as also allegedly lying to insurance companies to get more favorable terms.So these questions focused on his net worth are significant, and he has testified that he was worth around $2.5 billion. They also suggested his net worth could be even more than that. But the Attorney General is accusing him of actually having a net worth that is much less than what he disclosed in these loan applications. He also talked about how much cash he had on hand. For one loan, he said he had $50 million, boasting that he had quite a bit of cash at that time. He suggests that his net worth was exactly what it needed to be. He's also emphasizing with some loans that they were paid back, that there was no victim. And he said on the stand a short time ago, the reason he is in court right now is because of \"politics.\" Now, the past hour or so has been much more focused, much more productive for the Attorney General's office than the earlier part of the day, which was quite chaotic as the judge continued to interrupt Trump, insisting that he give yes or no answers, admonishing him for what the judge described as speeches and essays, which then set off disagreements between Trump's lawyers and the Attorney General's office. After a short break, the judge really took a different approach to today's testimony. He's no longer interrupting Trump, letting him talk. Sometimes his lawyers might feel at his own peril, but things are moving along and they're going down the list of properties that are at the heart of this case.",

The judge has already found Trump and his co-defendants liable for fraud. They're focused now mostly on the penalties, what he will incur for this alleged fraud. They've said they're going to appeal this.But what you saw today was likely the former president trying to really get the judge to interrupt him enough to then try to argue that he didn't get a chance to talk. He didn't get a chance to testify fully. He didn't get a chance to answer the questions accurately. It did appear, especially in the morning half of today's proceedings, that he was trying to debate the judge. And it did appear that it was working for the first part of the morning, where the judge continued to interrupt him, even threatened to kick him out of court, and say he would draw the most negative inference possible, which means he would conclude that the testimony went as poorly as it possibly could for Trump. Remember, there's no jury here today. It is just the judge who is overseeing. And again, we expect whatever happens here will ultimately be appealed. And the former president has been answering more questions this afternoon, but he has also taken shots again at the Attorney General who's sitting there in court, as well as the judge overseeing his testimony.",

He's saying that he's a victim here, that this is a witch hunt, that the judge really effectively didn't know him and was trying to embarrass him and said, look, this is - there's no victims to this, so why is there a crime. The banks all got their money, what's the problem here. And so, we've seen a lot of drama. If the lawyers were trying to tell Trump to shut up, they failed, but they probably weren't at this point because he's going to do what he's going to do. They're going to appeal. They're trying to egg on the judge and they succeeded at some point. So they could ask for a mistrial. But - so, what we're seeing is, I think, what we expected to see. The only problem here or the interesting difference here is that both of the sons were saying we didn't have anything to do with this stuff. We didn't know about this stuff. We just signed these papers. That's what accountants are for. And Trump, who, of course, took this more personally because this is so definitional for him as to who he is, said, yes, I made suggestions and I knew things and everything I did was right. And so there's a big difference between the way his sons were talking and the way Donald Trump is talking, because he says he ran a successful and he's being persecuted for it.",

They think this is a witch hunt. And that is what he's stating on the stand there. I think it would be more effective politically if this was televised.

But the trial that Donald Trump thinks he's in is whether he lied. The value of his assets, that's already been decided. Now, why that's so important to him is really what you're talking about.

And after answering a series of very technical questions, Trump is now playing what they describe as a series of classic attacks on the Attorney General and the judge overseeing this case.Now, the assistant attorney general pleaded with Trump saying, look, we're very close to the end of this questioning. But instead, Trump attacked the state of New York, saying businesses are leaving because of cases like this. He also attacked a crime occurring in the city and called the case election interference. This has been a common refrain from the former president, insisting that he is a political martyr here, that this is part of some sort of effort to interfere in the election, even though, of course, this investigation and this case have been sort of in the pipeline since 2019. Now, it's possible this testimony could be wrapping up, but we hear from our colleagues in the courtroom that Trump went on a lengthy monologue attacking the judge and the Attorney General. And the assistant attorney general who's been doing this questioning pleaded with him, saying, \"I promise you, Mr. Trump, I'm trying to get you off the stand.\" Trump foretold, shot back, \"Great. I'm sure you are.\" Trump then complained about the very hostile judge. He also once again complained that there is not a jury overseeing this case. And then the judge, who was very active early on today, but has been quieter this week and after lunch, said that he feels like a broken record. He again asked the former president to focus on the questions. And Trump complained that the Attorney General's office kept asking him \"The same questions.\" He doesn't understand it. The subject matter of the case is what Trump is alleging about the assistant attorney general, \"because he keeps asking me the same questions.\" Now, it appears that they have gotten Trump back on track, trying to get to the heart of this case, which are questions about how he estimated his net worth when applying for loans. But that was a moment where, once again, I mean, this hearing just went off the rails. We saw this earlier this morning. But here, Trump taking this opportunity on the witness stand to attack the judge overseeing the case and the Attorney General who has brought this case.

It's one behalf of society, not an individual litigant. The reason for that is because they want people who are similarly situated to be treated appropriately and similarly. In an instance like this, if you or I or any of us go out and try to use fraudulent document to secure a loan or depreciate or (inaudible) have less tax liability, that means that I'm getting more of a benefit of a pseudo bargain. So maybe his creditors were repaid, but the average New Yorker did not have the ability to have tax documents that were forgiven, lessened or have insurance that would be higher they normally would have. That's the problem part of it. Also, his issue is about the discretion of the prosecutor. Unfortunately, in our society, there is a lot of critique surrounding those who are elected as prosecutors. I was not like that. I was a line prosecutor for federal government. But if you are running for office, you're going to actually target in your campaign certain people.

And the Republican Party, basically, the leadership basically fell down before his feet and let him have his way with the Republican Party because he has such a strong hold on the base. Some of that is cultural, some of that is class, some of that has to do with race.And in so many ways, this case fits into that, right? I mean, it sort of benefits Donald Trump that the Attorney General there is a black woman, right?

Obviously she is the Attorney General for New York, but she is about to come down these steps.And it's notable to hear what she is going to say. I can see her staff lining up at the microphones. They have just indicated that she will be coming over to speak to reporters once she is outside of the actual courthouse. She spoke briefly on her way in, and she essentially predicted what the former president was going to say before he walked into the courtroom, including at one point an attack on her. He called her a racist attorney general, something that he has often said repeatedly on social media. She noted that that was likely to come. So it will be interesting to see what she says once he comes out here, because so much of the focus today has been on the back and forth, understandably, between the judge and Trump's attorneys and Trump himself when he was on the witness stand, which he just left a few moments ago. There was no cross-examination from his own team. But also on the answers that I think that he has provided to the Attorney General's office as they are trying to make their case here, which has already been determined by the judge. But the question now is the penalties, is they have actually gotten some answers and some acknowledgement from Trump on his own involvement in detailing and putting together those financial documents that are at the heart of what the Attorney General says is fraud here, over-inflating his - or just inflating, period, his net worth and the value of these properties. And so that's a significant step there. We'll also likely hear from Donald Trump once he leaves the court. That itself - in and of itself would be notable because he did speak briefly this morning going into court. He did not speak in either of those breaks when they were coming out. So that is the question to see what she says. But she will be speaking here in a few moments once they wrap up in court, we are told.",
