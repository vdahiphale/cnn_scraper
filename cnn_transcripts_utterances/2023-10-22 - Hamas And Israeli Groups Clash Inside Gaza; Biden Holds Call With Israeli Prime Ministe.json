We begin our special coverage with new developments happening in Israel's war against Hamas and a warning, what you're about to see is graphic. New action on the ground as Israel Defense Forces say their troops clashed with Hamas fighters inside Gaza. It marks just the second time Israeli forces have confirmed operating inside the enclave since the Hamas terror attack two weeks ago. It has been another violent day across Central Gaza, where a new barrage of Israeli airstrikes hit several targets. One Gaza hospital saying they are being overwhelmed by the number of bodies. Videos obtained by CNN show dozens of dead people wrapped in shrouds surrounding the hospital. The morgue already filled to capacity. Israel also launching a rare aerial assault on a mosque in the West Bank. The IDF claims the strike thwarted an imminent terror attack, but the Palestinian Authority calls it a dangerous escalation. IDF is vowing to increase its aerial bombardment of Gaza ahead of a potential ground incursion against Hamas. With the bloodshed mounting, this afternoon, President Biden held phone calls with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu and Pope Francis. That call comes as more critical aid appears to be on the way into Southern Gaza. Fifteen trucks carrying food and supplies from Egypt are now being inspected at the Rafah border crossing, just one day after the first convoy was allowed into Gaza. Wolf, let's send it back over to you.",

And in the course of those conversations. The two leaders have talked about the ongoing support by the US to Israel, the fact that the US wants to see that innocent civilians are protected and that humanitarian aid is making its way into Gaza.Now, just yesterday, the president here in Rehoboth was asked about whether the administration is trying to delay any invasion by Israel, and to that, he said he was talking to the Israelis, so clearly a working weekend here for the president, not the only call of the day. The president also spoke to Pope Francis today, according to the White House where the two also discussed the situation in Israel and Gaza.

At the same time, families that are associated with those embassies in those two countries are coming home. Non-emergency personnel are leaving as well.

It also has very close, tight-knit streets, much of them have been demolished by airstrikes over course of the past couple of weeks. There's also that network of underground tunnels that has to be contended with, and I don't know exactly what happened today, but you know, undoubtedly, some of those factors came into play, and resulted in at least one Israeli death. And so it sort of indicates just how difficult it's going to be when there is a full scale invasion into Gaza involving a lot more Israeli soldiers -- Wolf.",

We have a very close dialogue between us and close consultations. Many questions come up during these consultations, but as the White House said, and as we said, Israel is a sovereign nation, and they do not ask us or tell us what to do.

We don't want to live under a terrorist organization. We want to live in a democracy and that's what the state of Israel is.

Hamas has never called for attacks on US soil before, but we've seen a deluge of these threats coming from ISIS, coming from al-Qaeda. Al- Qaeda rereleased every issue of inspire magazine online, these are rife with instructions on how to commit terrorist attacks. ISIS called for practical ways to support the Palestinian people in their words in articles in their magazine \"Al-Naba\" by their leader Qureshi talking about attacks on Jewish people, Jewish economic interest, Jewish nightclubs, synagogues across the world. So police are trying to figure out how to have as many people in uniform, in reserve no matter what their assignment is, in case they have to be called out in the event of either civil disorder or an attack.",

Evelyn, thanks so much for joining us. What is today's clash inside Gaza between Hamas and Israeli forces signal to you? EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Yes, I mean, it signals to me what the Israeli said that they are now moving into a new phase of their operation against the Hamas terrorist fighters, and they are going to try to root them out. It doesn't sound like they had tremendous success, at least in this skirmish, but we can expect to see more of this going forward.",

So as you know, and you and your colleagues have all been reporting, there have been attacks coming -- attacks on Israel coming from the Hezbollah from the north. There is a fear that the Hezbollah fighters might be interested in ratcheting up the pressure that could get Lebanon involved. And again, many other actors then including the United States. So that's number one.Number two is, you know, and I think you had earlier this morning, you had some excellent people on. General Petraeus, you had Defense minister and then Prime Minister Ehud Barak, they all talked about the fact that there's a lack of a strategy. You need to provide a future, a future vision to the people of Gaza, otherwise, you're going to lose in the long run. Israel cannot occupy Gaza, so they need to have a transition plan, a political transition plan, and launching into a full scale operation without knowing how it's going to end is very risky.",

Israel has to destroy Hamas, destroy the terrorist organization, but it cannot do that and then create a whole another opposition. So they have to, again, as I said, offer the people of Gaza and frankly, the Palestinian people writ large, a hope for a better future so that maybe they won't turn against Israel and certainly broadening the conflict is very dangerous because the Israeli military is not as strong as it should be at this point in time for various reasons, most of them political.",
