      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, one on aschool, the other at a market. We are live on the ground in central Gaza as rescuers dig with their bare hands looking for survivors. Plus, it is day two of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and it's kicking off with some of the biggest names in the party. We're live with the latest from the DNC. But first, tonight, new developments in Gaza today are a really a grim reminder of all the lives that are at stake as a ceasefire and hostage release proposal languishes on the table. Rescuers dug with their bare hands through crushed concrete near Gaza city, looking for survivors after an Israeli strike hit a school sheltering families. Gaza Civil Defense says at least 12 people were killed, mostly women and children. Israel says it conducted a precise strike on militants operating inside the school. Disturbing scenes in Deir al Balah as well -- have a look at this, where as officials say at least six people were killed in a strike on a market. Israel meantime has just released video of its operations to recover the bodies of six hostages. It says soldiers found them in Hamas tunnels in Khan Younis, all but one hostage had previously been declared dead. Hostage families are urgently renewing their call for the government to finalize a ceasefire deal now to bring the remaining   hostages home. And in the meantime, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is shoring up regional support for the latest proposal that aims to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas. He is now in Doha after meeting with Egypt's President -- you can see there in Cairo. Well, our former CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon is on the ground in Gaza, she's now the President and the Co-founder of the nonprofit organization, International Network for Aid Relief and Assistance. And she witnessed the aftermath of that strike that we were telling you there in Deir al Balah. She joins us now. So, Arwa, you're on the ground, you saw casualties coming in outside Al-Aqsa, just give us a sense of what you saw. ARWA DAMON, PRESIDENT &amp; FOUNDER, INTERNATIONAL NETWORK FOR AID RELIEF &amp; ASSISTANCE:  Yes, I happened to be at Al-Aqsa Hospital, which is just a constant flow of, you know, families going to pick up the bodies of the dead, you know, people who are injured, sick, and then all of a sudden, the intensity that you see kind of at Al-Aqsa amps up significantly as these ambulances just start roaring and people crowding around them. We saw a number of children who were being carried out. I saw two children who were very bloodied, being very quickly carried away. Women are screaming and wailing. I saw one woman being carried away on a stretcher. I saw a man with a very severe leg jury. And you know, as tragic and as horrifying as seeing that is, what makes it even worse, Isa, is what I know because I was inside Al-Aqsa the day before, speaking to the head of the ICU. They don't have enough bandages. They have people who are getting infections because they don't have something as basic as sufficient bandages. There's a little girl right now in the ICU who is a year-and-a- half old, she needs to be stabilized so that she can be moved to another facility to have surgery there. But they can't do that because there's a very sort of basic tracheostomy or something too, but that they don't have in the right size for her. This is a very sort of run-of-the-mill piece of equipment, but they don't have it. And when it comes to this little girl, when she wakes up, she's going to find out that she's an orphan. The rest of her family, her parents or siblings, they're all dead. And so, you stand there and you look at this sort of, you know, flow of bodies of ambulances that's coming into a space like Aqsa, and it's really heartbreaking to realize the many different layers of the tragedies that unfold here on a daily basis. It's those who are dying and being injured every single day. And it's those who are reaching the hospital, and hospitals are limping along, barely able to provide patients what it is that they need.",

And normally,when you think of triage, you think of it as being, you know, sort of in the moments after, you know, something devastating takes place. But doctors in Gaza are having to triage all the time. One of the doctors that we were speaking to has given us an example of how there was a little girl with severe pneumonia that needed to be admitted to the ICU. And he actually very sort of painfully spoke about how initially they don't want to admit this girl to the ICU. Because her treatment, they were estimating would probably take around two to three weeks, and if they kept that bed free, if she wasn't occupying that bed in that two to three weeks span, they estimate that they can probably turn over 6-7 patients. So, he had to make -- and they have to make these calculations all the time. Now in her case in particular, she was actually eventually admitted to the ICU, but it's just an example of what happened. Now, I was at Al Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, which is absolutely -- I mean, devastated, crushed, apocalyptic earlier today. And they are the doctors, the head of the pediatric unit is talking about how they make the same calculus all the time. They are discharging patients that should not be discharged, because there is not enough space. And they're having to decide when it comes to saving someone's life if it's actually going to be worth investing the time to do that. And if they don't do that, how many other lives can they save, you know, in exchange for it? It's an impossible situation. And I just want to quote what one doctor said to me. He said, when we're in the hospital, we have to harden our hearts, but every day when we go home, all we do is cry.",

You've been -- you and I have had this conversation. You've been to Gaza numerous times, and you are seeing, Arwa, firsthand, the devastating toll the war continues to take on innocent Palestinians here. And those are going into hospitals, but those are staying outside of hospitals also facing equally dire situations. I mean, we were reporting that polio, it's been detected in Gaza for the first time in 25 years. Just speak to the conditions. We're looking at your video now from inside central Gaza.",

      "sentences": "So, let me put it to you this way. There are so few hygiene products that are coming in, that doctors at the hospital are having to goout and buy their own soap. A bar of soap, which should have cost, you know, 50 cents on the market, cost around $10 to $15. Hygiene is something that everybody is struggling with, because no hygiene kits are getting in, and what's available on the market is atrociously expensive, overpriced, and frankly, not very useful because it's all off- brand and stuff is getting mixed in with everything else. And what this is resulting in is a number of skin diseases. And some of the skin diseases, and you know, you and our viewers may have seen some of these videos of children in the hospital, but it basically starts off as these, like blisters and bumps, and then they pus open, they scab over. And this particular skin disease is so severe and so dangerous that if left untreated -- is also highly contagious. But if left untreated, it can result in kidney failure and kidney failure can result in death. So, there's not enough hygiene, there's not enough toilets, there's not enough clean water. The most recent evacuation orders that have been coming from parts of Khan Younis have meant that a couple of the water treatment plants, desalination plants, the water pipes that run into Deir al Balah, resulting inside Deir al Balah, evacuation orders, those have all been impacted. They're estimating that Deir al Balah and Mawasi, there's going to be a 70 percent decrease in access to clean water. Keep in mind that it was barely enough.",

Well, let's get more on the conflict really, and the latest developments when it comes to negotiations. I want to bring in CNN's Jim Sciutto who is in Tel Aviv for more. And Jim, just talk to us first about this military operation that happened overnight in Khan Younis, that led to the recovery of the six bodies of the Israeli hostages. What more can you tell us? What are you hearing from other hostages and their families? This is incredibly traumatic, of course, for them.",

Prior to this operation, the Israeli military was aware that five of the six were already dead, and then they found that the sixth was dead as well when they conducted this operation. I think it's important to say their names at a moment like this. They are, Yoram Metzger, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Chaim Peri, Nadav Popplewell and Yagev Buchshtab, six more, and now that brings down to the number of hostages remaining in Gaza to 109, the vast majority of whom was taken -- were taken October 7th. But keep in mind that of that number, the Israeli military believes quite a large number. They haven't specified exactly is also dead. And that's the pressure, right, Isa, you hear that the reaction of families today for ten months, they've been calling not just for operations, but for a negotiation to get their loved ones home. And it's in the midst of negotiations to do just that in addition to establishing a ceasefire in Gaza. But those negotiations are not advancing at a particularly fast pace. In fact, it's hard to find the news of concrete progress in those talks. And as it extends, as those negotiation extends, it becomes more likely that you have situations like today, right? That the military is bringing home hostages lost, and not hostages that could be reunited with their families. It's a -- it's a tremendous disappointment to the families themselves, but also to Israelis who have been protesting, and they were protesting in recent days for a deal for some time now.",

And keep in mind when the U.S. Secretary of State says that the U.S. and Israel agree on this proposal. Hamas is not. And to your point, Hamas has said, and the way they described it today is that the U.S. and Israel and including the U.S. President are sharing misleading claims that do not reflect the true position of Hamas in these talks. And I will say that this allegation that the Israeli Prime Minister is moving the goal post here, it's not confined to Hamas on the other side of the table. You've heard some criticism here in Israel, and it seems to relate to a number of issues -- I'll give you an example of one of them, and that is, who controls, who provides security at the Philadelphi Corridor along the border between Gaza and Egypt? Because part of the proposal as we knew it was that Israel would no longer provide that security. They would find another mechanism to do so. But it appears that the Israeli Prime Minister is insisting on some Israeli role there. And you heard that, Isa, in his statement to hostage families today, where he said that yes, we want to get the hostages home. But I, the Prime Minister will not give up what he called Israel's strategic security assets.

To U.S. politics, after -- to the past, Democratswill focus on the future for day two of the convention in Chicago. An adviser to Barack Obama says the former president would deliver a forceful affirmation for Vice President Kamala Harris when she takes the stage as a keynote speaker in just a few hours. Also speaking tonight, former first lady Michelle Obama and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. Meantime, Harris and running mate Tim Walz will be in Milwaukee for a campaign rally at the same arena, the same arena Republicans held their convention last month. CNN's national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny joins us now from the convention in Chicago. So, Jeff, we're expected to hear really tonight from two -- well, I think it's fair to say the biggest stars, right? And one of the most eloquent speakers -- say both eloquent speakers. What are we likely to hear from the Obamas? What is the focus here? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  But there is no doubt that there's Democratic audience certainly here in their hometown of Chicago is very excited and there's high anticipation for the speeches from former first lady Michelle Obama and former President Barack Obama. I'm told Michelle Obama's speech is going to be much shorter, largely, an introduction for former President Obama. But former President Obama's speech is going to be the capstone of the evening, really making the argument, making the case for the election of Vice President Harris. He has a bit of a long relationship with her. It was 20 years ago this Summer that she was actually in the audience as a young district attorney in San Francisco watching his breakout convention speech when he sort of began rising through the ranks of the Democratic Party. She endorsed him early on as a presidential candidate. He helped her in her race, and now he's become one of her most trusted advisors. But I'm told from one of his advisors that the former President sees this as an all-hands-on-deck moment for Democrats trying to, you know, certainly rally them behind her candidacy, but make the case that this is an important election and draw a stark contrast with the former President Donald Trump as well. He'll talk about the economy. He is likely to also talk about the Middle East, and he is likely to again draw that sharp contrast. This is not -- I mean, as we've seen protesters outside this convention hall to some degree, there were a couple inside here. There is division inside this Democratic Party, particularly on the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the war in Gaza. So, I do expect the former President to at least raise that, and sort of try and refocus the conversation to, would Donald Trump be better on this issue? But the big takeaway here is, this is certainly a celebratory moment as the torch was passed last evening, actually, early this morning here in Chicago with that long speech from President Biden and Kamala Harris coming on stage there to greet him. But now it's back to the business of electing her. This is a tough race to come. There is no doubt about that, but the Obamas will be front and center tonight as well as Doug Emhoff, he's the second gentleman, Vice President Harris' husband, he'll be making a personal case for her election as well.",

Now, Pokrovsk is strategic, six highways converge on the town, roads which have -- Russia took the city, would open the way to other strongholds and bring Russia closer to controlling the whole of Donetsk. So, if the core objective of the Kursk incursion was to stretch Russia so thin, it couldn't advance in Ukraine, but hasn't worked. But Ukraine has more than one goal here. Right now, they seem to be still advancing slowly in Kursk. A new video Ukraine released Tuesday showing intense fighting still ongoing, but they are also consolidating, blowing up bridges on a critical Russian supply routes, setting up a military office to handle law and order in the town of Sudzha, all that fits with the goal of holding onto a buffer zone to prevent cross-border shelling. And beyond the military goals, we also see a messaging strategy, one that President Zelenskyy made it clear Monday, is targeted in part at the West.

A general in Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps was quoted in state media as saying, time is on our side. And a waiting period for Iran's response may be prolonged. Our Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran and spoke to the former head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps earlier today about what Iran's next steps could be. And Fred joins me now.

You mentioned some of them where the spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that he believes that time is on Iran's side. There won't be any hasty action. But the other thing that we looked at very closely was also the Iranian saying that the response that is going to come may look very different than the last time Iran struck Israel, which, of course, was after the bombing of Iran's embassy compound in Damascus when they launched hundreds of drones and missiles towards Israeli territory. A lot of those were intercepted, but some of them did come through. And you are absolutely right. I did speak to the former head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who is still in the expediency council here in Iran, and he said that he believes that the response coming from the Iranians, while it's unclear when it's going to be, is going to be extremely tough. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHSEN REZAEE, FORMER IRGC HEAD (through translator):  The occupying power of Jerusalem is a regime that will continue its evil acts if it does not receive a harsh response.

On the other hand, the U.S. is facing problems regarding their own defense coasts. There has to be a ceasefire in Gaza soon. The United States and Israel should not repeat their mistakes. If in the first weeks of the Gaza war, the United States had stopped Israel and Netanyahu, the war would not extend. So, the main element of the extension of the war are the U.S. and Israel. The more this war extends, the more the United States will be damaged. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean, if you're seeing these -- there are people in the crowd who are intent on agitating and they see that they're quickly placed under arrest and may face charges and prosecution pretty quickly, they may be less inclined to cause problems like that, which would preserve the real right of those other protesters who did protest peacefully to march through the city and exercise their First Amendment right. And what Chicago police have made clear is that they and they did as much, and they could to try to allow these protesters enough space, enough time to voice their concerns. That yesterday was a pro-Palestinian march. And like I said, the police had anticipated that march. And so, they wanted to give that march enough space. And of these 3,500 people that came out, it was really just, you know, a couple dozen or so people that ended up breaching this fence and causing a problem.

According to Reuters, the victim has been identified as onboard chef Recaldo Thomas, an Antigua citizen. Expert divers are carrying out search operations. Among those missing, British tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch. Our Barbie Nadeau has the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over):  A dream Mediterranean holiday turned deadly when a luxury yacht carrying VIPs was hit by a water spout early Monday morning off the coast of Sicily. Of the 22 passengers and crew on board, at least 15 people survived. Divers searched through the night to recover those trapped in the sunken vessel. On board tech titan Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, Morgan Stanley Chairman, Jonathan Bloomer, and prominent attorney, Chris Morvillo, and their wives, an official told CNN. Lynch's wife, whose company owned the 56-meter yacht, survived. All the passengers were guests of Lynch who was acquitted of fraud charges in the U.S. over the sale of his company. A local fisherman who was waiting out the storm saw the ill-fated yacht. FABIO CEFALU, FISHERMAN (through translator):  We waited about 10 minutes to see the intensity of the tornado, and we went out to sea. We were first to give rescue, but we found no one at sea. We only found cushions and the remains of the boat. NADEAU (voice-over):  The luxury yacht, 72-meter, 236-foot aluminum mast snapped in the storm, sending 15 people into the sea, including a one-year- old girl whose mother carried her above her head in the waves, she told reporters. The survivors, including all 10 crew members, were rescued by a nearby sailboat who found them in a lifeboat.",
