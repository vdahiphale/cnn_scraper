The NYPD is coordinating closely with the Secret Service and other federal agencies to protect both the former president and the crowds that may show up to protest.More now from CNN's Shimon Prokupecz. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  With an unprecedented indictment comes immense security challenges. The NYPD, along with court officers, U.S. marshals, and the United States Secret Service, are running through logistics of how Tuesday's historic arraignment of the former president will go down. Tonight, law enforcement sources telling CNN officials are conducting a dry run of Trump's movements, including his motorcade route to the courthouse in downtown Manhattan where he is expected to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon, how he will get inside the courtroom flanked by Secret Service, and what will the arrest process look like. Will he be treated like any other defendant? The former president expected to be fingerprinted and photographed for a mugshot. It's a massive effort starting when Trump arrives by plane Monday securing Trump Tower, the court, and the motorcade route.",

So far, the mayor's office says there are no credible threats to the city. And out of an abundance of caution every member of the NYPD -- some 35,000 officers -- are reporting for duty in uniform and prepared for mobilization.",

Up with us this morning let's bring in senior contributor at Axios, Margaret Talev.So, all right, let's start here. The Trump campaign says the team raised more than $5 million in 48 hours following the indictment. Do you think the case in Manhattan benefits his political campaign even if he is charged because he does seem to be leaning into the legal trouble here? MARGARET TALEV, DIRECTOR, DEMOCRACY, JOURNALISM AND CITIZENSHIP INSTITUTE, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, good morning. Yes, I -- look, I think the early indications are that in a perspective GOP primary they have given the former president a boost. You've seen poll after poll showing his lead over Ron DeSantis who is not yet a candidate but is expected to be widening. And you saw those fundraising numbers -- the campaign telling Axios' Mike Allen that a quarter of the initial contributions within that first 24 hours of the indictment had come from first-time contributors. So one of the big questions is can Donald Trump actually gain any voters? It appears in the base he can gain new donors at least. But I think that's a separate question from how would it set him up as a general election candidate. And we're seeing other new polling -- IPSOS-ABC the most recent -- showing that Democrats and the plurality of Independents do favor charges being brought in this case and prospectively in other cases around January 6, around the 2020 election, and that's before any of the evidence comes out. So I think politically, Donald Trump is leaning into it. You're seeing him make plans for a big event at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday after his arraignment to message around us. But its early implications for the primary is really all we have a glimpse at right now.",

He's saying the office is more important than any individual. This will be a distraction.I think it's easy for us to forget -- because he's been a two-term governor, a member of Congress, D.A., administrator -- that Asa Hutchinson was also a U.S. attorney and was also a prosecutor in the 1980s under the Ronald Reagan administration, and so he does have kind of that law enforcement perspective on these cases. And while he's been sort preemptively critical, like he doesn't like the case based on what we know about it so far and that sort of thing, he's also been different than the rest of the Republicans to that point because he's saying that the process has to work itself out. The criminal justice system must be allowed to work.
