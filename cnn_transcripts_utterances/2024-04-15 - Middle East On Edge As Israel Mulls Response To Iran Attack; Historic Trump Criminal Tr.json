The cabinet was mulling both military as well as diplomatic response. Israel says it intercepted nearly all of its missiles fired by Iran.

And really the concern is that it's about the nature of Israel's response. Now, it's important to keep in mind that most of the regimes -- and I'm not talking about his but non-state actors, but most Arab regimes have no love for the Iranian regime, but they are really concerned about the nature of Israel's response. We saw that Jordan, Saudi Arabia, others either were directly involved in the defense of Israel or provided critical Intelligence heads-up, for instance, that something was coming. But what they don't want to see is a full-out and all-out war as Jeremy was talking about. Now, we heard over the weekend, for instance, Israeli officials telling CNN that they're mulling two possibilities, either in the words of one Israeli official, breaking all the dishes, or a more measured response. If it is pinpoint, very measured, perhaps the Israelis can take the box and say, OK, we did it, we took revenge on the Iranians. Now, let's move on. But if it's a question of breaking all the dishes, then all options are open, and obviously, Hezbollah, which until now has been limited, its actions against Israel to really the border area.

And it probably is no coincidence that several major countries with major militaries like the U.S., the U.K. and France, and of course, Jordan as well, had planes in the air, as did the Israelis, ready to intercept a lot of these drones and some of those cruise missiles also. So this was definitely not a surprise attack that the Iranians carried out. And I think that these combined forces obviously were able to take down, as John Kirby put it there, 99 percent of those weapons. But I think for the Iranians, it really was more a show of force than anything else and sending a message. I thought it was quite interesting some of the things that we heard from the Revolutionary Guard Corps over the weekend, with the head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps saying they had originally planned for a larger strike against Israel, but then had revised that to only try and hit the air base from which they believe that strike on Iran's embassy compound in Damascus was carried out. And of course, there seems to be minor damage at that base. However, the Iranians are also saying that they believe that their strike was actually more successful than they would have thought that it would be. And I think that the points that they say that they were trying to prove in all of this is that they can strike back, they have the weapons to strike back, they have the precision to strike back. But they're also saying, and this is some of the messaging that we're seeing, especially from the foreign ministry, that they did -- they do believe that they did show restraint, that they don't want all this to spiral out of control into some larger war. However, of course, we also do have those warnings from the Iranians that if there is a large strike by the Israelis, that then the Iranians would also not show any restraint anymore either.",

So the fear, ofcourse, as you say, Fred, is that it becomes a tit-for-tat and this escalates further. Frederik Pleitgen for us there in Berlin. Thank you very much, Fred. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden's pledging ongoing support for Israel, but he also says the US will not take part in any type of offensive against Iran. Here's what Secretary of State Antony Blinken had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have been coordinating a diplomatic response to seek to prevent escalation. Strength and wisdom need to be the same sides -- the different sides of the same coin. I've been in close communication with counterparts in the region and we will continue to do so in the hours and days ahead. We don't seek escalation, but we'll continue to support the defense of Israel and to protect our personnel in the region. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jury selection is just getting underway in the New York courtroomjust behind me here in downtown Manhattan for what is an historic case. The first group of potential jurors has just been sworn in. They are in the courtroom. They're going to begin facing questions. There are a total of some 200 jurors in the courthouse today for these proceedings. Twelve New Yorkers, six alternates will ultimately be seated. Jurors will be vetted through questions that could signal, or at least intended to signal, any political views or biases against the former president. This is going to take some time. Earlier, attorneys argued over Trump's social media posts. What evidence and testimony will be allowed during this trial? Former president was in the courtroom. He was read his rights and has barely spoken, only answering yes three times in the court record. We have been speaking all day about the unprecedented activity happening in that New York courthouse right now as jury selection is underway. It is the first ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. CNN's Brian Todd gives us a closer look at exactly how this historic case against Donald Trump came to be. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It wasn't until almost 12 years after the affair allegedly occurred that the world first learned of the allegations of hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. In January 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that in the weeks before the 2016 election, Donald Trump had arranged a $130,000 payment to the adult film star to keep her from publicly discussing their alleged 2006 encounter. Later, former Trump attorney Michael Cohen testified that Trump directed him to make payments to Daniels, \"For the principal purpose of influencing the election.\" And that Trump later reimbursed him. Cohen served jail time for campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments and gave jarring testimony to Congress. MICHAEL COHEN, DONAL TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. TODD (voice-over): Donald Trump has always denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels. In April 2018, Trump was asked by reporters about hush money.",
