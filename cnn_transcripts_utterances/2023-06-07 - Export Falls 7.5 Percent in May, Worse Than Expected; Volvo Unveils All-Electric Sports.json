Great to be back with you this Wednesday and plenty coming upthis hour including another humanitarian crisis tens of thousands of people at risk after a crucial dam collapse is in Russian occupied Southern Ukraine. Many still trapped in their homes and hundreds of thousands now without drinking water, and what the President has described as an environmental catastrophe, the very latest just ahead. Plus teed off started golf is grumbling over the secrecy surrounding a monster sporting tie-up. Saudi backed LIV Golf is now joining forces with the PGA Tour. The deal also ending what had become a bitter legal and moral let's be clear battle, we'll have a live report on the latest. And Volvo's show the auto giant rolling out its latest fully electric SUV in Europe. A vehicle they say closes the pricing gap between EVs and combustion engine cars. Volvo cars CEO Jim Rowan will reveal all later on the show. And speaking of the road ahead Wall Street struggling to get into first gear, U.S. futures and European stocks little changed after a weaker Asian handover disappointing Chinese export data not helping its raising new fears about Chinese growth and the demand pull from elsewhere in the world, details on that just ahead. And the S&amp;P 500 however begins the session at 9 month highs and close to bull market levels once again. The NASDAQ also at 14 month highs, take a look at that. Small caps have actually been outperforming us too. Also today the Turkish Lira hitting fresh all-time lows versus the dollar. You can see that the dollar higher up by around 5.5 percent versus the Turkish Lira. One reason being cited is the lack of dollar reserves available in Turkey to support the currency what you have to do is you sell dollars and you buy Lira. But if you don't have enough dollars to sell, well, then you can't support your currency. Ultimately, what you end up having to do, of course, is raise interest rates. Lots to get to today, as always, but we do begin with the latest from Ukraine and mass evacuations underway following Tuesday's collapse of a major dam. As I've already mentioned, more than 1500 people forced to leave their homes in Southern Ukraine. And fears also rising over an ecological catastrophe too to \"President Zelenskyy\", he called it an environmental bomb of mass destruction. Fred Pleitgen has the latest from Kherson.",

In fact, just yesterday, when we were here we were I'd say about 100, maybe 150 yards in that direction, that entire area is inundated you can't go there anymore. At the same time the rescue efforts are ongoing to free people from their houses, people where the water rose so quickly that they couldn't get out. And you can see police here, the Army's here they have some boats here, and they've been trying to get some people out. Now, this isn't an operation that was ongoing throughout the entire night. That's what the authorities were telling us that they would not rest but it's also one that was ongoing under nearly constant shelling. We were hearing that the entire night. We've been doing it throughout the entire day is up there. Shelling seems to be coming from multiple rocket launching systems, but also from artillery as well. And as you can see, if you go over here, it's not only people that are being saved from the buildings here from a lot of animals as well. There are a lot of cats here in these cages and -- rescuers coming here and then -- to greet them and they picked up from maybe a fence or maybe a rooftop obviously a lot of those animals also very much in danger as are the people who are still caught in that area.

But here we are it was just last week that we got some manufacturing data. And we saw a decline. In fact, one of the effective was actually the worst weakest manufacturing quarter period, since the COVID lock downs were lifted last December. So there are challenges, certainly with the import, export market. But we also heard from an analyst who pointed out that right now, China is still dealing with a weak property market. And as well as another wave of COVID, that is coming across the country and then also, the youth unemployment still very high. And that is also slowing things down.

But with so many people taking this a record number of students hoping for higher education, it does pose this question, well, what happens after graduation with so many highly educated people there? Will there be enough jobs? One concern in the education sphere in China has been a mismatch of education levels and jobs. Now, if you're graduating a very highly educated workforce, and there are only so many positions, that is going to create a whole other series of problems. But nonetheless, this is a very important time in China. There are restrictions about noise there are students who are lighting incense. They're going to temples to pray for high performance.

They're telling me that the risk of a 2023 recession is fading fast. I think that people got to euphoric, Julia, in early 2021, when the vaccines were coming out and President Biden was taking office, and they probably got too pessimistic because of high inflation and the war on high inflation and the truth was probably somewhere in between.

He has sciatica he was as you said in the hospital for an infectious bronchitis in March, if any of us had elderly parents or grandparents the sage would be very worried about them. And so of course people are concerned. But this isn't must be said not an emergency surgery per se. He was here in this hospital yesterday afternoon for a quick checkup. He conducted his audience in St. Peter's Square this morning to a full crowd. And then he came here in his car being driven obviously, not in an ambulance.

If you don't need range, you can have the smaller battery, if you don't need power, you can have the single motor. If you do want that bigger range or that more acceleration, then of course you can choose the bigger battery sizes as well.

And all of this combined will have a positive impact, let's say, and reducing those friction factors towards full scale adoption of electrification. And we see that in many markets that we see already, for example, and Volvo, we already have about 12 to 15 markets now that I've got 85 percent of every car that we sell as either a full bed, or to plug in electric hybrid. And that change has happened really just in the last year or so. We see a lot more markets now approaching the halfway point of every car that we sold. In fact, in Norway, 85 percent of cars that we sell are now fully electric. In Sweden, it's almost 40 percent. And in the Netherlands, it's 43 percent.

And that, of course, is an important topic for president of a secular state Antony Blinken to address with the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince sees himself as a big diplomat. He sees himself as somebody who can help establish a peace between Ukraine and Russia, although I don't think even he thinks he can do it in the short term. But yes, for Secretary of State Antony Blinken, there's a huge amount to talk about, talking about ISIS, talking about Sudan, and talking about Yemen. It's the Yemen and Sudan really where United States and Saudi have had sort of good commonality over the past few months. And I think that's sort of something Secretary Blinken wants to build on.",

The controversial Saudi backed live golf joining forces with the long established PGA Tour and DP World Tour. It's been billed as a moment that changes the game all over again. The new partners hadn't till now been at loggerheads. So it's a deeply divided sport now reunited. Amanda Davies joins us now on this. Amanda, there will be and there are clearly because they're expressing their views quite candidly on Twitter and across social media.

The deal established last summer has been extended three times so far. But this week, Russia said if its demands are not met, it sees no prospect for extending the deal beyond the middle of July. Moscow's demand well, the reopening of a pipeline that carries Russian ammonia to Ukrainian port for shipping. Grain exports have already fallen sharply. 33 ships sailed from Ukrainian ports last month, that's actually half as many as we saw sailing back in April. The Ukraine, just to remind you is a major grain exporter. It accounts for around 10 percent of the world's supply of wheat 15 percent of the corn market and 13 percent of world barley. Now the charity, The Hunger Project says if the Grain Deal fails, it will put millions of people at risk of severe hunger or famine. The U.N. estimates that even before the war, up to 10 percent of the world's population was threatened by hunger. Joining us now CEO of The Hunger Project, Tim Prewitt. Tim, thank you so much for making time for us. As we were just describing there, the Russians, at least at this stage are threatening the end of the deal.

Now, if prices stay high, that means people simply buy less food and if people live on $2 a day or less, and they spend more than 70 percent of their income on food, that means going with less food.

It's called pre harvest loss or just post- harvest loss, where they're not getting all of the food into the hands of the consumers. Either way, if you take up all that food loss and food waste, and you calculate the impact on the environment, it would be as big as a carbon emitter as the third largest country in the world behind the U.S. and China.

How he convinced that it came out from some form of phone hacking. But what you had was the Mirror lawyer going through each and every story suggesting that there could have been a different source to that story, which wasn't through phone hacking. So that was that how things sort of progressed throughout this and it got increasingly more lively, if you'd like as it got towards the end of the cross examination. Harry has a much broader point here is that a lot of these stories were very suspicious. He had a lot of experience of these types of stories and he felt they were suspicious, and they whiffed of hacking. It will be for the justice side, whether or not any evidence was really proved about that hacking and whether anything could be upheld against the mirror, they absolutely deny all of these charges. The cross examination is now over. And now reporters who are accused of publishing hacking stories are being cross examined by Harry's lawyer. So the case does continue.
