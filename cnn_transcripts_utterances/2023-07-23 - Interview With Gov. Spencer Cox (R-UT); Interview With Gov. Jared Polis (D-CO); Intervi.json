That has effectively frozen the Republican primary race while candidates wait to see just what exactly special counsel Jack Smith might have uncovered about the party's front-runner. Today, I will talk with the two most powerful people inside the Capitol during the January 6 attacks, the then-House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who worked to coordinate a police and military response to the riot, and former Vice President Mike Pence, who refused pressure by Donald Trump to overturn the election.

I believe that that's covered by the existing exceptions that I have acknowledged. But -- but I have just known so many cases where early diagnosis or an early DNA test suggests that a child may not go to term, and then, because of the courageous decisions of mothers and fathers, they have gone forward and been blessed with a healthy baby at the end of that pregnancy.

      "sentences": "Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION.Vice President Kamala Harris talking about the Florida Board of Education's new standards for how black history should be taught in public schools. My panel joins me now. Karen Finney, I know that you have heard a lot of Democrats over the past two-and-a-half years saying, the vice president needs to get out there more, where's Kamala, all of those things. What do you make of this? KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  It was a stellar moment. And I think she did something that she has done often in the last couple of years, which is, in a moment when something needed to be said, she got out there and said it and really channeled what people were feeling. And the idea that we would literally have a conversation -- I mean, I have to laugh, it's so disgusting -- that there were personal benefits of any kind to slaves, that's like saying, know, we're happy when we couldn't vote and we couldn't have our own banking account. It's just ridiculous. She's done -- she's had these moments, when she's talked about reproductive freedom, when she went down to Tennessee after the shooting and the two gentlemen were expelled from the legislature. I mean, she's been able to, in these moments, speak to what people are feeling. I think we're going to see a lot more of it throughout this campaign. We're going to see her on the road talking about these issues and reminding us that that literally, as we're talking about the economy, and we're talking about the progress that the Biden/Harris administration has made, there are also very real serious issues at stake in terms of who gets to be part of our democracy.",

Like, we can disagree as black people as well. I think what the bigger picture is, is that this is happening in Florida. This is happening in a Florida where you have a governor who has an anti-woke bill, who has a don't say gay bill, who wants to ban DEI problems, who wants to do -- wants to ban Rosa Parks. And now you have -- children reading Rosa Parks or other academic books that talk about a diversity of issues. I think, at this panel, we can all agree that slaves did not benefit from slavery, even if the citation says, well, they might have gotten something -- but they didn't have a choice, so that's not a benefit. Slaves did not have the freedom to choose if -- Ron DeSantis said maybe they could have become a blacksmith, not when they didn't have the choice to become a blacksmith. And so that was what Kamala Harris is saying. And I hope, in this moment, when we have such a contentious political environment, that we can all agree that slavery was not a good thing and slaves did not benefit, and then we could move on. But the problem is, the governor, who is the second in the polls for the Republican nomination, won't do that.",

Sorry. That's South Carolina. Let's do that first, Donald Trump 48 percent, Nikki Haley 14 percent, Ron DeSantis 13 percent. And then let's also look at Iowa, 46, DeSantis 16. I mean, it's not even close. Donald Trump is by far and away the front-runner, even more so than he was before. Miles Taylor, you are here. You have a new book called \"Blowback.\" And you talk about what happened when you were working inside the Trump administration. I want to look at it as it pertains to a potential second Trump term. And you said\" \"The aids that guarded the book,\" meaning -- you're talking about something called the Doomsday Book -- \"were concerned about the president reading it or MAGA allies around him getting ahold of it, because, especially towards the end of the administration, they witnessed the president's proclivity to abuse his authorities for political purposes, and especially as he started to signal that the 2020 election might be stolen or he could be cheated.\" MILES TAYLOR, AUTHOR, \"BLOWBACK: A WARNING TO SAVE DEMOCRACY FROM THE NEXT TRUMP\":  Well, to your point about the polls, I want to say that I do think that Donald Trump is stronger than he was politically in 2016. I mean, the odds markets had him at 9 percent of winning the presidency in 2016. Right now, the betting markets have him at something like 30 percent or above. And it's confounding, I think, to a lot of people that the twice-indicted, soon-to-be-probably-thrice- indicted, Donald Trump would be the leader in the field. But we have to then, if that's the case, really think in a clear-eyed way about what a second term would look like. And you point to what's called the Doomsday Book. When I was at the Department of Homeland Security, one of the things we were responsible for was continuity of government, the most extraordinary presidential powers that could be used in the case of armed foreign invasion or nuclear attack. Now, I didn't find out until I was talking to former colleagues about this book that Donald Trump wasn't aware of some of those authorities, but now he is. And if returned to the White House, those are the types of things he wish he'd known about during the January 6 insurrection.",

As long as half the party that doesn't want to do Donald Trump remains fragmented by all these other candidates, he's going to be nearly impossible to defeat. So the only real question about this primary is, unless he collapses, which I don't know if that's likely or not, is, how quickly can you get it down to a two-person race, and -- after Iowa? And, also, if he wins Iowa by more than a handful of points, does that just functionally end the race at that point?",
