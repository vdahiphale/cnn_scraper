That didn't spread as wildly and as far because we didn't have the internet back in the 70s.Listen, make no mistake about it, that ebbs and flows, right, the Black Panther movement, there were lots and lots of movements in the 70s because of a perception of inequality in America. I think maybe that's what's happening now, just sort of a different version. People feel there's inequality in America in some way. And so, that gives rise to these different groups.

A spokesman for Cosby calls the lawsuit -- quote -- \"frivolous,\" saying in a statement -- quote -- \"As we have always stated and now America see that this isn't about justice for victims of alleged sexual assault but it's all about money. We believe that the courts as well as the court of public opinion will follow the rules and law and relieve Mr. Cosby of these alleged accusations. Mr. Cosby continues to vehemently deny all allegations waged against him and looks forward to defending himself in court.\" Joining us now is Jordan Merson. He's the lawyer representing the five women accusing Cosby. Jordan, thank you so much for being here. So, I understand that this new law in New York suddenly gives these women the opportunity to try to hold Bill Cosby accountable for what they say he did in sexually assaulting them. But some of their accusations go back decades. So, three of the women's cases go back to the 1980s, one goes back to the 1960s. How do you plan to present evidence to prove your case?",

And back with us, Elie Honig and Kierna Mayo as well.So important because -- just unpack a little bit for us, Elie, this law, as to why this does not go against some of the issues that Alisyn raised. The idea of due process considerations, the idea of statute limitations. Why can this be possible? The general idea of a statute limitations in criminal law or civil law, here we're talking civil side, is that you'll only have a certain amount of time in which to bring a lawsuit. Interest of fairness, interest of finality. But this has been carved out by New York State, has an exception. And the reason is exactly what you were talking about, Alisyn, I think the lawyer was just talking about, it is so difficult for survivors, victims of sexual assault and violence to come forward. Even now. We've got much better at this now. But even now, it's extraordinarily difficult. Now, put yourself back in the mindset -- in the 80s and 70s. I'm certainly old enough to remember how Bill Cosby was regarded back then. He had 100% popular approval rating. And imagine being a young woman back then and having this alleged incident happen. It's virtually unthinkable to come forward. And so, the New York State legislature has said, we're going to give this brief window where you can revive these old cases. But as Alisyn was asking the lawyer, it is more difficult. It's really, really hard to prove allegations that go back to the 80s or the 60s.",

It was a mistrial. They re-tried it again the next year, which would've been 2018. He was convicted of all counts.

They just couldn't square it.But 50, some say 60, 62 women later, I think there's no question that there is something that must be squared. I'm no legal expert at all, but the thing that I can say, regardless of the direction that this lawsuit goes in, is that speaking of heart and soul, every time women are able to come forth, every time a new batch of women are empowered, and not just in the Cosby case, but in any case, where you're talking about a powerful man abusing or allegedly abusing women, when they feel empowered, when they find their voice, when they find their cause, their 12-month window that says, go now, it opens up the door for God knows how many other women to tell their stories, to actually maybe close the gap and how long it takes to report, because you're talking about stories of assault that happened in the 60s, 70s, 80s.
