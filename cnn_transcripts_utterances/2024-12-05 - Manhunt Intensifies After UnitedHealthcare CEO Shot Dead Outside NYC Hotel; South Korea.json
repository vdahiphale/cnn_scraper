He really made a lot of concessions to them, but those concessions were not enough. And what Marine Le Pen and her party said was basically they thought they weren't hurt. But if you look at the facts, they were very much hurt. Maybe not as much as they wanted to, but they were concessions. So this is about their party stating that they have the power topple government. That's how powerful they became in this country in terms of votes, but also in terms of seats at Parliament.

I have to say, a couple of months ago, just after the results of the last snap election, a parliament, the conversations that we had when we saw the results were if we have a parliament, a National Assembly that is split in three equal parts that do not speak to each other, he's not going to have another choice but to resign and to hold a snap presidential election.

This fragile ceasefire has seen near daily accusations of violations on both sides of this ceasefire agreement. But for now, both Israel and Hezbollah seem inclined to keep it going, even as the firing has not stopped altogether.The United States, the State Department offered a similar assessment on Tuesday, saying that this ceasefire, quote, continues to be largely holding in place despite some of the strikes that we have seen. Nearly every day of the ceasefire there have been Israeli strikes in Lebanon. The Israelis insist that what they are doing is simply enforcing this ceasefire firing after they say Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon were violating this agreement. The State Department also said that they believe that Israel still has the right to defend themselves, although they wouldn't weigh in on specific Israeli strikes and whether or not these are violations. Now, as this tenuous ceasefire is still holding in Lebanon, there are now questions about whether or not a deal to free the hostages can indeed be advanced. We are seeing that the Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Katz, says that he believes that there is a real chance of a hostage deal materializing as Hamas faces increasing pressure. The Israeli military also releasing new information about the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered in Gaza in August. At the time, the Israeli military indicated that it was likely that they had been shot by their Hamas captors. But there were questions about the role that an Israeli strike in the area in February when these hostages were in fact killed, could have played a role in their deaths. The Israeli military not offering any definitive new information, but they did say in a new report that February strike that the Israeli military carried out in Khan Younis in southern Gaza may have led to the militants to execute those six hostages. The report says, quote, it is highly probable that their deaths were related to the strike near the location where they were being held. According to the most plausible scenario, the terrorists shot at the hostages close to the time of the strike. And the findings of that IDF investigation were indeed presented to the families of those hostages on Wednesday. But the question now is for the hostages alive and dead, who remain inside of Gaza and whether or not these new talks that appear to be happening quite quietly behind the scenes will actually result in a deal.

She is someone who is pointedly undecided about whether she will get on board, and could actually vote for his nomination. She's actually someone who has endured sexual assault herself, a victim of sexual assault, and has tried to push to change the practices of how the Pentagon deals with these sexual assault claims.

He's denied those allegations, but leaving a meeting with him for about 45 minutes on Wednesday afternoon, she refused to say if she would support him for the position. She only said she had a thorough conversation and a frank conversation with him. Really would not say anything else when I asked her if she would vote for him. Now, there have also been questions about some of these allegations of misconduct, including excessive drinking on the job. He has denied that, but he did tell senators including Senator Roger Wicker, who is chair of the critical Senate Armed Services Committee that would take up his nomination, that if he's confirmed, he would no longer drink.
