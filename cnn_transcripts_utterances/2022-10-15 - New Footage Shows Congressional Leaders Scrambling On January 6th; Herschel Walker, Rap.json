One at the U.S. Capitol where violent insurrectionists sought to stop the peaceful transfer of power. Another at a nearby military base where top lawmakers fought to preserve democracy. Their goal, continue the counting of electoral votes to certify the free and fair election even if the Capitol building was off-limits. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): So let's say we finish at midnight or 1:00 in the morning, how does it? You're going to bring them all back to the Capitol and let them disperse?

More behind-the-scenes footage was released this week during a hearing by the House Select Committee investigating January 6th. The panel voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump. They want him to answer for his words and actions that led up to the insurrection.And CNN's Zachary Cohen joins me now. He's done plenty of reporting on January 6th. You know, Zachary, it's been fascinating to see how these lawmakers were working together to try to get this certification back up and running.

It's the absence of one man, Donald Trump, in all of this. I mean, we see Nancy Pelosi coordinating with members of her own party, with the vice president who was bunkered down in the U.S. Capitol while the riots are happening.

In fact, I testified seven different times. That was the only one that was live. I testified, that's right, in the SCIF, you know, six different times to three or four different congressional committees. What is it like to watch that? It breaks your heart. I mean, that's the people's house. You know I worked there in 1987 and 1988 for Congressman Joe Moakley. I love that building. Everyone should love that building. That is our house. And the fact that these people felt that they had the right within which to desecrate it, all in the name of their monarch, their king, their supreme leader, it's disgraceful.

M. COHEN: Right. So the answer to that would be good luck. You know, Trump was enjoying the spectacle. He was enjoying watching all of these people on the television with the Trump banners, the Trump flags, the MAGA hats. Why? Because they were doing it for his benefit. This is what I refer to in the book \"Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized the U.S. Department of Justice Against His Critics.\" He really wasn't just doing it against his critics, he was weaponizing the Department of Justice. He was weaponizing, you know, the government in order for his own benefit. And that's the point that I tried to make. It may seem a little bit unclear. But if you read the book, you'll understand the man does not want to be president of the United States. He wants to be an autocrat supreme leader, a dictator. And watching these people doing this on his behalf was exciting for him. He was elated from it. In fact, you may recall Don Jr. sent text messages to Mark Meadows.",

And again, I mean, I mean, people again, and Michael, you were on the other side of this in 2016, people brushed off the notion that Donald Trump could become president again. I wish people would stop saying that because he absolutely could become president again.But given what you know about how he tried to use the Justice Department to go after people, what do you think happens if he becomes president again? M. COHEN: So the unconstitutional remand of me back to Otisville when I failed to waive my First Amendment constitutional right is just part one of the Trump playbook in terms of making America into an autocracy or into a dictatorship with Donald as the leader. The first thing that they want to do is to take away your First Amendment constitutional rights. All media, like we see in Russia, is state-run and state- controlled media. The second of course is weaponizing the military or if you cannot get the military, get a paramilitary group like we saw on January 6th. What this is all about in \"Revenge\" is showing this is the playbook that failed. But now that they have the failed playbook, there is an opportunity to correct it and to make it right if in fact someone, whether it's Donald Trump or a Donald Trump 2.0, ever, you know, returned to the Oval Office. And what we are seeing right now as well. We are seeing that there are 299 elected -- well, I should say individuals that are running for elected seats that are election deniers. This is dangerous especially if, in fact, they all believe that they have to come and kiss the ring of Donald Trump in order to win the support. So whether their loyalty goes to Donald or whether it goes to America and to their constituents, that's really the big problem. And we've already seen what he knows how to do things. So we have to be extremely careful to make sure, especially come this midterm November. We have to make sure the person that ends up taking the elected spot is actually worried more about America than Donald.",

He's up three or four points. He's got to stop the deterioration.And so Democrats are putting a lot of chips in Pennsylvania. They have the advantage of a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, non-incumbent, Josh Shapiro, who's likely to win handily and maybe can help pull Fetterman in. But the Republicans know if they lose their seat -- the incumbent is a Republican. If they lose their seat in Pennsylvania, it really puts them behind the eight ball. Then they have to gain two Democratic seats. They're focusing on Georgia and Nevada. But Georgia is no longer a sure thing for them at all. In fact, Warnock seems to be a little bit ahead.

In his tweet today, he's saying, the hell with it, we will keep funding Starlink in Ukraine, despite the fact that they are still losing money.Now, let's remind our viewers that what we have been reporting is that the company that runs Starlink in Ukraine, the satellite internet service is SpaceX, which of course is largely owned by Elon Musk. And they had requested that the Pentagon start paying the bill, they simply said we've already spent $100 million, we can no longer continue to pay for this hardware in this service indefinitely. We're now asking the Pentagon to start picking up the tab. And what they were asking for an immediate term was $124 million for the rest of the year. And that's a rate that could amount to around $400 million for about 12 months, not an insignificant amount. So it seems that SpaceX was essentially done paying for this really critical internet service in Ukraine. Now after our reporting, there was a bit of an uproar. And it looks like now Elon Musk is deciding to switch course and saying somewhat bitterly despite the fact that other companies are getting taxpayer money, we will continue to fund this. Now, there's no disputing the fact that there are other companies that that are that are not paying out of pocket, whether it's Raytheon or Lockheed, you know, defense industry companies. But the point here is, Jim, that since Starlink, was sent into Ukraine early on in the war back in March, there has been a lot of global acclaim, a lot of thanks for Elon Musk and SpaceX for sending this and they were taking a lot of the credit. And it was surprising to a lot of people that in fact, other governments, other entities were paying for this critical service in Ukraine. So now what Musk is saying is that they will continue to fund this. We haven't been able to check with the Pentagon yet to see if they're rescinding this request. And we, you know, it is it is completely fair to point out that this is a critical technology that Ukrainian forces have been absolutely relying on. And without it, they would be severely hampered at a really critical juncture in this war, Jim.",

He's -- as a result of losing these soldiers and having a bunch of other ones wounded, they've lost a lot of the territory that they thought they had taken, as the Ukrainians have pushed back.And as a result of losing that territory, Putin has had to cross a line that he didn't want to cross, which is to draft up a bunch of people, 300,000 soldiers, from all walks of life, to go and become the next cannon fodder in Ukraine. And that's led to his decline in popularity, people are leaving Russia, there's more than half a million people, could be as many as a million men between the ages of 18 and 60 have left Russia. So he's in a very bad place right now. And what does he do when he's in a bad place? He lashes out. And all of this, this sort of indiscriminate bombing of Ukrainian civilian, is a sign of his desperation. He's not doing well. He's not gaining any military advantage by pummeling Ukrainian civilians in different places across Ukraine. And he's probably using up whatever's left at his diminished artillery. And so this is not looking good for Vladimir Putin right now. And statements that this is all going according to plan. It's not going according to any plan he had at the beginning of this war.",
