Bridging traffic to a standstill for a time. No arrests were reported. Tyre Nichols died three days after the violent encounter. He was just 29 years old. His funeral has been set for next Wednesday. All five officers have been fired, and on Thursday, they were charged with second degree murder, kidnapping, and other offenses. The first arraignments are set for next month. So, we want to play some of the newly released videos. They are difficult and disturbing to watch, and there's a lot of foul language. Now, we don't see Nichols being pulled over for alleged reckless driving, but the first clip is from an officer arriving at the scene. And from there, the situation escalates rapidly. Have a look.

      "sentences": "A short time later, at a nearby location close to his home, Nichols is on the ground. You heard him there calling out for his mother as he was beaten. After several minutes, Nichols is slumped over. No one seems to care. No one appears to render aid for more than 20 minutes before an ambulance finally arrived.Protests broke out across the U.S. after authorities released that video. From coast to coast, people marched to condemn police violence and demand justice for Tyre Nichols. Most of the protests were peaceful, including this one in New York, but a few arrests were reported along with minor clashes with police. Now, at this point, we don't know the specific cause of death of Tyre Nichols, but medical expert tells CNN he probably died of internal injuries caused by blunt force trauma. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta tells us more about the possible injuries Nichols might have suffered. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is just horrific to watch. Even as a trauma neurosurgeon myself, I've never seen anything quite like that. You don't often see patients who are brought into the hospital, but you don't see that just horrific beating that he took over those several minutes. When you look at this thing, there's obviously so many different injuries that he could have sustained at the time. I think one of the areas that people probably paid a lot attention to was just all these blows he took to his head and to his face. He was restrained at one point, taking fists to the face, and he was being kicked in the face when he was on the ground. What can happen sometimes is that the brain is the one organ in the body that when it's starting to swell, it really has no place to go because it's encased by the skull. Every other organ in the body can swell a little bit more easily. Brain swelling can start to take place and one can start to lapse in and out of consciousness, has seemed to be happening with Mr. Nichols. I watched the videos alongside medical examiners from around the country, and that was the area they really pointed to was these blows to the head. It's also worth noting that he's a pretty skinny guy from we understand, and there were kicks to the body, to the torso, to the chest as well, and any of those organs may have actually sustained damage and started bleeding as well, could have been suffering from internal bleeding at the time that all this was happening. And that brings us to the next point, which I think is critically important. When you look at the timeline of what was happening there, it was around 8:33 or so 8:34 when you see this last kick that he sustains, and then he is handcuffed and dragged over to the car, and then it's eight minutes later before we see EMS even arrive. But it's not until around 9:02. So, 20 minutes after that, 21 minutes after that, almost half an hour in total before you see a gurney arrive. So, you have a critically ill man who's lying on the sidewalk, sustained all these injuries. Hard to say the extent of the injuries or even how serious they are at that point. Obviously they are serious, but what exactly is the most serious is difficult to ascertain. And it's a full half an hour before he's really assessed. You hear at various times that it's going to take a while for the ambulance to get there. And that's obviously very problematic. He needed to be in a hospital. Whether or not it would have made a difference ultimately that's hard to say. And we'll get more information, you know, probably over the coming few days as to exactly what caused his death. [05:35:06] We don't have a firm cause of death yet from the county medical examiner, but watching that video, looking at that timeline, you can get -- you really get a sense of what happened to him and what happened to him in the days that followed.

      "sentences": "Well, the video is problematic on a multitude of different levels. One of the things that we look to is leadership in a point of crisis in policing. There never appeared to be a front-line supervisor that took control over the situation and gave specific instructions to the officers on the scene.Secondly, no officers intervene when you clearly recognize that excessive force was apparent. Someone should have stepped in and said, stop, or physically remove the officers. So, the component of a failure to supervise and a failure to intervene was a problematic component in this combustible situation relating to the deceased in this particular matter. I think that oftentimes in policing, heads can run high, and that's understandable, but at the same token, you need to slow down and move forward with the necessary provisions as it relates to the policies in connection with how you introduce a use of force against an individual in a car stop. And when we look at this video, it's clear that the subject in this case is not posing a propensity to aggressively assault the officers. He's merely saying at many points, look, OK, OK, stop. But he's not assaulting the officers. So, it goes back to the criminal trial, and that's where you see this manifest in the retribution against the officers moving forward.",

Here, we had a pole camera that captured what occurred on the ground level. In addition to that, we had officers that wore body cameras. So, you would think that it would be blatantly obvious that what you do will be captured.However, officers in this case, I believe, were impervious to the fact that there was oversight, and it was just them doing what they felt was appropriate at that time, which was highly excessive. And it begs the question of who was setting the tone in that police department. When you have a supervisor or a police manager that sets forth a specific tone, then people will follow through to that. However, when you have a laser fair attitude by management, that's when officers will believe as if they can act autonomously. And what we see in this video is a result of a failure to supervise.",
