Earlier, he met with the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, and others in the West Bank and he acknowledged the very difficult path ahead in trying to end decades of conflict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  It's also important to continue to strive not only for reducing violence (ph) but ensuring that ultimately the Israelis and Palestinians alike enjoy the same rights, the same opportunities. What we are seeing now, from the Palestinians, is a shrinking horizon of hope, not an expanding one. And that, too, we believe, needs to change. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In both instances, it was restored after some time. So the question will be now whether this freeze will be for a few weeks, a few days or if it will be more of a freeze to the public and then behind the scenes kind of, on a person to person level, still some coordination. That is definitely going to be one of Secretary of State Blinken's top priorities or was when he met with the Palestinian leadership. The U.S. State Department was very clear last week that they disagreed with the decision to cancel that security coordination. The Americans see this as a vital, way one of the few tools, really, that they have of communication between the security forces that can help calm the situation down. I actually spoke to a, for that piece that you mentioned, to a retired colonel from the IDF, who was in charge in parts of the West Bank. He said that one of his major concerns about canceling of the security coordination is not so much, yes, they do intel sharing. But he's concerned about the trickle down effect to the lower level members of the Palestinian security forces, who may go out and then do something else. He's concerned that, because there won't be a coordination, there won't be communication between the Palestinian Authority security forces and the Israeli military. The Israeli military, under the security coordination, will talk to the Palestinian Authority security forces and instruct them and say, hey, we're going to go do this. He's worried about possible clashes between the IDF and the Palestinian Authority security forces if that coordination is not restored -- Becky.",

Still, today an important test, compared to what happened on January 19th. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BELL (voice-over):  The last protests against pension reforms saw more than 1 million people take to the streets of France, according to official figures. Just over 10 days later, unions are hoping to top that. They're also calling for strikes across the public and private sectors like the ones that paralyzed so much of the country on January 19th. But for now, the government hasn't budged. OLIVER VERAN, FRENCH GOVERNMENT SPOKESPERSON (through translator):  We're not asking everyone to agree with the reform we're carrying out; what we want is first of all, to explain, that this reform is essential. And that we must do it. BELL (voice-over):  Currently, the French can retire at 62 or even earlier in some cases with a minimum monthly government pension of around 1,000 euros. Earlier this month, the French prime minister announced plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 with a full pension raised by an average of 100 euros a month. STEPHANIE RIST, FRENCH MP (through translator):  The reform is necessary because the accounts are in deficit from this year. Our pension system is no longer balanced. And by 2027, we're looking at a deficit of roughly 12 billion euros. BELL (voice-over):  Pension reform has been derailed in the past. In 1995, under then president Jacques Chirac, it also faced stiff resistance under Macron's two predecessors. FRANCOIS HOMMERIL, PRESIDENT, CFE-CGC UNION (through translator):  This reform comes at a time when there's a lot of anger, a lot of frustration, a lot of fatigue. In fact, it comes at the worst time when living standards are down and the cost of living up. For some people, shopping bills are up by 20 percent or 30 percent and rent hasn't fallen (ph) and all of that creates a climate of defiance.

I also met with opposition leader Lapid, who shares the same commitment to counter Iran. Iran's deepening ties with Moscow and  the sophisticated weaponry that they're exchanging to enable one another's aggression are among the many reasons that we raise with Israel the importance of providing support for all of Ukraine's needs -- humanitarian, economic and security as it defends its people against Russia's brutal war of aggression. We discussed a number of ways to advance the United States' and Israel's security interests. Just as I did yesterday at my meetings with the prime minister. With president Herzog and with foreign minister Cohen. Across these discussions I made clear that America's commitment to Israel's security is unwavering, just as it is been for nearly 75 years. Finally, the United States will continue to deepen our bonds here with partners outside of government. Today I had the opportunity to spend time with Palestinian and Palestinian American civil society leaders, entrepreneurs, business owners in Nadardwan (ph), who shared the vital work they are doing to improve the lives of their communities. And I started my day by hearing from a group of young Israeli leaders, Jews and Arabs, who are doing aspiring, incredible work for advancing LGBTQ rights and the rights of people with disabilities, to building trust and ties between communities. These meetings were a reminder that the civil society in both of our countries plays an indispensable role in defending and strengthening the rights of people and principles at the heart of a free and open society and helping people tackle some of the most pressing challenges. It's a reminder of how citizens are willing to continue to engage, to hold their leaders accountable and to keep working to create the world that they and their communities want.

One of the -- one of those actions is what we talked about, was the provision by Iran to Russia of drones and technology to be used in Russia's aggression against Ukraine. And as I mentioned before -- and as we also discussed with our Israeli counterparts -- this is a two-way street.

He has repeated the message time and again throughout his time on the ground, that the United States has an ironclad commitment to Israel's security. But, he says, all sides must take steps to restore calm and reduce the violence. Some will say those are empty words, given the real tinderbox atmosphere that we know to exist in the region at present. Do we still have our guest, Tor Wennesland, available to us? Yes, we do. Let me get you to our guest. It's important that we get Tor's perspective here. You are the U.N. special envoy for the peace process. You're in Jerusalem. You have just heard the words of the U.S. secretary of state. What do you make of what you heard? TOR WENNESLAND, U.N. SPECIAL COORDINATOR FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS:  Well, first of all, thank you, Becky, for having me on your program. Let me reiterate what the secretary said, and which is the line of the U.N. and the U.N. secretary general. I mean, there is a need, immediately, for responsible leadership and to address the escalating hot spots that we have had with us for a time and that has led to the current degree of instability on the ground. And I would like to underline that this is a very serious situation. It is not kind of like this, that will be limited necessarily only to the West Bank if we don't stop it. There is a potential for a much wider escalation if we're not addressing the situation on the ground in Jerusalem. In Al-Aqsa, the Temple Mount area, we are running into the holiday season. And we need to have plans for how to deal with that situation as well. I would also underline one thing that we have seen before, where the U.N. has been deeply involved. We have seen a situation spreading from the West Bank into Gaza with serious military escalation. That can easily happen again if we're not taking the current situation of instability superbly serious. I welcome the visit -- (CROSSTALK)",

We need to see that addressed. There need to be security coordination that can allow for the situation on the ground to calm down. Secondly, we cannot have a situation where settlements are further expanded, because that is creating tension. Number three, there need to be a stop in house demolitions and evictions of families because that is driving tension and it's not calming down. And there need to be a specific action taken in order to keep status quo at the holy sites and to police that properly, so we don't have a conflict that is spreading into the religious life of people, not only here but in the region. All these messages need to be taken.",

I think the involvement of the region, Jordan and Egypt, is going in the same direction. U.N. is also involved in any effort that can lead to a deescalation. I am not taking status quo after a given (ph). We need to work on the issues that are so far not resolved.

But let's be quite frank here, sir. There is a new, likely most right-wing- ever Israeli government at present. An it is difficult to assess the Biden administration's position on that very right-wing government and the impact that its policies could have on the current situation. I mean, Antony Blinken talked about the very vibrant civil society; he is obviously talking about the demonstrations we've seen, both in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, against this very right-wing government and its potential policies. He's talked about a healthy debate in parliament. It feels like he is talking about the reforms to the judiciary that this right-wing government is likely to try and push through. How important is it? And I know, you know, you're unlikely to want to address this question head-on. But let me try this. How important is it for the U.S. administration that they see very quickly what these new policies from this very right-wing Israeli government are going to look like? And how concerned do you think they are about those policies and their impact on this current situation? Apologies for the length of that question.",

That is something we will see pan out over the next weeks and months. I am not going into whatever internal discussions there are on the Israeli side. My focus is on getting stuff done on the ground. And I fully support the line of action taken by Blinken in this regard at this meeting. And I would like to underline again that both the Israeli situation is complicated internally; the Palestinian situation is complicated internally. That's why I'm saying that we need bold leadership.
