And the epicenter of the earthquake was in the high atlas mountains.This is south of a popular tourist destination of Marrakech. The impact was felt a lot further than where this happened. The depth of this is relatively shallow, just about 11.5 miles under the Earth's surface. But even a shallow earthquake like this can still do extensive damage. That's why you're seeing this number of 632 confirmed dead so far, more than 300 wounded. Authorities fear that, when the full account is done, those numbers could be a lot higher, because as they now to begin to move in the regions in the mountainous areas, some of the roads are blocked. This happened about 11:00 pm local. Some people could have been trapped in their homes or under these buildings that have collapsed. The worst damage has been in these mountainous regions, which are very hard to reach. But they will be trying to sift through all that and get to them. I want to show you this incredible CCTV footage of the moment this earthquake hit. You see people scampering for safety and the debris starting to fall. This explains just the impact of this earthquake, not just in the epicenter but so much further away. That's why you saw so many people sleeping rough on the streets, afraid if they stayed in their homes, their homes might collapse on them. You see people being pulled away in all kinds of -- whatever they can really to get them to safety. So many people dead. Some of this video shown on social media, harrowing video, bodies lying on the streets, just speaking to how bad this has been, especially happening at night, when some people were probably asleep. I want you to listen to this one gentleman who was further away in Casablanca. Even there, a lot of fear. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHAMED TAQAFI, WITNESS (through translator): The house rocked aggressively. Everyone was scared and I was shocked and didn't understand what was happening. I thought it was only my house that was moving because it's fragile and old. I heard people screaming. Everyone went out of their houses. The street is full of people and women screaming. That's what happened. Even now, people can't go back home because they're still afraid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then together with other guests from the hotel, we decided our safest option would be to make our way to open ground farther away from high buildings. And initially I was quite surprised at how little panic there was in the streets. People were quite calm and organized, making their way through these narrow alleyways. But I think then, at the moment when the dust had settled and when the initial shock and burst of adrenaline had passed, that's when I heard screams erupting. I think it's when people saw most likely the extent of the damage and injuries. And then standing in that open space next to roads, more and more injured people were arriving, some people being carried out of buildings on stretchers. I saw one person wrapped up in a carpet who had been brought out of the house and several people with what appeared to be quite bad head injuries with a lot of blood. Ambulances obviously coming to treat the injured. Unfortunately, I did also see one incidence in which an ambulance had to turn away a woman. They were simply full. There were so many injured people in the back that they couldn't fit her in. And, yes, that's basically how long the hit in Marrakesh started yesterday (ph).",

And the other thing is people lining up for public buses with suitcases packed.

That marks a significant achievement for Mr. Modi, who has been pulling out all the stops for U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders. But two key players, as we've been reporting, are not there -- Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. That, of course, is significant for this summit. Divisions over the war in Ukraine have some observers wondering whether the leaders will even be able to issue a joint communique this year. CNN's Kevin Liptak joins me from New Delhi. I know you are well versed in Joe Biden and the White House's priorities on this. At this hour, Reuters is reporting from a source that they have reached some kind of consensus on language for that communique. The sticking point was Ukraine. I'm not exactly sure what you've heard from your sources. But what does the White House want to come out of this summit if they feel that they could come up with a win?",

American officials did say this morning that work was still underway on that communique.I think what is most likely -- and I think what I've heard from folks who are involved in this, what is most likely is some sort of compromise language in that document, something that would most likely reflect the document that came out of last year's G20 in Bali, which stated most members of the G20 condemned Russia's war in Ukraine. And the implication there is not all G20 members condemned Russia's war in Ukraine, most principally Russia. I think the work is probably continuing. Of course, the leaders themselves will have to sign off on this document before they put their names on it at the end of this summit. There has never been a G20 that did not result in a joint communique. I think it would be striking if this one didn't. It would reflect the fractured nature of the world at this moment, when you have the U.S. and Europe on one side and you have Russia and China on the other and you have all these other countries in the middle, who aren't necessarily taking a side. One of the objectives for President Biden, when he speaks to this gathering today, is to talk about the war in Ukraine and to sort of make the case that it is an imperative for global democracy for these countries to come out and forcefully condemn Russia's aggression.

But at the same time, you do hear from White House officials that there are opportunities in these absences.It certainly allows President Biden to make the case, particularly to the developing world, that the U.S. is a more reliable partner when it comes to things like investments. And certainly, by showing up here, he is making that case and he is coming armed with certain proposals, things like reforming the World Bank. He does also plan to announce this major transit corridor from Asia to the Middle East, eventually on to Europe, that could challenge China's global trade ambitions. So certainly, President Biden is trying to make the most of these absences. What it does prevent is any sort of interaction with these leaders. You'll remember at last year's G20, the major centerpiece was President Biden's hours-long summit with president Xi. He is trying to restore more normal channels of communication with China. He has been sending his top officials to Beijing over the last several months. U.S. officials do still hold out hope that there could be a meeting between these two men in the coming months, potentially at the APEC summit in November in San Francisco.

Kremlin-backed candidates, some of whom are running unopposed, are widely expected to be installed after that process.

The Ukrainians are saying two things. They say this is a violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. We can see the map there on our screen. Again, Ukraine is obviously saying this is Ukrainian territory. The international community says exactly the same thing. But they also say this is a flagrant violation of the rights of the people who live in that area because they say the people are essentially being coerced to go and vote in those elections. The Ukrainians are saying, in some cases, Russian-installed officials are going door to door to essentially bring people to the polling stations. The Ukrainians say, on the one hand, that is to act as though there were queues in front of some of these polling stations, that people really want to go and vote there, even though in many cases Ukrainians believe they don't. But it also is, of course, to make sure there are no protests or anything on the side. The Ukrainians believe these votes are sham votes. The Russians take a very different view on all of this.

So given the climatic conditions, people often prefer to use clay constructions. The predominant building is brick. And masonry constructions are in the urban areas.So these buildings are essentially highly vulnerable to seismic shaking. That's what you saw in your videos, that, many buildings, it took only a few seconds to bring them down. The shaking was pretty strong. But at the same time, these buildings are not really designed to the modern seismic standard that we know of. And thus, they really cave in pretty quickly, killing, unfortunately, all the occupants that they have. So this is a very unfortunate situation. And I think one of the important worry that the search and rescue people have is the potential of experiencing aftershocks. And if they're trying to rescue people, what would that lead to? So a magnitude 6.8 can easily produce sizeable aftershocks. And these kinds of earthquakes, given the vulnerable building stock, can still pull down some of the weaker buildings that are left over from the main shock earthquake.
