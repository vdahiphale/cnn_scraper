      "sentences": "Good morning. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. This is EARLY START.We begin with global markets in turmoil in the wake of the failure of two major commercial banks, SVB and Signature Bank in the United States. Global markets, Asian shares closed down sharply as investors fear further bank collapses to come. Two percent move in Tokyo, 2 percent move in Hong Kong. Those are big moves for one day. European stocks have been climbing though in the last few hours, a mixed performance now, but trying to find some footing this Europe. And look at U.S. futures, stocks and futures in the U.S. are now up slightly. We'll try to make sense of all of this for you in a moment. One place you don't want your investment dollars right now, regional bank stocks. On Monday, First Republic shares first more than 60 percent. Western Alliance Bancorp down 47 percent. PacWest Bancorp down 21 percent. Driving the U.S. market overall, extreme fear. According to CNN Business the CNN business fear and greed index. CNN's Clare Sebastian is live in London. How is this playing out around the world, what've seen, Clare, in the U.S.? It seems logical that the global stocks are down now. But, explain why on earth the U.S. futures are up again?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we'll get to that in a minute but first on U.S. futures, Christine, I mean, look, there have been five straight sessions, on the Dow, basically a week of losses leading up to today. So it could be that there's some sort of profit happening.If you look into the individual stocks, there are some recovery and the banks even in those very hard hit regional banks not enough to reverse the losses on Monday but a little bit of a recovery there. Perhaps it seems that the initial fire has been put up by the quick action of the federal government, the Biden administration. The Treasury officials are also telling us that the scale of the outflow of deposits from the regional banks has slowed somewhat and that gives the sense to the initial crisis has abated somewhat. But, of course, we've got CPI data this morning, that could change things, things could change by the hour with these features if CPI comes in very hard. And then the currently reduced likelihood of a higher rate rise next week goes up in a little bit, which, of course, the markets don't, like and if it comes in better than perhaps less likelihood of a rate rise, which currently down as I say. The Fed is also juggling this banking crisis. As for around the world, in Japan, we saw a lot of fallout for the banking sector there and even the biggest banks amid scrutiny of their own treasury holdings on their balance sheet. And here in the U.K., that outlier in Europe was still seeing some fall off, HSBC, the bank that will swoop in and took over the UK arm of SVB down today, one of the biggest fall outs on the FTSE there, Christine. So, still some contagion for the banking sector around the world.",

So we will see, again the next Fed meeting is March 22nd.Thank you so much, Clare. Nice to see you. All right. She mentioned this scale of outflows, right? That's another factor that may be holding U.S. stock prices steady. Fewer customers withdrawing their money from U.S. banks on Monday. A senior treasury official says deposit outflows from small and mid-sized lenders slowed. Now, that's a sign, a central element of the Biden administration strategy is working, that sending a clear message that customer bank deposits are in fact safe.

So this is still very much reporting from \"The Wall Street Journal\" from this time, but significant if true. The reporting is that President Xi Jinping is preparing to hold a virtual meeting with President Zelenskyy.To give you some context around this, of course, President Xi Jinping now elected for an unprecedented third term, armed with that domestic support he seems to be turning outward. You will remember President Biden is also expecting a call from President Xi Jinping in the coming days. We don't know exactly when that will take place. But we also have an expectation that he will be traveling to Moscow potentially next week to meet with President Putin. Now, these two leaders have met dozens of times. They are considered very close and they have become even closer experts say during the conflict in Ukraine. President Putin recently boasting their relationship as having no limits. And you will remember that China seems to be getting more involved. Just last month, Beijing proposed a 12-point peace proposal essentially trying to poise itself as a potential peace broker, a neutral party that could find a solution when it comes to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But the United States says this is simply not true. It sees China as very much siding with Russia, concerned that these two countries are in lockstep, that they hold a similar vision of the world. And it's also the United States has been warning that China could potentially be giving weapons to Russia to restock its arsenal.

And I think we demonstrated that with the regulatory community, the balance sheet in the full faith and credit of the United States, in a really impressive way. But it doesn't mean we're not going to see more bankruptcies in the coming days and weeks.I think a lot of us are paying attention to ten or so banks that we want to see good news. We want to see funding, we want to see restructuring, we want to see the ability for them to respond to this kind of question mark around their survivability. I should also point out, back in the 80s, there were nearly 30,000 banks in the United States, and now, we're in the 4,000 range. It's a national evolutionary process of the American system to see a contraction in the number of banks. And to see deposit centralized in the large money center banks.",
