Shame on them for that.But the bottom line is this is a really good idea, for society, for parents, for young people. And the truth is a warning label will be very effective. Congress just has to pass legislation. So maybe they can actually stand up and do their job for once on this. And the truth is it will help parents understand the potential negative impacts. You gave the statistics, Brianna, earlier. About five hours a day for kids who are really dealing with social, emotional and cognitive issues because of social media. So a warning label helps the average parent understand this is like tobacco. You really have to be worried about this. Remember, there are no seat belts for social media that you can just click on your kid. So they're being exposed to all sorts of challenging mental health issues because of their social media experiences. So a warning label from the surgeon general is a great idea. Congress has to do its job, though, Boris, and pass a law for this.",

We're big believers here at Common Sense -- we have 1.3 million future members. Most of the schools in the United States use our digital literacy curriculum.I would tell you schools can educate people. And they could basically say to kids, we should be telling every kid that there's a warning label. This is like tobacco. They need to be aware of it. But the other thing I think that we can see is states like California and New York can take the lead. So we'll be introducing legislation probably in Congress to see if they'll affirm this warning label idea that the surgeon generals recommended. But we'll also introduce legislation in California and New York. And so, once you start to see that snowball happening at the state level, then we can have real progress for the kids and families who -- in this country who deserve that kind of guardrails that you're referring to.",

Because the surgeon general is pointing out the warning label, it's not enough to fix the problem.He's also urging, of course, parental involvement, creating phone-free environments, restricting kids' social media until they graduate from middle school. What would you say to parents whose kids are in that five-hour range at kind of a young age who are attached to social media already? How do you change that relationship?",

But actually, the older they've gotten, the more they do agree with me.I think what you say to parents is, you can really enforce rules and that you have to, even if the social media companies themselves are pushing this through algorithms on your kids 24/7. You need to, as you just mentioned, and as the surgeon general has said, you have to have device-free zones. We run a big campaign called Device Free Dinner at Common Sense. So you have to remind your kids not to sleep with their cell phones. And I actually think waiting and delaying giving your kid a phone is great practice. We did that in the Steyer family. Our kids didn't love it, but it turned out to be a really good move. And I would recommend that parents do that. That schools talk constantly to the students themselves and also to parents, bodies at their schools about the risk associated with social media. Look our kids love platforms like Instagram and TikTok and YouTube, and they're going to be on that. But the more they're educated about the downsides the better. And young people are smart. We have hundreds of millions of users and they talk a lot about how much social media has a negative influence on their lives. So kids are smart. Teenagers are smart. So we just have to keep reinforcing to them common sense, balanced use of social media. Put your phone away, sort of the basic stuff that is part of parenting in this new digital age. If we do that, then we're going to go along -- we'll be a long way down the road. And a warning label would just be a really good added fact.",

You know, when I speak with people who are impacted, that have had conviction for low-level cannabis crimes, of the difficulties they have when they apply for a job, the difficulties they have when they apply for housing, the difficulties they have when they apply for certain educational opportunity. So it's been a real barrier for some. And I know it's hard to understand that for people who don't have records.

As a result, we're able to create opportunities as the cannabis industry takes off and to ensure that communities that were negatively impacted during the war on drugs will now benefit from the lawful use of cannabis. And then we can take those state revenues and invest in communities that were so hard hit during the war on drugs. So this is a hopeful day in Maryland.

The same can be said for a commercial truck driver who could lose their license because, in Maryland, they now can lawfully use or consume cannabis. But their license would be taken away from this.
