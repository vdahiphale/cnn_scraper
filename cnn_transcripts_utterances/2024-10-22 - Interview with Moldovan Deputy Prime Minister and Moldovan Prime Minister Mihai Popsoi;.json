Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. The U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Israel in the waning days of the Biden administration, trying to bring the war in Gaza to an end, according to the State Department. Meantime, the U.S. envoy to the region describes Israel's war on Hezbollah and Lebanon as, quote, \"spinning out of control.\" 63 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Monday, The Lebanese Health Ministry says. Blinken's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lasted for more than two hours, as deaths mount in Gaza even after killing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. Hundreds have been killed there in the last two weeks alone. With no word from Netanyahu on what he sees as Gaza's future, or any public plans for the day after, facts are getting established on the ground. Far- right Israelis, including government ministers are calling for settlements in the enclave. Let's go to Correspondent Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, here we have the secretary of state. What do we have as a readout from both sides after this meeting?",

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been in Ukraine offering more western military support. While the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has hosted the biggest group of world leaders since invading Ukraine and being slapped with sanctions that are meant to isolate him. The so-called BRICS nations of China, India, Brazil and South Africa are attending in Russia. Ukraine's neighbor, Democratic Moldova, watches Moscow's every move with alarm, as it seeks to avoid Ukraine's fate. In an incredibly tight referendum this weekend, the country voted to join the European Union. But the vote was marred by allegations of blatant election interference by Russia. Here to help us understand the stakes, Mihai Popsoi. He's Moldova's Deputy Prime Minister, as well as Foreign Minister, and he joins me from the capital, Chisinau.

So, as is with the energy security, where Moldova now is independent from Gazprom, so is with the other reforms that we're implementing, including justice reform.

But Moldovans will not be subdued. Moldovans have seen the horrors of the so-called Russian world in Ukraine. And Moldovans have been used to have peaceful relations with everyone. And we are a peaceful country and we want to be friends with everyone. But as long as we see this horror happening in Ukraine, and as long as we see barbaric aggression on a daily basis, the Russian world's appeal in Moldova will decrease and Moldovans will, as we've seen in this election, look towards peace and stability in Europe, which has proven itself to be a project of peace and prosperity.

This has allowed us to weather this enormous storm. When the energy blackmail kicked in, when the Kremlin pushed us with the backs against the wall, hoping that we'll crumble. But thanks to the resilience of our people and thanks to the enormous generosity and solidarity of the International Community, first and foremost, our partners in the European Union and the United States, but also others in the free world, we've been able to weather this storm and Moldova's energy security now is a lot stronger than it was. And we can also advocate, of course, on behalf of Ukraine to get the support, because Ukraine is also defending us. And for us, it's not at all abstract. We've seen the maps. We've heard the plans.

In the spring of 1980, six gunmen stormed the Iranian embassy and held 26 people captive. These hijackers were opposed to the Ayatollah. They hoped their siege would lead to autonomy for Khuzestan, it's a rebellious region of southwest Iran, oil rich. For six days, the world watched in real-time as tensions ratcheted up, ending an extraordinary raid by British Special Forces, which was carried live on national television.

So, they had not factored in one important, crucial element, which was Margaret Thatcher. This was before the absolute kind of clampdown on no negotiations with terrorists. But it did also inform Thatcher's attitude towards terrorism generally. I mean, the IRA situation was then critical. And from this moment on, she had absolutely no intention of negotiating with any kind of terrorists. But it was a real gamble on her part. I mean, had it gone wrong, and she was warned before the final assault took place on the building by the SAS, she was warned there would be 40 percent casualties, if they were lucky.

So, he had to file challenges inmultiple different states in order to have a hope of overturning the election. And he did so. He did so in state court and in federal court. I think 62 different cases. He lost them all, but he still tried. He pressured state legislatures and state governors to try and throw out the votes and have fake slates of electors and things like that. And then, he pressured local officials, state election boards, to try and throw out individual votes in various counties, all with the hope of trying to flip several different states. And when all of that failed, he went to the Congress, because on Congress on January 6th, they have a duty to open all of the electoral votes and count them. And what he had tried to do was have Pence -- his vice president, Pence, impugn the vote and throw out the votes of certain states. Vice President Pence famously refused to do that. Nonetheless, Republicans in the Congress tried to do that and take up these voting objections, but they did so against the backdrop where they had to run the table, because it was 306 votes that Biden had. He had such a margin that they couldn't just impugn the election integrity in one state or two, it had to be in many. The worry this time around is that the election might be closer in the Electoral College, than any one state might swing the election. And if that's the case, then any one court decision or a decision by the United States Congress on January 6th to throw out any one state's vote, all of that could swing the election. Now, it's the case that Congress in 2022 passed something important, the Electoral Count Reform Act, to try and prevent that. In my view, is it should prevent it. The law is written in a way to stop. bogus objections. But the question -- you know, law is only as good as the people who are applying it and the people who are trying to enforce it.

So, like, as I said, I'm not a particularly political person but I have watched what's happened to the Republican Party, which used toreally stand for law and order and stand for the right to vote. I had the privilege of arguing the Voting Rights Act case on the Supreme Court, and it had just been recently reauthorized 421 to 3 in the House of Representatives and 98 to 0 in the Senate. That's the reverence with which both political parties took the right to vote back just a few short years ago. And unfortunately, what's happened in the last years is that the Republican Party has purged many of its members, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, you know, others, who've tried to say, hey, you know, these shenanigans on January 6th, that's not America. That's not the democratic way. That's not the peaceful transfer of power. Just look at the images that were beamed around the world and what happened at the Capitol. And unfortunately, those folks are now not part of the party. And so, some of the institutional checks that we had last time around, think about, for example, Vice President Pence, who on January 6, 2021, played such an important role. People like that aren't there. Instead, you have people like J. D. Vance to replace Pence, who are fully in on, you know, the notion that Donald Trump won in 2020.

So, the 12th amendment to the United States constitution, which has been around for a couple of hundred years, although it hasn't been kicked in in two centuries, but what it says is, if there is no one who gets a majority in the Electoral College, then the decision for the presidency is made by the House of Representatives and for the vice presidency is made by the Senate. And there are some very arcane voting rules there. I'll walk you through in one second, but just think about that. You could have a circumstance in which the president is a Republican and the vice president is a Democrat because the Senate picks one and the House picks the other or vice versa, which is incredibly unwieldy, and perhaps even potentially dangerous to have -- you know, to have people of different political parties occupy those two roles. So, the 12th Amendment says that if there is a tie or no one gets a majority, then it goes to the House of Representatives. But it does so under a specialized set of voting rules, which don't exist elsewhere. Each state has one vote. And so, you count up the number of members of Congress of the House of Representatives and look and see, are they more Republican or more Democrat? And that's how that state will ultimately vote. And so, if that were to take place today, I think there are 26 delegations in which Republicans have a majority. And so, if it were to take place today, Donald Trump would win. Because the House of Representatives would give him that vote. Obviously, you know, it's the new Congress that will decide that thing, not the old Congress, and so things may change.",
