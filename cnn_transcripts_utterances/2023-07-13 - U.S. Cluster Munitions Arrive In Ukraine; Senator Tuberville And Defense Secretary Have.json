The arrival of those weapons has not previously been reported.You can see here a video from last year in Kharkiv. This is what it looks like when a Russian cluster munition exploded there. You see the initial explosion and a number of those smaller bombs falling around the area. That's what they're designed to do. They're designed specifically to kill people. CNN's Oren Liebermann, he's at the Pentagon. He has been following this story. Has the Defense Department confirmed the arrival of these munitions in Ukraine now? Does it have any sense of when and how Ukraine plans to use them?",

      "sentences": "Jim, Lt. Gen. D. A. Sims who's the Director of Operations here at the Joint Staff confirmed just a few moments ago on a press briefing that U.S. cluster munitions have arrived in Ukraine. So that corroborates what our colleague, Alex Marquardt, heard from Ukrainian general, which is that they have arrived in the country. But Sims wouldn't say anything about whether or not they has - have been used yet. Generally, the U.S. will leave it to the Ukrainians to talk about how when and where they choose to employ the weapons that have been provided. Sims also made the point that a third country has provided cluster munitions to Ukraine in the past. So the Ukrainians have used at least the other countries cluster munitions as the U.S. ones begin to flow in and it's not too much of a surprise that they arrived only days after they were announced, because at least to this point, cluster munitions are essentially an untapped stock of ammunition that the U.S. hasn't given yet.So that was ready to go and shortly after it was announced, the U.S. was able to essentially wrap that up and get it to Ukraine as quickly as possible. In terms of how and where these are used, Ukraine committed to the U.S. that it wouldn't be used against civilian targets. It would be used in the ongoing counteroffensive. And you saw from the video you showed at the top there how these are used. They can essentially saturate a small area or medium-sized area with these little bomblets, these sub munitions that can hit over a bit of an area and you can see why they'd be very effective targeting personnel, targeting Russian lines there. And that's how the Ukrainians have committed to using them. Jim, one more point that's worth pointing out here. One of the other issues that the U.S. faced was what is the dud rate, what percentage of the bomblets or smaller munitions don't explode. According to the U.S. in the case of Russian cluster munitions, which have been used repeatedly since the beginning of the war? It's upwards of 30 percent or 40 percent. For U.S., it's below 2.35 percent. Jim, that's very important for the U.S.",

That's the Russian parliament that according to him, the general who was an Air Force General is \"resting.\"He was reportedly taken into custody and subjected to interrogation over his close links with the Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary group in Russia. And that mercenary group, I think, Brianna, is very, very important from the Ukrainian perspective first because they concentrated they're fighting around Bakhmut and then because over the last few months they've been overtly mutinous, culminating in that attempted coup that is the subject of that interrogation for the Russian general. But on top of that, we've now got an extremely important development with Ivan Popov, a Russian general who's recently been fired. An audio tape from him - purporting to be from him - saying very much the same thing as the Wagner leadership have been saying, blaming the Russian military - Ministry of Defense leadership for Russian failures on the front line in his words, decapitating, I quote there, \"the Russian efforts.\" Now, he was the commander of the 58th Army down in Zaporizhzhia. That is arguably the most important frontline area in the Ukrainian counteroffensive and he has now been relieved of his position, he says, and bitterly critical of the Kremlin and the leadership under the Kremlin of the Russian Armed Forces. This is the first time we've heard from a regular Russian soldier one, reportedly extremely popular with his men, breaking ranks. This is exactly what the Ukrainians want to see, mutiny in the ranks of the Russians will save a lot of Ukrainian lives ultimately.",
