      "sentences": "Yeah, Rahel. He is really detailing very carefully all of the legal elements that the jury needs to consider when they go into that deliberation room. And there have been some very important instructions so far. So, first off, that all important reminder that the prosecution has to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt. And sometimes, that's hard for jurors to grasp. So, the way the judge described it, he said, you can't say a defendant is probably guilty. You have to find that it is virtually a sure thing that the defendant did it. That's the -- beyond the reasonable doubt.Then to the actual law. The judge explained it this way as to what the jurors must find. I'll read you the quote. He said, \"You must find beyond a reasonable doubt first that he, Donald Trump, solicited requested, commanded, importuned or intentionally aided that person to engage in that conduct and second that he did so with the state of mind required with the commission of the offense.\" And then the judge explained a little bit more about acting in concert with somebody or acting alone. The judge said, If Donald Trump didn't directly falsify the business records, even if the jury finds that he requested it or aided in the falsification, he can be found guilty. And crucially here, the jury needs to be unanimous, obviously, on all the counts, but they can in fact disagree on this. The judge explained that this way. He said they can disagree whether Trump acted alone or acted in concert with someone else and they can still find Trump guilty even if they disagree whether or not Trump did it alone, or acted with somebody. And then, Rahel, I thought this was really important. The judge talked about Michael Cohen's credibility. Of course, that was something that the defense attorneys really zeroed in on, on their closing. And notably, the judge did tell the jury that if they find that any part of his testimony was unreliable, and remember, he was on the stand for several days, the jury can disregard all of his testimony. And that was the big gamble with prosecutors putting Michael Cohen on the stand that even if the jury finds one part of his testimony wasn't credible, they can disregard everything, Rahel. So, that'll be interesting to see how the jury interprets that.",

Let's turn now to Criminal Defense Attorney Amy Lee Copeland, who joins us live from Savannah, Georgia. Amy Lee, good to have you on. Let's just start with jury instructions. Based on what we just heard there from our correspondent, did the prosecution's job just get a little harder? What do you think? AMY LEE COPELAND, CRIMINAL DEFENSE AND APPELLATE ATTORNEY, &amp; FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA: The jury instructions, the judge here used the standard instructions, and the prosecution has always been the one that's been charged with proving the facts in conformance with the law. So, what the jury instructions do is give the jurors a roadmap about what they have to analyze the facts under. As the prior correspondent said, it's interesting, because jury instructions are both a mix of the law and telling jurors not to abandon their common sense of the door in judging things like credibility. So, the prosecution, the state knew all along what the law was, and it certainly introduced its case in accordance with the law and how it thought the judge would charge the law. We'll see what the jury does, though. As Tom Petty said, the waiting is the hardest part, and I think that really holds true here in jury deliberations.",

They have to look at him one at a time. In addition to guilty and not guilty verdicts, the juror or several jurors could say, we don't think he has done anything at all, and the other jurors could say we think he is guilty. You could have holdout jurors. And you would know that because the note would be sent to the judge saying we are hopelessly deadlocked. We can't continue any longer.If that happens, the judge would give what's called an Allen charge or Dynamite charge, designed to blast up a jury deadlock. And he would send the jury back out to deliberate. Typically, the longer the jury stays out, the more likely it is, it tends to favor the offense. It tends to favor a mistrial or a hung jury.",

And the jury instruction has talked about that. They both talked about treating the former President as a member of the community, but they also talked about not bringing any of these grudges or these good feelings into the jury room with them.

We'll continue to follow that.In the meantime, we want to turn our attention to the Middle East. The UN Security Council is meeting right now to consider a draft resolution demanding immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Permanent member France says that it is quote \"high time for the council to take action\" after dozens of Palestinian civilians were killed in an Israeli strike at a displacement camp in Rafah, Israel says that it's investigating what caused the fire to sweep through that camp, where families were sheltering in tents, suggesting that there may have been a secondary explosion. Now, much of the video from the scene is far too graphic to air, showing people pulling charred bodies from the ashes. And a CNN analysis finds that U.S.-made bombs were used in the strike. The White House says that that attack and Israel's invasion of Rafah in general do not cross President Joe Biden's declared red lines. In the meantime, a major blow to the U.S. effort to facilitate desperately needed aid into Gaza. $320 million new pier constructed by the U.S. military has broken apart in heavy seas. Repairs expected to take more than a week. A lot to get to. Let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is in Jerusalem for more.

Well, the United Nations is now estimating, Rahel, that more than 940,000 civilians have been forced to flee Rafah as the Israeli military expands its military operations in that city, which used to be a kind of last refuge for about one and a half million Palestinians, who -- many of whom had been displaced from other parts of the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military is now expanding its military offensive in Rafah with tanks spotted in central Rafah. That is forcing the World Central Kitchen to close its main kitchen in that very same city and move many of its operations further north.We're also watching impacts to hospitals in Rafah already. And beyond that, of course, there is the question of humanitarian aid and whether or not sufficient humanitarian aid is getting into Gaza. And so far, all signs point to that not being the case. That's because -- partly because the Rafah border crossing has been closed for over three weeks now since the Israeli military launched that offensive in Rafah and took control of the Gazan side of that border crossing. But, we're even seeing challenges even after Egypt agreed to send the trucks that would normally go through that crossing through the Israeli-Gaza Kerem Shalom crossing instead. 370 trucks, for example, arrived from Egypt on Monday to that Kerem Shalom crossing, but only 30 of those trucks were actually picked up by the United Nations for distribution, speaking to the enormous security challenges that exist in Gaza that are really hampering the distribution of that aid even once it makes it across the border.

You could see the flooding rain in the streets and the hail piled up like it is snow plow. And you could even take a shovel to it. But, look at the heavy rain that came along with it. In Texas yesterday, we had gusts up to 80 to 95 miles per hour, 95-mile per hour gusts reported and that knocked out power. At last check, we have nearly half a million people still without power in Texas from those destructive winds that came through yesterday and knocked around some of those power lines. Right now, we've got a few storms that are still lingering around parts of Texas. They are sub- severe. So, we're not finding any warnings for damaging winds or large hail.

In its closing, the defense hammered out the credibility of Michael Cohen, at one point telling jurors that Cohen is the GLOAT, the greatest liar of all time\", that there isn't a shred of evidence.

They might not be used, but they still will be in the courtroom. But, yes, these jurors are now at work. They're deciding on whether Donald Trump is guilty or whether he will be acquitted on some or all of these 34 felony counts. You're getting a glimpse at the jury profile right there. Interestingly, there are two lawyers on the jury. So, we'll see how they might interpret this case.The judge did remind the jury several times, they must be unanimous in their decision. They cannot bring any cell phones or electronic devices into the room, but they can bring their notebooks that they've taken copious notes on throughout this process. The jury has been sitting through about five weeks of this trial, and now they will take everything they've heard and seen and apply it to the law in this case. The judge gave very specific instructions about what they can and can't consider, and how they apply it to the law. Interestingly, he said that, even if they find that Donald Trump was merely involved, rather than being the main player in this whole scheme to falsify business records, they can in fact find him guilty. But, of course, they also have to find that there was another violation of another underlying law, like federal election law or tax fraud. And this is all in order for these counts, 34 counts, to rise to felonies. So, Rahel, the jury is at work beginning at 11:28 this morning. We anticipate that the jury will take about an hour for lunch at some point. They won't work during that hour. They'll likely go to 4:30 p.m. today. And again, the only items they'll have with them are their notes from whatever they've jotted down throughout this lengthy trial. We've also just learned that they're able to bring laptops back into the deliberation room. These are court sanctioned laptops that have all of the evidence from the trial. Two of the jurors were just instructed on how to use those laptops, to pull up any of the evidence that was admitted into this trial. So, a lot to go through.

And in this case, in the Trump trial, the jury has a huge amount of evidence that's been presented to them and a lot more accounts, and I can imagine that they may need to come back to the jury -- to the judge several times for further explanation.But, at a certain point, to more specifically answer your question, towards the end of our deliberations, we did ask the judge whether or not we could be unanimous on one of the counts and hung on to others. And he very calmly explained to us that many times juries cannot agree for many days, and sent us back into the deliberation room and demanded that we come back, however long it took, with a unanimous verdict.",

So, all the media circus that's going on in front of the courthouse, they don't really have to see it. I think we all made an enormous effort to block out any kind of social media.

Now, while Combs has strongly denied these claims for many of the suits, he has not responded to all of the allegations.For more now, let's bring in CNN Entertainment Correspondent Elizabeth Wagmeister, who has been doing some really incredible reporting on this very story.

This could still be a lengthy investigation.We all remember back at the end of March when two of Diddy's homes in Los Angeles and Miami were raided by the feds, and that is what this is all leading into. But, this is absolutely the most significant development in this investigation, now that we know that they are preparing potentially for the grand jury.

We just been listening to the former President Donald Trump there, who is of course on trial right now, as the jury is now 17 minutes into deliberations on these charges of falsifying business records just before the 2016 election. A few things we heard from Trump there. He said, I just want to say it's a very unfair trial. It should have never happened. It should have happened seven years ago. He talked about certain things. He attacked Joe Biden, of course, his challenger.He talked about a few things that he said were quite unfair about this trial. He said Bob Costello, one of the witnesses for the defense side. Remember, the defense called two witnesses. Bob Costello was one of them. Trump said that he wouldn't, the judge, wouldn't let him talk. That is not true. Yeah. He gave testimony. He was actually reprimanded by the judge, because of at times what appeared, according to those inside of the courtroom, as a combative witness, Bob Costello there. He said -- Trump said that I'm gagged by this judge. He doesn't continue to -- he doesn't allow me to continue to speak. That's not true, obviously. He was clearly just speaking there. He continues to post, including, if I'm not mistaking, this very morning, alluding to Michael Cohen, the witness in this case. Trump also said November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. Just a split screen here. Trump is obviously speaking to the cameras, to the media, to American voters. Prior to November 5th, the election, he is playing the political game, as is his right. But, inside of that courtroom, there are 12 jurors who are now 19 minutes into jury deliberations, who will decide his legal fate, as we continue to wait what they decide, who they believe.

I think part of the rationale is that demand has dropped off from some consumers. And so, retailers are trying to kind of pump up demand by lowering prices. It also has to do with the fact that consumers are really frustrated right now. And retailers are trying to kind of signal to consumers, hey, we get it. We know prices have gone up. So, it's a little bit of a marketing play. You have these companies putting out press releases, making these splashy announcements, try to kind of signal to customers, we're with you.And then, it's also a supplier play. It is the retailers kind of pushing back against their suppliers, saying, hey, we need to really lower these prices for consumers, and all sorts of way to boost their private labels, the retailer's private label. Some of the prices that they're cutting are on their private label brands, their in-house brands. They are trying to move customers to these cheaper private label brands. So, a lot of different tactics at play here.",
