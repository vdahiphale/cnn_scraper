It was a signal to his base and to President Trump, former President Trump, that he wants to return to Trump's America first kind of era of policy making when it comes to foreign policy. I think that pleased a wing of his base and we know Kevin McCarthy still really wants to please Trump and his supporters, wants to be speaker of the House if Republicans take control. So I think - and I think it was a signal to Republican voters who are thinking about the economy, inflation, recession and how we're spending money.SHANE GOLDMACHER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": I mean I think that when you look at what a Republican Congress and a Democratic White House is going to look like, it's going to look like ugliness and gridlock on some really basic things. Things like raising the debt ceiling. Things like, do we give funds to Ukraine over the war that's happening, right? And I think what McCarthy's doing, he's drawing a line and saying, if you're going to come and want money from me, you're going to have to give me something back. Even if it's something you think is just basic needs, you're going to have to give me something in exchange.",

And what many people don't realize is, when you're dealing with what is essentially this war on the ground in Iran, you can't do what you've done with Russia and Ukraine by arming the Ukrainians with HIMARS. So, what do you do? What does the west do in a situation like this? What happens is, it's amplifications of these voices. Britney Spears has 52 million followers. It might sound insignificant having her tweet about foreign policy, but she is able to amplify the voices and the cases inside Iran right now, putting more attention. That's not what the regime wants. Sixty percent of Iran's population is under the age of 30. They understand this digital revolution that's taking place and how to get that message out. I also have to say, the Iranian regime is pretty savvy and understands how to crack down on that, whether it's finding the people from their balconies and their windows shooting these images and going in to take their phones away.
