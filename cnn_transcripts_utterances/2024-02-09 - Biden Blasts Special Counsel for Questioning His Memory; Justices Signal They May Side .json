Try to recall some of these things to the best of your ability, that he even thanked the president for doing the interview in the middle of an international crisis.

And I thought it was actually a good thing for him to go out and set the record straight on that. I mean, I thought the kind of the two things that worked last night were, one, his very honest and raw and emotional response to the Beau piece of this, and, two, you know, I thought he showed some feistiness. And, ultimately, I think showing a little feistiness and scrapping a little bit, it does combat the age perception. I mean, when he's kind of going back and forth and speaking from the heart and showing fire, that's one thing that he can do to combat the notion that he's too old for the job. So, you know, I thought those were two things that worked in what he was doing last night, and I think what he was trying to convey, trying to push back on some of the substance, but also just, you know, show overall put in context that some of these swipes were out of line, that they were potentially politically motivated and show that fire in the belly, and I do think he did that.",

That's what voters take away from this. And, look, you know, he messes up people's names, Donald Trump messes up people's name. These are both people within cognitive decline. It's very clear. It's why poll after poll says we don't want this match up. We don't want to see a rematch of this.

We're all going to mess up names. We're all going to misremember dates. Obviously, as you said, Poppy, Trump literally just did this last night with Viktor Orban. So, I don't think that a slip of the tongue, as late as last night, the president was explaining in great detail what he's doing to try to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is, in and of itself, something that voters are going to look at and say, oh, well, he screwed up Sisi's name, so he's too old to be president. But he has to be out there. He has to be talking to people, making the case for his presidency for the second term, taking it to Trump, which he's very effective at doing, and also puts that fire on display, which pushes back on the notion of age.

So, laying that out was not a political effort. Robert is a longtime prosecutor. He's a serious guy. I think there's nobody who can really claim that he's a politically motivated actor, right? What in fact he's doing is saying, look, here's the reasons why I chose not to prosecute the president. They are good reasons. They're not about his decision to retain the documents, which was illegal, because he convinced a jury that maybe he forgot about them, forgot they were there and the like, and he had to lay out the case for why.
