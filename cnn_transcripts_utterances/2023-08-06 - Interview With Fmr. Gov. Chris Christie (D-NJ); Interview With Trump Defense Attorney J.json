But, frankly, you talk about our European partners, we got out of the Paris climate accord, and nobody really noticed we actually exceeded the goals in the Paris climate accord in reducing CO2. But we did it through American innovation. We did it through unleashing American energy. And the energy plan we will unveil this week is going to be an all-of-the-above energy strategy. I mean, Joe Biden declared war on energy in his first day in office, shutting down the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. Gasoline prices are jumping back up again this week. We had $2-a-gallon gas under our administration, and we achieved energy independence. We can do it again. And in my campaign going forward, whatever the news of the day is -- Dana, it's just like last week, when we unveiled our inflation plan. This coming week, we're going to lay out a plan to restore American energy independence. And I believe, through innovation, through diversification in energy, we can practice conservation on our land. We had the cleanest air, water and land in the history of the country during our administration. We can meet the goals in our environment without crippling the American economy.",

Dana, I met some of those mothers whose children were ripped away from them by Russian soldiers. They don't know how they are, where they are. This is not a territorial dispute, Dana. This is an absolute authoritarian attempt by Vladimir Putin to overtake the free country of a neighbor. And it's obscene what's going on there. And America is right to supply. And I spoke with President Zelenskyy for an hour. He never once asked to have American troops, American men or women there. All he wants is the ability to fight the war on an even basis. Give you one quick example. In artillery, the Russians are outgunning them on a daily basis nearly 11-1 in artillery. The Ukrainian army is incredibly brave. They're fighting for a unified and free Europe that we have maintained for 80 years, since the end of World War II.
