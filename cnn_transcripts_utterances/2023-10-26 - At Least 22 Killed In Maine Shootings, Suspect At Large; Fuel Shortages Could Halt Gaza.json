Another mass shooting in the United States. At least 22 people reportedly killed in Maine, and the suspect is still at large.We're also following developments out of the Middle East. Israel gearing up for ground operations in Gaza, even as the territory is deepening humanitarian crisis spirals out of control. We begin in Maine where a manhunt is underway after a massacre in two locations in the city of Lewiston. This stage, 22 people are dead up to 60 others wounded. The shootings took place Wednesday night at a bowling alley at a restaurant. Officials in Lewiston and the neighboring city of Auburn are telling residents to stay inside and lock their doors. Hundreds of officers are looking for this man. 40-year-old Robert Card. Police describe him as a person of interest and say he is armed and dangerous. The local sheriff's office released this image of the government holding a high- powered assault style rifle just inside the entrance to the bowling alley. U.S. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the shooting and spoke with Maine's governor and lawmakers. Federal authorities are assisting in the investigation. I want to bring in Steve Moore, a CNN law enforcement contributor and a retired Special Agent for the FBI. Good to have you with us. I want to start, of course, with what we know. Officials saying that the shooting began around 7:00 p.m. local time. 22 people killed, dozens injured in two locations. And seven hours later, the suspect armed with a military-style rifle is still on the run.",

He said the failure will be thoroughly investigated and everyone must provide answers, including himself but only after the war.Meanwhile, the crisis in Gaza is deepening amid severe shortages and the intense Israeli bombardment. The Hamas-controlled Palestinian health ministry says recent Israeli air strikes on Gaza killed more than 700 people in a single day. Some food, water and medicine have reached to Gaza via Egypt. But the main U.N. aid agency in Gaza says it will be forced to suspend crucial operations in the hours ahead if fuel is not delivered. Since fuel is needed to collect and distribute those supplies, reserves are believed to be running dangerously low. The Israeli government has said it won't allow fuel into Gaza because Hamas will steal it and use it for its operations. Well, fuel is also desperately needed to power hospitals. Doctors warn waves of new patients injured and the daily bombings and babies relying on oxygen supplies will die if fuel is not brought in. CNN's Clarissa Ward has details on that and we need to warn you, her piece contains images that are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Every morning they gather outside the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Family members bidding farewell to their loved ones who did not survive the night. A ritual that tragically has become all too familiar in Gaza. Women and children, these are the targets this man laments. This is Hamas. Hours earlier, the chaotic moments as the dead and injured were brought into the hospital during the most intense night of bombardment in the last 17 days. And as with every night, so many of the victims, children. Dr. Mohammad Rayyan says the E.R. has struggled to keep up with the flood of casualties and the severity of the injuries that they are dealing with, particularly third-degree burns. The hospital is not prepared to deal with these types of burns and I don't suppose the bigger hospitals will be able to either, he says. We're suffering from a lack of essentials due to the siege. Even as we speak now at any moment the electricity could cut off. The World Health Organization has warned the 12 of Gaza's 35 hospitals are no longer functioning. And that number is about to get higher and less desperately needed fuel arrives. Left to fend for themselves with no place to go. They watch and wait for help that has yet to come. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we don't know a lot of the facts, I want to be clear about that.

Many states have passed those. Maine doesn't have one, expanding the Brady background check system could have an impact, an actual extreme risk protection law or Red Flag Law.Maine calls itself having a Yellow Flag Law. When you look at that law, it actually has no real protections that can be easily enforced, for family members who have individuals in their midst, or neighbors or others in the community who see someone at risk, which is reported that this was the case here. There is no real tool in the state as in California, where I am right now, Virginia where I live, and 25 other states roughly, that allow law enforcement and family members to seek a court order to remove firearms from someone who is at risk of doing harm to themselves and others. And frankly, a whole host of additional laws that could have been brought to bear. But those are the most salient ones that are lacking in this state that are used and utilized every day in other states to prevent tragedies from unfolding. And given that we have 450 million firearms in this country, the lack of that kind of action to protect our fellow citizens, the essence of public safety is extremely frustrating and very sad to me. I don't want more people in this country joining this club who are victims of gun violence. This is ultimately preventable.

That's the question everyone has who doesn't live in America.And for those of us who live here, what we have to understand, I think increasingly people are understanding this is that, if guns are the number one killer of our kids, we can't say that we live in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

I'm in California right now, they have the strongest gun laws in the country and per capita, they have way fewer gun deaths and injury than any other state in the country. We need to double down and understand. We need Uniform Federal laws across this country. We don't need to have a version of the Second Amendment interpreted by the courts, that is a death sentence to our fellow Americans. We can respect the Second Amendment and not bankrupt our public safety laws in that equation. And right now, that's in the balance.

And so Israel has this ax to grind. And obviously, these comments from the Secretary General haven't helped things. Obviously, he said that look, he said on Tuesday, it is important to also recognize that the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. He also went on to say that, look, none of this justifies any attacks on Israel, certainly not the attack that came from Hamas.

And the ambassador to the United Nations also said this on Twitter, saying every person, quote, understands very well that the meaning of his words is that Israel has guilt for the actions of Hamas, or at the very least, it shows his understanding for the background leading up to the massacre that Hamas perpetuated. Obviously, none of this, Lynda, helps the current situation. You have the U.N. on the ground in Gaza, saying that they will run out of fuel in a matter of hours to fund what they or to -- that obviously helps them do what they need to do there and including providing fuel to hospitals. The Israelis are unwilling to send it at this point. And you also have this situation in the U.N. Security Council as well, where you have these competing drafts between Western countries and Russia. And the Chinese, all sorts of squabbling over the fine language about whether to call for a ceasefire or humanitarian pause and when or how much to denounce the, what Israel is doing or what Hamas is doing.",

And look privately and publicly, Western leaders have said that whatever comes next for the Israelis in this potential ground invasion or ground incursion, needs to take into account, international law and also civilian lives.But perhaps many people across the Arab world or the Islamic world aren't hearing that part. They're not hearing about the calls to provide aid to Gaza. They're just hearing Western leaders lining up to stand with Israel and not being nearly as outraged about deaths in Gaza as they are in Israel. Obviously, Western leaders would deny that account. But perhaps, you know, the most blunt yesterday was actually the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who summarized his thoughts. He announced that he was canceling a trip to Israel saying that Israel cannot justify killing children even in response to the Hamas attacks which it does not condone. He said that look, Turkey doesn't have a problem with Israel, but it can never approve of, in his words, atrocities that Israel has carried out. And then when it came to Hamas, he said this.

Look, President Erdogan had initially sought to be a peace broker early on in this conflict similar to the work that he's done and trying to mediate between the Russians and the Ukrainians in that conflict. But obviously as this has gone on, he like other leaders across the Islamic world have become more and more vocal and more and more critical of Israel.[02:50:09] KINKADE: All right, Scott McLean, staying across all the developments for us from London, thanks so much.
