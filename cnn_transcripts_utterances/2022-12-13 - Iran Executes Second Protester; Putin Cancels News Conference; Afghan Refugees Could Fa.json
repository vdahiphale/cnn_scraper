Usually, a wide- ranging marathon kind of press conference that typically is stretched on for hours. Though there are questions, but maybe he doesn't want to answer questions about his war in Ukraine and the setbacks that he's faced.CNN's Bianca Nobilo and Max Foster are joining us live from London.

British intelligence, strangely, has got involved in this and they are suggesting that they are concerned the Kremlin - that it could be hijacked by unsanctioned discussions about the special military operation. Also saying it's likely to increase concerns about the prevalence of anti-war feeling in Russia.
