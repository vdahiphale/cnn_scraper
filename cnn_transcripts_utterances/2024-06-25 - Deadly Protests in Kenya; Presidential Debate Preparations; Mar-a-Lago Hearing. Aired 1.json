Billionaire Barry Diller has called Trump Media a scam and said that people who buy the stock are -- quote -- \"dopes.\"Now, to make his point, Reid Hoffman said, look at how Trump media is valued compared to another social media company, Meta. That's the company behind Instagram and Facebook. Meta is trading at about nine times what it brought in, in sales last year. By comparison, Trump Media is trading at more than 1,400 times its sales last year. And, Jim, look, this is not a trivial matter, right? I mean, Trump's stake is worth around $4 billion in this company. And there's a lot of real people who do own stock here, and they would get hurt if gravity sets in.",

I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now, Trump's defense team is launching yet another attack on the special counsel in that case, Jack Smith, and his office. It's the former president's latest bid to have the classified documents case tossed out. Right now, Judge Aileen Cannon is holding a confidential hearing, we're told, with both sides, ahead of today's public hearing. It follows Monday's back-to-back hearings where tensions flared between the judge and the prosecution. At one point, Cannon saying -- quote -- \"I don't appreciate your tone.\" Meantime, a late-night filing from Smith's office contained never- before-seen evidence, photos from Mar-a-Lago -- you can see it right there -- showing boxes with their contents spilled out onto the floor. Smith's office is expected to use this as they defend their handling of evidence today. CNN's Evan Perez is outside the court this morning. He joins me now. Evan, tell us more about this new filing and these photos. What more can you tell us?",

They're arguing that, because some of the documents in those boxes that were taken from Mar-a-Lago back in August of 2022, the order in which those documents were found had changed as a result of the investigation, that this affects or hurts his ability to mount a defense.And so what you're seeing there in some of these new photographs, you will see once that were taken by Walt Nauta. It looks like something out of the show \"Hoarders,\" right, where you see these boxes sitting in a closet there in a room with them spilling out of the boxes. There's also boxes that show classified documents intermingled with news clippings, and another one, a document or a letter written from the White House on White House stationery to families from Sandy Hook. And so what the special counsel is saying is that, look, there was no bad faith, there was nothing lost in -- as part of this investigation. And what they're saying is that the court should see Trump's newly invented explanations for how these documents were found as his latest unfounded accusations against law enforcement. In other words, law enforcement did not do this to try to fix this case against the former president. Again, we have an ongoing hearing that is still on -- that is going behind closed doors. We expect that some of this, Jim, some of these pictures and some of these documents from the latest filing to be part of the hearing. We will see later this afternoon.",

And that's a fair question.Federal judges, Jim, have a very robust amount of authority. We respect that authority you practice before federal judges. But, generally speaking, I don't have any issue or qualms with the competence of the judge at all. She's come from tremendous law schools. She's had tremendous experiences. I think my issue is the process.In terms of what I do in my daily practice is that you go before judges and they move cases along. And if you have a meritorious argument, they will hear it. If there are argument that are well-settled in law, they will not. But what they will do is, they will move the calendar, because there's a lot to get to. And if you have something that you have to say, put it in a motion, we will have a hearing and decide it. But this delay, delay, delay is somewhat -- it just doesn't happen.

And, certainly, when you're trying to get across an argument that you believe to be significant, that you believe to impact the impactful, the judge may, for example, take umbrage with how you express something. And it happens, right? Perfection eludes us all. The real issue on the merits of the gag order is, why not? I mean, the reality is, is that, yes, Jim, listen, we live in a free speech country. And in a free speech country, I will tell you that judges do not like to stop, prevent people from saying anything. And they certainly don't like to restrict content of what people say. However, having said that, you know, I know that there are limitations to speech. You can't yell fire in a theater. You can't defame someone. What am I speaking about, right? I'm speaking about the notion of limiting speech when it impairs something. We have seen gag orders before. Why? Because of the issue of fear and intimidation, hush money in New York, the election interference case before Judge Chutkan in D.C. Whenever it leads to fear, intimidation, it's a problem. Whenever it could lead to potential violence, it's a problem. So if you're saying things about assassination, yes, you want to limit the amount in which you can restrict someone, but I think you have to protect public safety.

Sources say the reason for that is simple. The president's policy achievements, in their view, are not resonating with the American people. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is projecting confidence ahead of the CNN showdown, but this morning appeared to suggest that the president may not entirely follow that advice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  When there is an opportunity for this president to speak to millions of Americans, he shows up and he meets the moment. So, obviously, the president's going to look forward to Thursday doing just that, laying out what he normally does, what he's done the last three-and-a-half years, how he's going to continue to build on the economy.

He has to demonstrate that he gets it and he has a plan to fix it. Talking about, I did this and this and this and you should be grateful, that will be tone-deaf from Biden.

They just managed to put out the fire a short while ago by the Nairobi City County Fire Department.It's not clear what happened here. Some of the protesters claim police fired tear gas inside the building while there were still people in there. So they managed to put that under control. But the building called Uganda House is badly damaged. This is just a sign of how violent these anti-tax hike protests became. It began as young people angry at overtaxation by the government of President William Ruto, who famously got a big welcome in the White House only a few weeks ago. And now, back here at home, young people who voted for him feel disillusioned. They feel that, even though he told them to elect him in 2022, because he understood the plight of the common man, he has turned his backs on them and is overtaxing them. And so they're angry about this proposed finance bill that would raise taxes on a lot of basic commodities. They have taken advantage of that to do some general looting. On this street, this entire block has businesses that have been ransacked, that the walls have been broken into and every single thing that was inside appears to have been taken away. There's no valuables left here. So what you have is this scene here with broken glass and these shutters completely broken into. And people up here who have just been taking advantage of the situation and the anarchy to loot as much as possible. And that's -- now, these businessmen, I spoke to some of them who say they have lost everything. They're trying to come to terms with the extent of the damage here in the middle of the city. This is one of the main business thoroughfares here in the city. And I have never seen it like this even in previous protests. But there is some real anger on the streets of Nairobi about these tax proposals for people who feel they're already overburdened, but they cannot afford any more taxes. The police have been fighting protesters all day, surviving water cannon, surviving a lot of tear gas throughout the day.
