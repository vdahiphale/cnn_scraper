It may look like the size of a baked potato that you'd eat like one I ate last night. But in reality, that is a 2,500-pound potato that's going to be dropping in about 30 minutes now. G. TUCHMAN:  That's right; 1,000 LED lights are inside that potato. There are laser beams. There is fog coming out of it. L. TUCHMAN:  It's a disco potato. G. TUCHMAN:  Yes. We call it disco potato, also a glowtato. (CROSSTALK) G. TUCHMAN:  We want to introduce somebody who's here right now. This person right here -- L. TUCHMAN:  This is my new best friend, Spuddy Buddy. Hug. G. TUCHMAN:  Spuddy Buddy does not talk because potatoes don't talk. But Spuddy Buddy, who represents the Idaho Potato Council and 13 billion pounds of potatoes are harvested in Idaho each year. L. TUCHMAN:  Not Spuddy Buddy, though. (CROSSTALK) G. TUCHMAN:  No, this is the number one state, everyone loves potatoes, it's the perfect food. Spuddy Buddy can't talk but Spuddy Buddy can dance. Give us the potato dance. L. TUCHMAN:  Oh, yes. And everyone here really loves potatoes. But we also love being out here in this beautiful weather. G. TUCHMAN:  Right, this is the state capital of Idaho, right behind us. We're in downtown Boise. Right now thousands of people here. We want to give you a look over here. At the stroke of midnight Mountain time, on this little ski mountain, there are going to be skiers and snowboarders in a competition doing death-defying feats. So we're excited to be here. This is the one thing I'm going to tell you about we're really excited about -- (CROSSTALK) G. TUCHMAN:  -- tell them the honor that we have. L. TUCHMAN:  So we've got the very distinct honor of pressing the button at midnight to welcome the New Year's in on Mountain Standard Time. G. TUCHMAN:  That's right, we're going to press the button. And the potato is going to come down to bring in 2023 here. So it's exciting for us to have that honor. Whole different topic, I'm a huge hockey fan and I want to promote something on our sister network, TNT. The Winter Classic hockey game outdoors tomorrow, Fenway Park where the Red Sox play, where the Green Monster is. The Boston Bruins, the Pittsburgh Penguins, 1:00 Eastern time, 10:00 Pacific time.
