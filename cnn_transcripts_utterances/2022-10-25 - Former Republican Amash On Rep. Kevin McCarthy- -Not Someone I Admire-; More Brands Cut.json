      "sentences": "All right, Anderson.Well, welcome to CNN TONIGHT. I am Jake Tapper in Washington. Tonight, we are just two weeks away, from the critically important midterm elections. And I've been talking to strategists, and pollsters, from both parties, today, to try to get a sense, and share with you, what they think the lay of the land is right now. So, allow me to be your guide, if you will, as we take a look at what they think is actually going on out there. Because, earlier this month, you might remember, we told you about how President Biden's pollster, had coined this election, \"Headwinds versus head cases.\" The headwinds, in his view, challenging the Democrats? Majority disapproval of President Biden, high inflation, a possible recession, among other factors. The head cases, hindering Republicans? What Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell diplomatically referred to as \"Candidate quality\" issues. That's the Republican candidates, with limited appeal, or various scandals, creating challenges in races that theoretically they should be running away with. But those headwinds, they seem to be a changing, and getting a little stronger. And the politicos with whom I spoke today all agree, as of now, a modest Red wave, at the very least, seems to be building. Best estimates put Republicans in at picking up about 25 seats. They only need to win five, to flip the House, for Congressman Kevin McCarthy, to become House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. How worried are Democrats? Well, just today, President Biden directed the Democratic National Committee, to transfer another $18 million, to help House and Senate Democrats, in their races. That includes a very high profile race, in New York, featuring the Head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a member of House Democratic leadership. The DCCC is apparently so worried about its own Chairman, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, that the DCCC is throwing another $600,000, into the race, to defend him. That alone, for Democrats, is alarming. But when Democrats are concerned about House seats, in New England? That is a flashing red light! First Lady Jill Biden heads to Rhode Island, tomorrow, to help a Democratic House candidate, there. Vice President Kamala Harris visited Connecticut, earlier this month, to help a House Democratic candidate, there. And Republicans are reportedly now recommitting money, in New Hampshire, to try to unseat Democratic senator, Maggie Hassan. Continuing our trip now, through the political landscape, let's go visit my home, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Tonight, the two Senate candidates, in that race, sparred in their first and only debate, Democratic Lieutenant Governor, John Fetterman versus Republican candidate Mehmet Oz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. JOHN FETTERMAN, (D) PENNSYLVANIA U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE: I'm also having to talk about something called the \"Oz Rule\" that if he's on TV, he's lying. DR. MEHMET OZ, (R) PENNSYLVANIA U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE: John Fetterman takes everything to an extreme, and those extreme positions hurt us all. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And now, it's possible that Dr. Oz could, could become Senator Oz, even though Oz has a net negative favorability rating, in Pennsylvania. More people disapprove of him there than approve of him. Quite a big gap at that!Let's turn west, now. Let's go from Pennsylvania to America's Dairyland, and another Senate race, in which momentum has seen to shift, toward the GOP, in recent weeks, with again, Republicans attacking the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, in this case, Mandela Barnes, for being soft on crime. A \"Washington Post\" analysis, out today, found that Republicans have spent tens of millions of dollars more, attacking Democrats on crime than on inflation. Now, just two months ago, Democrats were confident that Barnes would be able to knock off Wisconsin senator, Ron Johnson. Now, the race is a toss-up. People I spoke to today think that Ron Johnson probably even has a slight edge. And the Democratic finger-pointing has begun! (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM NELSON, (D) OUTAGAMIE COUNTY, WI EXECUTIVE: The National Party has totally failed us. And so, it's going to come down to Wisconsin Democrats.

And yet, a new poll, from Monmouth, says 63 percent of Americans believe that President Biden is not paying enough attention to the issues that matter most to them.And that may be part of the reason why Democrats also are starting to face some structural problems, with various racial minorities, groups that they've been able to rely upon, for electoral support, in the past, Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, groups that are starting slowly but surely to peel away from automatically supporting Democrats. One poll shows that Hispanic support, for Democrats, in congressional races has dropped by about 13 points, since the 2016 and 2018 elections. Now, 13 points? That might not sound like much to you. But even if just a sliver of minority voters cast a ballot, for Republicans, or stay at home? That could be, in these tight races, enough, to hand the Republicans, a victory. And voter enthusiasm, for Democrats, among Democratic groups, and demographics? Right now, that appears a real challenge, as Senator Bernie Sanders told me, two days ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): I am worried about the level of voter turnout, among young people, and working people, who will be voting Democratic.

But if Biden acknowledges a walloping, it's not as if it would be unprecedented.Now, the past might not be prologue, however, when it comes to something else. And as your election guide, I've got to warn you, boys and girls, watch your step. We're entering unchartered territory. This will be the very first election, since Donald Trump convinced a huge swath of the American public that the U.S. election system is rigged. It's a false charge, but it led to a bloody Insurrection. And this time around, we're seeing big signs of potential trouble. Candidates, in key races, across the country, continue to lie to voters, about the 2020 election. These are, in some cases, the very same people, who will be in charge of certifying the election results, if they win. The list includes Secretary of State Candidates in Nevada, and Arizona, plus Arizona's Republican candidate for governor, Kari Lake. That could become a huge problem, in 2024, if those folks get elected, and if they continue to swear allegiance, to Trump's lies, instead of the U.S. Constitution. Another issue now? Not in 2024, but now? These allegations of voter intimidation we're hearing, intimidation by vigilantes. Some of them are now under investigation. Last Friday, two armed individuals, dressed in tactical gear, were spotted at a ballot drop box, in Mesa, Arizona. Also, in the Grand Canyon State, a group calling itself \"Clean Elections USA,\" accused of stalking ballot boxes, taking photos, of voters' license plates. This is impacting mostly, we're told, Latino voters and, in particular, the elderly. Seniors often prefer a ballot drop-off, to having to stand in long lines, according to a lawsuit, filed, on behalf of those voters. And yet, Clean Elections USA has allegedly accused at least one voter, perhaps your average grandma of being a mule! A mule is a reference, to a fringe voter fraud conspiracy that was amplified, in the latest MAGA propaganda film, the widely discredited, fact-challenged \"2000 Mules.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
