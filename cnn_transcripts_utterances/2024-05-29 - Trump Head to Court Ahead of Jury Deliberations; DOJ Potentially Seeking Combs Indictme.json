And I think what the campaign is doing is not really anything different than what they did on the day that President Biden announced for reelection, which is the contrast between what he has done for the country and what he will continue to do for the country, focused on economic growth, protecting our rights and freedoms, protecting our democracy, versus Donald Trump, who showed us what he wants to do if he is elected again. January 6th was just a trial run. And so the contrast between someone who wants to protect our democracy and our Constitution, and Donald Trump, who wants to destroy it, this - the place where you are now, John, I think is a perfect backdrop for that because it is all about our judicial system, our institutions, our democratic institutions, and how one candidate wants to preserve them and strengthen them and one candidate wants to destroy them.",

I don't know if necessarily there are things that I would much rather him say that speak to how he's going to help this country move forward as opposed to the continued rants about this being a, you know, political or election interference trial.I think it's, you know, as he heads into this case - into this, I guess, the jury decision, I have to assume that he's a little bit nervous, right? I think that he's, quite frankly, biding on the hope that there is one juror that's going to stick up for him. But again, as you watch, it's kind of hard for all of us outside without having been in the courthouse from day one to see what's actually happening. I think it's going to be hard for him to kind of walk out of there without some sort of maybe some vindication for a few of the charges, but some of the other ones, you know, not so. But it all plays into his argument. And I think his argument is, unfortunately in some cases, resonating with the base for one and then, two, those folks that he needs to come back over to his side from the Biden campaign in 2020.",

This is seen as a clear sign the Department of Justice could be moving to indict him. Since November, Combs has been named in eight civil lawsuits, seven directly accusing him of sexual assault. His homes, you'll recall, were searched by the FBI in March. And there's a lot more to this.CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister has this new reporting and she's joining us now.

Based on the sources that I have spoken to, they said that while federal investigators are planning to present this to a grand jury, that nobody has been prepped for testimony yet. At this stage, witnesses have been notified that they could potentially be called to testify in front of a federal grand jury in New York City. But that's where this stands.And right now, Kate, the investigators are still diligently doing their work. They are still calling in people for questioning. They are bringing back some potential witnesses for repeat questioning. I hear from a source that some of these accusers, who have filed lawsuits against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, have been called in multiple times. And we all remember back in March when two of Diddy's homes were raided, both in Miami and in Los Angeles, and they seized a lot of evidence. So, they are combing through all of this. I have one source telling me that should there be an indictment, that federal agents want to ensure that this is bullet proof. That is the word that they use. So, not something that we expect to happen immediately, but, as you said, this is a clear indication that this investigation is moving along and in a substantial way.",

Remember, he is facing eight lawsuits, seven which directly accuse him of sexual assault. And the big question remains, will this domino effect continue? Will there be more accusers that can potentially come forward? We hear that in addition to the accusers who have already filed these sexual assault civil lawsuits, that investigators have brought in additional people.

The defense's relentless focus on Michael Cohen continuing through closing arguments I think - John said it and we - and, obviously, it is true if John Berman said it, the defense called Michael Cohen a liar 78 times during closings.

You have the facts as you find them.And I think one of the critical issues that the defense would have the jury believe, right, is that you cannot convict unless you believe Michael Cohen. Now, whether that's true is an open question. I think prosecutors certainly did a lot to corroborate Michael Cohen with respect to other witnesses who told the same narrative, and with respect to saying, are you serious? Of course you can convict, even if you don't believe Michael Cohen, because there's so much else. And we call that drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence. Sometimes it's not direct evidence, but there's something called circumstantial evidence, and boy is that a plenty, right? So, that's what prosecutors did. But, ultimately, I think the defense used what was very important, which was to brand this as the Michael Cohen case. He's on trial. And if you can't trust him, you cannot vote to convict. And so they used that, I think, to great effectiveness. How effective it was is ultimately in the hands of the jury.",

So, we know that he's going to say that there was a federal election crime, that they contributed too much money to the campaign.
