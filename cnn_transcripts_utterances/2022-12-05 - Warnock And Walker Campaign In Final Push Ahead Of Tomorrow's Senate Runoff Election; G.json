At stake, whether Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock holds off challenger, Herschel Walker giving Democrats a 51 to 49 majority and control of Senate Committees next year. Now the race has already seen a record number of early ballots cast, massive campaign spending especially on the Democratic side. Negative ads from both sides and numerous allegations of personal misconduct by women against Walker, it has been quite a race, it was quite a final day of it. CNN's Jeff Zeleny tonight has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): One final day of overtime in Georgia. SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): We are on the verge of victory, but I don't want us to do the victory dance before we actually get into the endzone. ZELENY (voice over): Senator Raphael Warnock exuding confidence, but warning Democrats against being complacent on the eve of his runoff against Republican challenger, Herschel Walker. HERSCHEL WALKER (R), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: You are going to know you've got a champion in Herschel Walker. ZELENY (voice over): With control of the Senate set to stay in Democratic hands, Walker implored Republicans to send him to Washington as a check on President Biden and his policies.",

In fact, Senator Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent was calling Herschel Walker, his opponent, the handpicked candidate of Donald Trump today, so trying to use him to fire him up. But on that phone call tonight with supporters, the former President said that Herschel Walker is the last line of defense against President Biden, so trying to cast this race even though the control of the Senate does not depend on it, as a check against the White House. He said, if Herschel Walker is elected, it will make Chuck Schumer's life more miserable.

The question is, in these larger urban counties like DeKalb County, Fulton County, in Savannah, and Augusta, where people will, particularly Black voters in those areas continue to come out tomorrow, and will we have a large enough early vote advantage?I say the answer to that is yes, because you've seen a well-oiled machine on behalf of the Warnock campaign showing up early. Now, he will tell you, like anyone else will tell you, you cannot count your chickens before they hatch. As he says you can spike the ball before you actually score the touchdown.

We could wake up Wednesday morning and Herschel Walker win by a landslide. I just don't see any data points that show that actually could happen. But the one thing that just shocks me is, you know, here we are at the closing part, and the best asset that Republicans have is Joe Biden. It's really the kind of the failed record and all those things out there that just are unanswerable. We're not talking about that. We're talking about Herschel Walker, we're talking about shortcomings. We're talking about whether or not he lived in Texas or not, and why, you know, all these interviews he gave from Texas.

And I think that when you have two candidates and you're able to draw those contrasts, there's been nothing dramatic that's happened. And I don't think that the Kemp organization is a dramatic addition for Herschel Walker or a huge subtraction for Raphael Warnock. There has been nothing to change the game or the dynamics.
