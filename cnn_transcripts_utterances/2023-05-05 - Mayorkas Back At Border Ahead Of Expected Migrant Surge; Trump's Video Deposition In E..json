Red Cross volunteers also on the ground helping out with the growing number of migrants already crossing into Texas. That is even before Title 42, as it's known, ends.That Trump-era policy allowed the government to quickly turn away asylum seekers due to COVID-19. That expires on Thursday. Border towns have been bracing for an immediate surge -- really a further surge from where we've been. That includes El Paso, Texas, which is where CNN's Rosa Flores is at. Rosa, listen, to be frank, this has been a long time coming. The numbers there are already great. I suppose the question is how much greater do they expect the numbers to be in the coming days? ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): You know, it's unclear. Officials really don't know and they're not releasing estimates. The image is here in El Paso still very dramatic. Walk with me. I'm in this alley where migrants are setting up practically tarps and blankets to protect themselves from the sun. They're staying underneath because it's very hot here in El Paso right now. The city of El Paso estimates that there's about 2300 migrants that are in the city streets at the moment. That's on top of all of the migrants that are inside shelters already. At this location where I'm at, officials believe that there's about 1800 migrants that are out in the street. Now, the scene might change here in the coming days. We don't know exactly how much. But the city does plan to tap into some of the resources that they have. Some of the shelters. They're going to start opening some of the shelters but here's the thing. We don't know how much the scene here will change for this reason. The city of El Paso can only help migrants who have turned in themselves to border authorities. They had -- and gotten processing papers. A lot of the individuals here actually decided to enter the country illegally. The city can't help them. That's why you see a lot of American Red Cross blankets out here. That's why the American Red Cross is here. The city of El Paso asked the American Red Cross to help, to come on- site because they can't help individuals who entered the country illegally. Now, about the flow as we anticipate the end of Title 42 from talking to sources at USC BP. They anticipate that large group of -- groups of migrants will continue to be turning themselves in to authorities. A lot of them will be entering illegally, Jim. USC BP is saying that they've been battling a misinformation campaign by transnational organizations, i.e. the cartels. A lot of these cartels lied to the migrants. They smuggle them into the country illegally. And this is where they ended up, in camps outside a church here in El Paso, Jim.",

A high- powered U.S. weapons system that Ukraine says is a game-changer in its fight against Russia is running into some problems on the battlefield. CNN has learned that Russia has had some success jamming the GPS of the American-made HIMARS units so that the rockets missed their targets.CNN's Alex Marquardt broke this story for us and joins us now live. Alex, this is as the Ukrainians say a game-changer but it's being rendered less effective. ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (on camera): It was an immediate game-changer, Boris, when it arrived in Ukraine early last summer. This is the most celebrated weapons system that Ukraine has received from the U.S. It is the most feared by the Russian side, and that is because it is extraordinarily precise. It can fire six rockets at any given time. The rockets they have now can go around 50 miles or 80 kilometers and land with a precision of around 10 feet. But, Boris, they are guided in part by a GPS guidance system and that is what the Russians have figured out how to jam. It is relatively simple. And so, what has happened is it has made them less effective. I spoke with the Ukrainian source, he talks to drone operators on the front line, those drone operators saying that they are not hitting their targets as much and that they are sometimes missing their targets altogether. So, what has happened is the U.S. has worked with Ukraine to come up with workarounds to get around that jamming. And then the Russians will figure out how to counteract that countermeasure. So, in the words of one senior Pentagon official, it is constant tweaking that they have to do. It is a constant game of cat and mouse to keep the tactical edge of that very powerful weapon system.",

The White House has simply called this ludicrous. This is in line we should say, Boris, with what we've heard from the Kremlin before that the U.S. is not only supporting Ukraine in that fight but Russia feels like it is fighting against all of NATO.

I mean, that's something that we've been struggling to do for a very long time now. And that's good news.It comes though, with a bit of a trade-off and some bitterness as well. And that as the bitter side of the pill is that those over 65 are not participating in the labor force as they have in the past. And those over 55 are not participating in the labor force as they have in the past. That is a residual of the pandemic, but also the care crisis we have in the United States. People that are in their 50s -- their mid-50s, in particular, women are saying that they're dropping out of the labor force to either care for an elderly parent or for children -- of their children, their grandchildren. And that underscores the childcare crisis we have. The good news is, is that women are driving the participation rate and it's coming up again. And it's finally exceeded those 1999 levels, which is just stunning. The bad news is we're still lagging all our competitors out there in prime-age women participation. And in male participation rate. The participation rate, just north of the border in Canada is much higher among women ages 25 to 54 as it is among men. So, we're still trying to catch up but the good news is we're beginning to. The other part about the data that I think is important is the downward revisions we saw. March was the weakest month in terms of overall employment gains with the revisions -- the downward revisions to it, which were quite large that we've seen since December of 2020 when employment actually contracted. What it suggests as we've seen two months in a row after the longest string of upward revisions to the data that we had seen on record is two months of a row of downward revisions. That means we could be at a tipping point where we're now overcounting the number of workers each month. But the good news is, that's not going to affect that unemployment rate, that unemployment rate is still extremely low. It's been under four percent for 15 months -- consecutive months straight. That's the longest string of unemployment rates below four percent since 1969. That's very important for a couple of reasons. Most important to the Federal Reserve is that is also an era that the Fed thought that the Fed was in a combating inflation mode and didn't defeat inflation back then. It is also above with the Fed estimates as a non-inflationary rate of unemployment.",

Senator Dianne Feinstein hasn't voted in the Senate since February 16 as she recovers at home from shingles. But the California Democrat argues in a statement. \"There has been no slowdown in advancing and confirming judges.\" Her statement also blames Republicans for blocking some judicial nominees.Let's bring in CNN's Lauren Fox, who's on Capitol Hill. Lauren, the question is, is she right? And also, how long are Democrats willing to wait for her to come back? LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Jessica. I mean, the pressure is really mounting on her to set aside to retire the argument coming from her colleagues, some of whom say that she has had a very impressive three decades of service on Capitol Hill, but that it is time for the 89-year-old to step aside if she is not coming back soon. In fact, the New York Times editorial board wrote this today in a piece saying. \"If members can't effectively represent their constituents, they should not hesitate to turn their job over to someone who can. Ms. Feinstein owes California a responsible decision.\" Now, the argument from Senator Feinstein's office is that her absence has not had the kind of impact that some Democrats have painted a picture of. In a statement yesterday, Senator Feinstein said there has been no slowdown. When I returned to the Senate, we will be able to move the remaining qualified nominees. The issue, Jessica, on Capitol Hill is not necessarily the judicial nominees that were in the pipeline and ready to go on the Senate floor. Democrats still have the advantage there. The issue is when it comes to the Senate Judiciary Committee without Senator Feinstein's presence, they now have eight equally divided committees. That means that anyone who does not have the support of both Democrats and Republicans gets stuck in committee, and that means that you cannot move forward with a floor vote. So, that's the main issue happening right now. And while during her absence, yes, they have been able to advance many nominees on the Senate floor. They're starting to run short in that timeline. And the concern is if she's gone much longer, the amount of judges that you have in that pipeline starts to dry up, Jessica.",
