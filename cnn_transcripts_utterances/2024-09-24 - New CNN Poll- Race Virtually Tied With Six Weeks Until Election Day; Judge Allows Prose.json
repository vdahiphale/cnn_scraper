On the issues, about 40 percent of likely voters say the economy is the most important one to them. That is followed by protecting democracy, immigration also abortion rights.But when it comes to trust the data shows voters overall back Trump to handle the economy 50 percent to Harris' 39 percent. Earlier Trump turned his attention to that issue when he pitched his economic vision to voters in the battleground state of Georgia, that is where we find CNN's Kristen Holmes live in Savannah, where Trump just spoke. Tell us, did he stick to the economic message or did he go elsewhere?",

He re-litigated the ABC debate attacking Kamala Harris, attacking ABC, called names, Kamala Harris. He went through the details of both the first and second assassination attempt. And at one point he was talking about standing over French fries at McDonald's as he accused Kamala Harris of never working at McDonald's.But this was billed as an economic speech and the reason why his campaign continues to hold these events in smaller venues to try and get him focused on the economy is because of the polling that you just talked about, because of the polling that shows that among likely voters 50 percent of the voters are more likely to trust Donald Trump with the economy than they do Kamala Harris at 39 percent. That is a huge margin. But again, Donald Trump has a hard time staying on message when he did talk about the economy. One of the things he promised was to essentially bring foreign jobs here as well as American jobs back to American soil. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: With the vision I'm outlining today, not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands, but under my leadership, we're going to take other countries' jobs. Did you ever hear that expression before? Have you ever heard that we're going to take other countries' jobs? It's never been stated before. We're going to take their factories and - and we had it really rocking four years ago - we're going to bring thousands and thousands of businesses and trillions of dollars in wealth back to the good ole' USA.

      "sentences": "Because of the simple fact that consumers pay for tariffs, that's just how it works.Kristen Holmes in Savannah, Georgia, thanks so much. Let's turn now to CNN's Matt Egan. So Matt, Trump, of course, focusing on the economy, speaking about jobs, tax cuts, tariffs, among other things, what did you hear in his remarks that stood out to you? Was there - were there new proposals in there? MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER: Well, Jim, former President Trump spent a lot of time talking about how he wants to create a manufacturing renaissance by a combination of, yes, lower taxes and, as Kristen was just saying, higher tariffs. But there were a number of misleading or even false statements in these Trump remarks. We've got to address a few of them. First on tariffs, he said that tariffs would not cause inflation, even though many, many mainstream economists that I talked to, they say the exact opposite. The Peterson Institute has said that the Trump tariff plan would cost a typical middle-income family $2,600 per year and that doesn't even account for the almost definite retaliation from other countries. Trump also - he falsely claimed that Vice President Harris wants to ban fracking and end all fossil fuel production, even though Harris has said that she no longer wants to ban fracking. And ending all fossil fuel production would send gasoline prices to the moon. We should also note that under Biden-Harris, the U.S. is producing more oil than ever before. Trump also did talk up his 2017 tax cuts, but he said they were the biggest ever - even bigger than under Ronald Reagan, that is not true, as CNN has repeatedly fact-checked. It's not the biggest on an inflation-adjusted basis or relative to GDP. Also, we should note that tax cuts, like what former President Trump is calling for, would be very expensive. The nonpartisan budget model at Penn Wharton, where Trump went to school, has estimated that his tax cuts and other policies would cost almost $6 trillion over a decade. That's just one estimate, but still it is very telling. Now, on tariffs, Trump just yesterday was in Pennsylvania, where he talked up the idea of a 200 percent tariff on an American company, John Deere. He said if John Deere goes forward with their plans to move jobs and shut down production in the Midwest and move it to Mexico, then he would impose this 200 percent tariff. This is something that billionaire Mark Cuban has blasted. He was on Twitter, where he said that that idea is, quote, \"insane,\" and he said that would be a good way to destroy a legendary American company and increase costs to American buyers. One other point here, Jim, is Vice President Harris, of course, is going to make her own economic speech tomorrow. And ahead of that, she has landed a major endorsement from more than 400 economists and former policymakers, many of the policymakers from Democratic administrations, including Jason Furman, Alan Blinder, Brian Deese, also some notable academics, University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers and Claudia Goldin, who just won the Nobel Prize for economics. And yet, still, despite these endorsements, we do know that the CNN poll shows that the number one issue for voters right now is the economy and that voters trust Trump, not Harris on the economy. SCIUTTO: Yes, the track record of those big letters, whether they be economists or national security experts actually moving the vote, at least uncertain. Matt Egan, thanks so much. Brianna?",

And I think what's really interesting in this latest poll that we're seeing, this new CNN polling, Frank, is that by and large, the economy, of course, is what matters to people that is further cemented, right? They also care, of course, about immigration. They care about abortion. They care about protecting democracy. But the economy is really the issue. And yet this is it. You see 48, 47, neck and neck.

The fact that that has really made some movement since July for her and then also the fact that more people voting for her or who say they're voting for her or likely voting for her, say now that it is actually a vote for her, not just against Donald Trump.

It's been that significant, that positive. And that is the reason why she's tied or leading in some of these key swing states, which is something I need to emphasize to your viewers.The actual overall numbers don't matter. It only matters in the seven swing states and she's doing reasonably well in those places. But even with the negativity, and even with the debate performance of the former President Donald Trump, he's still holding on, he's still dead even with her. And the thing I'd emphasize is that whoever is the focus of the coverage seems to be doing worse. When the cameras and the lights are on, Harris and before that Biden, their numbers decreased. When the same thing happens to Donald Trump, his numbers decreased. My advice to both candidates, which you'll appreciate, Donald Trump needs to say and speak less. And Kamala Harris needs to say and speak more. It's the exact opposite advice, because the candidate situations are diametrically opposed.",

And now it only highlights the fact that she hasn't really focused on this issue, even though she had some - we can't determine what the actual responsibility was that she had in the administration, because it's been muddied. But this is an area that Donald Trump can say, just look at the numbers, look at the immigration statistics, look at the illegal immigration that took place under his administration, and under the Biden-Harris administration.But once again, he starts to focus on eating dogs and cats. I don't understand this. It's as though he's trying to lose this race. If he actually could stay on message, and could do the statistical comparisons side by side, I think he would be the front runner. But he's been incapable of doing that. He's chosen not to do a debate with her. And her going to the border is only going to remind voters that things have gotten worse over the last three and a half years, so it's an interesting strategy that maybe I would not have recommended.",

And so those are aimed at eliminating all of the missile and rocket force, the actual missiles and launchers that they can find. And clearly, Israel has mapped those out over the years. But the other part of this is, is Israel trying to escalate to de- escalate? We hear this all the time.

All agree.And the reason is because, basically, this part of northern Israel, there's - and villages that are completely destroyed now, but no one will feel safe to go home. So you're basically saying, like, this entire part of Israel is uninhabited - uninhabitable. And this is one of the goals of the axis of resistance, right? And so, you know, I do think that it's very different there. There is a chance that they would go to the negotiating table, but I don't think we should forget, and I'll like to add this context, is that the U.N. Resolution 1701 that ended the 2006 war actually required Hezbollah to move north out - away from the border and create this buffer zone. That was never enforced. And so it allowed Hezbollah to move all these missiles in, and the threat that Israelis feel now in the north is too much for them to handle.",
