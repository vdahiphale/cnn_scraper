Sara, let me start with you. What are we expecting to learn during today's hearing? SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDNET:  Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily learn any new facts at this point. We'll see. Maybe I could be surprised. But I think what they're really trying to do is sort of set the table for the basis of this impeachment inquiry. And they put out a framework last night that gives you an idea of what they want to delve into in this initial hearing and sort of what the parameters are for this impeachment inquiry going forward. And it's essentially four different questions. And the first three of these questions all pertain to the notion of whether now President Joe Biden, whether he provided access, whether he provided the perception of access, whether he took any official action because of foreign interests or foreign money related to Hunter Biden, other members of his family. And then the last question there is whether Joe Biden ever intervened at all in the ongoing criminal investigations into Hunter Biden. And, again, as you guys have pointed out, these are not new questions for Republicans to be asking. James Comer, who is, of course, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has been asking these questions since Republicans got control of the gavels, and he still has not been able to provide any evidence that Joe Biden actually benefited from Hunter Biden's business dealings or from other family members' business dealings. Republicans say this impeachment inquiry will allow them to get more documents, more information to better answer those questions. But you can bet we're going to see Democrats today just hammering Republicans over focusing on this impeachment inquiry rather than on the impending shutdown.",

      "sentences": "Without objection, so ordered.I now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement. Since assuming our Republican majority in January, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee has uncovered a mountain of evidence revealing how Joe Biden abused his public office for his family's financial gain. For years, President Biden has lied to the American people about his knowledge of and participation in his family's corrupt business schemes. At least ten times, Joe Biden lied to the American people that he never spoke to his family about their business dealings. He lied by telling the American people that there was an absolute wall between his official government duties and his personal life. Let's be clear, there wasn't a wall. The door was wide open to those who purchased what a business associate described as the Biden brand. Evidence reveals that then Vice President Joe Biden spoke, dined and developed relationships with his family's foreign business targets. These business targets include foreign oligarchs who sent millions of dollars to his family. It also includes a Chinese national who wired a quarter of a million dollars to his son. Joe Biden also lied to the American people about his family making money in China. He continued to lie about it even when the House Oversight Committee uncovered bank wires, revealing how the Bidens received millions from Chinese companies with significant ties to Chinese intelligence and the Chinese Communist Party. Just this week, we uncovered two additional wires sent to Hunter Biden that originated in Beijing from Chinese nationals. This happened when Joe Biden was running for president of the United States, and Joe Biden's home is listed as the beneficiary address. To-date, the House Oversight Committee has uncovered how the Bidens and their associates created over 20 shell companies, most of which were created when Joe Biden was vice president, and raked in over $20 million between 2014 and 2019. We've also identified nine Biden family members who have participated in or benefited from these shady business schemes. Now, what were the Bidens selling to make all this money? Joe Biden himself. Joe Biden is the brand, and Joe Biden showed up at least two dozen times with business targets and associate sending signals of access, influence, and power to those prepared to pay for it. The American people demand accountability for this culture of corruption. They demand to know how these schemes have compromised President Biden and threaten our national security. They demand safeguards to be put in place to prevent public officials from selling access to their public office for private gain. Under the leadership of Speaker Kevin McCarthy, House Republicans have now opened an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. By opening an impeachment inquiry, our investigation is now focused on whether President Biden engaged in impeachable offenses under the U.S. Constitution. It empowers Congress, elected by the people, to continue providing the answers, transparency, and accountability that the American people demand and deserve. In recent history, Democrats inflicted much damage on the credibility of Congressional investigations by peddling the Russian collusion hoax. But this committee, under this majority, will not pursue such witch hunts based on manufactured allegations, innuendo and no real evidence. Today, the House Oversight Committee will examine over two dozen pieces of evidence revealing Joe Biden's corruption and abuse of public office. This includes emails, text messages, bank records, and testimony of Biden business associates. We will hear from legal and financial experts about this evidence and crimes that may have been committed as Joe Biden was sold around the world. The House Oversight Committee, along with the committees on the Judiciary and Ways and Means, will continue to follow the money and the evidence to provide accountability so that Americans know their public offices are not for sale. I now yield to Jason Smith, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, for his opening statement. REP. JASON SMITH (R-MO):  Thank you, Chairman Comer. Yesterday, the Ways and Means Committee released new documents.",

      "sentences": "Right, John. So, I think the question you pose is the exact question I would pose to Representative Comer. What proof do you have? The very first sentence out of his mouth was about this, quote, mountain of evidence. I'm sitting here thinking, okay, let's see it.We keep hearing about how there are thousands of documents, financial records, bank records, emails, photographs. Okay, good, now we're having this hearing. Let's see it. Let's not rely on sleight of hand. If there is evidence of a connection between Joe Biden and the dealings of his son, Hunter Biden, let's see it. They've been investigating this for months. Now, we're having a hearing. This is the time, this is the place. They say they have all these documents. And the other thing I noticed, John, is there seems to be a little bit of a sleight of hand in the way Representative Comer was just talking about this. He said, and I wrote this down, that money was sent to the family, to the son, to the Bidens, to the Bidens and their associates. And that, I think, tells you where this gap exists. They haven't yet bridged that gap between the millions of dollars that Hunter Biden made from foreign entities and any connection financially or directly to Joe Biden. If they have that connection, good, let's see it.",

      "sentences": "And then one specific reference that Chairman Comer made was to these wires that were revealed overnight. There were a number of documents put out, but there were wires to Hunter Biden, who was, we believe, potentially living at Joe Biden's residence. And it was made during the time when Biden was out of office, Comer distinctly said, running for president.That was between the time when he added official job as vice president and then president of the United States. That would be four years, where I imagine, again, if this were a court of law, the laws would apply differently.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, first of all, the use of that residence, Joe Biden's residence as an address for some of the transactions here, we need some context on that because there is evidence that Hunter Biden would use that address quite frequently. In fact, at times he was living there.And with respect to any transfers, any bank records that may have come through, okay, let's see, is there evidence of a transfer of substantial amount of money from Hunter Biden over to an account that belongs to Joe Biden? And that's one of the big questions we have. There's also the important question that you raised, John, of timing. When was Joe Biden doing any of these actions that we've heard about? Was it during his vice presidency or was it during those years in between the vice presidency and the presidency? There's a bit of a constitutional question about whether a person can be impeached for something they did before they were in office. And I think we're going to hear from some of the constitutional scholars today about their differing views of that question. I think Professor Charlie (ph) is going to say, sure, anything that a president has done is in play. And I think we have Professor Gerhardt, I saw there, I suspect he'll take the opposite view that a person can only be impeached for something they did while in office.",

And then I think what we've just heard from Jamie Raskin is sort of getting into the notion that a lot of these allegations Republicans are making against Hunter Biden and Joe Biden are things that have come up before. They were things that Rudy Giuliani was peddling years ago during the Ukraine first to Donald Trump impeachment.
