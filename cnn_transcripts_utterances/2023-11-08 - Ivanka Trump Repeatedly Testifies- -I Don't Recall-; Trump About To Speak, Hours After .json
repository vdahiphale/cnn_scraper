The former Trump Org executive vice president under oath repeatedly saying she didn't remember key details about the family business she ran. With me tonight, a top Trump business reporter who was there in the courtroom, former Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb, and Omarosa Manigault Newman.Plus, Israel tonight says it's destroyed 130 Hamas tunnel shafts. We have a special report of what's inside those tunnels. The spider web crisscrossing underneath Gaza, and what that underground warfare looks like right now as the death toll mounts in Gaza. And Trump's opening up about a potential VP pick. Could it be that guy? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, I don't recall -- those three words were Ivanka Trump's most used on the witness stand today in the New York fraud trial against her father and brothers, a trial that could put an end to the Trump family business. Ivanka Trump who was not a defendant because of the statute of limitations said that she struggled to remember basic important details about the finances of the business she ran. For example, when asked if she discussed Trump's finances during a meeting with government officials about acquiring the Trump D.C. hotel, she said, quote, I don't recall. It's worth mentioning in this context that she, of course, was the person in Trump of the Trump D.C. hotel deal. In fact, Ivanka Trump played a crucial role in developing some of Trump's most marquee properties, including not just that D.C. Post Office that became a Trump hotel, but Trump's Doral Golf Resort, and his towers in Chicago and Toronto. And her job title was executive vice president for development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization. So, of course, it does seem to defy basic reality to not recall. But that is exactly what she said when she was asked what might be the most basic question. Did she ever help review or value assets? Her answer, she does not recall. Again, she was in charge of development and acquisition. So reviewing and valuing assets, to put it very basically, is core to the entire job. In fact, Ivanka Trump served as a primary contact for Deutsche Bank, the Trump Organization's largest lender, the organization at the heart of this. Attorney General Letitia James took note of Ivanka Trump's responses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But according to an email presented in court, Ivanka proposed changing the requirement to two billion dollars as part of the lone negotiations, even though Trump's 2011 financial statement estimated his net worth $4.2 billion. They finally agreed to $2.5 billion, but the exchange is significant, because the attorney general is accusing Trump of falsifying his net worth in order to get better loan rates.

Ivanka Trump has boasted on the record about how involved she was in the business. She wrote in one of her books, quote, I was Donald Trump's eyes and ears on the board as I was at the Trump Organization and on his reality television show. OUTFRONT now, Omarosa Manigault Newman. She was a contestant on that reality show, \"The Apprentice\", and, of course, went on to work on Trump's 2016 campaign and to serve in the Trump White House. She's now the author of the book \"Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House\". So, Omarosa, the last time we spoke, you said you are most interested in hearing Ivanka's testimony during this fraud trial. So what was your reaction to what you heard today? OMAROSA MANIGAULT NEWMAN, FORMER \"APPRENTICE\" CONTESTANT: Well, the first thing that I noticed, Erin, was how she walked in. It reminded me so much of her mother, Ivana, when she was going through her legal woes with Donald Trump during her divorce. She would always arrive at court dressed in all-black, and she would strut in like a supermodel during fashion week. And that's what we saw from Ivanka. That's the first thing that I noticed. But from the read out, I was really shocked to hear that she didn't take any accountability, and that she claimed to not know. This is one of the most shrewd businesswomen I have ever sat in a boardroom with, and I've had to do that now for three seasons with her, but also to go on to work with her in the White House. She knows every detail of every single engagement that she's a part of. It doesn't matter what the transaction is. She knows the names of the players. She knows the numbers, the figures, the assets.
