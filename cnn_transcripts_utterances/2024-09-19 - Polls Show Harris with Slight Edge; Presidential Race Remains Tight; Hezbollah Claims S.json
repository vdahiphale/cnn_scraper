Harris seeing a slight bump there as she soon heads to battleground Michigan to campaign what the campaign is billing as a huge virtual rally with Oprah Winfrey.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez back with us. There's a lot going on this morning. We've got this new CNN polls after you and I were talking this morning about just how you add them all up and what it means to these campaigns.

But they're paying attention because over the last several days, the vice president has spent almost the majority of her time in Pennsylvania. And that was one of the bright spots in the New York Sienna College poll this morning, which is, as you see there, that she has a slight edge over former President Donald Trump.But a CNN poll of polls also finds that, generally speaking, it is tight. It is a deadlocked race. And that is exactly how the Harris campaign is operating. You hear it from the vice president herself when she says that they are the underdogs and they're generally running this campaign as though they're losing. Now, when you look a little deeper into the data here in these polls, the economy is still a top issue for voters. That is something that the vice president has been fine-tuning her messaging on. But also on immigration. Former President Donald Trump continues to hold the lead over the vice president. And yesterday, during her remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, the vice president targeted former President Donald Trump's immigration proposals in an explicit way, one that we haven't generally seen on the campaign trail. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They have pledged to carry out the largest deportation, a mass deportation, in American history. Imagine what that would look like and what that would be. How's that going to happen? Massive raids? Massive detention camps? What are they talking about? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Whether or not she continues that message, you heard there on the campaign trail, remains to be seen.But today the vice president also going to go to Michigan, where she is going to participate in a livestream with Oprah. That is an effort to essentially try to shore up support with black women who are very influential in their communities, which is a key part of the Democratic coalition, and overwhelmingly supported President Joe Biden in 2020. So, it is these types of events that the Harris campaign is trying to use, unconventional methods, like this, Zoom live stream, to try to mobilize voters, especially the parts of the coalition that they think is really helping get out the vote and help with voter registration.

So, you're seeing consistency among \"The New York Times\"/Sienna College poll. Why is that so important to me? Because given the sort of controversy around polling over the last few years, I want to look at the pollsters who have been most accurate. And if you look at \"The New York Times\"/Sienna College poll back in the 2022 Senate race, what you saw was, the result was John Fetterman, the Democrat, by five points. And the final \"New York Times\"/Sienna College poll had John Fetterman ahead by five points. So, a very accurate pollster back in 2022 showing a consistent - small, but consistent advantage for Kamala Harris in the state that might prove to be the most pivotal.",

So, an overperformance. She's outperforming Biden's margin by three points.And let's take a look at some other pollsters who not just got 2022 right, but who got 2020 right, which a lot of pollsters did not. So, let's go to Iowa, right? Ann Selzer, one of the best pollsters in the business. You go back to her final poll in 2020. She had Donald Trump ahead by seven points. He ended up winning in Iowa by eight. Look at where she has the race right now. A poll that was released just on Sunday. Donald Trump ahead, but just by four. So, Kamala Harris is doing three points better than Joe Biden did in the final poll back in 2020. How about in New Hampshire, the UNH poll. Again, this poll was within a point, the final one, in 2020. It had Joe Biden winning by eight. In the granite state he won by seven. Look at where Kamala Harris is ahead by. She's ahead by 11 points. So, a three-point over performance. Again, the same as we saw in Iowa. The same that we see in New Hampshire. Very consistent with a three point over performance that we see, or the four-point over - the three-point over performance that we see in, of course, Pennsylvania in terms of \"The New York Times\"/Sienna College poll versus the 2020 results. Always looking for trends. I think that's what you're doing and that's why this is all important, and why we appreciate the lessons you give us. Talk to us about the difference between some of these northern swing states and the southern ones.",

And so if we, right now, look, Harris versus Trump in the battlegrounds margin, you look in the northern battlegrounds, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, what we see is Harris up by three. If you look in the sunbelt battleground states, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina, we see a tied race. So, Harris doing better in those northern battleground states than she's doing in those southern battleground states.And again, John, so pivotal, the electoral map, the race to 270. Even if Harris loses say in North Carolina and Georgia and then in Nevada and Arizona, if she carries these Great Lake battleground states up here, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, that gets her to exactly 270 electoral votes. So, the bottom line is, there's good polling for Kamala Harris in these northern battleground states. Maybe just enough to get her over the top in the Electoral College.",

More than three dozen people across Lebanon were killed, thousands more injured.

And then, very quickly, as Hezbollah was increasing orders, but they were discovered. That somehow Israel believed that the cat was out of the bag and all of this effort to put thousands of pagers with explosive devices inside them were going to be uncovered, so they had to hit the button.
