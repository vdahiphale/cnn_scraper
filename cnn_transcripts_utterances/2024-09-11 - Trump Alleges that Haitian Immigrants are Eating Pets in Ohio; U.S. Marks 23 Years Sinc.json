But it's also incomprehensible to -- I'm going to guess about 80 percent of the people who were watching that debate last night. I mean, it is an extremely online right-wing meme which by the way has been debunked.And Donald Trump used this opportunity on the debate stage in front of millions of people to, instead of making a cohesive case about his own immigration plans, to talk about this thing that means nothing to 80 percent of the people watching. So, it was bizarre. It was kind of quintessentially Donald Trump. It was pinched with hatred, made no sense to anybody except the most online, you know, right-wing MAGA followers, and   is not the way to make a case to the moderate and swing voters who are going to decide the outcome of this election.",

And here's how she answered it when asked.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I love our small businesses. My plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start-up small businesses, knowing they are part of the backbone of America's economy. My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations which will result in $5 trillion to America's deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20 percent tax on every day goods that you rely on to get through the month. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I thought she answered that question really effectively by both going straight to small business, which she believes is one of the beating hearts of the economy.Talking in concrete ways about what she would do for small business, and then contrasting with Trump who has said again he's going to continue big giveaways to the wealthiest in this country. I mean, I thought she did a nice job kind of lining up that contrast. At the end of the day, you know, a successful debate is about using the time in front of the camera to connect with the audience in the way you want -- in the way you want to, answering the question the way you want to.

She felt rehearsed, she felt memorized, she felt nervous, it just didn't seem to the audience, I don't think as to be capturing really the problems that Americans are facing and presenting a real plan.So, I thought one of Trump's stronger moments of the night was when he said, her plan is, you know, can be summarized as run-spot-run. There isn't much there. I'm going to give people free things, that, you know, this doesn't really address the problem of giving people free things is the cause of the inflation that has hit historic levels. And that, although the inflation is coming down, it is still rising at 1 percent higher than the Fed's target rate. That means prices are still going up. So, Trump missed an opportunity there, and then, of course, the moderators did follow-up multiple times with Trump, will you answer the question? Tell me about your tweet. Tell me about it. And they did not follow up here. So, I think there were missed opportunities both from the moderators and from President Trump. But it was not her strongest answer by far.",

Who's got responsibility for the fact that reproductive freedoms have been taken away from women across the country. You had him reiterating that. You also had her kind of pushing him on national abortion ban and whether he would veto it, he did -- around it, he wouldn't give an answer. And then you had her giving a really heartfelt answer about what women in this country are going through. And so, it really illustrated the stakes of the issue. And we know this is an issue that is motivating voters all across the country. So, I thought this exchange was one of the most powerful for Kamala Harris in this debate.",
