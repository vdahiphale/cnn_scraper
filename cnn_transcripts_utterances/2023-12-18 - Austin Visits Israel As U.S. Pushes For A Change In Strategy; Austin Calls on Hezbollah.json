Our support to Israel's right to defenditself is ironclad, as you've heard me say a number of times, and that's not going to change. It's critical, as I said earlier, that Hamas not be able to threaten Israel from Gaza, or even threaten Gaza anymore. You know, that's an interest that we all share, and it's a common interest with all of us. And so, today, we had great discussions about the status of the campaign, about goals and objectives, and about how to reduce harm to civilians in the battlespace, and the need to ensure a sustained flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. We can offer some insight based upon our own experience in fighting terrorist groups, and certainly, that enabled us to have great discussions. And we also have some great thoughts about how to transition from high intensity operations to lower intensity and more surgical operations. So, we had great discussions on all of those issues. On Lebanon, we've been clear that we don't want to see this conflict widen into a larger war or a regional war. And we call upon Hezbollah to make sure that they don't do things that would provoke a wider conflict.",

And I cannot show only one issue that eventually we will wish our gods (ph), first of all, to destroy Hamas, second, to rescue their hostages, both of them very important, equally. This is a war of national determination and national resilience, and we will prevail, because we are fighting for the right values and for our survival in this region. As to the second question, we understand how important is the cooperation, the international support to establish something different in Gaza. This is the reason we conduct this talks today, together with the Secretary Austin and General Brown and Mr. Satterfield and others regarding the issues that we have to conduct in Gaza. We know that Hamas will not control Gaza. We know that we will have the freedom to eliminate any kind of threat in the future. And there will be no serious military threats against Israel from Gaza. Second, Israel will not control Gaza in any civilian way. We will conduct any needed operation and military effort in order to secure our future, and we are building the routes for non-hostile partners in the other side.",

There has been alot of discussion about getting Israel's intent to reduce civilian casualties to match up with the results. General Petraeus famously said that sometimes the U.S. needs to take hits on force protection to win over hearts and minds. Legitimacy. You're probably familiar that just recently about 10 Israeli soldiers died in one ambush. And a lot of people in Israel were saying if the Israeli Defense Forces had just bombed the area, they wouldn't have died. Is this the kind of thing a war doesn't have perfect solutions that sometimes the United States may think that Israel may need to take more hits to force protection instead of being as aggressive with its air force and artillery? Minister Gallant, good to see you. The United States in its most respectful way possible is trying to push Israel on certain timelines and certain things about the day after. Is it may be time that yourself and the government need to tell Israel that even though we've had tremendous successes in the field, we may not actually control all of Gaza at the end of January, we may not get all of the hostages back at the end of January, some of these things may continue in the three to nine months afterwards, the -- what they call Shlav Gimmel, the third stage?",

And we will continue to operate in different levels of intensity according to the situation in the region. And I can tell you that soon we will be able to distinguish between different areas in Gaza. In every area where we achieve our mission, we will be able to transition gradually to the next phase and start working on bringing back local population. That means that it can be achieved maybe sooner in the north rather than in the south. So, we are dealing with all the different components, and we will decide in the next future, reality future.",

And it has certain parameters, including the amount of battalions that we need to dismantle and the chain of command and supreme military leadership and so forth and so on, the phases, the technique, which is part of the plan that we have to deploy in the area in order to achieve our goals. And as Secretary Austin said, this is only the way that we shape our plan in order to achieve the goals. And as it happened in the battlefield, the circumstances are changing. You change your efforts, and you do something different in a different phase, and the intensity in the first phase is given, but in other phases, we will concentrate on certain issue, for instance, the engaging and detecting the supreme leadership of Hamas and others. So, all in all, there is no -- there is not -- nowhere a clock that is running. And we have to obey a certain day. But, we need to get to different performances on the ground before we move to the next phase. And I believe that we will find a proper time to do so. And the most important issue, as I mentioned in the beginning, we will prevail. We will dismantle Hamas. Otherwise, we will not be able to exist and live in the way we want to live in this region, because there is a price to deterrence.

A polling by CBS and YouGovshows Florida Governor Ron DeSantis getting a slight bump in Iowa, but still trailing Trump by 36 points. In New Hampshire, things are tightening up. Trump still leads by double digits, but former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who is the daughter of immigrants, is definitely closing that gap. Let's dive into all of this with today's great panel. Ruy Teixeira is Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and Co-Founder of the Substack newsletter \"The Liberal Patriot\". He is also a contributing columnist at The Washington Post. Bakari Sellers is of course a CNN Political Commentator and a former Democratic member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. And Scott Jennings is a CNN Senior Political Commentator, Conservative Columnist, and Special Assistant to President George W. Bush. Alright guys. Great to have you. I love this crew. A lot to get to. Ruy, I want to start with you particularly on that comment about poisoned the blood related to immigrants. Your latest book is about how a lot of working class voters, including Hispanic working class voters, have been moving away from the Democratic Party, and with Trump making some real inroads. How does that language land with that constituency, do you think? RUY TEIXEIRA, SENIOR FELLOW AT THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, &amp; CO- FOUNDER AND POLITICS EDITOR, THE LIBERAL PATRIOT: Well, I mean, let's remember that he has used language like that before, throughout his presidency and after, and it doesn't seem to have tanked his performance among a lot of non-white working class voters, particularly Hispanics. In fact, if you look at recent data, he is actually doing quite well among Hispanics, relatively speaking. Biden only has single digit leads in a lot of polls. There was just a CNN poll that came out the other day that showed Trump being preferred to Biden on the issue of immigration among Hispanics. So, it's not clear to me that as dark as his rhetoric may be, that it's qualitatively different in such a way it's going to turn off these voters who have been moving towards him. So, I think it's hard for people for whom this kind of rhetoric kind of blows their minds, to like kind of wrap their mind around the fact everybody doesn't react with the same way. And a lot of Hispanic working class voters, for example, might just feel the border is out of control. And they figured Trump. He is a crazy man. He kind of amps up his rhetoric. But, I get what he is saying.",

That is where this rhetoric is going to have the greatest effect. It won't be -- if you're Hispanic in this country, if you're African American in this country, you've heard this rhetoric for so long from so many different corners of the universe that you become somewhat desensitized to it.

Obviously, that's not happening in Iowa, where he is dominating. So, if you look at the way this is going to unfold, Trump probably wins Iowa by a record margin. He has momentum going into New Hampshire. And if Chris Christie is still on the ballot over there, who is effectively competing for similar kinds of voters of Haley, does she have a lid on what she can achieve?

But, as you were -- we were noting from that previous clip, there is a lot of people on the left of his party who are going to be absolutely apoplectic if he does this. So, he just has to make a choice. And the people, the Democrats in the Senate and the House have to make a choice. Are they going to have sort of try to remedy this problem and give people the impression they're actually going to try to do something about border security, or they're going to cave on this and not strike a deal?

Talk about what specific issues have eroded the working class, including non-white working class voters, and then more importantly, what Democrats can do about it.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, in our book, John, we have a couple of different parts. One is called the Great Divide, and the other is called CulturalRadicalism. So, the initial sort of cracks in the Democrats coalition appear in the late part of the 20th century. As Democrats embrace this sort of soft neoliberalism, on economic issues, on trade and on regulation, and so on, we see the white working class start to move away from the Democrats. Over that time, we see the decline of the union movement, which anchored the working class more firmly to the Democratic Party and gave it shape. Then in the 21st century, we see, in addition to that, this sort of move toward what we call cultural radicalism on the part of the Democrats and race, immigration, gender, even climate wise, I think, to some extent, has become a cultural issue. And Democrats become in a way a lot more responsive to the views, preferences and priorities of their college educated liberalist base than to the working class, and that is reflected in the movement of these working class voters away from the Democrats, most vividly in the 2016 election when the Democrats cratered among white working class voters in the Midwest, delivered the election to Donald Trump. And then bizarrely, and counterintuitively, in 2020, even though Biden does win, he actually loses a lot of votes among non-white, particularly Hispanic working class voters. And we see that continuing to the current time. So, in a way, it's a long story about the movement of the working class away for the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party's domination by more college educated elitist elements. So, I just have different priorities in the working class. It doesn't mean Democrats can't win elections. Of course, they do. But, they're no longer really a working class party in the way they used to. And it does put a ceiling on their support. And one way I think about this is, how did we get stuck with these two guys, Biden and Trump again? And I think part of the answer lies in what's happened to the working class vote over time and how it's torn between these two different parties, and neither party seems to be capable of dominating politics today.",

And you're from the south. You're upstate South Carolina, originally from a fairly small town now, well established in Columbia. But, I just -- I wonder how you see that analysis of the Democratic Party, and what you see the solutions has been?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's interesting to hear Ruy describe his book. The analog book for the Republicans would be the flight of upper middle class,college-educated white-collar workers in the suburbs to the Democratic Party. So, you see these massive flows of people. I think it is how Joe Biden capturing some of those folks, and some senior voters was able to win the election in 2020 despite the outflow of working class voters. I kind of lived through this in my own life. My grandparents were New Deal Democrats from Western Kentucky. My father was a factory worker and a garbage man and could not have little Bill Clinton more than he did. But, by the time 2016 rolled around, he was the biggest Trump guy. He knew Trump before anybody else in my life knew about it. And so, I've watched in my own family people migrate, the working class, rural voters migrate, and have been sort of fascinated by it. So, I'm looking forward to reading Ruy's book because I've lived it, and I certainly work in it today. And I think what he has to say is vital to understanding not just how the parties are going to perform in elections, but what will the parties platforms be. The Republican Party platform has shifted to accommodate these new voters. My question has been, when is the Democratic Party going to shift its platform to accommodate some of its new constituents as well?",
