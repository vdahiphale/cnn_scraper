The Dow is closed for the day now,the markets and the main events of the day to bring to your close attention. Russia says it is stepping away from the humanitarian deal that allowed grain from Ukraine to reach global markets. Elon Musk tweet a fringe conspiracy about Paul Pelosi and confirmed fears about his ownership of Twitter. And Lula da Silva elected to tackle inequality after winning Brazil's presidential election. Live from New York, Monday, October the 31st. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Now, good evening. If you are wondering why the market has closed when it normally doesn't, because of course, Europe and where you are changed the clocks, but the US doesn't change the clocks for another week or so and we want to make sure we are with you, at the same time every night. So that's why it's actually four o'clock in New York here and the market has now closed. But to our agenda tonight, which of course is the crucial aspects. Ukraine says it is restoring power to major cities after a wave of missile strikes. The lights are back on in some places in Kyiv after Russia and missiles knocked out power and water across the capital. The Mayor of Kyiv says one attack struck a power facility serving 350,000 homes, 40 percent of the city's homes and businesses were without water. Other cities hit, too, including Kharkiv, where subway services were disrupted. Clarissa Ward is in Zaporizhzhia and joins me now. Clarissa, I mean, it's a bit of sort of -- Russia attacks; Ukraine then does whatever it can to sort of get things back on again, whether it be subways, electricity, water. How much longer can this go on, where you know, Russia just has to keep destroying more infrastructure and Ukraine can't keep up?",

This is now the third or fourth Monday in a row that Russia has started off the week with a salvo of rockets and missiles targeting critical infrastructure. Now, Ukraine has been getting quite a bit of support in the form of air defense systems. And to that end, according to the Ukrainian Air Force, they were able to intercept 90 percent of those missiles. Forty of the more than 50 that were fired at Ukraine were intercepted. But still, the ones that did get through were able to strike 18 different installations in 10 different regions and caused a hell of a lot of damage, and the reality is that while the Ukrainians are very fast, Richard, at trying to build back capacity again, they are finding it more and more tough to contend with the amount of damage that has been done. We're here in Zaporizhzhia, as you mentioned. Some 200,000 households were without power today. The local hospital, the children's hospital were all operating on emergency power. And you can probably see behind me, the entire city is blacked out. People are being told to conserve whatever energy they possibly can. In Kyiv, they were being told to go and collect water to store it because there is a sense that this isn't going away, this problem, and it is only going to get worse especially as temperatures get lower -- Richard.",

We've also heard Ukrainian authorities asking Ukrainians who are living outside Ukraine at the moment who moved during the beginning of the war, don't come home this winter, because this country cannot take the strain that that would put on the grid. And the President himself, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned Ukrainian people, this is going to be an unbelievably tough winter ahead. As I said before, this is not a problem that is going away.

The social mediagiant's new owner amplified a baseless conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi. He deleted the tweet. Not however before it had been retweeted 28,000 times. The billionaire is also reportedly considering charging users $19.99 a month for verified accounts. Donie is with me. Donie O'Sullivan in New York. I've looked at all the weekend stuff over Twitter. I think this thing with tweeting the disinformation or at least, you know, it was classic. It's almost Trumpian. I'm not saying this happened. But there are people who are saying this might have happened. And maybe we should take a look at it. That's what he did, isn't he? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Precisely. And look, I think this is the real challenge and frustration, right? Because there are people who work at Twitter whose job it is, especially right now here in the U.S. with the midterm elections and with the Brazilian elections over the weekend. There are people, there are teams at Twitter that work in trying to counter misinformation and disinformation. And then you have the new owner tweeting out a link to a story about Paul Pelosi to -- by the way, just a junk news Web site. That same Web site back in 2016 actually claimed that Hillary Clinton was dead and that the person we're seeing on the campaign trail was a body double. So, you know, if Twitter has a misinformation problem, it is at the very top right now. What we did also hear today, Richard, was, you know, given the concerns of all of this with Musk taking over that reportedly he did tell the European Commission that Twitter, his volume of -- his version of Twitter would comply with all E.U. laws.",

So here we go, it's going to be $20.00 a month, we hear at least from people inside the company. If you are a person with a blue tick and you want to keep that blue tick, that verified tick, it's going to cost you 20 bucks a month. On the flip side, if you do not have one, and you want to be verified on Twitter, you will now reportedly be able to get one if you're willing to pay $20.00 a month. Why does this really matter? I mean, in one way it doesn't. But there is a function to this blue badge, right? Especially if you're an NGO or a charity or an emergency service and you're tweeting out critical information, I would certainly personally hope to see that those kinds of organizations aren't charged for it whatever about most journalists.",

The reality is, this is clever pricing because DonieO'Sullivan and perhaps for less let's say Richard Quest would hopefully hope that our lord's or masters at CNN will pay the $20.00 a month or big corporations will do a deal for 1000 bucks a month and everybody in the corporation gets it. So this is clever pricing. O'SULLIVAN: It's great. I mean, it's a great idea. I haven't talked to our boss yet, but I was crunching the numbers a bit today. I'm pretty sure, you know, there are hundreds of CNN employees, for instance, that have verified badges. And again, it's important in cases because if you, you know, sometimes as reporters, researchers and producers here will use Twitter to read sources, particularly in breaking news scenario. So that blue tick is quite valuable and saying yes, we are a CNN. Now, our boss is going to be happy with hundreds of employees paying thousands of dollars, tens of thousands of dollars in the cumulative just to Twitter every year. I'm not so sure.",

I'm just going to -- all I'm going to say is that they've priced this -- I think it's priced high but theypriced it cleverly in the sense of they know a lot of -- a lot of organizations, corporations. It's a cost of doing business for many stars, celebs or whatever. Anyway, we'll talk about it. Donie, thank you. Now I have in front of me an enormous amount of candy. Well, trick or treating, look at it. We bought the cheap stuff. We really did. My goodness. This will have your fillings out in half a minute. The chewy, the chew stuff, banana chews. And you don't want to try that too much. But for years, the markets, investors we've all been on sugar high with low interest rates, cheap money, inflation is now soaring and this Halloween. So how much candy are the central banks going to let us have? Are they going to wean us off the sweets completely? In five moves since March the Fed has hiked rates 300 basis points. It's one of the most -- if not the most aggressive tightening campaigns in history. And of course this week, we're going to get more. So the sugar high. Rahel Solomon who's probably not about to snuff away through all this amount of sugar. Rahel is with me. This sugar highs lasted a long time. But you've got the numbers that show us how dramatic this rate rising has been.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Richard. In fact, this is not something that we have seen in modern history. I want to showyou even just the most recent rate hike cycle that we've seen. This was 2015, 2016 that you can see. How the Fed move gradually. You see that step by step there, Richard, that's 25 basis points or over a quarter of a basis points. And in the period of three years or 36 months, the Fed only raised the fed funds target range, 225 basis points. We have surpassed that. We are now at 300 basis points and just about seven months and we expect to move up another 75 basis points this week. About 400 basis points and just about eight months. So this is something that is really unheard of in modern history. The problem, however, is that it doesn't appear that the medicine is working. It doesn't appear -- the data doesn't show that inflation is starting to abate and that is the problem. And so it really leaves the Fed in quite a dilemma. Do you keep delivering these massive doses or do you just start to wait to see when the medicine will start to work?",

I think it is a humannature thing that we want the pain to be over sooner rather than later. We want almost to the clarity of knowing that the worst is behind us. So not just a millennial thing, a human nature thing, I think. But yes, you are right, there is, of course, a monetary policy lag of about six to nine months. So we are still just in the early days of this, but we're still not seeing it. And I would also argue, Richard, that it's not just the monetary policy lag, consider the impacts to excess savings from the pandemic. I mean, the Fed just put out a report earlier this month that said, throughout the pandemic, we accumulated $2.3 trillion in savings and try to wrap your head around this, Richard, we've only worked through a quarter of that.

On the other hand, it's powering consumer spending, which we know part of the inflation certainly in the U.S., part of this inflation story is spending. It's the excess demand.
