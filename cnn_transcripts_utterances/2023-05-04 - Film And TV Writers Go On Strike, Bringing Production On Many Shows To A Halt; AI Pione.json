A lot of these people live here in Los Angeles or in New York, where those are two of the most expensive cities in their country. And they`re saying they need to make a living wage and at issue, they`re also saying that they should make more money for the shows that they do for the streamers. They`re saying that the business model hasn`t adapted and they`re not getting their fair share. Also, they`re saying they want to make sure that the writer rooms are protected. And the number of writers who are on the show have viable work. They`re saying that the studios are really pushing for a gig economy. And they`re saying they can`t support their families that way. In fact, take a listen to one of the writers talk about their frustrations.",

      "sentences": "Now on the other side, the studios are saying is that the business has changed. You`re saying they`re feeling pressure from Wall Street, tobring down how much they`ve been spending on all the shows that they`re streaming, and all the shows that they`re making. And they`re saying they don`t want to pay to just have writers in the room if they`re not working specifically on any show at that time. Of course, this is a very far gap between where they are right now. The last time we saw a strike it was 15 years ago, and it lasted for 100 days. And as we had estimates of costing some $2 billion or so.  Right now, where they are, they`re not even sure if they`re even close to getting to a deal. I`m told by the chief negotiator for the WGA. But as far as the people who watch the shows, the people who consume these shows, it`s impacting already, because we`ve seen the late-night talk shows already go to black.  They are saying they will be black as long as this strike is happening. So that means Seth Meyers, I mean Stephen Colbert, that means the Daily Show and Saturday Night Live, all dark for now. As far as TV shows and movies, a lot of those are already pre-produced and already in the can. But if this drags on for a long time, then some of the favorite shows that people like to watch could be impacted, you might see seasons delayed. All of that is down the line. But for now, this is what the Writers Guild of America says they need to do to get their fair share of pay. Stephanie Elam, CNN Hollywood. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

AI had a number of early contributors to the concept, but McCarthy is credited with coming up with the name. The advancement of AI technology has been so swift that many of us can look at something today and question, is that real or not? Especially when it comes to photos, videos, text and music, to name a few. Well, Geoffrey Hinton, also known as the Godfather of AI, decided he had to blow the whistle on this technology he helped develop. He made headlines for leaving his role at Google last week because he wanted to speak more openly about his growing concerns around AI. Hinton said, AI has the potential to eliminate jobs and create a world where many will, \"not be able to know what is true anymore.\" Our Anna Stewart has more on Hinton`s warnings.

      "sentences": "The chorus of critics, warning about the risks of AI are growing louder. And this particular voice comes from GeoffreyHinton, a pioneer of the technology. His work on Neural Networks provided a key foundation for many of the AI applications that you see today. Now, he has quit his job, and he`s tweeted that he left so that he could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how that impacts Google. Adding that Google has acted very responsibly. And for its part, Google says it remains committed to a responsible approach. Hinton says he`s concerned that people won`t be able to distinguish what`s real, and what AI generated or manipulated by the internet. And that includes music, videos, texts, photos, and we are seeing examples of this a lot. Hinton also expressed concern about the impact AI will have on people`s jobs. And that comment came as the CEO of IBM in an interview with Bloomberg said, AI may replace up to 30% around 7800 of their back-office jobs. Finally, Hinton says AI could become smarter than people and pose a threat to humanity. And he now thinks that will happen much sooner than he had once thought. Now, all this, he says, has been exacerbated by huge competition by the big tech companies. There`s open AI, there`s Microsoft, Google, IBM, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, all racing to position themselves in the AI space. But Hinton thinks perhaps there should be a pause. He says scientists should really work together at this stage to control the technology, saying, I don`t think they should scale this up more, until they have understood whether they can control it.

He has more wins than any other driver ever and a record tying Seven World Championships. He started driving karts as a kid and some people would make fun of him because he couldn`t afford a fancy kart like other racers, but Lewis` dad said, son, let your racing do the talking. And today Lewis has built himself into a legend with hard work, dedication and belief in himself. You know, youngsters today, they see social media and they think success is easy. And it`s overnight.

I`m still having to chip away. I`m still having to work like never before to be able to excel in a sport that`s constantly evolving. The competition is constantly rising; it`s getting more and more -- it`s getting tougher and tougher by the year.
