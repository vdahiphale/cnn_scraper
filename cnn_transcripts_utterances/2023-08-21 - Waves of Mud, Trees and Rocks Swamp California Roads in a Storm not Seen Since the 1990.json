The consoler-in-chief tries to bring comfort to a community all but wiped out in a wildfire.And a consequential week for Donald Trump. The former president set to surrender to charges in Georgia and skip the first GOP debate in Wisconsin. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Danny Freeman. We begin this morning with something southern California hasn't experienced in decades, but people there are facing it right now. Torrential record rain and strong winds from Tropical Storm Hilary. Overnight, Hilary has been bringing down power lines and trees, flooding streets and triggering mudslides. In fact, one mudslide forced firefighters to take fast action in San Bernardino County when it came barreling towards their fire house. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The mayor of San Diego telling CNN that the city isn't built for it, and as he urged people to stay at home. CNN's Kyung Lah reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  San Diego's mayor says the city is simply not built to handle a Tropical Storm Hilary. So, what this city has been doing is trying to prepare the best that it can. What you're seeing throughout this area of Mission Valley is main thoroughfares like this one completely shut down. The reason for these barriers is because the street behind me, this is an area if you're familiar with San Diego, Mission Valley, that is a known flood zone. There is a San Diego river over there, and then all of the hills you see, some of the desert area, all of that, that funnels down here into the water, and the infrastructure needs to hold. What the mayor has said is that there's approximately 3 to 4 inches that have already come down, and expected over the next 24 hours, three to four times that much. That's why the San Diego unified public school district has delayed the start of school by a full 24 hours. It was scheduled to start on Monday. That will push by one day. The Navy, in fact, has moved ten of its ships out of the bay further into the sea to try to protect those ten vessels just in case the storm were to create any sort of damage. But what the city has seen so far is that, it has been able to withstand Tropical Storm Hilary. The rain still coming down. It will be very much what happens in the overnight hours. Kyung Lah, CNN, San Diego. (END VIDEOTAPE)   FREEMAN:  Kyung, thank you. And Hilary made landfall Sunday as a tropical storm in Mexico's Baja Peninsula. At least, one person was killed when their vehicle was swept away in the flood waters. CNN's David Shortell reports from Mexico City. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SHORTELL, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE PRODUCER (on camera):  Devastating images coming out of Mexico in the northwest state of Baja, California, which has been pummeled for several hours by rain as Tropical Storm Hilary made its way up along the coastline, eventually making landfall Sunday morning on the 11 O'clock local time. The small community of San Quintin residents there feeling the full force of this storm, that 65-mile-an-hour winds, extreme storm surge, and then, of course, damage to the roadways. Authorities telling folks, do not leave your house. Stay home. There was an incident in Santa Rosalia earlier this weekend, where a man was caught in his car and swept away and killed. These were roads that had naturally become rivers as 4 inches of rain pounded the area in just a few hours time, that's of course, on top of immense amounts of rain coming down from the mountains in the central part of the state, just creating these terrible conditions. Across the entire state though, there has been damage as Hilary made its way northward towards California. Ensenada, Mexico's wine region was right in the center of the storm, and then, of course, Tijuana, an important border city that's been a hub for migrants as they make their way towards the U.S. Tijuana is a city with very poor infrastructure in some parts. It's a hilly city. And some of these homes are built into  the sides of the hill and mud signs -- mudslides, I should say are common there. So authorities on high alert looking for anyone in need of rescue as the storm moved through Tijuana into California with just this immense amounts of rain. Of course, this area, it's unusual for storms to hit like this, but it's not quite as rare as it is in California. That's because as storms form in the Pacific, they'll make their way up, and then usually turn eastward when they hit Baja, California, where the waters are much cooler than the waters are to the south. This storm, of course, ignoring history, moving straight up through Baja, California, and into California where it's just wreaked havoc. David Shortell, Mexico City. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It will take several weeks still. Some of the challenges are going to be extraordinary because of the temperature of the fire, the remains of those who have died in some cases may be impossible to recover meaningfully.

Do you think we're going to see 19 people show up together in court this week?AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR:  I doubt that, Danny. One thing to note though, that is very different in Fulton County than what's happening in the New York federal case is that, this is state court and cameras are allowed typically in state court proceedings. So, it's very possible that we will get an opportunity to see what happens inside that courtroom. But I don't expect all 19 of these defendants to show up on one day, and for all of them to either be in court or to be going through the booking process. We already know that Donald Trump's team is in contact with the district attorney's office. So, it's likely that he is going to negotiate something that will allow him to turn himself in, separate and apart from the other 18 defendants. We know he does not want to be lumped in with those other defendants, and I suspect, other defendants are negotiating something with the district attorney as it relates to them turning themselves in as well. So, although, this is going to be an unprecedented occurrence, and some will say even a spectacle, I don't expect all 19 to be  there together.",

I think the grounds that he has stated in his motion, one he identifies the supremacy clause saying that it immunizes him from liability because he was acting in his official capacity, carrying out the duties as the secretary -- or as the chief of staff for the president. And then, he also cites the First and Fourteenth Amendment, saying that these are the actions that he was engaged in are protected political actions.I think both of those arguments are going to fall on deaf ears as it relates to the court because the indictment makes it very clear that the activity he was engaged in, participating in phone calls, contacting state officials in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, making attempts to reach those officials on behalf of Donald Trump. These weren't innocuous acts by your normal chief of staff. These were acts in the furtherance of this criminal enterprise which is laid out in great detail in this 98-page indictment. So at this early stage of the proceedings, it is unlikely that the charges against Mark Meadows or any of these defendants will be dropped.   FREEMAN:  Now, Areva, we're still waiting, of course, on some clarity regarding trial dates for some of Trump's multiple cases. But do you see any of these cases, realistically, being tried before election day 2024.",
