I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. What's all coming up? Kamala Harris. Just two days since President Joe Biden announced that he was dropping out of the race, the VP has been flooded with delegate support, all but guaranteeing that she will be the Democratic nominee. On top of that, she's amassed a record-breaking $100 million dollars in campaign donations. At her first campaign event yesterday, Harris laid out her vision and did not hesitate to set up the new paradigm in this election. The prosecutor versus the convicted felon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  I was a courtroom prosecutor. In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abuse women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, joining me now is a trailblazer who's had to walk a similar path. Carol Mosley Braun became the first black woman to reach the Senate in 1992 when she was elected by the State of Illinois.

A lot of attention will be focused on the city urine in just a few weeks. But let me ask you about your reaction to what's happened in just the past few days, and that is President Joe Biden really passing the torch to his vice president to carry on the nomination for Democratic -- the election this year as the Democratic nominee.

And I'm glad I'm here to say to you that I'm looking forward to the convention. I hope it will be calm, or as calm as it can be. Chicago has been the site of conventions before, and they have been crazy. So, right now, what we're looking at is a funny kind of chaos within the Democratic Party, but I'm reminded of that old Will -- I think it was Will Rogers who said, I don't belong to no organized group. I'm a Democrat. So, the fact of the matter is Democrats have come together behind Kamala Harris. I support her wholeheartedly. And she's got the record. She's got the competence. She's got the credentials. She absolutely can do this, beat Donald -- DJT as -- for president. And we just -- we have to brace ourselves for the attacks because it's going to be an ugly campaign, it always is, but it's going to be -- I think she can rise above it and she can win.

Democrats are moving forward stronger and more united than ever before. In just the last 36 hours. I have seen a surge of enthusiasm from every corner of our party, uniting behind Vice President Harris. An enthusiasm felt in every corner of the country, and it's contagious among Democrats. The volunteers, the small contributions, they're just pouring in ways even beyond our expectations. Now, we all know that Vice President Harris has a tremendous record to run on. And now, begins the next chapter in our quest to make sure Donald Trump does not become president. Today, with one voice, we speak about the dangers he presents to working families, to our country, and to our democracy. We see very clearly how nervous the Republicans are about our new nominee. Well, they ain't seen nothing yet. Last night, Vice President Harris secured a majority of delegates. Today, in Wisconsin and across America, we begin our next chapter and it will be our best yet. Vice President Harris will beat Donald Trump and become the next president of the United States of America. Applause. Hakeem. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER:  Thank you, Leader Schumer. Joe Biden is a patriotic American. Joe Biden is a heroic American. Joe Biden is a great American. Joe Biden will go down in American history as one of the most consequential presidents of all time. President Joe Biden has made the selfless decision to pass the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is ready, willing, and able to lead us into the future. Kamala Harris and her candidacy has excited and energized the House Democratic Caucus, the Democratic Party, and the nation. Vice President Harris has earned the nomination from the grassroots up and not the top down. She is ready. She is willing. She is able to energetically and emphatically lead America into the future. Kamala Harris is a common-sense leader who knows how to deliver real results for hardworking American taxpayers. Kamala Harris is a courageous leader who has worked hard throughout her entire career to keep our communities safe. Kamala Harris is a compassionate leader who will build an affordable economy that makes life better for everyday Americans. Kamala Harris will fight for our freedom.

      "sentences": "Well, it's going to be very interesting to see how the vice president handles this issue of the war inGaza of support for Israel. I mean, by and large, she has stood by the president's side through many of his policies, although there have been times where she has been a little bit quicker to kind of be attuned to the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. She made that call for a ceasefire in March. That was a bit -- had a bit more urgency to it than what we were hearing from President Biden and from the White House at the time. And look, she's going to have to confront this issue electorally as well. We know, of course, that President Biden was facing huge issues with his progressive base because of his overarching support for Israel, his supplying of weapons to Israel as it battles Hamas in Gaza. And so, Harris is going to be tied to many of those policies, but she also has an opportunity here to try and distinguish herself. So, it's notable that, for example, she chose, although this happened, it seems, before Biden dropped out, she chose not to preside over Netanyahu's speech to Congress visually, that would have been a dynamic that maybe would not have been good for her with her base, could have been problematic. So, it'll be interesting to see how she addresses this meeting with Netanyahu, what emerges from it publicly. And also, this will be an opportunity for the Israeli prime minister to gauge someone who could potentially be the next president of the United States, how she will approach things. And I also think Netanyahu is going to be looking this week to see how Trump feels about things. It's not clear yet whether he will meet with the former president, but we know that Netanyahu is an avid and very keen observer of U.S. politics. And as he moles this issue of a potential ceasefire deal, whether or not to take that leap, he will certainly be looking to see what his options will be after the November elections and how that might impact the future of U.S. policy towards Israel.",

And I'm also saying when the Israelis were walking in the desert, to the promised land, they were thirsty and they cried for water. And now, the war has been wedged for more than -- nearly 10 months. And I'm from, day one, I -- and we are crying for peace. There is no better time to cry for peace than during war. And our political leaders, politicians, there are no leaders. Our politicians from both sides, the Palestinian and the Israeli, they lost their political imagination.

A moment not just for us, for the 12,000 peacebuilders that were in the arena, di Pace in Verona. And before that, again, journalists kept asking us, is peace possible? Is peace possible? But what we answered is that only eight years ago, as the war -- the second World War was raging and Europe and Italian were fighting against the Americans, against the British, and now, they're all gathering in the arena, the di Pace in Verona, and they're all going to meet by the end of this week in the Olympic Games in Paris.

They are naive. We are the voices of reason. We are the voices of logic. And like Jordan, which -- the Jordan and Egypt, they are the only secure borders Israel has. And Jordan, it's not only secure, Jordan also help us and supported us four months ago to stop the Iranian attack.

And then, signed on to by over 100 conservativeorganizations, which essentially provides Trump or the next Trump administration with a blueprint or policy proposals and pretty much a conservative political playbook. Although, more extreme than we've often seen in recent years. But it also brings together a proposal to essentially restructure the federal government. And that's what's key to understanding about Project 2025. It's not just the policy playbook, it's also a tool to completely restructure the government to give more power to the executive. So, we've already seen the recent Supreme Court ruling that grants presidential immunity, and here we're seeing a playbook that is essentially going to hand considerable power across the executive branch, across federal agencies, and place that power entirely in the hands of the next president.",

So, we have to think in terms of partnerships here. A key person here, a key figure is Russell Vought. Russell Vought actually is a former Trump administration official in the office of management and budget, and he also was the director of the committee that wrote the Republican Party platform, right? So, there's very deep ties in the Trump administration and close connections to Trump. He is also self-proclaimed Christian nationalist with very close ties to leading Christian nationalist voices in various denominations across this country. And Vought wrote the chapter on executive power. So, here you can see the Christian nationalist agenda is then going to be placed in the hands of an executive with unprecedented power. And this is important because if you look at survey data on Christian nationalism, what you see is that the majority of Americans do not identify as Christian nationalists. The majority of Americans do not want a Christian nation, according to this framework. So, democracy is not going to get them to their end goal, but this kind of executive power grab may in fact accomplished -- accomplish what they are setting out to do.",

That is a point of view, but we have a very long-established principle here of avoiding the establishment of kind of a state religion. How would this pass muster in the courts? I mean, the courts have still upheld these long-held principles that suggest that you cannot advantage one religious view over others. How did -- how do they get around that?",

And so, that's really key. And it's rooting that proposal in what they claim to be biblical marriage, a biblical prescription for what marriage is and is not. And there's another passage that is really important to understand the framework here. The idea that the constitution guarantees the freedom or liberty to do what one ought to do, not what one wants to do. And that really is foundation of Christian nationalism. Yes, you are free to obey God's laws. And we are going to structure this country around God's laws. And then they redefine rather than the right and to the pursuit of happiness, they say it's actually the pursuit of blessedness. And you are blessed when you obey these laws. What are those laws? Well, this is where you can look at the whole conservative agenda here. It's going to be anti-abortion. It's going to be anti-LGBTQ. And so, these rights do not exist within their framework. And so, they are redefining our nation's constitution, reinterpreting it through this lens, that the only rights that are guaranteed are those that align with their understanding of God's law.",

And within that Christian nationalism, personal piety is not what makes somebody a great leader. Not at all. In fact, that might actually work against the person in terms of their leadership capacity. What they want is a fighter. They want somebody who will fight their battles for them. They want somebody who will take on the left, the feminists, the, you know, woke ideology, and who will fight for them, who will protect them and who will advance their aims. And that is who Trump is and that's who Trump promised to be for them quite explicitly. Now, back in 2016 it was kind of unproven territory at that time. It wasn't quite clear if conservative Christians would embrace a man like Trump who so clearly did not live up to any of their moral standards that they claim to hold so dear. This is the moral majority after all. These are family values voters, right? And so, Mike Pence was maybe a bit of an insurance policy, or it wasn't quite clear that he didn't actually -- that Trump didn't need Mike Pence, because they were after the fighter. And Pence did not stand up and fight when it mattered for Trump, when it mattered to overturn the election, right? And so, Pence very much fell out of favor. A lot of conservative Christians I know say, oh, he's a good guy. You know, those who aren't rolling their eyes at him for being too weak might say he's a good guy, but he's just not what this country needs right now, right? We need a strong man.

But this is very much a moment, because they are now poised to essentially take control of the country and the very mechanisms of our democracy. And that is what is new here. That is what is different. And so, we -- you know, in the past, sometimes you had Ronald Reagan winning the White House and the Christian right is celebrating and the Heritage Foundation offers him a mandate for leadership, and we've had that in the past, but what we haven't had is this plan and a likelihood of them achieving this goal if they win the White House of completely restructuring our democracy, completely restructuring our federal government, and it's not clear what is on the other side of that. It's not clear if we will have another election where we can just reverse things or if that puts us on an entirely new trajectory in this country.
