This is Skippy nibbling on my arm. You know what`s happening here is they are in chimp school. Basically learning how to be chimps. (Voice-over): Skippy is much braver than the two boys. They try their best. But like their human cousins, they sometimes just need a cuddle. Their carer wears a mask so the chimps don`t catch a human cold.",

Rampant, often illegal development is destroying the forests. Sierra Leone has lost 55% of its tree cover since 2000. That`s about 7,500 square miles, or the size of New Jersey.

So if you said either number, put your hands up. While the Eiffel Tower`s height might have changed over the years, its significance around the world has always been clear. And now with a 2024 Olympics in Paris this year, athletes who medal will get an extra special reward with their gold, silver or bronze. Our Jeremy Roth explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The famous French city has put their stamp on the gamesliterally by weaving its most iconic landmark right into the competition`s medals. Each medal features a real piece of the Eiffel Tower`s original iron structure. Following renovation work during the 20th Century, certain metallic elements were removed from the famous French landmark and have been carefully preserved ever since. They have now been repurposed to create the medal`s hexagonal centerpiece, a reference to the country`s geometric shape. The fusing of the medals with the metals will allow the heart of Paris to reside near the hearts of the summer games fiercest competitors. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
