      "sentences": "It is 8And let's get right to the news. We are following two major stories today. Today's day five of testimony in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial. Earlier, the former U.S. president was fined $9,000 for violating the gag order in this case. At this hour, Trump has removed the social media posts which the judge, Julian Merchan, ruled had violated the gag order. We're going to have more on that story in just a moment. But first, it's been another tense day on college campuses across the U.S. We are looking here at live pictures at Chapel Hill in North Carolina, UNC-Chapel Hill, there. We also have news just out of Brown University which has come to agreement with protesters there. The university says it will hold a vote on divestment from Israel later this year that is ending investments in Israel. It's a key demand from students. Students have said that in response to that, well, they will disband the encampment by 5:00 p.m. Eastern today. Meanwhile, it's been an eventful 24 hours at Columbia University in New York, which has been the epicenter to some degree at these protests as students. Now face expulsion after they moved into and occupied a campus building, Hamilton Hall overnight. That move comes after the Ivy League school began to spending students who were refused to leave the encampment. The campus is now closed with only essential faculty and students living on campus allowed in. Elsewhere across the nation, protesters at Cal Poly Humboldt in California were removed after occupying school buildings for a week, closing that campus, the White House has condemned, quote, forcibly taking over buildings. They call it again, quote, the wrong approach. Arrests continue at many campuses across the country as these protests grow. Ed Lavandera is at the University of Texas, Austin, where protesters were forcefully arrested yesterday. First, I do want to go to Julia Vargas Jones, who is inside the Columbia University gates. I believe outside the building that protesters have now occupied. I wonder what you're hearing from students there both inside the building, but also outside. I wonder if other students support the action that they took overnight. We may have lost her signal there on Columbia, so I'm going to go to Ed, who is still in Austin, Texas, at UT-Austin. Ed, you described yesterday that the protests, which was relatively small compared to recent days, there were arrested though is police moved in yesterday? How our police acting there today?",

We were told by Travis County jail officials here in Austin that 79 people were arrested.The county attorney last week dropped all of the criminal charges against the protesters, but this week, sounding very different. In fact, the county attorney release a statement earlier today saying that she is troubled by the escalation in the protest here on campus and that she is speaking with university officials on how best to proceed and handled the criminal charges that these protesters are now facing. But, Jim, here today, a much different scene, at least so far. This is a gathering of protesters and kind of groups that have been involved in some of the protests over the last week-and-a-half now. And here really it's been peaceful. There are a couple of professors talking to either students or people who are visiting the campus, talking about Palestinian and Gaza issues. And that's kind of been the theme of what has happened here for the last hour or so and there's also been a great deal of criticism of the law enforcement presence that took place here yesterday. Their view excessive force was used. We've heard repeatedly as we reported on this yesterday, Jim, university officials simply have been saying for days now that they were not going to tolerate any kind of encampment tents brought onto the campus, any kind of sense that there was going to be some sort of occupation on any space here on the University of Texas campus? So that's they -- they say there are reasons for escalating the police presence here on the campus yesterday. But so far today, Jim, a much different scene. [15:05:07] Meanwhile, you know, university officials always bracing the way things developed yesterday was very quick and caught a lot of people by surprise. And so, you know, obviously, the tensions remain high as you university officials on guard as to how any of these protests, no matter how peaceful they started, how they might unfold or develop in the hours ahead.",

You can see just moments ago, we had people up. They're giving supplies, giving people pizza. They're very much committed to not leaving, Jim. I think that the news from the university that they will be facing expulsion, were only embolden the protesters. I don't think that this will the feeling I get from this ground is that this is not going to make them budge at this point. So much has happened. There's so much that has escalated on this campus starting with two weeks ago when there were arrests on this campus. This rally, I want to give you a closer look at how things are going. Right now, it's all about the logistic of the operation, sorry about that. But this is how things are operating. They're bringing up food to the students. They've been up there for about 12 hours now, since about last night. You saw the videos of how this happened. There was a human chain outside this building with faculty and staff trying to help other people from entering and leaving just students who have decided that they're occupying this building. Yesterday at 2:00 p.m., Jim, there was a deadline for protesters to leave the encampment. I hope you can still hear me, where they had been for a couple of weeks that deadline came and went. The university gave the opportunity for students to find a document saying that being would start abiding by university rules. Not a lot of people took that seriously. They deface those forms. They said absolutely not. Columbia, we will not be abiding by your goals and they're still asking for divestment, Jim. That is the one, like big bold letter requests that these protesters have.",

An internal task force on antisemitism at the university endorsed these policies. In March, however, at question whether they'd be enforced. This was echoed in a congressional hearing on April 17, at which the university president attended and testified.But today, it's not just a matter of what the policy says, nor whether they're enforced.

He ended up taking about $0.10 on the dollar.So it really turns out to be not quite worth as much as he thought it was going to be worth and I think that it shows the kind of negotiations that took place, the fact that the McDougal deal affected the Stormy Daniels deal. I don't think that they're going to have a problem with this being brought in. It's a course of conduct.

He says with or without a deal, Israeli forces will enter Rafah and eliminate the Hamas battalions there. Now, he is the Israeli prime minister. His words should certainly be taken with a seriousness that they require, but they should also be taken with a grain of salt and viewed through the lens in which they were delivered at. And that is certainly a political lens, one that is, words that are intended for a domestic political audience as the Israeli prime minister tries to ensure that his right flank in his current government sticks with him. But there's no question that this is bluster in part and that's because in speaking privately with Israeli officials, it's very clear that a hostage deal would indeed a prevent or at least delay a significant Israeli ground operation in Rafah. If there is a hostage deal, that means that there will be a ceasefire on the ground. And that means that Israeli forces will not, for at least some time, enter Rafah. And there's no question that the possibility of that rough offensive is weighing very heavily on these negotiations, weighing very heavily on this latest Egyptian framework which could see some 20 to 33 Israeli hostages released over several weeks, weeks of pause in the fighting and potentially even a longer-term ceasefire for at least one year. But now, the question is, what will Hamas's response be? Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, has received this proposal over the course of the last few days, and he's been reviewing it. And his response could come as early as today, perhaps tomorrow, but there's no question that that response will be critical to determining whether or not a hostage deal, a ceasefire will be possible. In the coming weeks, or whether instead Israeli forces will begin evacuating civilians from Rafah and then moving troops in. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They are associated in some way, not just with the University of North Carolina, but this has been sort of a triangle area encampment. So North Carolina State University, Duke University, Meredith College, all of those universities sort of came here to the University of North Carolina to have a joint triangle area encampment.There was one student who said Carolina, it's the first time ever said, go Duke in my life. They were all together as university students. So they weren't necessarily all UNC students. But the vast majority were students, and/or faculty staff members. There are, of course, for some additional protesters. But again, the vast majority of people at that encampment are associated with university somewhere in the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill area. Dianne Gallagher, good to have you there. Take care of yourself there and your team will come back as news develops. Well, today, the White House weighed in on the pro-Palestinian protests disrupting major universities across the country. National security communications adviser John Kirby said that people occupying campus buildings are taking the, quote, wrong approach in protesting the war in Gaza. President Biden briefly spoke about the college campus protests last week. CNN's Kayla Tausche is at the White House. Kayla, I wonder how the president plans to navigate this moment going forward. It's not like he has control over this necessarily. I -- I just wonder, are they worried about the progress of this and what role did they see going forward? Well, certainly, Jim, there have been many Republicans who have pointed the finger back at the administration and faulting them for the chaos that's been erupting at campuses nationwide. But the president and his top aides continue can you to walk the tight rope of supporting free speech while saying that protesters do not have the right to incite violence, to promote hate speech, to overtake certain buildings, and to essentially ruin the academic experience for the vast majority of paying students at these campuses. And in response to some of the questions from Republicans about whether there should be a role for the National Guard and all of this, the administration and Kirby by name earlier today said that at present there is no move to try to federalize the National Guard and that any mobilization remains in the hands of the governors of the states where these protests are taking place. Now at the moment, all eyes its are on the potential for a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Middle East that is currently in the hands of Hamas. Secretary of State Tony Blinken is in the region. He's trying to secure that deal and there's a sense that that deal coupled with commencement in a few weeks could significantly take down the temperature at campus nationwide. And yesterday, as Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, you know, about some of this and she said that, you know, that they all want the same goal, they all wanted the war to end. And that is what this ceasefire deal would do. And that is the first priority of the administration right now.",

Thirty years ago last week was the when Nelson Mandela was elected president, thereby ending apartheid and protesters point to the 150 some odd schools that divested from South Africa that saying, this is definitely possible. But I'll point out, just five colleges and universities were totally divested. Divested not just from South African companies, but from companies that did business in South Africa in any way, shape, or form.It's extraordinarily complicated and unlikely to ever be able to accomplish.

We've seen more recently, students pushing for divestment from fossil fuel companies and fossil fuel businesses. And now, most recently, the BDS movement.Students definitely want you to be asking that question. They want to be seen as -- as the inheritors of that cause, of that cause of sort of equity and the downtrodden, that the mechanics are a little bit different. In the 1980s, with the divestment movement from South Africa, stocks and bonds were purchased directly by colleges and universities. Now, endowment managers aren't really stock pickers. They're not using an e-trade account. What they're doing is what you and die and many others in America are probably doing, which is investing in (INAUDIBLE) funds or private equity. Once you start pulling those funds that are more and more complicated, it just becomes very difficult to identify what investments are actually operating in Israel and whether or not you can even divest from it.",
