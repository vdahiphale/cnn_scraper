They feel their relationship with the D.A. is strained and she's not provided enough information. I ran into a family member in town here this morning and I asked him if he received any word on whether or not he was going to be testifying in the grand jury, and still he's one of the family members that hasn't.

Well, we know that New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been joining some other big city mayors, Democratic mayors and talking about the migrant crime -- migrant influx as a crisis.This is an influx that began in the spring of 2012, when you had governors like Governor Abbott in Texas sending people crossing the border to cities like New York City and like Chicago. And so that is kind of the background of all of this. He's breaking now with precedent, with decades of precedent, in part, in response to growing concerns about public safety and about immigration in general. We've seen it already be a top issue in some recent elections. And it's a top issue on voters' minds. And it's an issue that Democrats aren't faring very well with. But the sanctuary city policy in New York has been in place since 1989. So we're talking about a long time. You saw governor -- Mayor Ed Koch first introduce a sanctuary policy. And then Mayor De Blasio expanded on that a few years later. So we're talking about decades of precedent that the mayor is now -- now wants to challenge and change. Listen to what he said at that press conference on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NYC): I don't believe people who are violent in our city and commit repeated crimes should have the privilege of being in our city. There's some people that feels that they should be able to remain here, keep doing the actions until they eventually get convicted. I don't subscribe to that theory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is the problem that a lot of immigration advocates and just civil rights advocates are having a problem with.This idea, he's suggesting that someone, a migrant who is accused of violent crime, a felony offense, could then be immediately turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation. That is a lack of due process that rights advocates have raised as an issue. I can tell you this. The mayor has not gotten really specific about exactly what changes he wants to see to the law. And he would need the majority of New York's city council to go along. That seems unlikely, according to the council speaker, Adrienne Adams, who said that the group is not -- the organization, the city council is not planning to take up this issue anytime soon -- Brianna?",

In the last few years, it's exploded and, you know, the amount of data that you can find, whether it's dating apps or phone location. It's all legally bought and sold in the U.S.But the concern here is that foreign spy agencies don't have any sort of road bumps in getting access to this. So it's trying to make that more difficult by reviewing the sale of data to companies that may then pass it on to foreign nationals. But it's really just kind of a Band-Aid on the problem, frankly. And administration officials acknowledged that. Because what they're calling for is a comprehensive -- Congress legislation, a bill to protect Americans' data comprehensively, whereas this is just a stopgap measure.",

The money is going to go to hiring more police officers, installing more security cameras and lighting upgrades as well. Remember, Riley was found dead after jogging through a remote part of campus last week. Investigators say that 22-year-old nursing student was hit over the head before the killer dragged and hid her body in a secluded area. A Venezuelan migrant has been arrested and charged with her murder. Meantime, deforestation was reduced by 50 percent last year in Brazil. That's according to the country's environment minister who said that efforts to control illegal activities in the Amazon are showing results. Brazil has stepped up efforts to address climate change since it's last president oversaw massive deforestation on his watch. And there was chaos on the court last night during a college basketball showdown between rivals Texas Tech and the University of Texas. Fans throwing objects on the court after a flagrant foul by a Longhorns player. He wanted to be ejected after the play. Texas Tech was also slapped with a technical foul for the rowdy fans' behavior, prompting their head coach to address the crowd over the microphone urging them to take it easy and calm down. The Longhorns wound up winning. Yikes. Still to come, snowless ski slopes at some famous resorts around the world. And experts are blaming climate change for the muddy mess that now threatens their survival, specifically, in Italy. That story is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [14:51:37]",

And right now, it is impossible to miss if you're a snow skier.In some parts of Europe, this year's unusually warm winter has left entire mountainsides bear. No snowfall. And it's even too hot for some resorts to even make much fake snow. CNN's Barbie Nadeau reports from central Italy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): These mountains in central Italy used to be a favorite spot for local skiers. Now, the area looks more like a barren, muddy wasteland. (on camera): February is supposed to be the biggest and busiest month here at Campo Felice ski resort in the Apennine Mountains in central Italy. Not this year. As you see behind me, all of these mountains that are brown are supposed to be covered with snow. This year, instead, there just hasn't been the snow. The only snow you see here was made with artificial snow machines. (voice-over): The human-caused climate crisis has resulted in snow loss across the northern hemisphere. Here, more than 4,400 feet above sea level, where snow is disappearing fast, people are questioning how much longer skiing can go on. This year, the influence of El Nino means temperatures have been even higher than usual. Normally, on a Sunday in February, you'd have 6,000 people skiing on these slopes. This year, only four of the 14 slopes were open. Of the 250 people who work here normally, only 50 have been able to keep their jobs, because the season has been so mild and short. This ski resort has been in Andrea Lallini's family for 23 years. First, his father and now he and his brother, Luca, run it. He says the seasons have been getting shorter over the years.",

But even that is problematic because, last summer, there was very little rain and lakes like this one ran dry. There was no water to make snow. And even fake snow melts if it is too warm. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" he says. And non-skiers feel the impact, too. Gennarino Di Stefano is the mayor of Rocca di Cambio. He says the town's livelihood revolves around this ski resort and those nearby. The changing climate is having a ripple effect on the economy. GENNARINO DI STEFANO, MAYOR OF ROCCA DI CAMBIO, ITALY (through translation): Every town has a good number of people who come here to work, from the ski instructors, the managers, the bars, the restaurants, the people who run the ski lifts.
