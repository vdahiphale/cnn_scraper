And another U.S. Supreme Court justice defending another undisclosed luxury trip paid for by another billionaire. This time it's Justice Samuel Alito vacationing with a hedge fund billionaire who reportedly had business before the court, according to \"ProPublica\". The preemptive strike Alito launched as he tried to get ahead of the claims. And diplomacy undone? Was all that work by Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Beijing ruined when President Biden called Chinese leader Xi Jinping a dictator in an off-the-cuff fundraiser remark? (MUSIC)",

That is the message from the U.S. Coast Guard today after officials announced more undersea noises have been detected by planes searching for the missing submersible, planes that deployed special buoys with sonar. Officials say multiple reports of the noises are being analyzed and tracked, although they do not yet know what the sounds are. We should note, as this point, there could be less than a day's worth of air remaining in the sub. The search area is currently about twice the size of state of the Connecticut and still expanding, with more ships and aircraft joining the search as quickly as possible. Five people were on board the submersible when it went missing, including the sub company's CEO, a French diver, a British explorer, and a Pakistani father and his son.

But the other thing that I worry about is now that more and more ships are coming into the area, now we're hearing more man-made sounds from the area. So I mean, I could just imagine this happening, a crew member on one of the ships has a routine every Wednesday, he's supposed to change the oil filter, and so he -- they're down there changing the oil filter and banging on the thing and now we have just made man-made banging sounds that's picked up by those sonar buoys, triangulates back to the vicinity of the Titanic that we send the ROV off to try to find them.

If it is on the bottom, that search area is probably relatively confined and we don't expect to be rolling or moving along the bottom. It is probably near the site of the Titanic and the debris field for this Titanic is about a five-mile long by three mile wide debris field. And so, let's say they're about within a mile of that.

Quote: The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two boxcars full of spy equipment in it, is he didn't know it was there. No, I'm serious. That's what's a great embarrassment for dictators when they didn't know what happened. And now look, we're told that the president's assessment of Xi being in the dark reflected U.S. intelligence that has been previously reported months ago. But the president of the United States saying this directly, of course, is a whole other matter, especially after Secretary of State Blinken just returned from a very important and sensitive trip to Beijing that has been in the works for months.
