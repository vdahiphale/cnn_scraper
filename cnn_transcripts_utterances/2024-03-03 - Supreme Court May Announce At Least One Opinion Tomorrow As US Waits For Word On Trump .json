The Supreme Court announcing it may hand down a new ruling tomorrow. There is growing speculation that justices could weigh in on Colorado's decision to remove former President Donald Trump from the ballot. Now, voters in that state are set to head to the polls this week for the Super Tuesday primary. Colorado challenged Trump's presidential eligibility under the Constitution's 14th Amendment Insurrectionist Clause. So here now for more on this breaking news, former US Attorney, Harry Litman. Now, harry, thanks for jumping on with us.",

So when they do things a little different, it really stands out here.There are two things they've done different. First, they've made an abrupt announcement, we're going to release opinions Monday. Typically, they would have said the last time they were on the bench that this is the next time we will announce opinions. Second, they are not going to be there. It is not one of their scheduled hearing date. And that too, is quite unusual for the release of opinions. So those are pretty glaring facts and departures from normal practice and you add to that that March 5th is Super Tuesday, as well as the date in Colorado and their desire perhaps to clear up any uncertainty before voters go to the polls, and it all states a very strong, you're right, of course we won't know until 10:00 AM. But a very strong case that tomorrow the Colorado opinion is coming. JIMENEZ: And look, throughout the appeals process, we knew there were efforts to try and get this resolved before the actual primary day, which again, is on Tuesday, and this also has implications for other states that have tried and in some cases failed already to get Trump kicked off the ballot because of the 14th Amendment Insurrectionist Clause, but I'm curious just from your perspective, based on what you've seen from these arguments, how do you think justices will rule tomorrow, if again this is what they are ruling on.",

Now, Israel has not sent a delegation, but the US says Israel has basically accepted a six-week ceasefire proposal in Gaza, but a highly placed diplomatic source is telling CNN that a deal is unlikely to be reached in the next 48 hours because of a few key issues that are still outstanding.

      "sentences": "Well, Omar, listen as the Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo today, there was some sense that Israel would also send a delegation there as well. But an Israeli official telling us this evening that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, decided not to do so because Hamas has refused so far to provide a list of the hostages who would be released under this initial agreement.They also say that they are still waiting for confirmation of the number of Palestinian prisoners that Hamas would be demanding in exchange for the release of those Israeli hostages being held in Gaza. That's how the United States and Israel broadly see the impediments to making more progress going forward. They basically see the ball as being very much in Hamas' court. But a senior Hamas member telling us, offering a different perspective tonight, telling us that they believe that the major sticking points going forward are questions about whether or not a permanent ceasefire can be agreed to as part of these talks. Questions about the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and also allowing displaced Palestinians to return to their homes in Northern Gaza. So all of these issues need to be worked out and we know that we are very much on a time crunch. The Holy Muslim holiday of Ramadan begins in a week, and that has been laid out as kind of the deadline for these talks to see if a deal can happen. Otherwise, Israel has vowed that it will press ahead with an offensive into Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. But in the background of all of this, we are getting a clearer picture of the dire humanitarian situation inside of Gaza. We have seen as hunger in particular has become a major issue in Northern Gaza, 15 children have now died of dehydration and malnutrition, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. And Kamal Adwan Hospital in Northern Gaza is warning that six more children could soon face the same fate if urgent action is not taken. And so, you're getting a whole host of  humanitarian agencies calling for more to be done to get aid into Gaza. In particular, allowing aid to get directly into Northern Gaza. Right now, there are just no crossing points allowing aid to go directly from Israel into the northern part of the Gaza Strip and that is one of the enormous challenges of getting aid there. In light of that, we are seeing the United States and other countries stepping up their efforts to airdrop aid. Yesterday, the US conducting an airdrop with three military aircraft directly into the Gaza Strip. But that is costly, it is inefficient. It can also be risky. Aid agencies say the US would be better positioned to focus on pressuring Israel to allow more aid directly by land. Hundreds of trucks are needed to alleviate the situation in Northern Gaza -- Omar.",

They didn't stay neutral in this process, so she is now telegraphing that she does not feel beholden to this pledge to necessarily get behind Trump. The problem for Haley is that this is ultimately a delegate fight, a delegate battle. Here in Vermont, in Massachusetts, where she was over the weekend, in Maine where she is headed shortly, you know, these are winner take all states here in New England. That means that if Trump gets above 50 percent in any of these states, that means he gets all of the delegates. She perhaps could win any of these states and get all of the delegates, but ultimately, this is a delegate fight and many political observers say that the former president could have enough delegates to wrap up this contest by the middle of this month -- Omar.",

Now here is a before image of that larger fire in Northern Texas. This is what it looked like roughly a few weeks ago. Now, fast forward to today, you can clearly see that burn scar area from where that fire has spread across the northern tier of the panhandle. Now for the rest of the day today, the elevated and critical fire threat areas, this is where were going to see most of that focus of those very strong winds. The hot temperatures and the extremely dry air and yes, that does include areas of the panhandle of Texas, as well as Oklahoma. Here you can see as we go through the day Sunday, those wins do start to tick back up, 30, 40, even as much as 45 miles per hour. But finally, Monday and Tuesday, we do start to see those wind beginning to calm back down and that will allow those firefighters to hopefully make some advancement in those containment numbers. Humidity levels expected to stay low today. We will see at least a little bit of improvement late Monday, but the big improvement comes Tuesday and especially Wednesday of this week, that will also help the firefighters tried to make some advancement in containing that fire. But in terms of actual  moisture, rain, or snow or anything like that, the bulk of it is going to either remain east or farther north of where they really need to see that moisture.",

DAVID PATERSON, FORMER NEW YORK LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: One time, Spitzer said to me, there is someone I'd like to interview to be lieutenant governor, but I wouldn't want to be rejected. Now, I realized he is talking about me and he was right. I didn't want to be lieutenant governor. And at the time, Hillary Clinton was the junior senator from New York. So I said to Spitzer, if Hillary Clinton becomes president, you pick the new senator. I would be your guy. And spitzer said something to me at that point. It was very prophetic. Stay out of trouble and you're my guy. And all I can say to that was physician, heal thyself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
