      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And this afternoon, we are following two major breaking stories, the first on Capitol Hill, you're looking live where House Republicans are meeting behind closed doors. Right now, they're tallying the results of a secret ballot where they are trying to decide who their next speaker nominee will be. Our teams are stationed across Capitol Hill and assuming, House Republicans are finally able to nominate a speaker after ten days without one, in the midst of two wars and a pending government shutdown, we will bring you the results. That is an assumption. Not sure if that's going to happen but we'll bring you the results. Our other major story, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing this afternoon, this is only the beginning of Israel's fight to destroy Hamas. And this time one week ago, one week ago today, right this moment, it was just after 11:00 p.m. in Gaza and roughly 1,000 members of Hamas, which is the ruling government of Gaza, were preparing to invade Israel to attack. They were going to infiltrate Israel by land, by sea and air, by paraglider to kill Israeli soldiers, to kill Israeli babies, to kill Israeli women and men in their beds, to kill Israeli seniors at the bus stop, Israeli young people at a music festival, hundreds and hundreds in total -- the deadliest day for the Jewish people literally since the Holocaust. Now nearly seven days later, that attack has resulted in hundreds more innocent dead killed in Israeli retaliatory strikes in Gaza, strikes that the Israeli Defense Forces claim are against Hamas targets. They say this is based on Israeli intelligence, though, of course, post- October 7th Hamas terrorist attacks, the quality of Israeli intelligence inside Gaza. That's a legitimate question as an IDF spokesman admitted the other day. And while currently no Western leader challenges Israel's right to defended itself, few can answer the question as to what exactly the plan is. As all signs point to Israel ramping up an assault on Gaza to destroy Hamas, including what appears to be a pending ground invasion. And if and when Hamas is destroyed, few can answer what then? Israel's military dropped leaflets from the sky warning the 1.1 million civilians living in northern Gaza to evacuate the area. That's nearly half the population of the entire Gaza Strip. Hamas, which embeds itself within the Palestinian population there, is telling the civilian population to not go anywhere. The United Nations says evacuations on that scale, 1.1 million, would be impossible to carry out, quote, without devastating humanitarian consequences and there are already questions, of course, about whether Israel having cut off food, water, fuel, and other supplies to the entirety of Gaza, constitutes a violation of international law. Israel's done that, they say, until the hostages that Hamas took are returned. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited Israel today where he was on hand to see a U.S. cargo plane delivering more U.S. weapons and munitions to support the Israeli military. Secretary Austin also spoke to CNN exclusively. This was his answer when asked about assurances from the Israeli military about avoiding Palestinian civilian casualties. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY:  This is a professional force that's well led. I'm sure they'll do the right thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The problem appears to be at this hour Egypt refusing to open that border.CNN's Nada Bashir has a wider look at the situation right now in Gaza. I do want to warn you that many images that we're about to show are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  As dawn breaks in Gaza, now under bombardment from Israel for seven days, a sinister warning from the skies, pamphlets from Israel's Defense Forces telling all civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate southwards. We're seeing our children killed right in front of us. They're starving us of food and water. We have no electricity, nothing. This isn't a life. Now they tell us we have to leave, but we don't know where we will end up. Hamas leaders have called on civilians to remain steadfast, and stay put, accusing Israel of engaging in psychological warfare. But families desperate for some semblance of security gather their belongings. And while they are unsure of what awaits them in the south, one thing is clear, there is no guarantee of safety wherever you are in Gaza. It happened to our grandfathers, and now it is happening to us. We are being forced out. Gaza is being destroyed. Nothing is left. It is a catastrophe. More than 2 million people live in a tiny besieged Gaza Strip, still under a blockade enforced by Israel in 2007, more than half of those are now being told to move. The Norwegian Refugee Council has characterized the evacuation order which holds no guarantee of safe return as an act of forcible transfer. In other words, a war crime. Meanwhile, the U.N.'s Refugee Agency for Palestine says the scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone chilling.",

There is, doctors say, simply not enough space in the morgue. They were all innocent civilians. Women, children, the air strikes came suddenly and destroyed all our homes, with children still inside, and now we don't even know where we can bury our dead. Enough, please, enough. In less than one week, Israel has dropped more than 6,000 bombs on Gaza. The equivalent to the total number of air strikes carried out, during the 2014 Israel-Gaza War which lasted 50 days. And while there continues to be widespread condemnation of the collective punishment the people of Gaza are being subjected to, there is every indication that this war will only intensify.

We just want to make absolutely sure before we report that. But Congressman Higgins seems to believe that was the number, 124 to 81. Once we get the final number, of course, we will report it. But the larger issue here is that Jim Jordan had indicated for some time that he needed to get 217 votes behind closed doors before going to the full house. He did not want to go through a messy floor fight the way we saw Speaker McCarthy did, then Speaker McCarthy do back in January, 15 ballots, ultimately getting the vote to become speaker. Jordan had said, wanted to hammer this all out behind closed doors. It is clear he did not here. Now, what is the question? This is how it could potentially play out. He was up against Austin Scott of Georgia. The question will be what will Austin Scott do? Does he decide to step aside and do Austin Scott supporters go and support Jim Jordan's candidacy? Does that increase his totally or does another candidate step in if Jordan decides to step aside. All big questions at the moment.

He claimed to not know anything, and there have been players, including this week, who said they didn't believe that. That's one of the issues. The question about whether or not Jim Jordan would be a good representative for the party given that scandal and questions about that. And the other one, Liz -- former congresswoman and former House Republican conference chair, Liz Cheney, tweeted early today. She said, Jim Jordan was involved in Trump's conspiracy to steal the election and seize power. He urged that Pence, the vice president, refused to count lawful electoral votes. If Republicans nominate Jordan to be speaker, they will be abandoning the Constitution, they'll lose the House majority and they'll deserve to. There are a number of Republicans from districts that President Biden won that probably are fearful of being tagged with Jim Jordan as the speaker. He could be radioactive to them, I would think. What's your impression of why there are dozens of Republicans reluctant to support him?",

But there are also just a lot of animosity towards members on the right who essentially ended Speaker McCarthy's speakership and ultimately sank Steve Scalise. And they simply do not want to reward what they consider bad behavior, rewarding those members who tanked the sitting speaker and then getting behind the person they are backing for the speakership. A lot of those members on the far right are backing Jim Jordan. That is where his strength is. The question, too, Jake, is if Jordan decides to go to the floor without having 217 votes, does he dare those more moderate members to vote against him on the floor? Kind of a reverse of what we saw back in January when the conservative members voted against McCarthy, time and time again, until McCarthy ultimately won that fight. Will Jordan do that with the moderate and will they stand up? Those are all huge questions at this moment, but really, the biggest one, is what Jordan will do despite winning the nomination well short of the 217 votes how does he press ahead, Jake?",

There's rocket barrages and people go into shelters, sometimes they're longer.But then we started to look a little bit at the news and started to see really things we couldn't believe.

My family is gone. I know that. I have it in my gut. I say it cannot be. It's unjust. Again, I'm an engineer. I know that several hotels back down sometimes.
