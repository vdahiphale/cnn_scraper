      "sentences": "Thirty-three years in federal prison. That's what the Justice Department is asking a judge to sentence two of the leaders of the far-right Proud Boys group.You can see the two men here, Enrique Tarrio and Joseph Biggs. They were both convicted in May of seditious conspiracy for plotting and leading the crowd at the January 6th capitol riots. With us now is senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, these would be some of the lengthiest sentences anyone has faced, being connected to the capitol riot. DOJ is asking for lengthy sentences for other culprits as well? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: They are. So there are five men who are essentially the leaders of the Proud Boys either organizationally or on the ground on January 6th at that riot. The men who were at the front of the mob that got past the barrier and then broke into the building, allowing all of those other people to flood inside and put Congress on that very serious and alarming pause in the middle of the presidential certification. And this number that the Justice Department is asking for, for these men, these five men, it is quite a whopper of a number for what they're asking for this sentence to be. I mean to have two of them being asked to have 33 years in prison. Enrique Tarrio wasn't on the grounds that day but was cheering on the Proud Boys. He had been purged out of Washington. And then others, Joseph Biggs and other leaders, 33 years, Zachary Rehl, 30 years. Dominic Pezzola, 20 years. To compare this, the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, received a sentence of 18 years in prison, and the Justice Department asked for 25. And so the Justice Department wants things to be more significant for the Proud Boys because of the revolutionary role that they played. They called them political vanguards in this country, people at forefront of political violence for quite some time.",

So there are many rioters who were convicted of misdemeanors, these petty offenses, essentially for trespassing at the capital, domestic disturbance types of crimes. And judges in the D.C. district court, the trial-level court chose to sentence them quite harshly because they wanted to both put them in jail and also give them probation, so they would stay in the system. And now an appeals court says we don't think that's the law. It's going to be on hold. There could be further appeals. But that's really something to watch.",

The survey also found that 44 percent of adults under 30 reported using marijuana last year. That's up from 28 percent a decade ago. Cannabis use has also been spiking among adults aged 35 to 50. Binge drinking also increasing for that age group with 30 percent reporting they drink five or more drinks in a row. But there were some good news, good signs in the study. Among young adults, alcohol use has actually steadily declined over the past decade. And it's been another rollercoaster day for the financial markets. The Dow has been down three straight days, in part, due to rising mortgage rates to the highest level in 21 years. The Dow opened lower again today but has since rallied. It's now pretty flat as we near the closing bell this Friday. Finally, a new threat to honeybees has been identified for the first time in the wild in the U.S. The invasive yellow-legged hornet was seen in Savannah, Georgia recently. Experts are now working to eradicate the pests. They could threaten the pollinators in Georgia. They play a major role in the state's agriculture industry. Boris, we need the bees.",

The long-term health of the river basin is still in doubt. Consider this, rising temperatures sucked more than 10 trillion gallons, trillion gallons of water out of the basin over the past two decades and that is likely to continue to get much worse.

Rombough allegedly replayed, \"Violating civil rights.\" This just scratches the surface. In another post, this officer, Amiri, after an encounter with a suspect, allegedly texted, \"LOL, putting a pistol in someone's mouth and telling them to stop stealing isn't illegal, it's an act of public service to prevent further victims of crimes. Now that officer, Amiri, was also a canine handler. Dogs are important to police, particularly when trying to confront dangerous suspects. But prosecutors allege that Amiri essentially kept a scorecard of the instances where his dog bit suspects, and that he shared, allegedly, gruesome images with police. In one, he allegedly wrote, \"I'm going to take more gory pics. Gory pics are for personal stuff. Cleaned-up pics for the case.\" And then in another instance, an unidentified officer allegedly wrote, \"It's good that even though the laws don't keep them\" -- suspects -- \"in jail, they still get F'd up by the dog.\" Amiri allegedly responded, \"Ha, ha, I know right?
