Patrick Mahomes leading KC out to an early 13-point lead, and they were never really threatened by Pittsburgh.Mahomes threw three touchdown passes, including one to his favorite target, Travis Kelce. Travis' 77th career touchdown catch early in the fourth, breaking KC's all time touchdown receptions record. He dunked the ball to pay tribute to the former record holder, Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez. The Chiefs lock up the top seed in the AFC for the fourth time in seven seasons with a 29-10 win. And, Kate, it was a very Merry Christmas for the Chiefs. Santa showed up to help them celebrate in the locker room, but this is actually their head coach, Andy Reid. And then check out the jolly old elf showing up to give coach, aka Santa, a game ball. The Chiefs earning their franchise record 15th win on the season. Incredible stuff. Now, I know earlier we talked about how good we would all maybe look in a Santa Claus outfit, but I don't think anyone could top head coach Andy Reid. That's stellar.",

Russia initially blaming a bird strike, but others pushing back on that and saying Russia may be to blame for the crash.The president-elect has floated the idea of taking back the Panama Canal, and now he's named the man who will be front and center as Donald Trump potentially pushes for U.S. expansion. The presents have been opened, and the bags are now packed for the return trip home but you might find some delays. Snow and rain on the way. We are tracking the forecast. I'm Sara Sidner, with Kate Bolduan. John Berman is out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. This is just in to CNN, NATO now calling for a full investigation into the Christmas Day plane crash that killed at least 38 people in Kazakhstan. It is preliminary report, Russia is claiming that a bird strike may have forced the attempt to make an emergency landing with the plane looking like it was falling out of the sky. But Ukrainian officials and others now pushing back on that this morning, saying that a Russian air defense system shot down the aircraft. Twenty-nine people, including two children, remarkably survived the crash. Some of them walking away from it. But 11 people are still in critical condition in the hospital this morning.

It seems pretty clear that the Russians are quite intent on gaining both as much territory and as much upper hand as they can ahead of the president-elect coming in to see whether or not he's willing to go ahead and, you know, negotiate his - the deal he said he could make in 24 hours. Now, he's backed away from that a little bit lately. And I think it's because he recognizes that if there is a deal that is given to or foisted on the Ukrainians that basically says you have to give back to the Russians the 20 percent of territory in Ukraine they already hold, I think the president - president-elect may be concerned that that looks weak, looks like he's giving up territory and it's not clear what he would get in return.

And that was Iran's main way of being able to reach into Israel. Iran's own missile attacks into Israel largely failed.So, the big concern right now in the U.S. government, and he was giving voice to this, is that Iran will conclude that its only option right now is to raise for a bomb. They have not seen the evidence of that yet, but certainly the Iranians have the fuel around for at least 4 or 5 weapons. It would take them a number of months to build it. It is not unreasonable to think that Prime Minister Netanyahu, once President-elect Trump is inaugurated, will come to him and say, there's never been a better moment to destroy the Iranian nuclear complexes. He has gone right up to the edge of that before. It may also be that President-elect Trump sees a moment here to negotiate, Kate.

And that's exactly what's happened. There was an effort by the Biden administration to revive the old deal. That failed. Today, though, I think the idea of putting the old deal together is pretty much gone, Kate, because it would have expired in 2030. That's not all that far away. There would be no sense in reviving a deal that would basically allow the Iranians to make what they wanted after 2030, just five years from now.",

Someone who is very representative of Donald Trump's sway in this part of Florida that we have seen in recent years, and also among the Latino community. Cabrera is someone who was a member of the Latinos for Trump group that was part of Trump's campaign. He is a - elected to the county commission in Miami-Dade, where he has served for the past two years. It's a job he won, in part on the strength of an endorsement from Donald Trump. And he, after taking office, actually sponsored legislation to rename a road down here after Donald Trump.He also was a member of the platform committee at the Republican National Convention, which wrote a very pro-Trump agenda for the GOP moving forward. And he's someone who also previously worked on Trump's campaign back in 2020. Obviously, he comes into this job with a potentially busy agenda given what has transpired in the past week, not necessarily a job that we anticipated would become a contentious nominating process, but certainly there will be questions on Capitol Hill about Trump - Trump's plans for Panama given everything that's transpired. And Trump, even in his announcing Cabrera, nodded to his newfound interest in Panama, writing, quote, \"I am pleased to announce that Kevin Marino Cabrera will serve as the United States ambassador to the Republic of Panama, a country that is ripping us off at the Panama Canal far beyond their wildest dreams.\" Not sure what their wildest dreams were in terms of their plans to rip us off but that is Trump's verbiage there. So, what remains to be seen going forward is what Trump actually wants out of Panama, and how far he is willing to go to get it. I've asked the Trump transition team, is he talking about getting the military involved, or is he just trying to - to pressure Panama to give the U.S. a better deal? And so far I haven't got a response. All - all they have said is this is in line with Trump's other agenda on trade, and it's in fitting very much with his focus in that area. Kate.",

He doesn't have an end game for anything he does. He's throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. It's Panama today, Greenland yesterday, who - Canada a week ago. He is just trying to muddy the waters to under - to get people all jack - riled up about something because really governing is harder than campaigning. And these are campaign things that he is just throwing out there. And to actually get these things done is going to be extremely challenging. He will not be able to just take the canal away from a sovereign government or take Canada from another sovereign government. That is a dictatorship. So, I think that - let's not have the American people be fooled here. He - there is actual policies that he wants to enact. And we'll see if he can get them done. But this is just muddying the waters, just like he did in his first term when he said Mexico was going to build a wall that never was built and never paid for.

We certainly don't want them to also potentially make their way to looking at the international stage.
