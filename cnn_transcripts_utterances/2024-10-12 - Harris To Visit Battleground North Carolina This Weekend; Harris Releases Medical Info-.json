      "sentences": "Thank you so much for joining us, I'm Alex Marquardt.We have lots of news, we begin this hour with the race for the White House. We are now just over three weeks, only three weeks away from the election. And there is brand new polling out today in two key battleground states, which is giving us new insight into where the race stands in these critical swing states right now. The new polling is from the New York Times and Siena College. It shows a very close race in two of those key swing states, Pennsylvania and Arizona. The new polling showing that Kamala Harris has a slight lead in Pennsylvania, you can see it right there, while former President Donald Trump has a similar size lead in Arizona. Both candidates are on the campaign trail today, traveling to battleground states on opposite sides of the country. Trump is campaigning out west, meanwhile, Harris is traveling to battleground North Carolina today, where she will stay overnight. The Vice President also releasing her medical information. Just a short time ago, her doctor released a letter detailing the 59-year-old VP's medical history, along with a health report. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who has been covering the Harris campaign, joins us live now from Washington. So, Priscilla, what do we learn in this released medical report by the Vice President?",

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, this is the first time that the Vice President's office has released records with this level of detail about Vice President Kamala Harris' health. Now, there are some new details included in this nearly two-page letter. It says that she has, for example, seasonal allergies, hives, she is nearsighted.But it also says that her routine blood work at her April physical exam show no cause for alarm. That is really the resounding message from her doctor in this letter, which is that she does have a clean bill of health. And he says the following, quote, \"She possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency, to include those as chief executive, head of state, and commander-in-chief.\" That a quote from the letter. Now, the campaign is trying as well to draw a stark contrast with former President Donald Trump. Remember, not long ago, there were concerns about age for both candidates. That was with President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, who is 78. So this is in part an effort to quell any concerns about the Vice President, at least when it comes to her health. But all the same, her advisers are facing much of what you discussed there at the top, which is that polls remain very close. It has certainly fueled some anxiety among the sources that I have spoken with who are close to the campaign. Because, again, despite being a few months into her candidacy at this point, the polls are just not really moving very much. Now, she is, as you mentioned, going to go to North Carolina later today. This is a swing where she's going to be doubling down on black voter outreach. This has been a bit of a weak spot for the campaign and something that there was focus on earlier this week with former President Barack Obama in Pennsylvania, because there is waning enthusiasm among this part of the electorate. So, today, she will be going to a local restaurant where she'll be talking to local black elected officials, as well as community leaders. She's also going to be delivering remarks at a church tomorrow in Greenville, North Carolina, and also speaking with black farmers before she has her campaign rally there. So there is certainly an extension of that campaign outreach happening with the Vice President's trip to North Carolina today and tomorrow. I will also note that while she's in North Carolina, she will be helping some volunteers who are part of a hurricane relief effort, given that there are so many still on the ground in North Carolina feeling the impact from Hurricane Helene. But again, Alex, getting back to the top on those medical records, the doctor overwhelmingly saying in this letter that she has a clean bill of health, again, only weeks from Election Day.",

In a few hours from now, former President Donald Trump will be holding a roundtable campaign event near Las Vegas in Battleground, Nevada. And later tonight, he'll be holding a rare campaign rally in California, which, of course, is a deep blue state that he lost by more than 5 million votes in the last presidential election. On Friday, he was in yet another blue state, Colorado, where he doubled down on his dark rhetoric and false claims about Venezuelan gangs overtaking the Colorado city of Aurora. In the meantime, his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, is once again trying to clarify and defend those controversial remarks he made about childless cat ladies. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now from Coachella, California, where Trump is going to be holding that rally later tonight. So, Kristen, there were some very notable lines in this new J.D.

Some of them have Kamala Harris ahead in various states. Some have Donald Trump ahead in various states.But one thing is clear. This decision, this election is going to be decided in the margins. And every single vote counts. And one thing that Donald Trump and his team have fallen short on is women voters. It is just not in the cards for them right now. Donald Trump, we know, is a polarizing figure, particularly among women. That's perhaps why you heard J.D. Vance trying to once again clarify these remarks that have plagued him since July, since he was named as the vice presidential nominee, when he -- this old interview from 2021 surfaced. And he said that he had called women or people, who won their country and women in particular, childless cat ladies. This has come up again and again. This time, he went a little bit further, saying that those were dumb remarks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Well, as I said when I made those comments, look, they were dumb comments and I said it a couple of times in a couple of interviews. And, look, yes, I mean, I certainly wish that I had said it differently. I mean, what I was trying to get at is that, look, I'm not talking about people who it just didn't work out, right, for medical reasons, for social reasons, like, set that to the side, we're not talking about folks like that. What I was definitely trying to illustrate and, you know, ultimately a very inarticulate way is that I do think that our country has become almost pathologically anti-child. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

You see this canoe that is next to me.There's been a couple of boats in this area. And this is to get people back and forth to their homes because, as you see down the way, there is a lot of water still. Some 48 hours, more than that, since landfall of Hurricane Milton. I also want to show you over here this home that has this tree that was cut because at one point it was all the way across the road. So you can see some of the damage as well as the water levels up to the porch and the stairs. And then let me show you one more thing. You see that bus way down there. I talked with a resident that has lived here for more than 50 years that says this was the worst that she has ever experienced and that the water was to the top of the white on the top of that bus. That's how high the water was at one point. We did get to see up close and personal ourselves on a ride with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office on one of their airboats this morning. And it was quite the sight being able to see not only that bus up close, but how high the water still are close to street signs. And you could see the mailboxes that were mostly submerged still. The yards, you couldn't see many of them. And we also saw some livestock as well, some chickens and roosters trying to just get by waiting for this water to go down. So it was quite the scene. Even now, a post a handful of days after this hurricane has hit. We are, if I didn't mention in the Bloomingdale Acres area, we're about a half a mile away from the Alafia River where much of this water spilled out from. Earlier today, the sheriff telling us a couple of things. One, that his office alone has been really busy with rescues. 300 of the 1,000 rescues across the state were done by his department. So, the sheriff's deputies not getting much sleep in the last handful of days and sometimes sleeping in facilities of the sheriff's department, instead of going home to families and having to deal with their own mess in order to be here instead. Also, a significant improvement in the power here for so many people. It went from nearly 1 million customers in this county without power to now less than half that, 426,000. So a big improvement there. And then lastly, fuel is an issue as well. The fuel tanks they are getting -- the tankers now getting transported by police escort to the people that need it most. Take a listen to what comes next, though. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

A new study shows that ultra-warm water in the Gulf of Mexico supercharged Hurricane Helene and human-caused climate change likely heated that water. Joining me now to discuss is Professor Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Mann, thank you so much for being with us. I want to note you are the author of, \"Our Fragile Moment: How Lessons from Earth's Past Can Help Us Survive the Climate Crisis.\" Let's talk about how climate change is fueling these storms. What role do you think climate change played in these two back-to-back hurricanes that we've seen in Florida and other states, I should note, in the past few weeks? MICHAEL E. MANN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST: Yes, thanks, Alex. It's good to be with you. And it's pretty clear. As I like to say, this isn't rocket science. It's actually very basic physics that tells us that when you heat up the oceans and you evaporate more moisture into the atmosphere, it's actually that evaporated moisture that provides the energy to intensify these storms. It's also that evaporated moisture that provides the moisture that's turned into record rainfall and flooding. And there are estimates that we see a roughly 12 percent increase in the maximum sustained wind speeds with these storms for each degree Celsius of warming, nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit warming. And that's about as much as the Atlantic has warmed up this century. So that's a 12 percent increase in the maximum wind speeds. But it turns out that the destructive potential, what we call power dissipation, how much damage a storm can do, actually is proportional to the third power of those wind speeds. So that 12 percent turns into a 40 percent, a 40 percent increase in the destructive potential of these storms with regard to wind damage. And we're seeing that. And, in fact, it was an estimate that with Helene, the rainfall, the flooding that killed hundreds of people in the southeastern U.S. was increased by 50 percent by human caused warming. So that's not just a subtle impact. There is a profound impact that human caused warming from burning fossil fuels and the production of carbon pollution. There is a major impact that that is having in terms of the damage and deadliness of these storms.",

As I like to say, the truth is bad enough. It's not exponential, but it's steady, which means that every additional degree that we warm the planet leads to a steady increase, you know, in the intensity of these storms, the damage that's done.Here's the good news. The warming stops when we bring our carbon emissions to zero. So if we can rapidly decarbonize our infrastructure, get away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, we can stop the warming of the planet, the warming of the oceans that is driving these ever dangerous and ever damaging storms.",

He's a CNN political analyst and White House correspondent for \"The New York Times\".Zolan, thanks so much for joining us today. There's a lot going on. A lot was made over those Obama comments after the rally in Pittsburgh. And some of the headlines that came out we're using words like \"scolds\" and \"admonished,\" \"admonishes\" and \"shames.\" Do you think that those comments to that group of young, mostly black men came off as -- as scolding to them and to some? Do you think that that effort by Obama could -- could backfire? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Based off my reporting, there is a risk of that, yes. And some people did digest it that way. Some black leaders did -- did process it that way. Look, for some, the former president was, in many ways, as a former president, as also a trusted messenger in the black community, the ideal person to almost say the quiet part out loud. And by that, what I mean is the quiet part out loud being something that has been discussed in private conversations with black leaders and Democrats. And that's whether a small -- I'm not talking about all black voters, not a mono -- not a monolith -- but a small all slice of the electorate would come to support a black woman in the way that black women have come to support black men in leadership positions for decades. And that's what the former president was getting at. But the risk here as well is that, for other Democrats, President Obama's comments also rick scapegoating one of the more reliable supporters of the Democratic Party for decades going back. In total, black men have been only second to black women of a more reliable basis for Democrats. And for some black leaders, I talked to, they said it's a healthy conversation if black men and are trying to interrogate the party. And for some black voters I've spoken to, they feel as if their vote has at times been taken for granted as well. They have economic frustrations. They feel as if government has neglected them. And they want the administration to come out and earn their vote. So it definitely was a calculated risk, that speech just earlier this week.",

But older black voters overwhelmingly choosing Democrats there, 82 percent of Democrats, 11 percent Republicans among black voters aged 65 and older. So, Zolan, with 24 days left, do you think that there's any progress that Harris can make? Can she make up that gap with those younger voters? KANNO-YOUNGS: That's certainly what the campaign is focused on. Look, this has been a concern. The numbers that you just ran out, including that sort of age disparity there, that has been a concern for this White House for the last couple of years, even before she was at the top of the ticket. I remember reporting that the vice president was having sort of private meetings with black leaders, black businessman, black entrepreneurs as well to get at that age divide and those younger black voters and sort of energize them as well. So it's been on their mind for a while. Look, she does have that interview next week with Charlamagne tha God as well, so that you can tell -- I believe if that's in Detroit. You can tell that's going to be focused as well on appealing to black voters, black men specifically. They, right now, are trying to get that small but significant slice of the electorate that is considering staying home and trying to make the case that her administration can deliver for them. But again, for many voters, they have the same concerns that they had with the Biden administration now for Harris.",

Also at this hour, Israel is almost done marking Yom Kippur. And it's the first time that the Jewish state has been at war on its holiest day since 1973. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. So, Nic, an Israeli retaliation for that recent ballistic missile attack by Iran with 180 ballistic missiles, that could come at any time really. And at least from what we're hearing from Iran and Iranian officials, they do sound ready to further escalate beyond that.",

Officials on the sidelines are saying that it does seem the U.S. and Israeli position is getting closer. The United States wants to a proportional response that should tame any desires in Iran for retaliation. But Iran is very clearly going on the offensive here and using bluster, if you will. It's not quite clear if it really would follow through with some of its reported statements that it would, in fact, attack oil facilities in the gulf of countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and others. Which would obviously wreck the globe -- the price of global oil, send it skyrocketing right before the U.S. elections. Not a thing the Biden White House wants at the moment. And that's a very clear way to put more pressure on the United States. And we know that Iran has got foreman hitting the oil production facilities through proxies of its neighbors. In 2019, took out two oil facilities September that year inside Saudi Arabia in a complex drone attack at the time. A very complex -- something that really hadn't been witnessed before. So these threats, if you will, are being taken seriously. A senior Iranian official was in Lebanon today meeting with the prime minister there. Also met with the U.S. mediator, Amos Hochstein, as well. But it's really not clear what traction the Iranians are getting from the gulf states. It's not clear what traction the United States is getting with the Israeli government. I suppose each day that goes by allows for further contemplation. But I don't think anyone here underestimates Israel's desire to hit back in as maximalist a way as it possibly it can, perhaps without trying to alienate the United States too much.",
