And that is what the administration apparently has decided, the U.S. administration that is, has decided to keep those bombs from being sent to Israel at this particular point in time.

So the IDF is actually moving to encircle a lot of what Hamas is controlling.And they basically want to destroy Hamas just like they've said they would. Go after their governmental structures and go after their military structures. So this is precisely what the Israelis are doing, and the other part of this, of course, is that they're cutting off the re-supply routes that these -- that the Hamas forces have used illicitly from Egypt. So that's the kind of operation that the Israelis are mounting, totally consistent with what they said they would do. But it is also part of a larger operation and that operation would include finding, locating, and destroying the rest of the Hamas forces. And the first thing they would do is cut off the border, then move into other parts of Rafah, which would indicate that they would be moving after places that could potentially house leadership like Yahya Sinwar and others that are part of the Hamas hierarchy at this point.",

That meeting turned into a dinner invitation she initially declined, but her publicist got her to reconsider. What could possibly go wrong were his words to me, Daniels recounted, with a giggle. If nothing else, you'd get a great story. She described Trump's hotel suite in detail, saying that when she arrived, he was wearing satin pajamas. Does Mr. Hefner know you stole his pajamas, she teased him, asking him to change and he obliged. Daniels said Trump asked her about the business aspects of her adult film directing and her possibly appearing on \"The Apprentice,\" and she briefly asked Trump about his wife, Melania, who had recently given birth to their son, Barron, recalling Trump said, we don't sleep in the same room.

When she later returned from a trip to the bathroom, Daniels testified that Trump was waiting for her on the bed wearing only boxers. I felt like the room spun in slow motion, Daniels said. I thought, oh, my god, what did I misread to get here? She testified that the two had sex.

In the morning when I go to school, Mom and Dad are not there to give them a kiss before I leave.KARADSHEH (voice-over): Darin and Kenan (ph) now know they were the only ones who survived that air strike. Their mom, dad and 8-year-old brother, Walid (ph), are gone. Their grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, 70 loved ones, all perished that October day. The children made it out to Platza (ph) for medical treatment. They have new friends. They go to school. They play and laugh. But beneath this veneer of normalcy is the pain they share with nearly 20,000 Palestinian children, which the U.N. estimates have lost their parents in this war. F Five-year-old Kenan (ph) seems oblivious to it all. But sometimes his aunt says he pretends he's on the phone to his parents. \"They laugh, they smile, but they also cry,\" Ustra (ph) tells us. \"Sometimes I can't be strong anymore. I hug Darin, and we cry. Then I pull myself together and tell her we have to be strong and get through this.\" Ustra (ph), separated from her own family in Gaza, has not left their sight since October. She's become their everything. They now call her Tata (ph), or Grandma. Not a day goes by for Darin without thinking of her parents and all those she's lost. She interrupts her interview several times to look through their photos. It's what she does when she misses them.",

It was the warmest April ever on record.And now we have been month, to month, to month records for 11 straight months in a row. Next month will likely be one full year. But this is disturbing. Still, 1.58 degrees Celsius above pre- industrial levels trying to keep that number below 1.50. And that just hasn't happened. And it hasn't happened since July of last year. This is the 11th month in a row where the global temperatures have exceeded any other year on record. So way up there. And same story for the warmest sea surface temperatures on record globally. Not everywhere is warm. There are some cooler spots, but with the El Nino in the Pacific and also the very hot areas here in the Atlantic Ocean, yes. The warmest sea surface temperatures globally that we've ever had. This red zone right here, and mainly right up in here, the development region for Atlantic hurricanes, the warmest it has ever been for this date. Not the warmest it's going to be in July or August, but we're already starting out very, very warm. In fact, warm enough to probably equal June or July. Already into hurricane season, although we haven't had any tropical cyclones here in the Atlantic Ocean yet. But that is likely to come. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
