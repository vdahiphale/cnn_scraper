(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: They've announced a few days ago that they're going to move a lot of their manufacturing business to Mexico. I'm just notifying John Deere right now. If you do that, we're putting a 200 percent tariff on everything that you want to sell into the United States. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

They're giving him all sorts of props and messages and events to talk about the economy non-stop. They believe if the election is about the economy and immigration, but they are favored to win.If it's about his personality about all sorts of other, you know, retributions and threats and all of the other sort of things that come along with Trump sometimes, it's a harder election for him to win. So if you look at his schedule every week, they're trying to give him an economic event somewhere to go every week. They want to talk about the economy every week. They're sending out speech excerpts ahead the night before. Here's our economic plan. We want to talk about the economy nonstop.

But I think that she is having issues really that predate her because there are a lot of democratic policies that are really popular, you know, increasing the federal minimum wage, the child tax credit, more money for affordable housing. But yet and still, time and time again, not only Vice President Harris, but Democrats more broadly are not as trusted on this issue as Republicans. So I think she's getting the weight of that.
