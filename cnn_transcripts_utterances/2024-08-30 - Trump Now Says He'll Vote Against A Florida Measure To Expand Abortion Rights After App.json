I was at her first stop, and this was a notable moment at the time, because it's been a galvanizing issue for Democrats, and they were assigning it to her to essentially be the voice on it. In Arizona, she had a rally there, and she called it the Trump abortion ban. She coined that term, and that was it. After that they used it repeatedly.And it's these types of moments that they seize on to remind voters about what they say is Trump essentially allowing for these abortion bans for being in this position in the first place because of the Supreme Court and the overturning of Roe v Wade.

And they are playing it smart, and they always have. This is a super popular issue, and it polls really high.The Harris campaign is leading in the polls by 20 points with women. That -- those are the people who are going to decide this election. When you're talking 10,000 votes in these states, that's a major pickup. And then if he's going to isolate his base, and he's going to maybe people won't turn out. So every vote matters in these battleground states, and so they are capitalizing on an issue that's extremely important to Democrats.

And McCaul was alerted to this by families of a marine that was killed and in the Abbey Gate bombing and the families, according to McCaul, they told him, \"Look, we are having trouble, Arlington National Cemetery is giving us a hard time,\" that's the quote on coordinating this event with Trump. Now McCaul, in a statement today, issued quote, \"Speaker Johnson and his team acted quickly and were able to get the situation resolved. But something like this should never have happened.Gold Star families have already suffered enough now.\" Now, notably, we do not know the extent of House Speaker Johnson intervened, who he called, who he spoke to, what sort of directive he said. But all this, of course, underscores the extreme sensitivities around the politics of Arlington National Cemetery, the fact that you are not allowed to campaign. They are not allowed to host political events there. And it was very notable that yesterday, when the army came out with that very rare, very stern statement where they defended their staffer and they reiterated their policies, we heard -- we saw on Twitter, Chris LaCivita, the Trump campaign spokesman, really doubled down. He's saying, reposting this hoping to trigger the hacks at SEC army. It was video from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and not from controversial section 60, though.",

They get -- they have a $3.5 million property in Palm Beach. He's got luxury watches. He's got a Mercedes Benz. He's also got three New York Yankees World Series rings. You know, in some corners, Phil Mattingly might pay 30 grand for one of these, I don't know. He's a big Yankees fan.
