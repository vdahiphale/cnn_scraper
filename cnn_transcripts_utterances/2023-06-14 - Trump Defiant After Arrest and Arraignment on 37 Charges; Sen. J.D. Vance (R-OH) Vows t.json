Moments later, back on the campaign trail, all smiles as the current 2024 GOP frontrunner carried on with campaigning, hugging supporters and trashing the legal jeopardy he is under.

He didn't do that yesterday, though, the former president did himself.And then the next thing that happens after that is the Justice Department is going to provide a list to Donald Trump and his attorneys, as well as to Walt Nauta and his attorney, where they will learn who they are restricted from speaking about the case with. So right now, Trump cannot speak about this case with Walt Nauta, even though the two men are traveling together, because Walt Nauta works with him. There will be other people, witnesses, potential victims in this case that will be added to that list. They will be getting that list. But with this case, as it goes on, one of the things that's so interesting about it is that in any criminal case, people are told when they're put under arrest that what they say publicly could be used against them in the court of law. And Donald Trump has seemed to not had any inhibition so far about talking about this case publicly. Here's one of the things he said last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  As president, the law that applies to this case is not the Espionage Act, but very simply the Presidential Records Act, which is not even mentioned in this ridiculous 44-page indictment. Under the Presidential Records Act, which is civil, not criminal, I had every right to have these documents. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the way the Justice Department has brought this case is that they have focused, that this is not about him being president, this is about the documents themselves being kept somewhere outside of the protection of the federal government, national security records. And whether he was authorized to possess them or not, that just isn't part of what the law is here, the criminal law that Trump is charged with.And so there are going to be statements like that that could become potentially part of this case moving forward, especially if Trump continues to acknowledge that he knew he had these documents and he kept them.",

You're seeing it both in the House and the Senate side, in the House side, efforts to try to restrict funding. There're some discussions going on about whether they can do that through the appropriations process to go after the Justice Department. And on the Senate side, Senator J.D. Vance announcing that he would plan place a hold, something that any senator can do on any nomination, planning to do that on all Justice Department nominees other than ones who are nominated to the U.S. Marshal Services.And in talking to both Vance and Durbin yesterday, Dick Durban, who is the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, it's clear that the standoff may persist for some time as Democrats say that they're ready to battle it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH):  I think I want some policy, some commitment from the Attorney General that he's going to do prosecutions and he's going to do politically motivated law in a much different way. We don't know exactly what that is. I'm sure, eventually, we'll talk to folks at the Department of Justice about what they'd be willing to do. But right now, I don't expect Merrick Garland to change course, and I expect this hold to be in place indefinitely. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL):  If you are in favor of law enforcement and the administration of justice, then not filling vacancies of judges doesn't help at all.

This seems to me to be a dream for Jack Smith and his and his team who are trying to prosecute this case.The other thing, just going back to Manu's excellent reporting, it's kind of remarkable to hear J.D. Vance say out loud that he knows that this tactic that he's trying to use to hold up judicial nominees is not going to change Merrick Garland's mind. So, he's admitting publicly that it is just for politics. If he was doing this in a way that he really thought he would get a result, that might be one thing, but he's saying he doesn't expect a result, which is translated as this is a political move.",

Never mind the legal part of this, just on the politics of it. But it's not the way it is in Donald Trump's Republican Party, which it still is, which is why you hear Nikki Haley maybe the prime example of somebody who is trying to feel her way.You can almost sort of her walking through the field looking at where the political landmines are with every one of these statements and knowing what we know about the Republican electorate, it's maybe kind of understandable.
