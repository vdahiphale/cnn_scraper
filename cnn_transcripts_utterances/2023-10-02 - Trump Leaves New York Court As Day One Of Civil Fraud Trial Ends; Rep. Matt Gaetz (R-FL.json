Trump attempting to turn the trial into a platform for personal and political attacks.Also tonight, Republican hardliner Matt Gaetz takes his threat to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy to the House floor, but stops short of any action yet, telling Americans to, quote, stay tuned. We're tracking the intense GOP in fighting right now after McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert a government shutdown. And California's governor appoints a Democratic activist to temporarily fill the Senate seat of the late Dianne Feinstein. We'll take a closer look at Laphonza Butler's potential impact on D.C. politics and on California's high-profile Senate race in 2024. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States at around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room.

This was part of the A.G.'s office attempt to link Trump from those financial statements to the loans at issue in this case, part of the elements of this case that they're looking to prove now.Now, Trump's attorneys have taken issue with the allegations in this case, saying that no banks lost money. Banks, in fact, made hundreds million dollars in money. There was no conspiracy. There were no victims. They say any differences in the valuations of some of these properties, such as Mar-a-Lago, or the family home known as Seven Springs in New York, was just real estate, not fraud, so really pushing back on that. Now, the state called their first witness to case Trump's longtime accountant, Donald Bender. He was on the stand for several hours this afternoon. You know, and inside the courtroom, Trump was very attentive. He was fully engaged. He was flipping through papers at times. He was watching the witnesses and his attorneys as they gave their testimony and their opening statements. But he did not engage with the New York attorney general at all. In fact, he passed by her three times without even looking at her. It was only one time that he -- as he walked past, he glanced down to look at her, but they had no involvement, no engagement. Eric Trump, who was there also in the courtroom today, did stop and see the attorney general. He shook hands with her. And then when he left for the end of the day, he spoke with her again for a second time. But that was quite a contrast from outside of court, where Donald Trump took every opportunity to speak to the cameras and criticize the attorney general, calling this a witch hunt and politically motivated.
