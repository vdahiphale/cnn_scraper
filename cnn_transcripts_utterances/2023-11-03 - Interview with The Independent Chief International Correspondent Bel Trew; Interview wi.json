I'm joined by Middle East expert and former Knesset member to discuss these looming fears. And the debate about natural abilities and gender in sport. Olympic medalist Castor Semenya shares her story. Then, how Nancy Pelosi's family became a target after January 6th. Christiane speaks to the former House Speaker's daughter, filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, about her new documentary, \"The Insurrectionist Next Door.\" Also, ahead, the surge in antisemitism in America. Hari Sreenivasan talks to national security expert Juliette Kayyem. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. As the siege in Gaza continues and the civilian death toll mounts, in the latest developments there are dozens of casualties after an incident near Gaza's Al Shifa Hospital. That's according to multiple videos from the scene and the Hamas run Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. The cause is not immediately clear. The U.S. secretary of state, meantime, is in Israel. Since the country launched its war against Hamas after the tragedy of October 7th, the rhetoric from Washington has been that Israel has a \"right to defend itself.\" But the administration is now calling for humanitarian pauses and the protection of civilians. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  How we build us these matters and it is very important that when it comes to the protection of civilians who are caught in the crossfire Hamas is making, let everything be done to protect them and to bring assistance to those who so desperately need it. And we're not in any way responsible for what happened on October 7th. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

An operation he says was \"100 percent Palestinian.\" Hassan Nasrallah also said there is a realistic possibility of war escalating.

There's not just an awful lot of people being treated there who are wounded, but there are thousands of displaced people who are sheltering within the grounds. The doctor said to me, it was an Israeli strike, it hit this afternoon, as a convoy of ambulances were preparing to take wounded people from the north to the south of the Strip, hopefully to exit out through Egypt. I've reached out to the Israeli military. They said they will get back to me. They haven't claimed responsibility for this strike or they haven't also confirmed that it is their munitions. But the moment, the scenes from the ground show an awful lot of wounded people, blood everywhere, at least one damaged ambulance. And the Palestinians are saying as many as 60 could be dead.

      "sentences": "So, I believe that Secretary Blinken justrepeated what was already said by President Biden during his visit and during his visit and during his phone conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu, that Israel is -- has absolutely full right to defend itself, but it has to follow the international legislation. It has to follow the red lines, inside Gaza. So, as for the current incident, in Shifa, we still do not know what happened there exactly. I mean, from the Israeli side, there is no response. There is -- just like Bel said, there is no official version of this event. I just have to remind that, just last week, the IDF released the footage of -- aerial footage from the area from where the Shifa Hospital is located and it claimed that there is -- for years, there is a central command of Hamas hides there, underground, underneath the hospital. And there are many militants in this hospital, but on the underground floors that you don't really see. So, is these two things connected? We still don't know as for now. But in any case, I have to tell you, Bianna, you know, in my personal view, and this is what many experts and analysts and politicians and former politician Israel say, Israel has to defend the civilians in Gaza not because Antony Blinken asks for it and not because President Biden asked for it, because this is a vital interest of the State of Israel. The next day after Hamas -- and this was the -- you know, this is like a clear goal of the IDF and also of the political leadership in Israel to eliminate Hamas. Let's suppose there is no Hamas. You still have to talk to someone in Gaza. You still have to talk to the same civilians that are being so severely hit right now, and in many different, occasions before as well. You still need to develop a dialogue. And, if you want to build some moderate rule in Gaza, then obviously you have to promise today, you have to vouch today, for the civilians that you are doing everything possible in order to safeguard their lives.",

And there has to be a room for negotiation for a two-state solution and for another party for Israel to be working with in the Palestinian community. Bel, let's get you to weigh in on the other major headline because everyone was waiting to hear from Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah today, in his speech. And again, putting everything into perspective, everything is relative, this would have been a speech that would have alarmed the world had it occurred October 6th. But given the anticipation and the concern that perhaps we could see wider escalation within the region, there was some sigh of relief that this wasn't as heated of rhetoric from Nasrallah as many had expected. Let's play some sound from him and then have you respond after. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HASSAN NASRALLAH, HEZBOLLAH SECRETARY GENERAL (through translator):  The worry is that the possibility of this front actually escalating or going into a fully-fledged war or becoming a wider war is a realistic one. It can happen, and the enemy has to make every provision for this. And I'm sure they do make every provision for this. And I'm sure they do think about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And while we understand that he's not interested to waste all of his firepower, manpower right now for Hamas, he will be waiting for an order from Tehran, essentially, to activate everything that he has under his command in order to harm Israel when it least expecting this in this moment. So, giving the buildup, yes, you would expect that he would declare a war or at least, formally, you know, that Nasrallah is joining and Hezbollah is joining the combat against Israel along with the Yemenis, whom he mentioned, and the Syrians, and of course, the Gazans themselves.",

Bel, let me ask you a final question because another big priority in the region and for Secretary of State Blinken is watching closely what is happening in the West Bank. In the past three weeks, over a hundred Palestinians have been killed. There is a lot of concern about settler violence there and what Israel is or isn't doing to contain that. I want to read an editorial from Haaretz, Israeli newspaper, that reads, if the government does not come to its senses immediately and respond decisively to the actions of the settlers in the territories, it will be adding another catastrophe to its record of failures. Bel, how do you view the Israeli government's response thus far from pressure both internally to do something about this, but obviously from its closest ally, the United States as well?",

And these are numbers, by the way, coming from the U.N. They've said that in 2000 -- in 2021 there was about one settler attack a day. Now, since 7th of October, that's seven -- on average seven attacks a day and at least 864, I think, was the last number people have been forced from their homes. So, the U.N. is saying this is a dramatic increase of attacks in the West Bank, and it's causing, you know, a big problem. I think -- you know, I put this to the Israeli military and I asked them because there's been some disturbing videos being shared, showing people in military uniforms abusing Palestinians, they said that they are investigating this, particularly the accounts of abuse by soldiers and that they are monitoring the situation. But again, Israel is coming under pressure because it looks like as the war is happening in Gaza, settlers within the West Bank are using that moment to increase forceful displacements and attacks. And if that isn't reined in, then they're going to come under pressure internationally as well.",

So, immediately after the terror attack by Hamas, the threat levels -- or there was a warning to local and state law enforcement,then that gets very specific in which a local and state law enforcement are told by the federal government, you know, the Jewish community is under particular threat because of what we were seeing online or what the U.S. was seen online and because of, obviously, the atmospherics, then that, a third time, increases to an overall increase in the national threat level. We don't use a color system anymore here in the United States. Christopher Wray, the FBI director, then testifies to say, it is essentially off the charts now. That's happening for a variety of reasons. One is, of course, the conflict abroad is animating and energizing a lot of political interest and religious interest here that are getting -- that are, for the most part, the appropriate, you know, First Amendment right to have an opinion, but in some instances do become violent. The second is the right-wing, a white supremacist apparatus that has always been antisemitic is playing off of this conflict to draw others into their sort of historic antisemitism. The third piece is, of course, foreign actors taking advantage of our fights, our political fights, our religious fights, the -- and I mean, you know, verbal fights and protests, taking advantage of it and amplifying and creating disinformation about what's happening here. So, all three of those things combined have now increased the threat environment for, of course, Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, but in particular Jewish Americans in the Jewish community.

Those -- that's not even a university rule, that is in fact rules of the public safety system that we are guided by. And I think what's happened is in their sort of twisting of trying to figure out what they want to say, universities have not taken that seriously enough. And I think that behavior would be better, in many ways, if we began to just view this as we need to -- you know, we need to protect students and their safety and security, whatever their opinion is. The second is just actually kind of related to our first part of this conversation is, I think I've been around a long time. I think this is the first sort of Israeli conflict or war or violence in the area that has a -- has had a very organized Palestinian support that you're just seeing it in colleges and universities. I think that's the nature of information. I think it's the nature of this generation and other organizing. I think universities are not used to that. They have to get used to the idea that there are multiple opinions about a very complicated area and to create the forums where we can do what we do best, which is try to find solutions and to educate and to provide forums for different ideas and maybe give students a space to be able to do that. I do believe that a lot of these higher political conversations and fighting that's going on in universities and colleges from the funders, from outsiders and others who are unhappy with various statements that university presidents have made and stuff, I think that has increased some of the tensions that we now -- I think this can be a long war that we now need to begin to moderate and provide forums for.

So, one of the challenges with this particular conflict, from a law enforcement perspective, is the language is so heightened inways that we've never really seen in recent history, and it's essentially the language of annihilation of one population or another. It is either the Palestinians and the Muslims are expendable or they're all terrorists, right? Or it's that, it's the anti-Zionism and -- or antisemitism, which many Jewish Americans will view as -- and view as appropriately as sort of the annihilation not dissimilar to the Holocaust. And we have to -- I think we have to understand that's how it's being perceived by both populations of Americans to maybe be able to bridge that gap. This is not just, I don't like this person. Both communities view it as annihilation language. So, turning to the FBI, they're seeing this stuff online, someone randomly says, you know, basically no more Jews or whatever, but that's just a statement. It's not going to be an action in terms of violence. You're allowed to say that in the United States. So, what they do is they continue to monitor these open websites. There's nothing wrong with that. Determine whether anyone has a criminal or violent history, someone who may amplify it a bit more target a particular synagogue, that's on the sort of investigatory front. That's what the FBI can do. It can't do much until someone says, I'm going after this temple tomorrow, or, you know, something more organized than, I don't like Jewish Americans, or I don't like the faith. The second piece of it is now defense, and that's what you're also seeing. You're seeing governors, mayors, and the Department of Homeland Security begin to push protective assets at synagogues, Jewish community centers, Jewish schools, where people may feel or be more vulnerable. So, it's that combination of things. But we have to understand the challenge is really is this language of annihilation of both against Judaism and Jews and against -- or viewing all Palestinians as pro Hamas. It gives the person who might be radicalized a justification for the violence, right? They're just simply protecting themselves. And that is why you saw Chris Wray, I think, more energized, in some ways, than I've ever seen him before in that sense of, this is really a flashing red light moment and we all need to watch what we say and to protect ourselves because of this heightened environment.",

I think now is the time because (INAUDIBLE) I think I've grown into sports, but I think the most important thing is that we need to start growing women's sports. We need to start understanding the worth of women in sports and their abilities. I think for me, it's all about fighting for what is right for women, the equality, inclusivity, and the diverse.
