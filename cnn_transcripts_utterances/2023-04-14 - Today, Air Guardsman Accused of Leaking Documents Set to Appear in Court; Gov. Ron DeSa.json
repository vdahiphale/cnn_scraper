You see the video right there on your screen. You can see Teixeira walking backwards with his hands on his head before agents take him into custody with their guns drawn. Teixeira was an it specialist for military intelligence unit on Cape Cod. U.S. officials tell CNN that he was also the leader of a small, private online group of video gamers, where hundreds of highly classified U.S. intelligence documents were posted before they spread on social media. A source is telling CNN Teixeira was under surveillance for at least two days before his arrest, and the FBI did not want to raid the house because they were concerned about him having guns. CNN's Jason Carroll live outside of the federal courthouse in Boston, as we wait for the suspects hearing. Good morning, Jason.

This is something he doesn't shy away from, obviously, but it's not something that he puts front and center the way he does his battle with Disney against what he thinks is woke corporate culture, the way he puts the education agenda, where he thinks public education in Florida sort of run amok when it comes to the teaching of race and history and gender identity, sexual orientation. So, he has put other battles much more front and center in his sort of pre-campaign travels around the country than he has this six-week ban. I mean, just take a look. He was in Ohio campaigning yesterday. He got back to Florida. This law got signed at 11:00 at night or so, that's not usually when a governor would sign a law if you want to maximize attention here. Again, I'm not suggesting anyway, he shied away from it. I just think he understands that there are sort of primary politics at play in general election politics at play.",

I do want to note here on the politics of this. A six-week ban is not broadly popular among Republicans, if you look at a lot of the polling out there, it kind of splits Republicans. Now, it may be broadly popular with the Iowa Republican caucus going electorate or those that participate in presidential primaries in some key states, like South Carolina as well, but Republicans broadly are kind of split on something like a six-week ban. Overwhelmingly, it's not that popular when you talk about the American public overall.So, while DeSantis clearly believes this will help with some key portion of the Republican primary base, I think he is no doubt aware that when you're talking about a general election, if he is indeed the nominee, that suburban women in places outside of Detroit or Milwaukee or Phoenix in these key battleground states, independent voters, this is precisely the kind of thing that can make it harder for Republicans to woo those voters to their side.",

He has not yet fully gotten on board with that, though he says he is proudly and 100 percent pro-life when he is out on the campaign trail. You're going to see throughout this Republican presidential primary process, there's going to be a debate within the GOP, and you can start hearing it. I mean, Tim Scott is in a slightly different place now than is Ron DeSantis, than is Mike Pence, who told our Wolf Blitzer a couple of weeks ago, he just would like to see abortion completely banned.

A live look over New York City this Friday morning, and, yesterday, former President Donald Trump spent nearly seven hours here at the New York Attorney General's Office in Manhattan. The former president sat for deposition is part of a civil case brought by New York State against Trump, some of his children and his sprawling business empire.Errol Louis, CNN Political Commentator and Columnist for New York Magazine, is with us now. What I find most interesting about this is that he didn't plead the Fifth 400-plus times like you had previously. He answered some questions.

And there's a reason, by the way, that he did not plead the Fifth 400 times the way he did in his previous deposition, and at least that's what we're hearing. And the reason is that, you know, in a criminal case, you have the right to remain silent. You don't have to say anything. You can sit there from the beginning of the trial to the end, and you cannot draw any negative influences from that. A jury is not allowed.This is a civil case, just the opposite. If you sat there when charged after charge is revealed to you, and you just sat and said nothing, a future jury, if it should come to that, is allowed to say, there's something fishy here. And so it was not in Donald Trump's interest to remain silent or to plead the Fifth over and over and over again. Presumably, the attorney general heard a lot more information from him in yesterday's deposition.",
