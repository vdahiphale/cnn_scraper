      "sentences": "Yes, the fight in Bakhmut is really a story of two fights. The fight in the center of the city, and the fight to push around it by Ukrainian forces. In the center of the city, grinding. Russians seem to be still the ones taking ground around Bakhmut. It seems to be the Ukrainians saying that they're taking -- is ground.Interesting to see if they can continue to push to try for a potential encirclement, that would be a big stretch from where we stand today. And behind me, you see where the overflow of the Bakhmut battle lands on civilian housing here. This huge crater inside the house here. Over the building next to it destroyed as well. The neighbors there, we were just talking to them and it's an interesting story because it ties together the whole picture of what's happening here in Ukraine. The neighbors there evacuated to Kyiv for safety a year ago. The house got destroyed here two days ago. They just came back and they were telling us that even in Kyiv now, because of the increase in airstrikes, they don't feel safe. At the moment, they're just salvaging what they can from the house and they'll go back to Kyiv because they still think it's safer than closer to the frontline. How the bigger battle evolves and shifts along the front line here isn't clear. When they go back to Kyiv, however, they will be, I suppose, at least a little bit assured by what they're hearing from Ukrainian officials that the Russian claims to have disabled a patriot missile system are not accurate. That these systems are complex. The whole air defense structure over Kyiv is more than one system. It's a very complex, sophisticated arrangement. So when they go back to Kyiv, they will know that they can have safer accommodation. But as to the big counteroffensive that people talk about, here at least it's focused on the battle around Bakhmut, which seems to be an isolated effort of intense, intense fighting, and again, perhaps that key bit inside the city, the Russians seem to be still having the advantage, Max.",

We saw the European tour that Zelenskyy took over the weekend to four countries, two and a half days. He has now continued that PR campaign addressing the summit of European leaders in Reykjavik.And really trying to make the point that, look, yes, we saw this big success for Ukraine's air defenses. If their claim is true and they did shoot down those six Kinzhal missiles, that really is a step forward. But he wants to make it clear that even with that, that does not mean that as Secretary Blinken suggested last week, Ukraine has everything it needs for this counteroffensive. And look that's true, air offenses are not some sort of one-time thing. You have to provide missiles to shoot down other missiles. The Pentagon leaks in April suggested that Ukraine could run out of missiles and that could potentially still be true. So he's still pushing for that. And of course, still pushing for F-16 fighter jets. We know that on the sidelines of the summit in Reykjavik, the U.K. and the Netherlands have sort of banded together to try to form this international coalition to provide Ukraine with those F-16s. The Netherlands has them, Belgium has them, the U.K. doesn't, but is trying to play the role of this sort of catalyst to unlock deliveries from other countries. And Zelenskyy sounded pretty hopeful in the U.K. But the holdout is still the U.S. which of course manufactures the F-16s. They have said they don't think Ukraine needs them at the moment. It's too difficult to train them. So he's still pushing.",

If you think about it, the G7 is a group of like-minded individuals and like-minded nations. And if we look at history, especially over the past year and a half, the G7 in particular has been very instrumental in instituting some of those punishments that we have seen against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.The question is, during this meeting, will things be taken a step further, as this war is now into its second year? We have seen Europe in recent months continue to export a lot of items to Russia. Things such as automobiles, even chocolate. We've seen Japan import energy from Russia. Will the G7 go a step further and put more restrictions, even eliminate some of those trade practices? That's something we'll have to see. Another big issue on the table also is likely China. Will we see the G7 nations issue a very strong statement to China, in particular, amid allegations of questionable economic practices? That's something that is still to be determined. When analysts told me, if that were to happen, that would be a big deal. Also, Max, we cannot discount the backdrop of Hiroshima. This is, of course, where the United States dropped atomic bomb in 1945. It holds a lot of symbolism, a lot of heartbreak in the region. In fact, during a recent interview, an exclusive interview CNN did with Japan's foreign minister, he's told me that he hopes these heads of state from the G7 take some time to reflect on what happened here and hopes that perhaps, it will guide their decision making in the future, Max.",

If the debt ceiling isn't raised, the United States will default on its debt obligations as early as June the 1st. If that happens, experts say, it would shatter the U.S. economy causing a domino effect around the world. President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met on Tuesday, but the two sides remained far apart. Arlette Saenz joins us from the White House with more details on the talk. Some people saying there's no way they'll break this debt ceiling, and this is all posturing. What are your thoughts?",

But there is a new phase of these negotiations that is kicking off right now. President Biden has appointed two of his top aides to join the negotiations directly with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's office. McCarthy has selected a Louisiana Congressman Garret Graves to lead his side of the talks. This now ensures that it's simply the White House and McCarthy negotiating directly as they're trying to come to some types of agreements about how long to raise the debt ceiling for the length of spending caps to put on in the future as well as a host of other issues. There's a key sticking point right now in these negotiations, which centers around the work requirements for some social safety net programs here in the United States. McCarthy has said that including those work requirements is a red line for him. While Democrats, especially progressives, have really balked at the idea of having those as part of these negotiations. The White House last night released a statement saying that the President intends to push back in negotiations over these work requirements that they do not want to see any programs impacting healthcare or trying to push Americans into poverty. But at this moment, you know, there's a little bit of glimmer of hope in the fact that they are trying to narrow these discussions directly between Biden and McCarthy. But there is still a lot of maneuvering that needs to be done on the issues. There is also that timeline. It takes time for legislation to move through Congress. President Biden says he'll be speaking with congressional leaders a bit later in the week by phone and then intends to meet with them again when he returns next week.",

Her mother had supervised visitation. Well, on July 7, right after 4 of July, her father Ryan, went to go pick her up from this supervised visitation and she was gone. He couldn't find her. Her mother was gone.And so I just got finished looking at some court records, and there was an amber alert, which we have in the United States. It was immediately called out, but she was nowhere to be found. And then at the end of July, there was a warrant out for the arrest of her mother for kidnapping. So six years later, and her father didn't know where she was for all of these years. What was Kayla told? Well, it was last Saturday night, it was North Carolina, 600 miles from South Elgin, Illinois, which is the Chicago suburb, and someone saw her in a store and had seen this episode on Netflix of \"Unsolved Mysteries\". Went to the store personnel and said, I recognize her. She was on this show of missing children. And so authorities came, they got her, the mother, they found her in North Carolina. She was arrested, held on $250,000 bail. But Kayla has now been reunited with her father. And there's two things here. She was on the Netflix episode for four seconds, four seconds. And that woman, whoever it was, recognized her from that show. And Kayla's mother has been released on bail. She is free, and she has a court date in July.",

One mayor of Ravenna, which is a town close to this particular location, says that his town is simply unrecognizable because of the destruction that the flooding has left behind. So what is the culprit? Well, we go to the satellite to show you this large, swirling, massive cloud across the northern Adriatic and into the northern portions of the Mediterranean. It is responsible for producing over 100 millimeters of rain just in a 24-hour period, particularly across this northeastern coastline, which is a very vulnerable area to flooding. You can consider what's just to the north, Vienna. We talk about flooding there quite frequently. Now, keep in mind, the larger story here is that drought conditions have plagued this part of Europe, stretching into northern Italy. We have drought warnings in effect across this particular region. That means the soil is extremely dry. So when you get that amount of rain in that short of period of time, it cannot soak adequately into the soil below. So it has to rush somewhere. And unfortunately, it rushes into the rivers and streams. It swells them over, they break their banks, and unfortunately, that impacts communities and villages downstream. You can see there's more rain in the forecast. We anticipate at least another 15 to 25 millimeters today and right through the better part of the weekend. Max?",

The birth rate in this country, once known for large families, has plummeted to a record low 1.24 children per Italian woman. One of the lowest in Europe. High cost of living, low wages and expensive housing are just some of the obstacles. Claudia and Gabrielle (ph) say they often argue about starting a family with so many uncertainties. Claudia says the government thinks that 10,000 euro is enough to have a child, but the incentives are temporary. A child is forever. Gabrielle (ph) says the government ignores the youth because they are the minority. The government has to take risks. They also have to take unpopular decisions if they really want to try to stimulate growth. They have to represent the side of the youth, he says.
