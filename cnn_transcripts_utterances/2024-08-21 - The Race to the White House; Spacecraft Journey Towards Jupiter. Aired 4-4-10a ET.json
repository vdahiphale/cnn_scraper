Additional speakers for the convention include former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Meanwhile, outside the DNC, thousands took to the street to protest the war in the Middle East, calling for a ceasefire. Dozens of protesters even broke through a security fence. On the Republican side, former President Donald Trump and his vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance are campaigning in battleground states, holding rallies and putting out messaging online and on television about their campaign. Since Republicans held their convention last month before Harris and Walz joined the race, Trump is now campaigning against a new Democratic duo. Another story we`re watching. The U.S. government has found that Iran was behind a hack and leak operation targeting Donald Trump`s presidential campaign. This came after news outlets reported getting documents that seemed to come from a senior Trump campaign official`s account. The hackers also attempted to go after the Harris campaign, but they didn`t succeed in their attempts. U.S. officials believe the investigation is a clear sign that Iran, and other countries, are trying to influence the 2024 presidential election. However, Iran rejected this, calling the claims unsubstantiated. 1 Ten-second trivia. According to astronomers, how many moons does Jupiter have? One, two, three, or 95? The current count is 95 confirmed moons for Jupiter, including the largest moon in our solar system, Ganymede, which is larger than the planet Mercury. Scientists have been studying Jupiter`s moons for decades, sending probes to peruse them since the 1970s. After discovering some of these moons have actual oceans under their icy surfaces, the European Space Agency and NASA want to know, can these celestial bodies support life? Well, the Juice mission, named after the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft, is going to use some pretty cool physics to perform the first double gravity assist maneuver. This week, the spacecraft will use Earth`s gravity to slingshot towards a Venus flyby in 2025, and putting it on track to scope out Jupiter and its moons by July of 2031. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Earthlings havebeen curious about these moons and their potential to house life for a long time. NASA first sent probes in part to get a closer look in 1977. Jupiter is a gas giant. That means it doesn`t have a surface. It`s a swirl of gases that can dense into a smoldering ocean of hydrogen at its core. It`s very similar to our sun in this way. But unlike the sun, it doesn`t fuse hydrogen atoms into helium to create energy and heat. Now back to those first NASA probes, they observed long lines and dark spots on the moon Europa. Typically, moons have cratered surfaces. But these images tipped scientists off that there might be an ocean beneath Europa`s icy exterior. In 1996, that theory was confirmed when the Galileo spacecraft reached Europa. It was the first ocean discovered on another planet. Then, in 2012 and 2016, the Hubble Space Telescope showed water plumes erupting from the warmest parts of Europa. Scientists don`t know much about the plumes. But if Europa has water and elements like carbon and hydrogen, it could mean that microbial life once formed there or even still exists. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Gold is now worth $2,500 per ounce, and high gold prices can be a sign of economic uncertainty. Next in our CNN 10 Olympian series this week is Team USA gymnast Steve Nedoroscik. His presence was seemingly ubiquitous on social media during the games after winning bronze on the pommel horse and propelling the U.S. to its first team medal since 2008. He took the Internet by storm for his bold performance and beloved look, battling eye conditions his entire life. Steve wears glasses and he loves his nickname Clark Kent.
