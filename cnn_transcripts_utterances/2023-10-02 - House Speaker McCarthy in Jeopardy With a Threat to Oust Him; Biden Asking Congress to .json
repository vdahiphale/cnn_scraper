Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" one crisis ends as another begins. Why U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's decision to work across the aisle to avoid a government shutdown has now put his leadership role at risk.U.S. funding for Ukraine also on the line after being left out of the government spending bill. What that could mean for Kyiv's fight against Russia. And the search for victims in Spain after flames ripped through a nightclub leaving more than a dozen people dead with fears that number could rise. Thanks for joining us. Well, after Congress narrowly passed a short- term spending bill to keep the government open, U.S. President Joe Biden is now urging lawmakers to approve new funding plans before the next deadline. He says lawmakers should pass a year-long budget deal and authorize war aid for Ukraine within the next month and a half. He's also calling on both parties to act fast, saying they should stop waiting until the last minute to get things done. But getting House Republicans in line for a vote could become more challenging in the days ahead. A far-right Republican who opposed the spending bill says he will soon try to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy after he worked with Democrats to pass the measure. Matt Gaetz told CNN that he will soon force a vote on whether to remove McCarthy, saying the Republican leader cannot be trusted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  I do intend to file a motion to vacate against Speaker McCarthy this week. I think we need to rip off the Band-Aid. I think we need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy. Look, the one thing everybody has in common is that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy. The only way Kevin McCarthy is Speaker of the House at the end of this coming week is if Democrats bail him out. (END VIDE CLIP)",

CHURCH:  And President Joe Biden says the brinkmanship, which we've seen, has to end.

We have not had a motion to vacate in effect to fire the Speaker since 1910 and in that example, I do not believe the minority party was the decisive block of votes. We know, as I said, that the vast majority of Republicans will vote to keep McCarthy in place. But because there are enough that will vote to put him out, Democrats can join with them and actually remove him.One school of thought in the Democrats says the devil you know. McCarthy has been a very partisan speaker he wants an impeachment inquiry into Biden without any hard evidence to justify it, but at least you kind of understand who he is and now twice with the debt ceiling and with the government shutdown he has behaved in a generally responsible way building a bipartisan vote to avoid potentially catastrophic economic consequences. The other point of view of the Democratic Party says, you know, puts the emphasis on the other part of the sense. McCarthy has been a deeply partisan speaker. He has generally conceded almost whatever the far right wants, and that Democrats should not lift a finger to save him. Plus, there is certainly an understandable view among many Democrats that the more chaotic a Republican's management of the House becomes, the better it is for the Democrats' chances of winning it back in 2024. I really don't know what they are going to do. My instinct is that the White House will kind of fall on the devil you know side of the equation and that will probably lead to enough Democrats supporting him for him to survive, but I wouldn't rule out the other possibility either.",

He's been able to convince Republican voters to see it in the way that he wants them to see it, as an attack on them through him.You know, they're going after you, but I'm just in the way, is what he says. It's a very different question what this might mean to a general election. You know, I think people are much too quick to write off the idea that this could be a significant burden for him if he is the Republican nominee. Americans are hesitant about re-electing Joe Biden. We see that about concerns about his age, about inflation. So, it's not as if Donald Trump's legal troubles are a silver bullet for Democrats. But I think that many Republicans are been too quick to assume that because none of this is phasing Republican primary voters, that it will be equally indifferent for general election voters. When you have a candidate whose case for managing the economy is based on his business acumen and his companies are being convicted of systematic fraud or judged to have committed systematic fraud, that is a potentially serious challenge for the core, really, of his candidacy, the idea that he can manage the economy better than Biden.",

On the campaign trail, Robert Fico pledged to cut off military aid to Ukraine if he won. Slovakia has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies since the outset of the war, sending helicopters, artillery and air defence systems.But Fico's basic argument is that sending weapons and ammunition only prolongs a war in which Russia will never accept defeat. And that is an appealing message in a country that is struggling with inflation and the cost of hosting more than a hundred thousand Ukrainian refugees. Fico's party won by a more comfortable margin than some poles have predicted but he will still need a governing partner in order to govern the country. And he had not ruled out pairing up with the far right party that broadly shares his view on Russia and Ukraine, but that party didn't quite make the 5 percent threshold needed in order to take seats in parliament, so it is more likely that he will now aim to work with the Halas Party which has been more vague about Ukraine. On the one hand arguing that Slovakia has given all it can afford to give, and on the other hand it says that Slovakia should continue to manufacture ammunition for Ukraine, which is ultimately good for the economy. So Fico's policy toward Ukraine and Russia is likely to be moderated out of political necessity, and he has been prime minister twice before so he has a track record of being pragmatic in order to govern. The voter turnout, by the way, the highest that it's been in 20 years. But it will likely take weeks before Slovaks ultimately find out who will be part of that coalition government.

It was his first appearance in a regular season game since going into cardiac arrest on the field in January.The 25 year old had been on the team's inactive list for the last three weeks.The Bills, meanwhile, put on a monster performance against the Dolphins, winning 48-20. Well it's another history-making day for decorated gymnast Simone Biles. Unbelievable. While competing at the World Artistic Gymnastic Championships on Sunday, she became the first woman to land the Yurchenko Double Pike Vault during an international competition. The high difficulty skill is historically done by men and will likely now be named the Biles Two in honor of the 19 time world champion, making it her fifth named element. Well despite the European team's commanding lead heading into Sunday's final round, the Americans gave them a scare at the Ryder Cup in Rome, but in the end team Europe prevailed. CNN WORLD SPORT anchor Don Riddell has all the highlights.",

Right from the off on Friday morning, the home team was in command against the USA, and they entered Sunday Singles with a five point lead.That meant that Europe only needed to take four of the 12 points available to win the cup, and their captain, Luke Donald, stacked his lineup to get the job done quickly. Jon Rahm secured a half point against Scottie Scheffler before the young Norwegian Viktor Hovland thumped Collin Morikawa for Europe's first full point of the day. And in the fourth match, Rory McIlroy beat Sam Burns to make McIlroy the leading point scorer of the week with four. Tyrrell Hatton's win against Brian Harmon put Europe on the precipice of victory but then the Americans had something to say. And when Brooks Keopka, Justin Thomas and Xander Schauffele all won their matches, suddenly Europe's win wasn't quite so assured. It was Tommy Fleetwood who got them over the line when Rickie Fowler conceded a putt on the 16th green. Europe had done enough to win back the cup, and for their captain, Luke Donald, the emotions were overwhelming.",

That is the church where Jimmy Carter taught Sunday school, wishing him a happy 99th birthday at the start of Sunday service. US President Joe Biden also delivered this birthday message. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, US PRESIDENT: Mr. President, happy birthday, pal. I have known a lot of presidents, as you have, but I admire you because you have such incredible integrity, character and determination. One of the smartest things I ever did, you may remember, I was the first senator to ever endorse you because I knew who you were. And you haven't changed a bit. You've never stopped. And I consider it a great honor to know you and to have worked with you. And I just hope I can be one half the president you've been. God love you. Happy birthday, pal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
