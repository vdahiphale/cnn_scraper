Hundredsof protesters gathering outside the National Assembly and outside the Office of President Yoon Suk Yeol one day after he tried to declare martial law, a move that both shocked and drew condemnation from those in South Korea and around the world. It is now 11:00 p.m. in Seoul, 09:00 a.m. here in New York. I'm Erica Hill in for Becky Anderson today. This is \"Connect the World\".

At the stock market here in New York set to open just about 30 minutes from now, as we take a quick look at the futures, there little bit of green flat, but a little bit of green, and we will take that on a Wednesday morning. In South Korea, a major display of dissent in the capital, hundreds of protesters took to the streets, marching to the Office of President Yoon just one day after he tried to declare martial law. Essentially, it's being seen as a political power play gone drastically wrong, creating an immediate crisis for the president and for his government. Mr. Yoon's Defense Minister his Chief of Staff and a number of other top officials have already submitted their resignations, and pressure is now on the president, that pressure growing for him to resign. All of this, of course, set into motion by that surprise declaration of martial law from the president that happened just about 24 hours ago. My colleague Mike Valerio has been in the thick of all of this in Seoul, watching it unfold.

So, they are trying to show that they are still key partners here. Another interesting thing Erica is Blinken this morning, he emphasized that South Korea has been an example of democracy building in the region over the past three or four decades. He was asked if it was a mistake, in hindsight, to host the summit for democracy there earlier this year, and he said, no, they were delighted to have South Korea take up that role, and they will be looking to them to continue that example. So, they are giving them a lot of leeway here to course correct, to follow the rule of law. They said they expect that any sort of conflicts -- resolved peacefully and according to law, be it in South Korea or around the world. Yesterday, we heard from the State Department saying they were seeking to have contact with South Korean counterparts, both in Washington and in Seoul.

Iran's most prominent human rights activist has been freed from jail for three weeks to recover from major surgery. On Tuesday, an Iranian prosecutor suspended Narges Mohammadi's prison term to allow her to recover from an operation for a suspected cancerous lesion. The Nobel Laureate has spent most of the past two decades as an inmate at a prison notorious for housing critics of the Iranian regime. Even though, as that regime allows the high-profile activists to leave jail, albeit briefly, Parliament is tightening the country's already harsh dress code imposed on ordinary women in Iran, one of course, that has previously sparked protests. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following all of these developments for us from London. So, first of all, I know we are hearing from Narges Mohammadi's family reacting very strongly to this decision to let her out for only a few weeks there in terms of recovery, what are we hearing from them? And just and just remind us, if you could why she has been in that prison for so many years?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely! So, we got word from her family this morning that she was being released, being sent by ambulance,if you can believe it, that ambulance was not covered by state funds. It was something her family had to pay for. They have been appealing for her to have a recovery period. This is a 21-day release to recover from a very serious surgery in November. She had a portion of her left leg bone removed because there was a lesion on it that was thought to potentially be cancerous. Since then, she's been in excruciating pain behind bars. Her family says unable to walk again. They asked for three months' time to recover. That's what they say. The doctors told them she needed but she has only been granted three weeks by an Iranian prosecutor. During this time, of course, they're going to cram in as much medical attention as they possibly can, but they're also going to continue to voice what is her primary message, which is freedom for women in Iran. She has spent over a decade in jail already. She is serving up to 30 years in prison for multiple sentences. The Iranian government accuses her of violating national security, of spreading lies about the state. She says these are simply consequences for steep for speaking out, for her activism, for her work calling for freedom for women and girls. In this sentence, as you mentioned, this release, rather comes just as the country tightens its restrictions, tightens its hijab laws. It imposes even harsher punishments on those that violate it.",

The CEO of United Healthcare shot and killed in midtown Manhattan this morning.That is, according to a law enforcement official, Brian Thompson, you see his picture on your screen there, who was leading one of the largest health insurance companies in the United States, was walking toward the Hilton Hotel in Midtown, there to attend a conference when a gunman opened fire on the street. We do have some new aerial images of the scene outside the Hilton, of course, a massive hotel well known to anybody who has spent time in New York City, and often the site for people who may be in town for a conference. Investigators say they do believe this appears to be a targeted shooting. As for the gunman, the suspected gunman got away on a bicycle, a manhunt underway now in the City of New York. We will continue to update you with further details as we get them. Sources telling CNN, Donald Trump's team is now actively considering alternatives for defense secretary, now that his initial pick of Pete Hegseth appears to be in jeopardy. Two names being floated, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, and also Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. This is a critical day for Pete Hegseth. He is set to sit down for his first TV interview since these new accusations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and inappropriate workplace behavior surfaced. CNN's Steve Contorno, following all of these developments for us. So, first of all, before we get to all of the developments in this day for Pete Hegseth, the fact that there are names being floated to replace him is actually a big development, because that tells you that there are things happening. There are wheels in motion behind the scenes. Tell us a little bit more about how either Senator Ernst or Governor DeSantis could really fit the bill for the Trump transition team?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, there are a lot of Republicans in Donald Trump's orbit, as well as in the Senate, who remain concernedwhether Hegseth can get the 54 votes needed for confirmation, and they are now doing their due diligence around some other potential names who could potentially replace Hegseth, if he were to step down or Trump take him off his list of consideration. Now I will say the two names that you mentioned, Joni Ernst and Donald, or, excuse me, Ron DeSantis, are very interesting for two different reasons. Ernst is interesting because she is considered one of the swing votes on Capitol Hill, who could determine, ultimately, Hegseth's faith, and yet she is herself, potentially in the mix with that combat experience that you mentioned as a potential replacement. Now Ron DeSantis is a sort of a stunning name to emerge at this moment, because him and Donald Trump have not been on good terms ever since DeSantis decided to run for president in a primary that everyone knew Donald Trump intended to fight for, and the these two once allies had an acrimonious end to their relationship during that primary. And Donald Trump is also surrounded by a lot of advisors and individuals who once worked for Donald, or excuse me, Ron DeSantis and have a lot of bad blood from that time. However, he does have some interesting qualifications. He is someone who has served in the military himself. He also has a very buttoned up a home image, which is obviously in stark difference to what has emerged out of Pete Hegseth in recent weeks. And he's someone who has vocalized a lot of the same concerns about the Pentagon and the military that we've seen Hegseth and Donald Trump speak about recently. So that is a reason why these two individuals are being considered.",

It does not guarantee that he will do it, but it makes them available, and this is something that they had resisted, in part because they had said they were going to do their own background checks on certain people and handle that in house. However, this change in position has come amid concern from Republicans on the Hill that a background check from the FBI could go a long way to -- way, some of the fears about some of Trump's picks and with some people, including Senator Collins like you, said outwardly saying they would not they would like to see what the FBI has to say about these allegations that have been raised against Pete Hegseth.
