He's already appointed essentially a mirror image of Facebook's governance council, so he can sort of attempt to outsource those types of decisions. I think what it does make it easier, though, what probably this facilitates is calls for carve outs of Section 230, around election misinformation, misinformation around medicine.But it's time -- the thing that most of these attacks have in common is that they were either catalyzed, discussed or organized online. So I think you're going to see Congress finally move on carve outs from 230 such that if individuals were clearly signaling this type of offline violence, and then it might jump from online to offline, that the platform's incur some liability. So I do think it's very difficult for him to start softening moderation. And also to -- you're going to see Section 230 carve outs. Also Michael, just from a shareholder standpoint, if you go from least moderated to most moderated, least moderated would be 4chan, most moderated would be TikTok. There's a direct correlation and shareholder value and growth between additional moderation. Twitter is successful because of moderation, not despite it.",

Is that going to work? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:18:27] SMERCONISH: With just 10 days left until the midterm election day, both parties now doing final pushes. And with the polling headwinds lately against the Democrats last night, the President and Vice President made a rare joint appearance on the campaign trail here in Philadelphia at the state party's annual independence dinner to bolster Senate hopeful John Fetterman and gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro. Former President Barack Obama attended a rally in Georgia aiming to boost Senator Raphael Warnock, gubernatorial candidate, Stacey Abrams and others. And next week, former President Trump do to appear at rallies in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Florida and Ohio. But how much can this kind of last-minute push really change any minds? Joining me now to discuss is David Beiler, Political Columnist and Data Analyst for the Washington Post. We're 10 days out, David, where are we big picture? DAVID BYLER, POLITICAL COLUMNIST &amp; DATA ANALYST FOR THE WASHINGTON POST: Big picture? This is an extremely close midterm election. If you look at the National house polling, what you see is Republicans have a slight edge. They've made up a lot of ground since Dobbs versus Jackson, the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade happened. You're seeing sort of independents break towards Republicans, you're seeing both sides really trying to turn out their base. So you're in a situation where it's not surprising that Obama and Biden and these other people are going out and trying to increase turnout and trying to get those last swing voters because it's really anybody's game, especially in the Senate.",

And the real question is, are those same voters who can't be reached by polls? Are they going to turn out and swing the election in November?

That's what I was wondering during this week's jury selection for the Trump Organization tax fraud trial in Manhattan Supreme Court which took three days, 12 jurors were chosen.Two of the Trump payroll corporation defense lawyers will join me in just a moment to answer that question. Trump, himself, isn't personally charged in this case against his company, isn't expected to show up at the courthouse unlike his former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg who pleaded guilty and is expected to be the state's star witness. But just as he looms over the midterms, despite not being on the ballot, he can't help but be a specter in the courtroom. Question 29 on the juror questionnaire form got to the crux of it. Do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former President Donald J. Trump either positive or negative that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror? As lead prosecutor Susan Hoffinger told the court, \"If we were to strike every juror who had a negative opinion about Donald Trump, we wouldn't be able to get a jury at all.\" And you have to believe other prosecutors who may be considering prosecuting Trump himself, are closely watching this trial, this process. When Judge Juan Merchan first informed 130 potential jurors about details of this case, many waved their hands in the air to request private screening by the judge and lawyers about reasons they could not serve. More than half were then dismissed. One man was excused after saying Trump made him -- quote -- \"sick\" to his guts. Another was gone after calling Trump a demonstrative liar. One woman said, \"He's guilty until my mind whatever the case is -- anything he does, anything his corporation does.\" Of the 12 selected on Thursday, three, or a quarter, openly said they are not fans of the former president, but nevertheless they could be fair and impartial as jurors. The man who would become juror Number 8 said, \"Honestly, I used to think he was funny before he was president. Then he started acting a little crazy and narcissistic. That's the only reason I didn't like him as president -- not so much policy.\" Joining me now are two veteran Philadelphia lawyers working for the Trump Payroll Corporation defense team, William Brennan and Michael van der Veen, both of whom also represented Trump during his second impeachment with van der Veen taking the lead role, you'll remember him.

The whole book issues forth from that.And -- but another dimension of this is just simply, are you formulating your opinions from any kind of sort of rational foundation? And, by the way, the diversity of opinions in our culture is part of what enriches what it is to be American. I mean, if everyone -- here's what happened recently, I think -- I'm old enough to remember, if you'd express an opinion and then someone else would have an opinion. And say, oh, that's interesting, let's compare. And then you'd still go out for a beer after, right?",

If things got a little tense, he would say, that rock is from the moon. And they'd be, oh.It has a way of just sort of rebalancing and recalibrating. But your starting point for how -- whatever it was that made you disagree in the first place. And this book is just a celebration of ways to rethink all the forces that are dividing us. The tribalism that -- I mean, it feels like it's worse than ever before. Probably not, but it just feels that way. And what I want is everybody to read this before Thanksgiving dinner. Because that's when all the crazy aunts and uncles come in with all kinds of weird, wacky ideas about how the world works.
