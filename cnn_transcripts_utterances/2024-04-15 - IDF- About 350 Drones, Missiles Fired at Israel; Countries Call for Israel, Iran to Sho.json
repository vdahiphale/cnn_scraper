Nearly all were intercepted.The U.S. says it intercepted more than 80 drones and at least six missiles but insists it won't join any retaliatory strikes. Well, Israel's war cabinet has not decided on a response. A source tells CNN, the council is divided, but a call from the U.S. president convinced Israel's prime minister to delay retaliation, at least for now. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson joins us from Jerusalem. And Nic, we did hear from the Israeli president, speaking to CNN yesterday. What did he have to say?",

This is no small assault, whether or not it was, you know, well-telegraphed or not. This is no small assault on Israel and its security. And \"The FT\" writing today, Iran's assault in Israel was in effect, an attempt to re-establish the old rules of the game, as it were, this sort of shadow war, if you will that has been waged for so long. What do you make of Iran's position and its diplomatic reach out at this point to not just the region -- and that is important to Iran, having re-established its diplomatic ties, certainly around the Gulf. But it's a very vocal message to the international community and to the U.S., specifically. Do not get involved, because your bases are targets around this region, should you get involved.",

This is it for right now, as long as Israel doesn't respond. And President Biden has told Israel, but the fact that their -- their defenses were so effective to consider this a win. And Iran would like to see this as a win. And they were -- there was one civilian casualty in -- in all of this. Iran is -- was trying to, by its own accounting, telegraph what was coming, not -- not overstep, if you will, and trigger a red line, although inevitably in Israel's eyes, they -- they have been -- they have been seen to do that. But Iran wanted a set -- turn the tables on Israel and say, Israel, you cannot act against our interests, our senior commanders in the IRGC. You cannot strike our diplomatic offices around the world with impunity. We are telling you this is our deterrent. But Israel has always stood strong and convinced its enemies that it will use strong deterrence to deter them from acting again. So this -- so while Iran may be trying to sort of present this as it's done, there were no huge casualties, we've made our point, the point they've made is that Israel cannot or is now challenged to -- to re- establish its own deterrence. And Iran knows that that will put Israel potentially in bad standing with its allies. And it is not just -- what happened wasn't just a military event. It was a diplomatic event. It was a political event. It was a strategic event. And this tries to turn the tables on Israel militarily and -- and turn -- and put Israel in the corner with its allies, as we have seen with the United States. President Biden saying he will not join Israel in a strike back at Iran. Everyone's calling in this region for de-escalation, not just to Iran but Israel, as well.

As Israel considers, then, how to respond to Iran's attack, other countries in the region calling for restraint, as Nic said, on both sides. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry spoke with his counterparts in Iran and Israel on Sunday, warning any further escalation could destabilize the Middle East even more. The Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concerns over -- and I quote here -- \"any potential severe repercussions.\" In a social media post, the ministry called on the U.N. Security Council to step up and manage the situation, given the threat to international peace and security. It's that international peace and security which, of course, sits at the heart of the U.N. Security Council's mandate. Officials here in the UAE responded, as well. The ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement in the wake of the attacks, saying it \"called for resolving differences through dialogue and through diplomatic channels.\" To discuss this further I'm joined by Amjad Taha, author of \"The Deception of the Arab Spring.\" He's a political -- political strategist and analyst, as well as CEO of the Euro Post Agency. Amjad, it's good to have you. This is a climate where, as far as the UAE is concerned, there needs to be a real ratcheting up of diplomatic efforts and dialogue to ensure that this thing doesn't spiral out of control. You are well-versed in -- in the UAE's perspective on what is going on here around the Middle East. Just explain the view from the UAE, if you will. AMJAD TAHA, AUTHOR, \"THE DECEPTION OF THE ARAB SPRING\": Well, first of all, thank you for having me. I think the de-escalation is requested and is required. And the fact that, through dialogue and through diplomacy, there is a lot of challenges that can be overcome. That -- that is the pathology, and that is the path when it comes to UAE. But however, de-escalation, it's (ph) been understood that the United States of American need to get more involved in the Middle East. China is not the solution. India is not the solution. The United States of America has more solutions in -- to put on a table when it comes to the Middle East. The fact that, at one point, the United States of America decided by Biden administration to be away from the Middle East. I think it wasn't the best choice. So we need to be more into the Middle East, keeping an eye on the Middle East and bring more solutions when it comes to radicalism, and bring even more solution when it comes to the Iranian regime. I mean, the Iranian regime complaining about what happened between them and the Israelis when they -- when there was an attack next to their -- next to the embassy of Iran in Damascus. But then Iran also attacked the Saudi embassy. We all remember that. And Iran also attacked the Britain embassy. And we all understand -- and we didn't see Saudi declaring war, nor Britain declaring war on Iran. But the best solution here is that the United States America is the solution; one, to -- they can bring a lot on the table. The fact that they need to send a strong and firm message today, Iranian last night when they attacked Israel, we see in the Middle East almost they came together. And this -- the greatest message we heard, and it was very crystal clear. It was from Jordan, that our sovereignty is more important, that our nation is more important, that we've got to protect our nation. We've got to protect our borders. We've got to protect the right of defending ourselves. We -- there was a breach of international law when Iran launches its rockets from Iran, but it crosses all those countries. All those countries, they had to -- it was their aerospace. They had to stop their businesses and so on. And that is a war not on Israel, but in the whole Middle East. So what Iran wants to have a war on Israel, and when those rockets, they dropped in Jordan street, they dropped in Syria, they dropped in Iraq. All those countries were suffering from Iranian rockets, including a baby, a Bedouin Muslim Arab baby. As with a child seven years old, girl. And Israel, all the way there, she was targeted by a rocket. I don't think -- and I don't think anyone from our audience believed that baby had anything to do with any battlefield in the region.",

Absolutely.But when it comes to the Abrahamic Accord, if it wasn't for the Abrahamic Accord, we would have not been able to send tons of food, tons of aid to there, to the people of the Gaza. So because we utilize the Abrahamic Accord, we were able to build that humanitarian corridor. Yes, with all the charts that is happening, but there still -- there is a hope in the darkness we can be the light. That's one side. When it came to the G-20. And this is -- was, I think it was the main important thing that changed everything. In G-20, Biden administration put on the table, and they say that corridor from India, the economic corridor or the train of economy, let's call it, in the best way of putting it. That starts from India, comes through the Gulf, Saudi, UAE, and it goes all the way to Israel, passing Palestinian states itself. In the future, that would have meant the oldest nation on a strong nation. And also that Iran can no longer use hormones or use the red -- the Red Sea to -- to provoke nations or stop nations from trading, as they are doing, using the Red Sea and the homeless right now. That, to the Iranian, meant to put a stop for it. That's when the 7th of October happened. But the question is this. The fact that we went for the Abrahamic Accord, a lot of countries joined, and it was really hard. And, you know that. In the Middle East, for you to normalize with Israel is a really challenging thing to do. But we went and we did it, and it was a brave move from our leadership. The next step was from the United States of America, as Biden administration came into power, they didn't reward the Abrahamic Accord. In fact, they rewarded the Iranians, which is the other side, which is anti-Semite regime that does not support any peace. It was rewarded with 6 billion release of money that goes to the Iranian bank, in exchange for five American prisoners. And guess who took the wrong signal for that? Hamas. The thought, OK, we take 200 instead. That signal is not the best, and it might send the wrong signal to the alliance of the United States of America that it's not very reliable. We know it is, but it sends the wrong message, even if you -- if the Biden administration meant something else. But one thing we know, one of the main solutions for de-escalation, one of the main solutions for peace is a strong America and a strong, present America in the Middle East, not anywhere else.",
