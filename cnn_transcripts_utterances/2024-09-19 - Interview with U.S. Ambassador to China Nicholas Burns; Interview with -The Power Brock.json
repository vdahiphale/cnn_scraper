      "sentences": "-- Professor Francis Fukuyama tells Walter Isaacson why he thinks this year of global elections has been good for democracy.Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we begin in Lebanon, where the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has condemned the back-to-back attacks targeting the group's pagers and walkie- talkie communication system. In a speech, he said that all the red lines had been crossed. And he called the explosions massacres. They killed dozens and injured thousands of people. He also warned Israel that Hezbollah's forces on the border won't stop until the war in Gaza ends. At the same time, Israeli fighter jets screamed over the capital, Beirut, appearing to drop flares. And the IDF said it is striking targets in Lebanon. And all of this is raising concerns about an all-out war and raising those concerns to a new level, after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's warning yesterday that a new phase of this conflict is beginning. So, let's get the latest from Beirut now with Ben Wedeman. Ben, you've been, you know, covering this nonstop. What has been the highest point of tension today? What were those flights over Beirut, the capital, doing?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, they coincided with Nasrallah's speech. And, you know, first there was thatflyover where I was live and heard a roar and saw these Israeli jets flying right overhead, dropping flares, heat deflecting flares over the middle of Beirut. That's an obvious message, not a very subtle one. Sort of adding insult to injury after those two days of pager and walkie-talkie blasts. And then, just about 20 minutes after that, again, two Israeli planes flying over Beirut, twice breaking the sound barrier. It's not the first time that such events have coincided with Nasrallah's speech, but a very unsubtle message from the Israelis that this is what we can do. We can fly our warplanes right over where Hezbollah is headquartered in the southern suburbs of Beirut and not just drop flares, but drop much more. And it comes at a time, of course, of unprecedented tension. And I think over the last seven visits to Lebanon since this war began in Gaza, I think this is perhaps the most tense time of all. This is an escalation, the likes of which we haven't yet seen. Now, what was interesting in Nasrallah's speech, Christiane, is that he did concede that these pager and walkie-talkie blasts were an unprecedented major blow in terms of personnel as well as the Hezbollah's security, but he insisted that the group will continue to support Gaza in the form of firing upon targets within Israel. And he said the only way that they will stop, regardless of what Israel does, is when Israel stops its war in Gaza. Christiane.",

      "sentences": "No, we don't. And certainly, he was not very emphatic about Hezbollah's retaliation for this week's blast in Lebanon. Back in late Julyand early August, in the aftermath of the assassination of Fuad Shukr, that senior Hezbollah military commander, he was very emphatic that revenge is coming. There's no question about it. He put it in very definitive terms. This time he said there will be an accounting, but we will decide when and where that will happen. So, he looked tired. We know that Hezbollah has been rattled as a result of this week's events, that they are feeling perhaps more insecure and more vulnerable than they have in quite some time. You know, Hezbollah has always had a reputation as being a very tightly controlled organization, very disciplined, very able to sort of keep its secrets. And it prided itself that it has not been infiltrated, for instance, like Fatah, the Palestinian faction that operated in Gaza and is still in the West Bank. That there aren't a lot of traitors to Hezbollah among its ranks. Now, there are serious questions about how good they actually are at maintaining internal security. So, yes, Nasrallah was not his usual sort of, despite all events, somewhat jovial self. He's famous for his sense of humor. He often chuckles during his speech. This time he looked tired and he looked very concerned. Christiane.",

So, we have to negotiate lots of different, very important differences between the countries. I think that's systemic. I think that's with us to stay for many years to come. We do think that we've been able to stabilize our relationship somewhat because of the flurry of meetings that we've had. And frankly, our ability to create some communications channels at a very high level, President Biden and Xi Jinping, Secretary Tony Blinken, Secretary Janet Yellen have both been in China in recent months. And you referred to Jake Sullivan, our national security adviser. He and I had a series of meetings with the Chinese leadership, with President Xi, with the foreign minister, Wang Yi, with the senior PLA officer, General Zhang Youxia, and I think, you know, that builds in some predictability and an ability to communicate when there's tension and when there's disagreement that we did not have before. So, I would say we have a relatively more stable relationship with China, but it remains a difficult and competitive relationship.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, you know, we are in a very competitive situation with the Chinese leadership. We have a number of substantial agreements, notjust on tertiary issues, but really vital issues. So, it is normal and it is not just understandable, but necessary that we compete with China and that our allies join us in some of that competition. I'll just give you two examples. China is a major supporter of the Russian war effort in Ukraine. Thousands of Chinese companies have been exporting dual use materiel and technologies to the Russian war machine. It's strengthened the Russian defense industrial base. It allows Russia to fire those missiles into apartment buildings to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians. So, we have a real problem with that. And we've been sanctioning Chinese companies that are helping the Russians. And this is a major disagreement between us. And frankly, for the European allies. Also, a major disagreement, you've heard from the NATO and E.U. countries. So, we make no apologies about the need to compete on that level. The second issue, Christiane, that I referred to before is the fact that China is now manufacturing two to three times beyond domestic demand in China in lithium batteries, in electric vehicles, in solar panels, and dumping those products below the cost of production into Europe, into Latin America, into countries like Turkey, and trying to the United States. And so, you have tariff barriers going up, not just from the United States, and we've certainly imposed tariff barriers, 100 percent, on Chinese electric vehicles. But Turkey, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Chile have all imposed tariff barriers on China because of this worldwide Chinese flooding of the zone with artificially low price products. That's a very serious disagreement. But beyond the competition, Christiane, this gets to the heart of your question, we're going to compete because we're structural competitors economically and militarily, I think, for the next decade or more, but we also want to make sure that we drive down the probability of any conflict with China. That gets to the importance of our military leaders meeting, and we've made some progress in that score. It gets to the importance of Jake Sullivan visiting and spending three days with us in Beijing a couple of weeks ago, and the real importance of President Biden maintaining an ability to work with President Xi Jinping. Obviously, the United States wants a peaceful relationship with China. We don't want to see a situation where we get close to a conflict, and so we take great care to do that. And this all -- the competitive part of it and the engagement part of it make up a very complicated relationship between us and the Chinese.",

And so, we are continuously cautioning the Chinese leadership about making sure that they do not use force to try to resolve the cross straight differences. We think that China should commit itself to a peaceful resolution of that dispute. And frankly -- and thankfully, we're not alone in this. You've seen a very assertive position of the government of Japan, the government of the Philippines, the government of the Republic of China -- of Korea, excuse me, and also, the European leadership and members of the European parliaments and national parliaments traveling to this part of the world to make that point. China asserts the right to use force. We don't think that's just and we don't think that's smart. And so, what we're trying to do is two things, convince China to resolve the cross-strait differences peacefully, and that's been the American position., Christiane, going back to Richard Nixon's trip here in 1972. And obviously, provide for a stronger deterrent in Taiwan. That's our legal obligation under the Taiwan Relations Act. And we're doing both things at once. But I think, frankly, there needs to be international pressure on China for a peaceful resolution of the dispute.",

We're watching carefully to make sure that that does not happen. A second part of the answer, Christiane, is I think the Chinese, at least in terms of what they say publicly, have been somewhat restrained about involving themselves in our election. I think they know that there's -- there is a bipartisan consensus. I'm in D.C. this week, Washington, and I've been up on Capitol Hill talking to the Senate leadership, I've been talking to our cabinet secretaries. There is large-scale Democrat and Republican agreement on the need for us to have a very tough-minded, competitive policy with China, but also, on the engagement side, to make sure that we're talking to the Chinese about climate change. John Podesta was just over in Beijing with me two weeks ago, our climate negotiator. We're trying to work on the fentanyl crisis here in the United States and getting some help from the Chinese government in doing that. We obviously want to work on global health issues together. So, this is a relationship that's incredibly complicated. On the one hand, we have high competition between the two governments. On the other hand, we're the two largest economies in the world. We have to work together on issues like climate. And I think that's part and parcel of what we're doing with. We -- the Chinese are intensely interested in what happens in America on November 5th. But we're warning them not to get involved and not to cross a line. And that's a very serious warning indeed.",

I -- that's exactly what I've been saying to Chinese leaders privately and whatI've been saying on social media in China publicly. We're a strong democracy. The United States is going to get through these hurdles and don't count us out. I think there's been a tradition over the last couple of years in China to say the east is rising and the west is falling. They've discounted us. We've seen a very energetic United States, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia. President Biden's going to be hosting the quad leaders, the Indian, Japanese, and Australian leaders in Delaware this Saturday. And so, I think the Chinese would make a big mistake if they somehow looked at a normal election, or perhaps a highly spirited election in the United States with great divisions in the country, and conclude that somehow the United States is weak.

And so, China's trying to dump these products unfairly and illegally below the cost of production on the rest of the world, and we're not going to let a second China shock to envelop the United States economy and society.

And Bob Caro feels, and I think my father agrees, that unless the sentences are as compelling and riveting as possible, no one will read the books and no one will care.

And because Kennedy was pushing civil rights, they were really stopping his whole legislative agenda. So, four days after Johnson is going to -- after the assassination, Johnson has to give a speech to the Joint Session of Congress. He's not even in the Oval Office yet. He's still living in his private home. He's upstairs sleeping, and down in the kitchen, four of his speechwriters and advisers are working on the speech he has to give to Congress. Somewhere around midnight, Lyndon Johnson comes downstairs and basically says, how are we doing? And they say, well, we haven't gotten agreement on a lot of things. The only thing we're really agreed on, you must not make civil rights a priority, like Kennedy did. If you do that, the southerners are going to stop your whole legislative agenda. It's a noble cause, but it's a lost cause. Don't fight for it. And Lyndon Johnson says, well, what's a presidency for them? And in his speech, he says, our first priority must be to pass John Kennedy's civil rights bill. A thrilling thing to me.

The year of elections really started off with the Polish election last -- at the end of 2023. This right-wing party, the, you know, Law and Justice Party had been ruling Poland for eight years up to that point. They looked pretty invincible and the more liberal opposition was very fractured, but they managed to create a coalition. They campaigned together, and as a result they managed to win a majority and really set the right-wing party back.

I think people appreciate democracy the most when they have to live under dictatorships. And the memory of that was already fading in many parts of the world. I think that also people that supported liberal democracy made a number of mistakes. You had a kind of extreme form of capitalism that created a lot of inequalities that left a lot of working-class people behind in in the rich world.

You know, you can, in a sense, say who's anAmerican by who's allowed to vote in -- as a citizen in this country. At the beginning of the American Republic, it was only white men with property. We fought a civil war that theoretically gave African Americans the right to vote, but that was unfortunately taken away from them for the next 100 years under Jim Crow and segregation. And so, it wasn't until really the civil rights era that they were, you know, really allowed to participate politically. Women were not allowed to be full citizens until the 1920s. And so, you know, the definition of who's an American became the civic understanding of an American is anyone who believes in American law, ideas, principles, a Declaration of Independence, and it doesn't matter what their skin color is, or their national origin. And I think that that was a huge achievement that America got to very painfully through a lot of struggle and blood, sweat, and tears by the time of the civil rights era. That's the moment when my father told me that I was simply an American, and I didn't need to worry about where my ancestors came from. And I think what J. D. Vance is doing is basically moving us backwards to before that period in the 1960s, where it did matter who your parents were and what they looked like and, you know, what's your ancestry was. He explicitly said that, you know, it's not just about ideas, that not just anyone can be an American, that you somehow have to be, you know, kind of embedded in the country for generations before you really qualify, and I think that's a very dangerous idea that's going to exclude a whole lot of people, you know, like myself that, you know, didn't have ancestors that came over on the Mayflower.",
