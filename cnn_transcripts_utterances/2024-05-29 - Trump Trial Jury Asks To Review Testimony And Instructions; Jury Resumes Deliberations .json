They're looking at it from a more or less chronological perspective and they're taking a systematic approach.And the thing that they asked about that I think is most important is this August 2015 meeting that happens at Trump Tower. The D.A. yesterday said essentially, this is where the conspiracy started, the participants in this meeting, three key players, Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, and David Pecker. And here's the crucial part of David Pecker's testimony that I think the judge should read back if he's responding accurately to the request tomorrow when the jury comes back in. Here's what David Pecker said. At that meeting, Donald Trump and Michael, meaning Michael Cohen, they asked me what can I do and what my magazines, meaning the National Enquirer, could do to help the campaign. So, thinking about it, as I did previously, I said what I would do is I would run or publish positive stories about Mr. Trump, and I would publish negative stories about his opponents. And I said that I would also be the eyes and ears of your dash. I said I would be your eyes and ears because I know that the Trump organization had a very small staff. So, eyes and ears is a crucial phrase that the prosecution really stressed to the jury. Clearly they want to go back to this crucial testimony and incorporate it into their deliberations.",

You've seen others messaging and echoing that this is a witch hunt and calling into question the entire process itself.So, what he's doing is laying the groundwork because this is out of his control. He does not know where the jury is going to come down. There's a very real chance he could be convicted. So he needs his outside allies out there convincing the public that there was something untoward here, he wasn't treated properly. I suspect that regardless of the outcome, you're going to hear a lot of anger from Donald Trump. We've seen that when he's gone out and spoken in these little press conferences. Even if it were to be a hung jury or an acquittal, which seems unlikely, I think he's still going to rail against the judge in the process and try to use that to rally his base.",

They asked for a read-back of David Pecker's testimony about a June 2016 meeting. Now, David Pecker is in a meeting with an investor and he essentially gets pulled out because Donald Trump has called him. And this is right in the heart of the election campaign season leading up to 2016. And here's how that testimony went.And, again, I believe this is what the judge will read to the jury tomorrow. Steinglass, the ADA, asks David Pecker, and could you tell us about the conversation you had that day with Donald Trump? Now, Pecker's response, yes. When I got on the phone, Mr. Trump said to me, I spoke to Michael, meaning Michael Cohen. Karen, meaning Karen McDougal, her allegations are starting to surface now. Karen is a nice girl. Is it true that a Mexican group is looking to buy her story for $8 million? I said, I absolutely don't believe that there's a Mexican group out there to buy a story for $8 million. And then he, meaning Trump, he said, what do you think I should do? I said, I think you should buy the story and take it off the market. So, again, this is the evolution of catch and kill that the D.A. tried to lay out for the jury, that leads up to the next incident, which is Stormy Daniels.",

They're being meticulous.And I think it was very noteworthy, by the way, that the judge gave this instruction about you cannot base your decision purely on Michael Cohen's testimony.

I think we can take comfort from the fact that the jury seems to be getting along well. That's what you want for good faith and proper and appropriate deliberation. I also think it's a good sign that they're asking questions. Jury notes or something that show that the jury is thinking about the evidence, is thinking about the facts are going methodically through things. Maybe they're going chronologically. Maybe they've already made a decision about the falsification of documents and they're going straight to the other issue, which is whether or not this was in furtherance of some other crime, like an election crime. So, it's hard to tell.It is not unusual for jurors to ask about the law, the legal instructions that were given by the judge. As other guests have pointed out, I agree with those who have said that it's rather anachronistic for this judge under New York law, not permitted to, but not sending the jury instructions back with the jury in the jury room. They have a laptop that does not have internet access that allows them to look at every exhibit in the case. And they can get read-backs of the testimony, but they can't have the jury instructions. And I think it's a good sign that they are taking seriously the idea that they're supposed to sift through the evidence and also take seriously the instructions of law given by the judge, which can be somewhat confusing and arcane. So, I think it's all good and not uncommon at all.",

And maybe another juror said, well, it doesn't just rest on Michael Cohen's shoulders, as the prosecutor said. There's very devastating and important testimony from David Pecker. Let's hear that again. Let's get some of that back in our memories. Remember, they had a week off from trial and David Pecker testified some weeks ago, so it's not fresh in their minds.So, it's impossible to know exactly why, but I think the prosecution is probably feeling better about that note and that question than the defense right now.",

The president looking to take a more aggressive approach to Trump's legal troubles after largely steering clear of the subject.For more on that, I want to bring in the principal deputy campaign manager for the Biden-Harris campaign, Quentin Fulks. Quentin, thanks so much for joining us. As I mentioned, President Biden has largely avoided any direct mention of Trump's criminal trial, so why is he now considering changing tactics? QUENTIN FULKS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER, BIDEN-HARRIS 2024 CAMPAIGN: I don't think that that is true, Wolf. I don't think that we are considering changing tactics. I think our tactic has been what it's always been. We've been headstrong on the fact that we've got to defeat Donald Trump at the ballot box. And that's exactly what our campaign is doing. I just left the president. We just left Philadelphia where we launched Black Voters for Biden, a coalition to reengage African-American voters across this country. And the president laid out the promises that he made to them four years ago and the promises that he kept and he laid out the vision of two contrasting agendas for what America could look like, one where people can continue to pay 35 for insulin and one where Donald Trump can take it away, one where people can continue to expand on the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, or we can roll it back. Those are the two in the contrasting visions. President Biden made a lot of promises to African-American voters and voters across this country, and he has kept them, and particularly for African-American voters' record low unemployment, the lowest racial wealth gap packing the court with black women, more black justices on the court than all of the presidents combined. And that is what our campaign has been focused on. And we've been making sure that we're building an apparatus to be able to speak to voters wherever they are in their countries, in their own communities. And the contrast in the split screen that we see and where we see Donald Trump is while President Biden is out talking to voters in their communities, doing the work, putting it in, not taking any voters for granted. And that's our strategy and how we're going to respond to whatever verdict may come from --",

And so if that's where the media is and that's where they're covering, we're going to be there communicating. And that clip of Robert De Niro is circulating all over because the media is covering it, because they're standing outside the courtroom.

Joan, what exactly is Justice Alito saying? JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: Good to see you, Wolf. He wrote letters to congressional leaders and saying, bottom line, that he's not going to recuse himself from any cases that are tied to the January 6 attack at the Capitol, and he tried to explain exactly why those flags were flying at his home. And he says that when you look at his involvement, which he said really was non-existent, it was the involvement of his wife, Martha, and flying them. There's no reason why he should recuse. And let me break down the two flags. The first one was an inverted flag flying at the Alito home in northern Virginia. He said, I had nothing whatsoever to do it with the flying of that flag. I was not even aware of the upside down flag until it was called to my attention. As soon as I saw it, I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused. I have to say, Wolf, that in addition to his recusal, we got kind of a window into the Alito household with these messages. He did say that her -- her motivations were not related to the stop the steal. They were related to a response to a nasty confrontation she was having with neighbors. And then for the second flag that flew at their vacation home on the Jersey Shore, it bore the words, \"an appeal to heaven\". He said, he acknowledges that it flew for a period of time in summer of 2023. But again, he mentioned that it was Martha-Ann Alito doing it, and he said, in his letter to members of Congress, my wife is an independently minded private citizen. Our vacation home was purchased with money she inherited from her parents and it's titled in her name. It is a place away from Washington where she should be able to relax. And then he added, Wolf, again, you know, giving an insight into the family a bit. My wife is fond of flying flags. I am not. And then he went on to list all the variety of flag she has flown, you know, sports flags, state flags, flags of ancestors, religious flags, but his bottom line and what's relevant here is that he said, no reasonable person should conclude that he is impartiality would be questioned in these two cases that are tied to January 6 because he had nothing to do with these flags, Wolf. And that's I think he's hoping that that's -- this is the last he will have to confront the whole flag issue -- Wolf.",

And interestingly, Wolf, if this is a bomb that is carries a relatively small payload, about 37 pounds, which is consistent with what the Israeli military described these two munitions as carrying when they launched this attack. This is a bomb that's actually typically used to try and minimize civilian casualties. But as these experts noted, when it's used in a very densely packed populated area like this camp for displaced persons, that obviously raises the risk of more civilians dying.",
