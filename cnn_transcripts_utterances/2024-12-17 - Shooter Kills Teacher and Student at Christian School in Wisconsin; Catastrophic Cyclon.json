And so every school, I work with schools, is making its own calculation and not -- but the truth is none of them are perfect as we've seen at schools with police officers in the schools, you still have school shootings.Maybe they're stopped quicker but you still have fatalities. And schools with metal detectors, you still have fatalities because there's just too many open areas. And the problem is that that combination of trying to be defensive against an enemy that has the means to do so, whether it's a student, an outsider or parent or whoever, it is almost impossible to close all of the gaps that any school is going to have. And that's what we have to remember, is that they're schools. They're meant to be open. Right? I mean, it's like you can make a perfectly safe school and that would be have no students. And that's the challenge for these school districts. KINKADE: Yes, exactly. And this, of course, is the 83rd school shooting this year. The number of school shootings are rising every single year.

I don't know if those were authorized practices. She had some background in shooting. How she got the handgun is going to be a big question.

Donald Trump's transition team is blasting a ruling that his hush-money case should not be dismissed because of presidential immunity.New York Judge Juan Merchan says evidence that led to Trump's conviction was not related to his official conduct as president. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts. A jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts back in May for falsifying business records to cover up payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has still not been sentenced in that case. His legal team is expected to appeal Merchan's latest decision. Well, Donald Trump is promising once again to push for a deal to end the war in Ukraine. In his first news conference since his election, Trump wouldn't say if he expects Ukraine to give up territory in exchange for peace. He did say parts of Ukraine have been reduced to rubble, and there are no cities left for displaced people to return to. Trump also repeated a warning that all hostages held in Gaza must be released before his inauguration on January 20th.
