Because they were the trustees, Cohen said.Blanche confirms with Cohen that his e-mail signature after Trump took office announced his title in every message he sent. It always said personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump. Blanche continued, his job changed, meaning president jobs changed yours didn't. Cohen, correct, Cohen confirms. So, this is -- I suppose Elie, a fruit of the poison grape. I'm botching the metaphor, but the idea, like, you are saying that they are basing this entire thing on these memos, these bills, that's the documentary evidence that people like Lainey Davis have been saying, you don't have to support -- you don't have to believe Michael Cohen, believe these bills.

They allowed Todd Blanche to reveal this to the jury and get their star witness to concede that yes, he stole from the Trump Organization on the stand. Now, what Blanche is doing to follow up with this is go through all of the different legal services that Cohen was providing to Trump in the year 2017, including the fact that in his e-mail signature, it says that he is the attorney to President Donald J.

And, Alyse, I'm glad to have you in this moment, because as we're seeing the defense continue to cross-examine Michael Cohen about what he was paid and what he was paid for, right now, they're walking through the clients that Cohen had while Donald Trump was president of the United States, the money that he made off that.If you're a prosecutor sitting at that table listening to Michael Cohen say, yes, I did steal technically from the Trump Organization because I told him I paid someone $50,000, but I only paid them $20,000. What are you preparing to do when you have the chance to question your witness again? ALYSE ADAMSON, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: If this were my case, I would be feverishly writing my ideas for rehabilitation on redirect. I am quite frankly shocked by what I have just heard. I mean, I can tell you, having worked at DOJ for seven and a half years, you go through training, like your first week on the job and like day two, it's how to handle witnesses and fronting bad facts. And I was listening when they read back the transcript on how the prosecution handled these payments, and it's like they glossed over the fact that this could be considered stealing. And in my mind, I can't figure out why they did that because they were so meticulous in explaining all of Michael Cohen's other lies in contextualizing this. And this is a lie that cuts at the heart of the evidence in the case. And it just -- I can't really make sense of the strategy. So, you better bet that the prosecution is trying to pull together some questions to contextualize this and retake the narrative. They really have to at this point.",

Well, I think all the documentary evidence is going to have to be used as corroboration. That is what they're going to have to hang their hat on at the end of the day. You can't just believe Michael Cohen, but believe what these documents are saying. But that's also why Todd Blanche is now raising all of this confusion with the documents.

I'm thinking about that phone call. There -- again, there's ways to contextualize that phone call with Schiller and what they were talking about. You know, life doesn't -- isn't always clean. Life doesn't always make a linear narrative. He could have been talking about multiple other things. So, I think you can expect to see the prosecution go back there.

So, a week ago, Monday, May 13th, Susan Hoffinger with the prosecution did get out from Michael Cohen that he pocketed some of the money, but it was done so in such a way that I think a lot of people completely missed it, certainly me. And it was done so in a way that was not hammered home to the jury.And I'm not going to read the entire thing but this -- in the testimony about Michael Cohen paying back Red Finch, this organization that did these shady things for the Trump campaign, such as, bogus spectators at his announcement and bogus online polls that they goosed. He said, Hoffinger, did you pay him the full $50,000? That was Hoffinger. And given that you didn't pay him the whole $50,000, why did you put $50,000 down on there on the bill? Cohen, well, for the previous year and a half I told Allen, meaning Allen Weisselberg, the CFO, look, I laid it out. My hope was to get the money from Allen onto it so that I can give it to him, but it never happened. But I constantly reminded him because I did want him, you know, to receive the funds. Hoffinger, did you pay Red Finch less than $50,000? Cohen, I did. Hoffinger, OK, and why did you then ask for $50,000 back? She's asking, why did you ask for 50 grand back if you paid them less than $50,000? Cohen, because that's what was owed and I didn't feel Mr. Trump deserved the benefit of the difference. Hoffinger, and if you were going to get $50,000 but you paid out less than $50,000, were you going to keep the rest of it yourself? Cohen, that's what I ended up doing. But that's it. And I have to say she does not -- Susan Hoffinger, in this direct testimony, she does not underline, Laura Coates, you did this, and that's larceny, that's illegal. And so, we should note that some of this memo includes an inflated bill, but we should not use that to discount the rest of it. She didn't connect the dots, and she didn't, like, explain to the jury this is a crime that you're confessing to.",

You want to go through ad nauseum all the reasons why you're fronting why this is not somebody that has been a truth teller his entire life or the organization.They went to such great pain to talk about his criminal convictions and his lies in the past. Frankly, Todd Blanche also did on day one and two. Now, we're in day three of cross-examination. But not to front it when it goes to the very core of the matter. This is not the typical lie that suggests, so, you have lied to the media, right? You have lied to the press in the past. You have lied about whether or not the payment was made and all these different things. Now, this goes to a very simple question that Todd Blanche could actually say and really wrap his case on and say, so just to be clear, Donald Trump had no idea that you were giving him fake invoices with inflated payments to actually repay him? No. Well, then you leave it there and the jury can then in summation have it. So -- because this is straight, he didn't know about falsified records and invoices. He wasn't aware of this. All you have to support is he approved and he's admitted to you that he didn't even give him accurate invoices, that can leave more than maybe a seed of reasonable doubt, which is really what he needs. Now, the prosecution has got to try to rehabilitate. They have got to try to say something. They've got to rehabilitate their own credibility as to why they did not front it and why they seem to be at least seemingly dismissive.
