      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We have a lot to get to this morning, but I wanted to start with this. Voting is very much underway across several states, from Connecticut to California. More than 5 million ballots have already been cast. And this morning in Georgia, key battleground state that could decide the 2024 election, people are shattering early voting records with more than 309,000 ballots cast on the first day alone in Georgia. That's more than double the first day turnout in 2020. And Georgia is giving us an early glimpse that Americans trust the election process on our making their voices heard. They're also voting in Pennsylvania, a place that's a top priority for both campaigns in these final three weeks, Donald Trump has been campaigning there. He's going to be there as well in the coming days, and his running mate, J.D. Vance, will be there this afternoon, so will Vice President Kamala Harris, as she tries to rally support in a race that is too close to call. Take a look at this, the latest CNN poll of polls from Pennsylvania shows a virtual tie with no clear leader. And I've just confirmed with the Harris campaign that she plans to amp up the fiery attacks on what the vice president sees as Trump's threat to democracy, including his latest comments on the enemy within and using the military, National Guard to go after what he deems to be his political opposition. And joining us now is Pennsylvania State Senator Sharif Street. He's also chair of the state's Democratic Party. And, Senator, I do want to talk to you about all of this. As you know, the vice president has really gone after Trump's tone, this rhetoric that he's been using, describing him as a threat to democracy, a threat to the country. What's your sense of that? Is that something that you would like to hear more of? STATE SEN. SHARIF STREET (D-PA):  Well, look, I mean, it's true. If you attack -- you can't attack -- you can't have January 6th, you incite a riot, you incite an insurrection and then say you're a partner of democracy. It also means he can't say that you're supportive of law enforcement when he stood there and watched and encouraged law enforcement officers to be attacked. I think we got to remember that he has undermined democracy, but he's also done so many other terrible things.",

There are people who are concerned about his national sales tax that he wants to advance and recognize that that's going to make prices worse. And there are other people that are just concerned that he will undermine democracy as a whole and his refusing to accept a peaceful transition of power.So, I think different voters have different reasons, but most, but what I am seeing is there is an encouragement, there is a movement towards Vice President Harris, who people realize is trying to bring people together, and is going to try and govern, and is going to govern responsibly.",

And so there are people who want to be critical no matter what she says.That being said, I think the important part is that Vice President Harris has a message about creating 3 million new houses to address the housing crisis. Vice President Harris has an economic plan to create jobs. Vice President Harris wants to make sure that we keep our communities safe. And Vice President Harris has a proven track record of delivering for people. And I think that's what we've got to focus on. Not so much about, you know, whether or she's scripted or not.

The one thing I would point out, one of the rumors four years ago was that people are hacking into the system. Well, you know, polls are not connected by internet to anything. At the polling place, when you make your vote, you put it into machine that goes into a thumb drive. That goes down to the counting center here in Allegheny County in Pittsburgh, never touches the internet. The same with your mail, never touches the internet.

What's interesting here to me, Jim, is that Trump acknowledged the fact- check. He said, They say it's over a longer period. No, it's under them. No, it's not under them. It's over a period of decades.Who is the they who say that it's actually over decades? Well, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement debunking these false claims from Trump and others saying the data in this letter is being misinterpreted. The data goes back decades. It includes individuals who enter the country over the past 40 years or more. They added, it also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or currently incarcerated by federal, state or local law enforcement partners. In other words, not only did all of these people not come in under Biden-Harris, many of them are in jail or prison serving their sentences for those crimes. Now, why are the other ones -- why have the other ones not been deported? Well, in some cases, after someone has served their sentence and been issued a deportation order, say if they're from a country like Russia, which simply won't accept deportations from the U.S., under a 2001 Supreme Court decision, the U.S. has to release those people from immigration detention after about six months.",

He has said that he would impose family separation yet again. And family separation is one of the darkest stains in our history. It is one of the most vile, disgusting, despicable, evil events that has happened, imposed on us and brought to us by one Donald Trump. He has absolutely no plan to undo it, to not do it again. He created a whole generation of kids without parents, without families, of orphans. The Biden-Harris campaign had to come in and reunite thousands of families.

And they specifically separated children from their parents as a way to sort of send the message across the border that if you bring your families across, this could happen to you. And it resulted in a lot of families being separated. And it's taken up until now, I think there are still some families that remain separated, and they have not been able to reunite all of these families. It's been a long and arduous process.But let me ask you, Maria, I do wonder, I mean, it sounds as though what the Harris campaign is trying to do is remind Latinos of something that occurred during the Trump administration, something that could come back if he's back in office, perhaps to address some of these poll numbers that do show that some Latino voters have drifted towards Trump in recent weeks.
