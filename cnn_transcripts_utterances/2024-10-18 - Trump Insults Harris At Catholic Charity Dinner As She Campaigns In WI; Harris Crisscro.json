Look, I think there's no question that Donald Trump and his campaign recognizes that they need to make inroads with women voters, particularly as they acknowledge that widening gender gap with Vice President Kamala Harris.Earlier this week, of course, he did a \"Fox News\" town hall with an all women audience. So this is really where some of that is coming from. And I think to take a step back, it's very clear that both campaigns are trying to really, no, gain support from some of these core demographics, not just women voters, but also black men, Hispanic voters. They recognize that this race, this election, is going to be incredibly close, and really this could be one on the margin. So that's where a lot of this rhetoric is coming from. I do want to note that we actually have some new reporting that the Trump campaign and Nikki Haley are in talks to potentially meet, or, excuse me, appear together on the campaign trail. Nothing has been finalized, I'm told. But they are in discussions to do that. So I keep an eye out for that. But I also, Erica, want to turn your attention to some of what we heard Donald Trump say last night at the Al Smith dinner. Of course, kind of a political or a moment for a lot of political presidential candidates to appear at this dinner, Donald Trump spoke, he tried to land a number of political jokes to a lot of laughs, I should say, from what seemed like a pretty friendly crowd. But he also spent a lot of time airing his grievances, complaining about what he said was him being persecuted in the months after he had left the White House, or the years, I should say, since he had left the White House. And also he lobbed a series of personal attacks against Kamala Harris. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We have someone in the White House who can barely talk, barely put together two coherent sentences. He's a person that has nothing going, no intelligence whatsoever but enough about Kamala Harris. Let's get on to something. But unfortunately, Governor Walz isn't here himself. But don't worry, he'll say that he was. He's going to say he was.The only piece of advice I would have for her and the event that she wins would be not to let her husband, Doug, anywhere near the nannies. Chuck Schumer is here looking very glum. But look on the bright side, Chuck, considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president.

You can see here there's in the video, there's an Israeli tank which fires around into the building where we later learn is where Sinwar was hiding. DNA testing would confirm later on that the body found was in fact his. It marked an end to Israel's year-long manhunt for Sinwar. The final clash had begun moments earlier when he and two other militants shot at Israeli forces. When Sinwar were treated into a building Israel's military sent in this drone. You see the video that it captured, capturing Sinwar, who at that point had not yet been identified, but clearly wounded, sitting amid the rubble alone in a chair.He's holding a piece of wood, at one point, throws it at the drone. Sinwar's death, of course, has massive implications across the Middle East and for Israel's war in Gaza. President Biden this morning is calling for a return to diplomacy. CNN national security correspondent, Kylie Atwood, joining me now from the State Department. So Kylie, the President calling for this. We're hearing from Antony Blinken.

We know that is what they're saying publicly. We also know that that has been privately conveyed to Israeli officials.

We know Netanyahu said yesterday, this is a moment to secure, of course, the release of the hostages that are still in Israel. But he also said that the task before us is not complete. So it's not clear if Netanyahu is yet or if he will be on the same page as the Biden administration here.This is why the next two days here are incredibly critical. Biden said that he would be sending Secretary of State, Antony Blinken to Israel, so we'll be watching those conversations incredibly closely. Erica? HILL: Yes. Absolutely. Kylie, appreciate it. Thank you. Let's continue the conversation now with CNN global affairs analyst, Mark Esper, who, of course, served as Defense Secretary under President Trump. It's good to have you with us today.

There have been reports in polling that maybe that -- that their support has fallen as -- as Sinwar has taken them deeper into the conflict, has been unyielding in terms of striking some type of deal. So I would look to see what's happening there with the people.Next will be is who does Hamas pick to lead them militarily and political -- politically. I think folks think that Sinwar's brother, Mohammad, who is in Gaza, might lead them on the military side within Gaza. But importantly, more importantly, maybe, is who will lead them politically. And they think it'll be more of a moderate who is based in Qatar, who might be willing to come -- come -- strike some type of deal with the Netanyahu government. So to me, that is really the most important. Next step is who will lead Hamas. And then we need to see, will Bibi Netanyahu set out his vision of the future? Is it a -- a -- a Gaza controlled by Israel, which some on the far right want a reoccupation? Is it something where the Arab states come in and provide governance and security and what not? Or is there some other technical out there?",

And he was trying to move to another location, unknown. But it's just remarkable and how it came about, and the footage that you're showing with regard to the drone that spotted him is just another indication of what the future of warfare looks like, not just in Israel, but we're seeing the same type of scenes play out in Ukraine as well.

Even though a week ago we could -- there were some murmurs that -- that Hezbollah was going to delink from any type of agreement. So I -- I think at this point, Hezbollah, of course, is another Iranian proxy group that's been decapitated and on its heels. I think Israel is going to go in. They're going to try and push back Hezbollah out of southern Lebanon.And my sense would be an outcome would be a restoration of U.N. resolution 1701, which says Hezbollah has to go back to the Litani River, 18 miles north. There have to be some type of peacekeeping in there that keeps them out of there once and for all. But they may have greater ambitions. Israel may have greater ambitions now that -- now that what's happening with -- in Hamas -- with Hamas, Hezbollah in Iran, we should see that attack happen -- counter attack with Iran happen I think in the next few days.
