They beat defending champions France on a penalty shootout netting Argentine soccer legend, Leonel Messi his first World Cup title. In Argentina, there was sheer euphoria as large crowds partied in the streets, of course in France, a disappointment despite a stunning comeback led by superstar Mbappe.

Well, Elon Musk gave Twitter users a chance to weigh in on his future as a social media company. But he may not be happy with the result that Tesla and SpaceX founder tweeted earlier. Should I step down as the head of Twitter? He promised to honor the result, however unscientific the poll might be. Well, the answer is yes. More than 17 million votes were cast, and 57 percent of respondents want him to step down. Well, so far, his short tenure has been filled with chaos and controversy. CNN's senior media reporter Oliver Darcy joins us now from New York. Good to see you, Oliver.

But if he actually does abide by this poll, it seems he's going to have to step down. I think we should note, though, that he has already, you know, last month suggested that he was going to find someone else to run -- to run Twitter. And that's because he really needs to refocus his energy over at Tesla. Tesla shares have been down quite a bit since he took over as Twitter CEO. And that's largely because investors are losing confidence, I think that he is focusing all his energy on Twitter. He's sleeping over the Twitter offices. He's not sleeping over at the Tesla offices.

Federal prosecutors from New York have charge Bankman-Fried with eight counts of fraud and conspiracy in the United States. CNN's Kara Scannell is following the story and joins us live from New York.

But what we do know is that he was arrested last Monday in the Bahamas, on these U.S. charges, eight federal charges, serious charges including wire fraud and conspiracy where prosecutors say he stole billions of dollars from his customers and used it to buy real estate, to make other investments and to make political donations. So, he appeared in The Bahamas court last Tuesday. There his lawyer said that they would fight extradition, but that they were also going to be reviewing their legal options. Now since then, Bankman-Fried has been held in a Bahamian prison, it's known as Fox Hill. It has a notorious reputation. A U.S. State Department report found that there was a lack of access to nutritious meals, that the conditions were bad where inmates were sometimes sleeping on the floors in the cells because there weren't enough beds. And also, that some of the cells were rat infested and infested with maggots and other insects. So not a pleasant place to be. He was not expected to be back in court on this case until February 8th. So that's quite a long time from now. And it's not clear, though, if how much of that factored into this or if there were other some kind of behind-the-scenes negotiations with U.S. authorities. But by agreeing to appear today in court to waive his extradition as a source familiar with the matter told me, it will -- it will expedite this process, expedition fights -- extradition fights, excuse me can carry on for weeks or months, sometimes even a year. So, this will speed things up. So, after this court appearance today, assuming that there is no hitch, he is expected to return to the U.S. fairly quickly. He will appear in a federal court in New York, face a judge, perhaps enter a plea if they decide to do the arraignment, but also have a discussion about bail and whether he will be held in custody or if he will be released on some sort of bail and bond.

He'salso facing one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud -- excuse me, money laundering, that also has a maximum of 20 years. And some of the conspiracy counts have a maximum of five years. Now, in the U.S., that's the maximum. Judges usually don't sentence that level. But what can really influence the judge's decision when it comes to sentencing and this is down the road of assuming he either were to plead guilty or be convicted. They take into account the value and here we're talking about billions of dollars. So that certainly puts a heavy hand on the scale in terms of what his potential exposure could be. In, you know, as we've seen in past cases with Bernie Madoff, which a lot of people draw comparisons too, made off had pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi scheme. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison, he died recently behind bars. Of course, you know, not to get too far ahead of ourselves. He still has to appear in court. He has to, you know, make a decision about whether he's going to fight these charges, but these are certainly very serious charges that he's facing, Lynda.",

Essentially, anybody arriving in the U.K. through illegal means, namely arriving in small boats off the coast of Dover from Northern France could face potential deportation to Rwanda and they will have their asylum claims heard there. Now the government has backed this for months now. We've seen this being championed by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, by Liz Truss. And now of course, by Rishi Sunak, the new Home Secretary Suella Braverman describing those arrivals on Britain's coasts as an invasion. And of course, she's also previously said that we can't describe these asylum seekers as being mostly refugees. But this stands in contrast to the government's own figures of a huge and overwhelming figure showing that those arriving on British shores are quite often deemed to be those in desperate need of humanitarian protection, genuine refugees, but this ruling could set the pretext essentially for the government to push ahead with its plan to deport tens of thousands of asylum seekers deemed have arrived in the U.K. illegally to Rwanda. And we were able to speak to one of those who is potentially facing the threat of being deported to Rwanda. Take a look.

And so, this is the list of people that they believe should be held criminally responsible for what happened on January 6. They will make these recommendations to the Justice Department. And from our reporting we know that at the top of that list will be former President Trump who is expected to be recommended for at least three different crimes. Now we know the lawmakers have been considering potential referrals for other individuals. But it's unclear if those people will be referred to today or at all. And the impact of this is look, it's largely symbolic. The Justice Department is already investigating the former president and his associates for their roles in January 6th. That has been handed off to Special Counsel Jack Smith. So, there's no guarantee that just because they made this referral, that there'll be an indictment or that anything really changes in this investigation. The second thing that will happen today is that the committee will vote to approve its final report. We're going to get a summary of that report detailing everything they've uncovered in this investigation later today.

She came from Ecuador with her husband. They've been traveling for 30 days. LAVANDERA (voice over): She says the journey was brutal. Sarah Romero (ph) like almost every migrant we've spoken with, says they were kidnapped and held for days in Mexico until they paid their way out. But they arrive at an uncertain time and the chance of winning asylum in the U.S. is far from guaranteed. LAVANDERA (on camera): Are you worried that you're going to be deported? She said they're looking for anything, they would like to either request asylum or a humanitarian visa, just something that would let them be able to work and earn some sort of living. LAVANDERA (voice over): Romero is one of the thousands who entered El Paso in the days leading up to the expected end of the public health policy known as Title 42, which allowed U.S. border officials to expel migrants nearly 2.5 million times since 2020. LAVANDERA (on camera): So here on the edge of the Rio Grande in Juarez, Mexico, not everyone is trying to cross over. The people you see kind of standing behind me, they don't want to cross just yet. They're waiting for Title 42 to be lifted, because they're worried if they crossed now, they will be deported. LAVANDERA (voice over): Some are sleeping under the cover of this carwash, and many are embarrassed shelters like this one called the Hope Center where more than 100 people sleep on these floors every night. Kelly Perez (ph) and her husband have waited here two months. Waiting to decide when to cross into the U.S. LAVANDERA (on camera): Where are you waiting to cross? They're waiting to cross because we've heard so many other Venezuelans who have been deported. And they don't want to -- they don't want that to happen. So, they're waiting for Title 42 to get lifted, to see how things play out and then they'll decide whether or not they're going to try to enter the United States.",
