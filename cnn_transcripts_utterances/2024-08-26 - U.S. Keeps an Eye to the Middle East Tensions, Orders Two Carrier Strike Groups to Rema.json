The U.S. defense chief has ordered two carrier strike groups to remain in the region and informed his Israeli counterpart of the decision.Meantime, on the ground, it appears Israel and Hezbollah want to avoid escalating the situation into a wider war. Hezbollah's chief says its attack on Israel in retaliation for the killing of a top military commander is done, but more strikes are possible in the future. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also vowing that this is not the end of the fighting. CNN's Jennifer Hansler has more on the situation in the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

A U.S. defense official said the U.S. provided intelligence to help Israel track oncoming Hezbollah attacks, but did not participate physically in those attacks.Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told his Israeli counterpart on Sunday that he would be keeping two major strike groups in the region to help deter a further war. The U.S. moved a number of assets to the region earlier this month to try to prevent Tehran and its proxies from launching a retaliatory attack against Israel. There are fears that such an attack could spark a wider regional war. At the same time, U.S. officials are pressing the urgency of getting a hostage and ceasefire deal across the finish line. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned earlier this week that this could be the last chance to get such a deal across the finish line. High-level talks continued in Cairo on Sunday and wrapped up without an apparent resolution. However, working-level talks are expected to continue this week. A U.S. official said the talks were constructive and conducted in good spirits towards trying to get an agreement. However, a number of gaps remain. U.S. officials hope that they are able to narrow those gaps in the coming days. Jennifer Hansler, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They say that they had intelligence which showed that Hezbollah was about to carry out these strikes and that is when they carried out what they called a pre- emptive strike, saying that about 100 fighter jets went across the border to take out some Hezbollah targets. Here's the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The Israeli army destroyed thousands of short-range rockets, all of which were intended to harm our civilians and forces in the Galilee. Additionally, the Israeli army intercepted all of the drones that Hezbollah launched at a strategic target in central Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It appears that more than 300 rockets, it says that it fired, were in order to try and occupy Israel's defense systems.And then they carried out drone attacks, as they say, on military installations. Now the IDF says that there was no damage to military bases in northern or central Israel. But we do hear from the Hezbollah side that they believe that this was a successful attack against Israel in response to that assassination of a top Hamas, excuse me, Hezbollah military commander at the end of last month. Now, as of now, it appears as though the tensions are simmering still, but they are not as high as they were over the weekend. There is a hope that this will be. the end of this latest flare-up between Israel and Lebanon, although we have heard from both the Hezbollah chief and also from the Israeli prime minister that this is not over. Nasrallah is saying he reserves the right to carry out more attacks if he believes that the damage was not sufficient to those Israeli military installations. So at this point the region is still on tenterhooks, but certainly it seems as though those tensions reduced somewhat from what we saw about 24 hours ago. Now as you say Rosemary, this does happen as those talks are continuing in Cairo for a hostage-ceasefire deal. The leaders we understand or the heads of the delegation are no longer involved at this level. It is the working level talks which will continue in Cairo in coming days. The U.S. for its part and the Biden administration say these talks have been constructive. But to be honest, that is the only side that we are hearing optimism from at this point. Rosemary?",
