We know, as I said, that the vast majority of Republicans will vote to keep McCarthy in place.But because there are enough that will vote to put him out, Democrats can join with them and actually remove him. One school of thought in the Democrats says the devil you know. McCarthy has been a very partisan speaker he wants impeachment inquiry into Biden without any hard evidence to justify it but at least you kind of understand who he is and now twice with the debt ceiling and with the government shutdown he has behaved in a generally responsible way building a bipartisan vote to avoid potentially catastrophic economic consequences. The other point of view of the Democratic party says, you know, puts the emphasis on the other part of the sense. McCarthy has been a deeply partisan speaker. He has generally conceded almost whatever the far-right wants, and that Democrats should not lift a finger to save him. Plus, there is certainly an understandable view among many Democrats that the more chaotic a Republican's management of the House becomes, the better it is for the Democrats' chances of winning it back in 2024. I really don't know what they are going to do. My instinct is that the White House will kind of fall on the devil you know side of the equation and that will probably lead to enough Democrats supporting him for him to survive but I wouldn't rule out the other possibility either.",

He's been able to convince Republican voters to see it in the way that he wants them to see it, as an attack on them through him.You know, they're going after you, but I'm just in the way, is what he says. It's a very different question what this might mean to a general election. You know, I think people are much too quick to write off the idea that this could be a significant burden for him if he is the Republican nominee. Americans are hesitant about re-electing Joe Biden. We see that about concerns about his age, about inflation. So it's not as if Donald Trump's legal troubles are a silver bullet for Democrats. But I think that many Republicans are been too quick to assume that because none of this is phasing Republican primary voters, that it will be equally indifferent for general election voters. When you have a candidate whose case for managing the economy is based on his business acumen. And his companies are being convicted of systematic fraud or judged to have committed systematic fraud.

I think the big issue is that it's a misunderstanding that some of the things that are happening in places like Ukraine don't impact, they think they don't impact the United States or its allies. And it's a very nationalistic, very USA-centric view of the world. And fortunately, we can't afford to have a USA-centric view of the world. We have to view the world as being something we're all interdependent to, where we're all working together for a certain goal.

We do not want to see this. We should have kept the lessons of 1945 from the end of World War II in mind when we are considering measures like this. And it becomes really important for us to look at this with a long lens of history, and with an idea of Putin's strategy. Putin's strategy is to divide and conquer. And if he divides us from our partners and is able to make something like this happen, where the Ukrainian aid is not passed to the Ukrainians, then it becomes much easier for Putin to move into areas of Europe, to gain influence in areas. We've already seen the results of the Slovak elections, for example, and that becomes a critical issue where NATO becomes frayed and then Putin has a much freer reign in Europe and that is something that we don't want to see and we really shouldn't see in the Europe of today.",

      "sentences": "Hey, good morning, Rosemary. Yeah, now comes the hard part of actually negotiating behind the scenes, horse trading, trying to figure out if Robert Fico can actually form a coalition government.He got the most votes, 23 percent of the votes, but it is entirely possible that when the dust settles on all of these negotiations that he's actually not the prime minister of Slovakia. It is customary, though, for him to get the first crack at forming government. You can see the results here. He'd actually not ruled out the possibility of working with the Republic Party, that's a far-right party, which shares his views on Ukraine and Russia. Remember Robert Fico said that it was Ukrainian Nazis and fascists that provoked Russia into war. But that party actually didn't get 5 percent, which is the threshold to actually get seats in parliament. There are seven parties that did. And so it is very likely that he needs more than one partner. The most likely scenario is that he pairs up with the Hlas party. That's an offshoot of his SMER party that broke away, but they share sort of similar values, and that party says, look, it's difficult to see how a coalition government could function without us, but he's likely going to need a partner in addition to the Halas party to actually make this work. Fico was also asked yesterday about his thoughts on Ukraine and Russia now that the election is over, and here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FICO (through translator): Slovakia and the people in Slovakia have bigger problems than Ukraine. We do not change anything about the fact that we are ready to help Ukraine humanitarianly. We are ready to help in the restoration of the state. But our opinion on arming Ukraine does not change.

This is one of the first holiday periods since the pandemic and also since the end of China's tough zero-COVID travel restrictions so, Yes, nearly 900 million trips are expected during this time.And according to China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, some 896 million domestic trips will take place. That's an increase of about 86 percent from the year before. And revenue from domestic tourism is expected to reach some $107 billion. Now trains are busier than ever, as you can see there on your screen, railway stations across China, you see scenes like this of the surge in domestic train travel. In fact, according to China Railway, some 190 million railway trips will be made during this travel rush. Around 20 million passenger trips are made on one day alone, on the first day of the holiday. Now, despite the surge in domestic travel, China's overall outbound travel market is still low compared to pre- pandemic levels. China's outbound international flight capacity is down around 50 percent. That's much lower than you compare to other countries and tickets are still very high. International flight fares are still much pricier compared to 2019. China's economy is in a tough spot right now. It's struggling to recover after the pandemic, after zero-COVID, so many consumers across the country are reluctant to splurge on expensive, pricey, overseas holidays. And so the Chinese consumers who are going abroad, they're opting for cheaper destinations, Asian destinations, which are closer to China, and also places like Thailand, which has become a top choice after Thailand introduced a visa-free policy for Chinese tourists. In fact, according to trip.com, we learned that hotel bookings to Thailand surged over 6,000 percent, compared to the previous year after that policy was announced. Pretty significant. Back to you.",

And a few places in Texas could end up having three or even four days in a row of record setting temperatures. But there will be an end to this heat in the next couple of days. And that's because it's going to shift farther to the east, really becoming more of a focus for the Great Lakes and the northeastern region of the country by the middle portion of this week.And at the same time, cooler temperatures will start to spread into the central U.S. And you can clearly see that on the multi-day forecast. Look at Sioux Falls going from a high of 92 on Monday, dropping back to 69 by the time we get to Wednesday. Similar for Minneapolis, topping out at 87 Monday, dropping back to 68 on Wednesday. Even farther south, like in Dallas, for example, looking at multiple days of temperatures in the 90s before dropping back into the 70s as we finish out the rest of the week. Cooler temperatures setting in, but also rain chances increasing as well. For the Northeast, temperatures will be on the rise. They won't necessarily be 15 to 20 degrees above average, like we're seeing in the central U.S., but still most of these places looking at least 5, if not even as much as 10 degrees above average. Take, for example, New York. Topping out at 81 on Tuesday, their average high this time of year is only 70. Philadelphia looking at highs both Tuesday and Wednesday in the low 80s, also 10 degrees above average. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And not that you'd really want to if you're the National Football League here in the United States, as they have seen sales significantly increase since last week's Taylor Swift appearance at the last game of the Kansas City Chiefs. For example, the Jerseys bearing the name of Travis Kelsey, those have been up about 400 percent in terms of the sales.There's also the ticket sales for Sunday night's game that according to TickPick, the online retailer of some of those tickets. Those sales up about 40 percent, according to them, they told CNN that they saw the most number of tickets sold in a single day for Kansas City Chiefs game this season. But you call it trailers, falsity, whatever you want to call it, this certainly marks a key cultural and business moment in the United States on Sunday though, for many of the fans of the New York Jets and the defending Super Bowl champs, the Kansas City Chiefs, all eyes were certainly on the football field.
