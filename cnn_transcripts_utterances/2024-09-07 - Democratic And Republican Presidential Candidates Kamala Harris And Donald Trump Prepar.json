Kamala Harris and Donald Trump face off Tuesday in their big debate. We're looking at every angle from what they need to do to win to changing the narrative. Can both candidates convince those still undecided voters they're not as extreme as their opponent says they are. And later, pencils down. The centuries old tradition your kids may soon say is old school. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, t-minus three days until Kamala Harris and Donald Trump meet for the first time and square off. Today, we're discussing their messages, the pitfalls they need to avoid, and the tactics they should use. And like any contest, the best indicator is looking at past performance.

So while, in general, the idea of Donald Trump and restraint going together does not seem like we should expect it, there's a chance he could hold it together.

She is part of an administration that has moved economic policy in the U.S. quite firmly and decisively to the left. She can try to use vague terminology. She can use vibes and joy. But the fact of the matter is that when it comes to those core bread and butter issues, the Biden-Harris administration passed the American Relief Plan which sparked an historic wave of inflation. That's a very, very tough record for her to run away from. She can try, she can try to course correct.

And how do you tackle that? And on the one hand, you have Donald Trump saying we're going to put in tariffs. Now, what tariffs are, are basically a tax on consumption. That raises prices for the people who consume and that hits hardest to the poorest members of our society. Wealthier people can afford to pay for it. Middle-class people and lower-income people can't. So his idea of just raising tariffs and raising tariffs, that's what his entire economic message was this past week, basically telling everyone he was going to raise tariffs, that's been roundly shown by most mainstream economists to be absolutely crazy.

They have tried to, at the last minute, change the parameters of the negotiations. You're seeing massive protests within Israel over this. Netanyahu knows that if elections were held today, he would be thrown out of office. If he has a ceasefire deal, his hard right, far right government would collapse. And so therefore, he has every incentive to keep this going for as long as possible. Also, he is a close ally of the right in this country, and I think most people believe that he would like to see a Trump administration come into power.

California passed a law recently recommending school districts assess the mental health impact of homework, especially in a post-COVID world. Some experts say decreasing students at home workload helps increase their social and emotional health. Add to that the A.I. impact, artificial intelligence helping kids cheat. Thirty- nine percent of students say it's OK to use A.I. to solve math problems, and 20 percent admit that those A.I. to write their essays. Reihan, where are you on no homework?",

But I think later on it is an important way to instill some discipline, instill some routine. My general view is the flipped classroom approach can work pretty well. That is do problem sets in the classroom when you have teachers around to help you with them. But then expect some reading and learning, maybe it's listening to a lecture, something like that when you're at home. Don't let that be totally idle time. But then be more thoughtful about how you use the guidance of a teacher or other adults who are around who can help out.",

They've really tried -- they've been trying to make an appeal to Jewish constituents. And the very fact that Tucker Carlson, a star the right who is very close to Trump, close with Vance, et cetera, has been making these very inflammatory -- platforming this very inflammatory person who basically says that Nazi death camps were just places where there was an oversupply of POWs who to happened to end up dead, is deeply problematic.
