The United States speeding added defenses to the region, preparing for the expected strike by Iran to be significant.Also this hour, Donald Trump is unleashing fresh attacks on Kamala Harris' record after making brazenly false claims that her huge crowds were faked. This, as Harris is gaining in pivotal battlegrounds, with the Democratic convention now only one week away. Plus, Trump is now asking for $100 million from the U.S. Justice Department, seeking alleged damages for the FBI's classified documents search at Mar-a-Lago. Stand by for details on the long shot bid and the likely political motive behind it. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv and you're in \"The Situation Room.\" We begin here in the Middle East as the Israeli and U.S. militaries are ramping up preparations for a possible revenge attack by Iran, a strike that potentially could happen at any time. CNN's Oren Liebermann is standing by for us over at the Pentagon, but first let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson. He's here with me in Tel Aviv. Nic, what's the latest on a potential retaliation strike from Iran on Israel?",

We've heard that the Iranian president today has had conversations with the British prime minister, the German chancellor, the Chinese foreign minister, and to all of them, Iranian media is reporting he has said that Iran has the right to respond and strike back at Israel.

They're rarely ever announced. And if they are, that in and of itself is a message.The U.S. publicly saying that the USS Georgia is headed to the region, that's very public signaling to Iran and its proxies that the U.S. effectively means business here, that the U.S. has very powerful forces in the region. And depending on what Iran chooses to do, the U.S. retains the option to use them. Wolf, it's worth noting this is not the first time we have seen the U.S. publicly announce the movement of a submarine during this war. Back in November, in early November, the U.S. very publicly moved the USS Florida, another cruise missile submarine, into the Middle East. Again, that then was a warning to Iran and its proxies about what they should choose to do. This is that same message delivered with a tremendous amount of other U.S. forces in the region as well.",

First, what I heard just in the last hour from at least four sources, two of them U.S. officials and two of them Israeli officials, the assessment is that this is not happening tonight. That's what I heard from both sides. They think it will still -- it might happen tomorrow, it might happen the day after, but it is not happening tonight.Another sign for that, President Biden's top Middle East advisor, Brett McGurk, is traveling to the region tonight to Cairo to start working or to continue working on the hostage deal, on the Gaza hostage deal. So, the U.S. is trying to say by that that, you know, business as usual, plans as usual, they're moving forward. And the next thing is that what I hear from both U.S. and Israeli officials is that they see two things. First, with Hezbollah, they see that Hezbollah's weapons systems, long-range missiles, are ready to fire at any minute and once Nasrallah will give the order, they can fire. On the Iranian side, extensive and significant steps on the ground in the drone units, in the missile units for a possible attack on Israel.",

But there's Hamas, and Hamas announced that they don't want another round of negotiations.And one of the interpretations of this statement is that Hamas and its leader, Yahya Sinwar, in Gaza, in the bunker, 100 feet under the ground in Gaza, is waiting for this Iranian attack and for a Hezbollah attack, hoping that after such an attack he can get better terms for the deal. So the possibility of an Iranian attack, of an attack by Hezbollah, will influence the talks in any case. So I think this is a very -- those two things are intertwined.",

And how much like Alayna was saying, this has really rattled Donald Trump. I mean, he's sort of reverted to some of his worst instincts and attacking Kamala Harris, you know, talking about her race and questioning sort of basic facts. And I think he was much more comfortable when he was running against Joe Biden, which I think is evidenced by the fact that he keeps sort of lamenting that Biden was forced out of the race, saying he wants to come back without any evidence.

Is she Indian or is she black? I mean, all these sideshows, these distractions are harming his campaign. The campaign is somewhat disciplined this time, the Trump campaign.

That was their argument.And that, frankly, made it easier for people not to look at Trump's own fitness. But now that Biden is out of the race and you have a more younger, dynamic candidate in Kamala Harris, now the question of Trump's fitness is once again at the forefront. And I think Ashley is absolutely correct. Democrats should make an issue of that. The fact that these are very unhealthy obsessions, they are bizarre. He's also -- you know, if you look at the video of Donald Trump, look at the tape when he was much younger. He was much more coherent and able to string together sentences better than he does today. So if I were the Democrats, I would focus on this fitness question. It's fair game and it's a turnaround. This whole issue is simply rebounded on Trump, but it's a real vulnerability for him.

So it looks like the enemy is seeking to improve its negotiating position for the future. The enemy will certainly receive a worthy response, and all our objectives will undoubtedly be achieved. PLEITGEN (voice-over): All this as Russia and Ukraine blame each other for what appears to be a major fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, an area under Russian control. So far, no increased radiation levels have been detected. Kyiv has published little information about its offensive into Russian territory, but Ukraine's President justifying the incursion.

And she dismissed the case not related to the search warrant per se, but she dismissed the case based on an argument that she accepted that the special counsel was not a valid individual to lead that investigation.So I am curious as to how the timing will work out in terms of waiting for the appellate court to consider whether or not she properly dismissed that case, and I think that's a real question that is still out there.",
