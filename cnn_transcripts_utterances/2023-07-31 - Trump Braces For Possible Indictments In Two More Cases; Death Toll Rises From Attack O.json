All of this as special counsel Jack Smith gets new evidence in the Mar-a-Lago case.Plus, remarkable new video into OUTFRONT of Ukrainian forces taking out one of Putin's prized rocket launches. This is as a Putin arch nemesis who has survived two poisoning attempts loses his appeal. His wife is OUTFRONT. And a long time Republican operative quits Ron DeSantis. Why he says the problem isn't the campaign, it's DeSantis's himself. Ed Rollins is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, new surveillance video in the Mar-a-Lago case just surfacing. A development tonight, a breaking development, we'll share more details in a moment because it comes as two major indictments are looming for Trump. In Washington, the grand jury investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the election is expected to meet just hours from now, and in Georgia a grand jury that could vote on whether to indict Trump met today. That vote could come as early as tomorrow. In Atlanta, where barricades now surround the Fulton County's superior court, all eyes are on those two grand juries currently hearing cases there. One of them meets Mondays and Tuesday's, the other one meets Thursdays and Fridays. So, Willis and her team can present their case to either of those two grand juries. So, they could've started today. Willis making it clear that she's ready to go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FANI WILLIS, FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY: The work is accomplished. We've been working for two and a half years. We're ready to go. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The judge rejecting Trump's efforts to disqualify the Fulton County district attorney you just saw there, Fani Willis who was a Democrat, from investigating the former president. The judge writing: The drumbeat from the district attorney has been neither partisan in a political sense, nor personal, in marked and refreshing contrast to the stream of personal invective flowing from one of the movants. This all comes as yet another investigation involving Trump, the special counsel Jack Smith's probe into Trump's handling of classified documents in Mar-a-Lago is heating up tonight. Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira made his first court appearance. He is, of course, accused of plotting with Trump to delete surveillance footage sought by investigators. Now, he didn't enter a formal plea. He was released on $100,000 bond. His attorney is currently being paid for by Trump Save America PAC, a PAC that we know has spent more than $40 million covering Trump's legal fees. Well, Evan Perez is OUTFRONT live in Washington. And, Evan, of course, we've got this new evidence breaking news as well as two grand juries, D.C. and Georgia, meeting tomorrow.

So, it is possible that come tomorrow, this grand jury is going to be convened and they could take a vote. Certainly everybody was anticipating that it could happen even Thursday or sometime this week. So, certainly for the special counsel team, they are aware of the calendar they know that we are about three weeks away from the first Republican debate. So, certainly, all eyes are on them tomorrow.

So, that's the big question. And that we do -- there's this idea that Mr. Tavares, the person who's in control of the surveillance video in Mar-a-Lago, is now the person cooperating. Was the government given some information? Did he then say, well, here's where the gaps are, here's additional footage, or here where it is in a different server, a backup?

And these symptoms, of course, are not getting much better because he is not receiving the care that a person with subhuman occult conditions should receive. A person with Vladimir's condition should leave a very active left and trying to do physical exercises all the time. He has no such opportunities behind bars. But he is not alone in this. Many prisoners in today's Russia are held without proper medical care. Just to name a few, Yevgeny (INAUDIBLE) is suffering from a heart issuing, Alexei Gorinov is suffering as well.

He chooses people who have -- they work their way up and we feel ingratiated towards him, we owe him. And then it's really scary, the thought of turning on Trump right now. His lawyers being paid for right now and he has a job. You get out into that world without the Trump cushion, and it's very scary and it's not very friendly, I've got to tell you.

But tonight, he is calling him, quote, a very flawed candidate, and it comes as a new poll shows DeSantis 37 polls behind Trump. DeSantis performing weakest among key demographic groups for Republican candidate, only 9 percent support among voters 65 and older, just 13 percent among those without a college degree. And Ed Rollins is with me now. He ran the pro-Trump Great America PAC in the last two elections and just quit the pro-DeSantis super PAC for 2024. So, Ed, I very much appreciate your time.

I started to worry about all the stuff that he's doing down there, go to war with Disney, go to war with the schools, what have you. Iowa is a different place. Iowa is a place that Ronald Reagan in 1980 didn't go to Iowa because he had been the voice of Iowa and his manager at that time said, we don't need to go there, we're going to win it. George Bush went there, went day to day, and became vice president because of it, beat us by a couple thousand votes. Jimmy Carter basically won the presidency on Iowa. Iowa is a place that wants you to come and talk to them about their kids, about what's -- about their farms. They don't care about all this stuff that DeSantis is talking about.",

Her husband charged with killing three women and suspected in a fourth murder is expected in court tomorrow, where we will see him for the first time since his arrest.

He's been on the ground at Gilgo Beach in the days after the bodies were discovered as well. So, Matt, you have been covering the story since the beginning. Your latest reporting is fascinating. So, let's start here with the projects Heuermann worked on. Multimillion dollar contracts, his client list includes a who's who list of global brands. He helped design a Target store in New York City. You've confirmed he worked on Donald Trump Wall Street Tower and that Trump deal alone was worth $200,000. How much was he making, Matt?",
