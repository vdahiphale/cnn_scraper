Keep an eye on the pivotal battleground of Georgia as most voting is ending there right now.And CNN can bring you a projection now. CNN projects that Kentucky goes to Donald Trump. Donald Trump will win the commonwealth of Kentucky with its eight electoral votes, and CNN can also project that Vermont will go to Kamala Harris with its three electoral votes. Kamala Harris wins the state of Vermont. It is too early to project in Georgia, Indiana South Carolina and Virginia. Let's take a look at the electoral map now to see where the candidates stand, 270 electoral votes are needed to win. Donald Trump has eight. Kamala Harris has three electoral votes. Let's bring you a key race alert now: Indiana, Donald Trump in the lead there with 60.3 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has 38.1 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has an 86,829 vote lead. That's with an estimated 13 percent of the vote in. Let's go to John King now at the magic wall -- John.",

      "sentences": "And so, Jake, now, we wait, right? You have the states that we've projected, Kentucky and Vermont. Those are the ones you expect. But so what are you going to get here? You see some first votes in Florida. Look at that lets just take it out, okay? It's just south here.It's in Osceola County, just south of Orlando. We like to look at votes when they come in. Right, Florida tends to be a reliably red state. Again though, be a test of whether Harris can improve their standing in the suburbs or put it this way, whether Trump can improve his standings in the suburbs, whether Trumps collapse in the suburbs continues. First of all, it's in votes in Florida always interesting to take a look, but what we're waiting for is the battleground just north of Florida, which will be essential in this race. Again, vice president's easiest path is those blue wall states. But Georgia, as a competitive state, what are we looking for, right? Number one, we're looking for the Democratic foundation, which is Fulton County. Sara Murray noted. Victor Blackwell is in the suburbs here. Some polling places will stay open, but we should get votes pretty quickly. And when you're looking at Fulton County, Atlanta is here. You see how it stretches a lot of suburbs around it, right? We're at zero right now. What are you looking for? You're trying to see if she can not only match the president's percentage, get 73 percent of the vote, but by the end of the night, sometimes this count could last into tomorrow is the map, the math margin, right, because if you look here and you come out here, there are 159 counties, 159 counties in Georgia. A lot of them are like this -- I'm just picking one randomly. They're small, they're rural. But Trump runs it up so were going to watch. That is the Trump base in rural America coming out in battleground Georgia, it is absolutely essential to his math that he run it up big in places like that. But if that is the case and that's what we expect to be the case, the Trump base comes out. Then the key will be does that, A, does the Harris base come out in Fulton County, Atlanta. And then what happens here. Clayton County just below, predominantly African-American, strong Democratic suburb, you need to run up the number. But it's not just the percentage. What's the raw math. Are Democrats coming out to vote? Democrats need high turnout to offset the Trump rural numbers. So that's one test. And then for me, once you get out to the -- you get further out here. Let's go out where Victor Blackwell is, out here in Gwinnett County. Look at that. Joe Biden got 58 percent of the vote, Jake, right? You don't have to go back too far in history. It was just in 2012. Mitt Romney won this county. Four years before that, John McCain won this county. This is the change in the American suburbs, right? Georgia was a red state then. But look at Romney's number, the Republican share in 2012, in the suburban area is 54 percent, right. That's what we're looking at tonight. How does Donald Trump fare in the suburbs right? It goes down to 45 percent under Trump in 2016. He still won Georgia, then at 45 percent. But then you come to 2020 and Trumps share drops to 40 percent. You cannot win in a competitive state if you are getting trounced like that in the suburbs, so can Trump get that number back up to 42, 43, 44 if he can, he's in play. If he can't, then this is -- you know, the tug of war in the state. As long as Harris gets out her base there, there's a -- there's a flip side responsibility for her. But this, we talked a bit earlier about this. This to me, Georgia and North Carolina demographically, they are just evenly split their tug of war. So we're going to see and it does its cliche. It does come down to turnout.",

You could argue if you want, Donald Trump's a little bit more competitive this time if that result holds, we'll see how that plays out, right? This is his home state now. But we'll see. But it's early to look at that. But that's one of the things you look at. The other thing you look at is we don't really have it yet, is here, the I-4 corridor, Tampa, Saint Petersburg, Orlando, over to the beach and you see it and then, you know, the Democrats again. I don't have no expectation that the Democrats are going to win Florida, but again, you will see, are Democrats turning out? Are Democrats turning out? There's some -- you know, there's been a lot of reporting about this. Harris lost a little tiny bit of the Jewish vote because of the Israel unhappiness over Israel. Gaza and how she has talked about that and the White House, you'll see a little bit of that down here. It's more important when you get to suburban Philadelphia and some and out in the Detroit area as well around metro. So you might get some clues out of Florida.

It's just much more diverse than in other places, which what makes it more complicated and fascinating. But it has become -- you're absolutely right that it has become especially down here, more Republican. In other states, it was -- Obama won two thirds of the Hispanic vote and now its become more of a fight in some of the other battlegrounds.

It's making up 30 percent of the electorate, according to these early exit polls, Harris obviously winning it big, 86 percent to 12 percent.But I want to note here that 86 percent number, four years ago, Joe Biden had 88 percent a tick higher of support of the African American vote. And Trump's 12 percent, he is a tick higher as than he was four years ago when that was 11 percent. But it's roughly the same with the Black vote. What we saw here. Look at younger voters, under the age of 30. Harris is winning them. They make up 18 percent of the electorate. Harris is winning them 60 percent to 39 percent. She is doing better with young voters in Georgia than Joe Biden was doing against Trump four years ago. Trump got 43 percent of the youth vote in Georgia four years ago. He's down to 39 percent now. So that will be something to watch. And then non-college white voters, this is obviously Trumps base 32 percent, roughly a third of the Georgia electorate are white, non- college educated voters. Trump's winning 81 percent of them. That is a bit better than he was doing four years ago, though. Four years ago, it was 35 percent of the electorate. So as a share of the overall electorate has come down Harris is winning 18 percent of them a tick under where Biden was four years ago. This will be the story of these exit polls in Georgia. Independent voters, they make up 31 percent of the electorate. That is a slightly larger share than what they made up four years ago. Trump is winning them by 11 points in these early exit poll results, 54 percent to 30 percent. Jake, four years ago, Joe Biden won independent voters in Georgia when he won the state by nine points. [19:10:02] So we've seen a swing of 20 points towards Trump in terms of the margin from nine point advantage four years ago with independents for Biden to now an 11-point advantage with independents for Trump in Georgia, Jake.",

In the state of Georgia, Donald Trump is in the lead with 51 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has 48.5 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 4,556 vote lead. That's with only an estimated 3 percent of the vote in, the polls just closed at 7:00. In the state of Florida, Donald Trump in the lead, his new home state 53.2 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has 45.9 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a healthy 438,912-vote lead. That's with half of the vote in 50 percent of the estimated vote. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, Donald Trump in the lead there with 58.5 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with 40.5 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 2,871 vote lead.

Those counties are expected to go for Donald Trump. So they see that as a positive sign and then on the other hand, when they look at where their voters might be its in places like the Raleigh-Durham area where you're going to have a larger proportion of those voters educated, a lot of people moving into the state, into those communities. You're going to have more diversity in those communities. And I'm told that the Durham turnout today gave them some optimism and hope as they go into this poll closing deadline in just a couple of minutes.

Obviously, if you're the Trump campaign, you think there's a lot of opportunity there for you. But the Harris campaign sees opportunity there, too. They want to get at least a chunk of those dissatisfied and angry voters who are dissatisfied and angry with Trump's dominance in our politics. So that will be something to watch later in the evening. We also are looking here at the most important issue economy, actually ranks top. Not like it is nationally, but like we saw in Georgia, though a tick down from that, 36 percent say the economy is the most important issue in North Carolina democracy is right up there, Jake, at 32 percent. Well down. Then is abortion and immigration in the teens. We also asked about hurricane aid here is federal hurricane aid getting to the people who need it. You see, it's roughly split here. But 49 percent say yes. Federal hurricane aid getting to where it needs to go, 46 percent say no. And then Joe Biden's approval rating, it's one point higher here in North Carolina than it is in Georgia or nationally, 42 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove. Again, the Harris campaign would like to make sure they get some of those Biden disapprovers into their fold. But that kind of approval on Biden is what is giving the Trump campaign hope in a place like North Carolina -- Jake. TAPPER: Interesting. All right. David Chalian, thanks so much. And let's talk about this. And, Dana, I mean, again, some headwinds for Kamala Harris here in these exit polls. First of all, 70 percent, 70 percent of North Carolinians of Tar Heels are either dissatisfied or angry with the state of things the economy is the number one issue.

That's when voting ends in the battleground state of North Carolina, as well as in Ohio and West Virginia. A total of 37 electoral votes are up for grabs.Right now, and CNN can make a projection that Donald Trump will win the state of West Virginia, West Virginia and it's four electoral votes going to Donald Trump, too early to call, too early to make a projection in battleground North Carolina with its 16 electoral votes, or in Ohio, with its 17 electoral votes. Let's take a look at the electoral map at this hour. Now that we've called a state for Donald Trump, Donald Trump has 23 electoral votes in the lead of Kamala Harris, who has three electoral votes, 270 electoral votes are needed to win the race, both are far from that. Let's bring you a key race alert now in the battleground state of Georgia. Donald Trump in the lead with 58.1 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has 41.4 percent of the vote. Donald Trump 69,586 votes ahead. That's -- with only an estimated 8 percent of the vote in, in the state of Georgia. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, Donald Trump in the lead there with 49.6 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has 48.8 percent of the vote. Donald Trump, with a 948-vote, lead only 2 percent of the vote has come in from the Commonwealth of Virginia. We have two more states to -- to show you now. Florida, Donald Trump in the lead there with 53.5 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris with 45.5 percent of the vote, Donald Trump with 586,779-vote lead. That's the most of the vote in, a majority of the vote, 64 percent of the vote in, in the state of Florida, with its 30 electoral votes. In New Hampshire, Kamala Harris in the lead there with 58.7 percent of the vote. Donald Trump has 40.8 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris has a 5,513-vote lead.

A former two term Governor Jim Justice, the Republican in this race, is projected to defeat the mayor of Wheeling, West Virginia, Glenn Elliott.Justice, a former Democrat, now expected to take control of the seat held by retiring Democrat turned independent Senator Joe Manchin as he now retires. Kind of gives you an idea of where West Virginia is headed politically. So this is no surprise, but it is significant for the math. Justice, a MAGA acolyte, known for taking his 4-year-old English bulldog everywhere with him, it appears that baby dog and Justice are now headed to the U.S. Senate. So what does this mean for the magic number? Republicans started out the night needing control of two Democratic seats to take the upper chamber. Now, that number is down to one, and they are currently leading in one race where Democrats hold a seat. Let's get you some key race alerts now. And show you exactly where that is on the map. We start with Ohio still very early there, but Colombian-born businessman Bernie Moreno is leading Democratic incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown, seeking his fourth term only by about 16,000 votes. Still, very early though 3 percent of the vote in, in the state of Ohio. If you're a Democrat and you're looking at the map, you're looking for opportunities to pick up a Republican seat, one of their best opportunities in the Sunshine State of Florida. Rick Scott got elected by winning only about a 10,000-vote margin over his previous opponent back in 2018. Right now, he's 715,000 votes ahead of former Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Still a lot of votes to count, but this is with 60 percent of the vote in in the state of Florida. So stepping back, looking at the raw numbers, what does this mean for the balance of power in the U.S. Senate? Democrats hold 28 seats, Republicans 40. With that one important pickup in West Virginia, 32 seats remain up for grabs, Jake, you need 51 for control of the chamber.",

All eyes are on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in this hour ahead. It is one of the make-or-break battlegrounds up for grabs tonight. And the polling there has been 48/48 or 50/50. Kamala Harris is hoping to pull off a win in Pennsylvania, as president Biden did four years ago. Donald Trump aiming for a repeat of his 2016 victory there.

That's where the marathon ends. It's called the finish line.
