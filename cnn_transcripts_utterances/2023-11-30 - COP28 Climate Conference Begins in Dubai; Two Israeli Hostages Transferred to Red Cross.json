But so far, the people here think they can. They have already struck down the gavel on one key issue. We start with breaking news tonight in Israel and Gaza. Within the last few minutes, we've learned two Israeli hostages have been transferred to the Red Cross and are on their way to Israeli territory. That news is coming from Israel's military as we await the release of additional hostages by Hamas in exchange for prisoners held, Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Now this is all happening on what is day seven of this temporary truce in Gaza. The pause in fighting extended by another day just moments before it was set to expire earlier today. On Wednesday, Hamas released 16 more hostages, 10 of them Israeli, as agreed in the original truce. Israel freed another 30 Palestinian prisoners. U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken back in the region, working to extend this truce or pause even further. He has met with Israel's prime minister today. And he also talked with the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. Oren Liebermann back with us this hour from Tel Aviv -- Oren.",

It's actually quite early for this to happen. We have seen it happen much later. So at least for this evening -- and, of course, we have to wait for more hostages to be released -- but at least for this evening, the process moving smoothly. After this, after the other Israeli hostages, women and children, are released, we shall wait to see how long it takes for Israel to release Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons. And then it's back to the exact same question we were trying to answer in the early hours of this morning. Is it possible to extend this truce by another day? That is one of the goals of secretary of state Antony Blinken in his meetings here, his day-long visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank and meeting with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He talked about Israel's right to defend itself and stood by Israel's right to defend itself as he promised that more humanitarian aid needs to go into Gaza to alleviate the demands of a dire humanitarian crisis unfolding there. He then met with Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. One of the issues that he brought up there was a concern, a serious concern, over increased Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. And we will see if that leads to any change. But of course, the overall mission is to try to make sure that this fragile truce, which has been on thin ice at times over the course of the past seven days, holds at least a little bit longer. Right, now the goal is to extend it by 24 hours at a time. But at some point, the major question is how many women or children are still being held by Hamas and Gaza? That is all that this truce is for. When it comes elderly men, when it comes to soldiers who are men and women, that may require an entirely different agreement. And keep in mind, Becky, how sensitive and how long it took to get to the first one. It was weeks of difficult, diplomatic work. Is there enough time to expand this beyond the current women and children agreement?",

That was mediated by Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt. That I think Blinken meeting with Hamas is an acknowledgment that they play a significant role here, especially as we see an increase in clashes, an increase in conflicts in the occupied West Bank. And so Blinken is trying to keep a pulse on that as well and keep the Palestinian Authority engaged, because that is a critical relationship.

And stocktake is one word rather than two. But I think the deeper point, you and I would agree, is that we need to stop just taking stock and instead start acting. And I think there are many reasons for that. First of, all the maps you just showed, how tragically behind the curve that we are on reducing the total volume of greenhouse gas emissions, at 58 gigatons per year, the map heating up. The global average temperature I'm sure did cross 2 degrees Celsius, by the way, from the pre industrial base In November of this year, decades ahead of schedule. And so when it comes to taking stock, I think we know that it is time for much more action. And that calls for radical solutions, not only on the mitigation side, which is to say more decarbonization, a lot more technology but then adaptation. Because you cannot pretend that we can wait until 2040 when we may or may not achieve certain goals of decarbonization and ignore, along the way, all of the human suffering and tragedy that is unfolding as a result of climate volatility.",

The fact is that, if you care about adaptation for people, individual people, not just millions but billions, you have to accept that migration is something that is happening already, according to the International Organization for Migration and other agencies. One third of the total number of displaced people in the world today are displaced because of climate change.

My view is that, if you want to do good for the world, you can just boil it down to two very simple, layman's kinds of things that I advocate for. One is that you either move people to the geographies of resources where they can live a better life and contribute to global society. Or you move technologies to people where they are needed if they are not mobile. Two things, move people to resources or technologies to people. That is what adaptation looks like in the real world.

And energy can be considered investing in renewables. On the issue of phasing out fossil fuels, I've also heard of phasing out fossil fuel emissions. I think for me that is where the issue of false emissions comes in, things like carbon storage, carbon capture. I think they are fairytale solutions. And I think that they are expensive.
