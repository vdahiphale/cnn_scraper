These are the key new questions this morning as the Pentagon scrambles to do damage control after highly classified documents surfaced online. CNN has reviewed 53 of these documents. All of them appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. Some reveal how the U.S. has been eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel, Ukraine. A source close to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy tells CNN, Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of these leaks.CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand joins us now live from the Pentagon. Natasha, what are you learning about where these documents came from and how the administration is responding?",

      "sentences": "John, it's really remarkable. What we are learning is that these documents first appeared on a social media platform called discard -- Discord at least a month ago. And there are at least 50 of them, which CNN has reviewed, and all of them have classified markings, including some up to the top-secret level, which is the highest level of classification in the U.S. government.Now, the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the matter based on a referral from the Pentagon, which referred the matter to the Justice Department and the FBI for further investigation on Friday night. But, look, these documents contain incredibly sensitive information about Ukrainian troop movements, strengths and weaknesses, including weaknesses in their air defenses, as well as really important and new information about just how far the us intelligence community has been able to go in penetrating the Russian defense ministry, as well as the Russian mercenary organization, Wagner Group, which, of course, is also carrying out operations in Ukraine. Now, we are also learning from these documents that this comes -- this information in these top secret document come from a variety of different agencies across the U.S. government, including the CIA, as well as the Defense Intelligence Agency. And so this really has impacted a lot of different agencies across the government, as well as many of the United States' its closest allies, including Israel and South Korea. A lot of these documents detail U.S. eavesdropping and intercepted communications of these foreign allies talking to each other. So, obviously, there's going to be some friction here moving forward between the U.S. and allies. They're already, though, talking to those allies and conducting a damage assessment, John, of how this leak may impact national security.",

And that's not good. It's unfortunate that this has happened this way, but it's alsotruthfully, Kate, being miss read by many people who don't understand what's in those documents. And I'll say \"The New York Times,\" they did a piece yesterday where they literally put two slides from the joint staff within their article, with no description of what it was. You know, when I read -- when I looked at the two slides, having been on the joint staff once, I knew exactly what it was saying, and it was not saying the same thing that was in the newspaper report. So, you're going to get amateur intel analysts saying things that just aren't true about some of these documents, but that doesn't decrease the fear factor that's involved in these things leaking to the general public.",

President Biden has vowed to fight this ruling from that federal judge in Texas every step of the way, and he has warned that it could impact access to medication abortion across the country, but also it could have further repercussions on other drugs that have been approved by the FDA in the past. The HHS secretary, Xavier Becerra, told our colleague, Dana Bash, yesterday, quote, we want the courts to overturn this reckless decision. The Justice Department did move very quickly on Friday night to file an appeal to this ruling, and they are also planning on seeking a stay, trying to put a more permanent pause on this ruling as it winds its way through the courts and very well could make its way ultimately to the Supreme Court. The attorney general, Merrick Garland, saying, quote, the department is committed to protecting Americans access to legal reproductive care.Now, some of the big questions now are what exactly the White House can do to try to protect access to this medication abortion. There are some Democrats and even a Republican, Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has said the FDA should simply ignore this ruling, that the courts shouldn't be telling what the FDA they can and cannot approve. The administration, though, initially Becerra yesterday said that every option was on the table, but then a spokesperson walked that back a bit and said that ignoring a court's ruling could set a dangerous precedent. But right now the White House is trying to work through what more can be done, but for the time being they might simply be watching this appeals process play out in court. That appeal is sitting with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is considered to be one of the country's most conservative appeals court. Sara.",

It's a combination of two pills, including Mifepristone, which is the one that we're talking about today. So that is a lot of women who were getting their miscarriage care, who were getting their abortion care by that drug. And I was speaking with a lawyer who represents several abortion clinics, and she said she's telling her clients, look, if there is not a change between now and Saturday, starting on Saturday, you just can't give this anymore.
