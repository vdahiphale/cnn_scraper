As you can see, a whole side of this building has collapsed into one of these very narrow streets. And the concern for the authorities here, and they have evacuated most of the tourists from this area, is that if there are any more tremors, then more of this will occur. The buildings themselves, many of them, are very, very badly damaged and they have got some catastrophic cracks. You can see up there, particularly on the left of the shot, you can see how, with a minor tremor, all of this can come tumbling down. Now, there have been tremors, Paula, elsewhere in the country and it is the tremors, the aftershocks that continue to pose very severe problems for the authorities partly because the roads are being closed, if they weren't closed originally by the earthquake, they are being closed by subsequent tremors. And, of course, those buildings that are remaining standing are likely to come down. Now, tens of thousands of people have believed to have been made homeless by this earthquake. People is having to sleep out in the open. There have been some miraculous rescues. Yesterday afternoon, a woman was pulled out from under the rubble having been trapped there for 12 hours. And there's a similar rescue here in Marrakech. But the authorities are having to use helicopters, aircraft, to get to some of these remote villages in the Atlas Mountains, the foothills of the Atlas Mountain, a burba (ph) area traditionally, has been extremely badly hit with whole villages being reduced to rubble. And it is in those areas where the death toll, which is now just over 2,000 people, at least 13 in Marrakech, but 2,000 and the rest of the country, and likely to rise as the authorities pick through this rubble and discover whether or not the people who are missing are now actually dead, Paula",

But there are people from rescue crews are coming in from all over the world. So, that's the first phase.And you're absolutely right. Then you've got the issue of infrastructure and understanding the scale of that and the cost, the financial cost, as well as the human cost of that, I think, is a ways off, really, for the authorities here. They're simply trying to get out into those remote areas and find out exactly what has happened. But their immediate needs are absolutely water, shelter and food for those displaced populations. And still, the Moroccan authorities have not given us any figures on what those estimates are, because they are in remote areas and they are simply coping now with what is an emergency rescue operation before moving directly into the humanitarian phase.

We'll look at the help victims are getting from their government, their neighbors, and even their national football team. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [03:20:00] NEWTON:  Russia claims its air defenses have foiled a Ukrainian drone attack on Crimea. The Russian Defense Ministry says eight drones were shot down near the peninsula in recent hours. Ukraine says its air defenses also had success taking down Russian drones over Kyiv. Officials say 20 of them were intercepted around the capital Sunday morning. Now, some drone debris crashed to the ground and left one person wounded. In the meantime, it is the last day of elections in Russia and occupied parts of Ukraine, but the Council of Europe says are violation of international law. The elections in the occupied territories are widely dismissed as a sham, both by Kyiv and internationally. A pro-Ukrainian resistance group claims some polling stations in the administrative capital of Crimea have been largely empty. But in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to make people believe the elections are, in fact, legitimate. He's urging people to take part in the process and have faith in the online system of voting. For more now, we're joined by Fred Pleitgen, who's here from London. Good to have you on these stories. Some analysts have called these elections the most uncompetitive in Russian history, others saying that it is a return to Soviet practices, where we saw those performative elections with zero opposition. But I think you know more than most that they do serve a purpose for Putin. Why does he lean into this, even as Russia continues to send troops to the front and they're suffering economically at home?",

Because we have to keep in mind, Paula, that Vladimir Putin started this war because he claimed that there was a genocide going on against Russian-speaking people, against Russians in Eastern Ukraine, specifically at the time in Donbas and Donetsk and Luhansk regions and then, of course, also now in the southeast of Ukraine as well.He was claiming that the government in Kyiv was a neo-Nazi regime that was hell bent on conducting a genocide against the Russians in the eastern part of Ukraine. So, obviously, the Ukrainians have said that none of that is true and, certainly, the international community has as well. But as the war stagnates, especially on the eastern and southern fronts, the Russians, while they might not be losing ground as quickly as some may have thought in the west, they certainly haven't been gaining any ground and really haven't had any significant victories on the battlefield in about a year. What Vladimir Putin seems to be trying to show is that, look, the people that we set out to allegedly save, as he put it, are doing a lot better now. They have elections, they're living in what he would say is a fairly stable environment. Now, of course, the Ukrainians are saying all of what you're seeing there, people going to the polling stations and all that is a farce. He says that -- or the Ukrainians say that people are essentially being forced to go to the polls, that many people don't want to go to the polls. The Ukrainians are saying that these elections are a violation, as they put it, not just of Ukraine's territorial integrity but also of the people who live in Donbas and are being coerced to go to these elections. And of course, you've also mentioned some of the international reactions with countries around the world and organizations around the world also saying that these elections are sham. Nevertheless, Vladimir Putin saying these are very important, not just, of course, for the political system in Russia, for his political system, but certainly also selling the war as well, Paula.",

Fred, he said, look, they continue to play a very significant war. But this is where the story gets interesting. It's controversial.And, recently, a new book came out that claims Elon Musk did not enable Starlink communications near Crimea last year because they wanted to stop a Ukrainian sneak attack on Russian naval assets.

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right. It's fascinating, and it's a really complicated story as well. Essentially, first of all, it is absolutely true that all the frontline segments in Ukraine that I have ever been to, the Ukrainian troops were using Starlink heavily there, and all of them said that Starlink was extremely important to them even staying in the fight, to have that communications link, and certainly one also that the Russians can't jam.Now, as far as this sneak attack that was apparently already in the works is concerned, essentially, what came out in that book is that the Ukrainians were trying to conduct a sneak attack. They then found that Starlink over Crimea, which they needed to steer unmanned, underwater drones that they had rigged with explosives as they were trying to attack the port of Sevastopol, which has a large part of the Russian Black Sea fleet in it, they found that Starlink wasn't working around Crimea. And they asked Elon Musk to enable Starlink around Crimea, and he refused because he feared that if there was a large-scale attack on Sevastopol and a lot of Russian ships got destroyed, that the Russians might escalate the war and could lead to the Russians using nuclear weapons. [03:25:02] That's sort of his version, or part of his version of things. He got a lot of flak for that, as some of this information was coming out in the book, also for some tweets from Musk himself, saying, look, you could have maybe shortened the war. There were Ukrainians who were criticizing him, people in the international community as well. It seems as though things are a bit more complicated because Elon Musk now says that Starlink was never enabled around Crimea and that he was essentially being asked to enable it for this attack as this attack was already in progress. And he said that he decided not to do that because he feared escalation. I want to read a bit of his of one of the tweets that he put out. He put out several seemingly trying to explain this, but one of them said, quote, at no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea. Moreover, our terms of service clearly prohibits Starlink for defense -- for offensive military action as we are a civilian system. So, they were, again, asking for something that was expressly prohibited. So, that is Elon Musk there. Whether or not the Ukrainians buy that is certainly up for question. However, one of the things that Karylo Budanov, as you mentioned, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, said, Starlink is so important for them that they really want to remain on good terms with Elon Musk.

Israel, which routinely sends emergency personnel and supplies to disaster zones, says it is preparing to send a rescue team and humanitarian aid to the area. Even Algeria, which broke off ties with Morocco two years ago, said it would open its airspace for humanitarian and medical flights to Morocco.

One of the most recent ones to happen was on Friday afternoon as the 34-year-old convicted killer was spotted, according to authorities, inside of the search perimeter here in Chester County, Pennsylvania, which is about 40 miles west of Philadelphia.That is promising for authorities, as it tells them, or at least suggests to them, that this individual is potentially still inside of that area that has been locked down and has been searched now for well over a week and a half. On Saturday, the Pennsylvania State Police also updated their search perimeter. Now, most of it actually covers some botanical gardens, or at least it includes some botanical gardens that, on any other weekend, would normally be packed with families, but that facility, which is about a thousand acres of gardens and meadows, has actually been closed because of this manhunt that continues. In terms of what we heard from authorities, Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens saying recently that this particular fugitive had actually been able to elude authorities in Brazil after he allegedly committed his first murder, actually hiding out in the jungles in South America and eventually able to get away, the lieutenant colonel insisting that that is likely not going to happen here. This is what he said with some confidence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  I will keep up this search at whatever tempo is appropriate for as long as we need to. He's a dangerous individual. We'll keep this up. We've done it in the past. I would think that history should allow people to see that. We mean it when we say we're here to stay until we capture him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
