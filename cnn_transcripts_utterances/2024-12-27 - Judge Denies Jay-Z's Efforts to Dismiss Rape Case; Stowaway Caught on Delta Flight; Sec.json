Investigators have in the meantime recovered the plane's second black box. CNN's Nada Bashir is joining us now with more on this.

There's a lot of pressure on the investigators now to come to some sort of conclusion as to what led to this fatal crash.As you mentioned, those two black boxes have now been recovered. And authorities say it could take about two weeks to fully examine the data collected by the black boxes. That is, of course, flight data, and potentially also internal recordings from within the cockpit. But there have been a lot of questions swirling, a lot of speculation around the possible causes. And we have been learning more from authorities since that crash. Take a listen to this eyewitness account from one of the passengers recording the final moments of that flight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUBHONKUL RAKHIMOV, PLANE CRASH SURVIVOR (through translator):  When the first bang happened, I looked around, quickly assessed the situation and thought that the plane was going to fall apart. A couple more seconds passed, but it didn't fall apart. Another minute passed, not even a minute,a few more seconds passed, but it didn't fall apart. I thought that I should start praying now. I started saying words. I started to remember the almighty. I thought that those were probably my last words. So I thought I need to get ready for a meeting with the almighty. So, while this meeting hasn't happened yet, I thought I needed to earn more favor from him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think what is important to underscore here is that we have heard today from Azerbaijan Airlines saying that they believe the flight was impacted by external physical and technical interferences, again leading some to believe this may have been the cause, caused by air defense systems, Russian air defense systems. So, a huge point of concern, particularly as we are seeing drone activity in the area, questions around whether the plane was targeted by mistake, given Ukrainian drone strikes in the area. We know, of course, that airports in this region have previously been forced to close as a result. And so there are questions around the safety precautions being taken for flights traveling in this region. There had been some suggestion by Russian aviation authorities that, because of these concerns, that the flight was unable to actually travel to the Grozny region, that the airspace should have been closed or pilots would have been advised to travel elsewhere or avoid this particular airspace. We'd heard shortly after the plane crash occurred from one Ukrainian security and defense official accusing Russia of failing to close airspace in this area. So, again, a number of questions still to be answered. That will be the focus of investigations. At this stage, there is no clear conclusion being offered by investigators, but we will be waiting for updates from them as they come in.",

And there was clearly drone activity. The fog of war was involved surrounding Grozny. The air defense units were responding, and this plane should have never been allowed to take off to fly to Grozny. There was simply too much military activity taking place. But for the Russian to acknowledge that, to close the airspace would have been a tremendous loss of face. They want to minimize the ability of Ukraine to disrupt their systems.

And, today, Admiral Kirby, the White House security spokesman, also implied that this was a shoot-down. And you can be sure that American intelligence has been monitoring the communications in Russia, and they know what's going on. So, the Kazakstan government has got their hands full running this investigation. They have got the two black boxes. The most important will be the voice recorder. That will tell us -- one, it will identify where the explosion took place. There are multiple microphones in the cockpit. They can determine the location of a sound outside the cockpit.

Officials have not provided any other information that. We know that this -- the flight was taxing out for departure when, as you noted, the flight crew realized that they had someone on board that should not be on board. And so they decide to come back to the gate. And we're told that, when they get to the gate, the door of the plane is opened and that the passenger runs out of the aircraft. Law enforcement had not arrived at the gate just yet. And so officials had to rely on some surveillance video to figure out exactly where this passenger ran towards. And this person was taken into custody, we're told, inside of a bathroom. Now, Delta released the statement shortly after all of this, saying in part -- quote -- \"As there are no matters more important than safety and security, Delta people followed procedures to have a non-ticketed passenger removed from the flight and then apprehended.\" They went on to apologize to their customers for all this. Jessica and Erica, a lot of unanswered questions and all of this, including the identity of this passenger. Officials have not released that piece of information.
