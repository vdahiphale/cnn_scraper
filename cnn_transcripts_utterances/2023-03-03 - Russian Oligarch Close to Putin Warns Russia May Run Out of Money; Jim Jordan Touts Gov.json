      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, Russia going broke. A top Russian oligarch who is close to Putin with that stunning warning tonight. This is one of the hardest fought battles of the war. It's a breaking point. And we'll go live to the ground.Plus, Alex Murdaugh vowing to appeal his life sentence for murdering his wife and son. He says he's innocent. Officials released a brand- new picture of the former attorney tonight. And Congressman Jim Jordan promising to expose the FBI and DOJ for playing politics. Tonight, major signs that this case could be falling apart. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Russia running out of cash. It's an astonishing prediction because it comes from one of Russia's most prominent oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska. He's warning that his country can run out of money as soon as next year, 2024. The quote from Deripaska: There will be no money already next year. We need foreign investors. And here's the thing, Deripaska is actually in a position to know. He's an oligarch. He has been close to Putin for many years. And he's been very loyal to him. He's long been sanctioned by the U.S. and other Western nations, most recently the cause of the war in Ukraine. But it's not a new thing to point out, it's a long time relationship with Putin of loyalty. In fact, one time, I had to meet with him because he was banned from entering the United States. Now the U.S. government said in 2018, quote, Deripaska has said that he does not separate himself from the Russian state. Deripaska has been investigated from money laundering and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official and taking part an extortion and racketeering. There are allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group. That alleged murder is part of the reason he was banned from the United States. And what's more? Deripaska, has one numbers to back his warning up that he's making right now on the cash issue. Russia government revenue plunged 35 percent in January compared to the year ago, spending went up 59 percent. And those are numbers they're allowing out there. Now, Deripaska did speak out against the Ukraine war at the very early days after Putin's invasion and that was because he knew it would be bad economically for Russia, for himself. But at that time, Putin didn't listen. In fact even as Deripaska, in that inner circle is giving that warning today, Putin is giving a very different impression about the Russian economy. Here he is days ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The Russian economy has proved itself to be much more resilient than in years past. (END VIDEO CLIP) Now, Putin sells the Russian public the story that he wants them to believe. He says that so they believe. And calling it out, saying it's not true comes that incredible cost. You may remember that we told you last week about this Russian lawmaker, you see him there. He's the one who posted a video himself mocking that very same speech from Putin. He hung noodles on his ear as well listen into the speech. That act demonstrates an old Russian expression which just simplistically translates to stop lying. Well, that lawmakers been charged. The charge is discrediting the Russian armed forces and he's now set to go to trial on March 7th. This is according to Russian state media, for putting noodles on his ears. This isn't the union. And the reason for Putin's anger is the failure on the front lines. His forces tonight still failing to make major gains in Ukraine. Ukrainian air force tonight claiming it shot down this Russian fighter jet in eastern Donetsk. You see the smoke coming from the ruptured, Ukraine says that this was a Russian SU-35 fighter bomber. And in Bakhmut, another day of death and no victory. We have new video out front from the deadly battles there. This is a Ukrainian soldier firing a grenade launcher. How group of Russians. He then you see runs back to his armor car. His team throws it in reverse, you'll see here, and the armored vehicle comes after fire. Now in this, case you see that incoming fire. They're filming this. I do want to let you know that we do understand that this particular situation seems to have ended with them surviving. The battalion says the truck's armor able to withstand those sniper bullets, as the rain reversed here, you're watching. And I want to be in tonight there in eastern Ukraine with Alex Marquardt. And, Alex, we're trying to go towards Bakhmut today. What happened?",

So, when you see Bakhmut, and what's happening there that bridge being blown up, that Alex was reporting on Prigozhin saying, surrender, we're going to get you and it seems from what we're hearing, this has been going the Ukrainians way, millimeter by millimeter, I guess some experts are saying, look, give it up in Bakhmut.

So Ukraine is giving up some territory which is not strategic. It's a 70,000-person city that basically is not strategic and has virtually nobody left in it and the entire Russian army is being degraded.

A claim he denies. He described this as being a weaponization of the security clearance process, according to the Democratic staff report. But on many points, he refused to elaborate or offer Democrats corroborating evidence. His attorney, a former election attorney for Donald Trump, told CNN his client provided confidential information to Congress. But, he did not release that information to Democrats on the Committee because he knew that they would leak it to the media. Delegate Stacey Plaskett, the top Democrat on the so-called Weaponization Committee, tells CNN, I said at the outset that I thought this was a mechanism for them to float every conspiracy theory that they might want to try and utilizing the 2024 election. It appears like that is in fact the case. A spokesperson for Jordan in a statement accused Democrats of leaking cherry-picked excerpts of testimony to attack the brave whistleblowers who risked their careers to speak out on abuses at the Justice Department and FBI.
