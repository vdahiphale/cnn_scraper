At 9Mr. Trump goes on to say, he now expects to be arrested and indicted again in short order. Another indictment guarantees another data point in Trump's political campaign strategy that he is a victim, and therefore the GOP should rally around him. CNN is reporting out every single angle of this from the Justice Department to the former president's plan to respond. We're going to start though, with CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, you've been doing reporting on this for a very long time. First question is, did the special counsel's office confirm that they sent this letter as the former president is saying?",

But my colleague Casey Gannon over at court today, she is watching and there is a grand jury that is meeting today as they have been on Tuesdays for many months investigating January 6, the same grand jury being used by this special counsel's office in this historic probe.And we do know that there is an active grand jury because the grand jury has given Donald Trump an opportunity to come speak to him -- to come speak to them. What they said in the target letter, according to Trump himself is that he was the target of the January 6 grand jury investigation. That's a federal investigation that we know has been largely based out of Washington, D.C., and that he was given a very short in his words, four days to report to the grand jury. That is very likely an invitation for him to speak to them on his own behalf. If he so chooses, he doesn't have to take that opportunity. And everyone who is viewing this, who is hearing this, who understands how these Justice Department investigations work, how this target letter works and how this special counsel operates, believes that this indicates a charge is imminent. This is the sort of situation where you're notifying the former president of the United States that he is not only just a person, there has been information collected about in this grand jury criminal investigation, but that he is very likely to be charged with a federal crime. And Dana, there are a lot of aspects of this investigation that we have seen play out over many, many months, even predating the special counsel's appointment last November. But putting it all together, much of the grand jury activity has centered around Donald Trump and what he did, while he was president, after he lost the election, leading up to end on January 6.",

Here with me to help put this dramatic moment into perspective, CNN's Abby Phillip, CNN's John King, former federal prosecutor Laura Coates, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, former Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams. Thank you, one and all.Laura, I want to start with you as a one of the former federal prosecutors here to talk about the potential scope of charges. Because we have seen and kind of gotten the sense based on the interviews that the special counsel was doing and the testimony that he was calling before the grand jury, that you saw the lawyers in and around, lawyers and air quotes around the former president, around January 6 going in. It was a big question whether or not he was going to be a target, whether they had the goods on him. What does this tell you?",

So, sketching out and adding to some of the things Laura said, sketching out to the back of the envelope, or at least the top of the legal pad, what potential charges might be possibly conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct Congress, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.You could have misdemeanor interference with elections, and then any other host of other sort of lower-level crimes. If this went really big, and I'm going to like, it's sort of doubt they would, but they could potentially charge Rico or Racketeering, sort of a criminal enterprise, bringing in a number of different charges. I think that's highly unlikely to be clear, but they could just do it. And sort of, and then the big one, seditious conspiracy. Again, you're going to have a really hard time looking the former president to that, because like you said, Dana, you're going to need one-on-one conversations with the president agreeing with people to use force to obstruct Congress. So, I think you get something probably in the realm of these conspiracies to get in the way of Congress.",

So, it's unlikely that the president would be indicted as a sole defendant in an indictment of this nature. And whoever else gets charged with him will give us some insight as to what direction the prosecutors are likely to go.There are other folks who are kind of on the periphery of the activities leading up to January 6. There was, of course, a potential conspiracy to impact the Department of Justice with the removal of the acting attorney general, that's up. I think -- I tend to think that those are issues that will be addressed later. If they are focused on the president right now, likely be simply the president and those two, maybe three individuals who are closest to him at that time on those core issues of defrauding the government, obstructing Congress and potentially even inciting (crosstalk).",

And so, it strikes me that to get to a point of criminal charges, after a special counsel has taken a look at this, the evidence is going to have to be substantial to warrant charging a former president with a case that is as broad as it is.And where to your point earlier, Trump's involvement in this would be not the way that you would expect it. He's not going to write an email saying, go do this or go do that. He's not writing a text message saying go do this or go do that. So, the to be able to prove that, strikes me that the Justice Department has a high bar to reach in terms of evidence, understanding also the incredible amount of scrutiny that they will be under, not just for this case, but all the others that Trump faces.",

But if you talk to some of the people who've gone in before this grand jury, they say this goes back to even before the election. That the conversation started even before the election about what happens.We will say, as Donald Trump said on election night, against the advice of his political advisors and his legal advisors, that the election was stolen. So, I would say today, as we focus on this again, and following what Donald Trump says it's about, just to be very cautious about that, and realize that we know from the witnesses that they were asked about things happening in the last weeks of the campaign up to election day, all the way up to January 6, and then even after that.",

It has been very successful for him in the past. He's stayed strong in polling. But we do not know if the past is necessarily the same as this. This is a much more serious case that we saw play out in real time.So, when you talk to Republican voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. This was last night, talking to some of them, who again, liked Trump's policies, but not his personality. More of them have an open mind than I was expecting about sort of how this year is going to play out. This could be different. It could not be, we'll see. But I do not think that we should necessarily automatically assume that his strength will continue on this because of the different nature of this. And as you said, he was -- all of the people who were interviewed are people from his inner circle, Jared Kushner and other things. And I'm thinking back to the days right after the election between that period and the inauguration, when he acknowledged privately as we reported, that he may have lost. So, this is all going back to, yes, his core has stayed with him, but there are half the party is ready to move on. The question is what to his rivals, how do they seize upon this?

But again, they are still working the phone. They were caught off guard by the timing around this target letter. I'd spoken to multiple sources in the last several weeks, who said that they actually thought that this investigation had cooled off recently. Now, when we talked about planning travel. Trump is on his way to Iowa tonight because we cannot forget he is running for a third presidential bid. Right now, he is in the middle of campaigning and none of that is going to change. He is doing a town hall tonight with Sean Hannity. And of course, we expect this to come up. But one thing I will note is, so far, I have not seen any fundraising emails off of this target letter. That's usually the first thing that they do. As we reported last week, when we saw his FEC numbers. They believe that they actually raise more money when he gets either indicted or a target letter faces these legal problems. So interesting to see them not doing that just quite yet. But again, there's a lot of confusion. A lot of conversations still going on right now all around the fact that they still have -- all while having this third presidential campaign that they're running.",

But there are people who can offer insight into Trump's mindset that very few other people really can do so.And so, it's Hope Hicks specifically, that's I had a conversation last week with a source. And I said the idea that they brought in Hope Hicks in June, so not even that long ago. What does that tell you? And they said, it's very clear, they're looking at Trump, Trump himself in a way that they did not know previously. I think this caught Trump's team off guard, though. It's not a surprise, obviously, we knew this investigation was coming, and that this was underway and that charges were likely, but the fact that Trump has gotten a target letter.

And we've all learned from reporting what he did, leading up to an on January 6. But the hardest part of a case here is what was in this person's mind.Did he have intent to break the law? Did he know generally that what he was doing is wrong? And I think that's exactly what to Kaitlan's point. Why we've seen DOJ focusing in on the people who were closest to Donald Trump. Hope Hicks, one of his closest advisors. Jared Kushner, a family member. Mark Meadows, we know they've spoken Mark Meadows's Chief of Staff. Because those are the people who had at the time unvarnished, unregulated one-on-one conversations. And for somebody who doesn't really text, who doesn't really email like Donald Trump, you're not going to have a smoking gun document. But what you may have is crucial conversations from the people closest to you. GEOFF DUNCAN, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Well, as a Republican, as a conservative Republican, this is a bad day. Because our party is once again going to be blemished with technically the leader of our party. But this is a good day also for our party, because this is one step closer to telling the real story what happened on January 6. Is the real story about talking about what happened in the election in Georgia and clearing the slate and moving past this. This is difficult stuff. I can't imagine what's going through Donald Trump's mind right now, right? They just mentioned earlier, he's going to go to Iowa. I mean, could you imagine having a federal indictment sitting on the edge of somebody's desk, ready to come your way? And then you have to go campaign for president United States.

And there was a sense that the big dog was never going to be gone after. And so, I think for people who want to see equal justice, if you apparently you know, people say, we have a two-tiered justice system, we do.
