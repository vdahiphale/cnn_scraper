      "sentences": "Well, Erica, some Democratic governors do want to have a meeting with the White House to talk about some of their concerns after President Biden's debate performance last Thursday. That's according to new reporting from our colleague Jake Tapper. And some of the concerns that these democratic governors had were aired out in a Monday night phone call that was organized by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.That was only governors on this call. No staff was on. But one thing that was expressed in this call, we're told is that there was some frustration concern that President Biden hadn't directly reached out to some of these governors. There was a sentiment that they did believe they needed to hear from President Biden himself following that debate performance. Now, there are -- also, one point of discussion on this call was the possibility that Vice President Kamala Harris potentially speak to the governors. At the time, there are plans underway for a White House meeting. Though, it's unclear when exactly that could -- or if it will eventually take place. Now, it comes as some of those governors we're told were concerned about making some of the -- or expressing some of their concerns publicly out of fear that it might cause President Biden to dig in more. We know that President Biden spent the past two days up at Camp David with his family -- with his family encouraging him to stay in this race. But there have been many questions for the campaign about the path forward for President Biden. The Biden's top campaign officials have been working the phones over the weekend and yesterday and into today to try to quell some of the anxiety amongst Democratic lawmakers but also donors. There was a call last night with top campaign officials including the campaign's chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, where they tried to ease some of the concerns of donors. And defended the president's health and insisted that his candidacy remains on track. The campaign, of course, has doubled down saying that there are no plans for President Biden to step aside in this race. But they have been facing a lot of pressure for potentially changing course. For instance, there have been allies from the outside who have encouraged the campaign to have President Biden participate in news conferences or town halls, something more informal to show that he is up for the job. Now, I will note that we are expected to see President Biden in just a few hours. He will receive a briefing relating to the extreme heat in this country and also deliver remarks. So, we will see if that might be an opportunity for the president to face questions from reporting but -- from reporters. But this new reporting about the concerns of Democratic governors is significant at a time when some are expressing that they want to hear from President Biden himself following that debate performance last Thursday. That could have implications not just on Biden's standing on the ticket, but on the other Democrats who are running in competitive House and Senate races as well.",

Congressman Quigley was on with our colleague Kasie Hunt earlier today. And when she asked if, you know, where he stood on whether Biden should step aside. I'm paraphrasing here.He did say that decision needs to be left up to the president. It needs to come from him. But he also said that he didn't think this was a one-off in terms of that performance. And some concerns for Thursday night. He said he wouldn't go any farther. But he did bring that up. You have Senator Welch, who in an interview out of Vermont, said that this needs to be a discussion that it has to come from the top levels of the Biden campaign, that they have to have a discussion. And he criticized the campaign for its dismissive attitude toward people who were raising questions for discussion. There does not seem to be a real appetite to having that discussion, Arlette.",

And I think that they want to meet with the president and have those conversations. So, I don't think it sets off alarm bells in any way, shape, or form that wouldn't -- you know, every -- all these leaders in the party should be meeting with the president and getting to see where his head's at and having those conversations. But the President's been out publicly. You know, since the debate happened, he was out all weekend in -- you know, doing fundraisers in at two events in North Carolina and one at Stonewall. He was out yesterday giving remarks. He's going to be out again today. So, I -- this doesn't give me the feeling that the president is, you know, hiding in secret and wanting to drop out. I think he's willing to go forth and show the American people that he is up for the task -- the task here at hand.",

But there also is a lack of communication.And there are concerns that the campaign has been very dismissive about the concerns. Whether they come from elected officials, surrogates, donors, or voters. And voters are who they really need to be concerned about. Is the campaign doing anything to mitigate that? Because this is dominating the conversation for a reason. And it's because it's not being addressed, Meghan. HAYS: Yes -- no, absolutely. And that's a fair criticism. And it's how these meetings leak, right? When people close ranks and circle the wagons here with internal in the campaign and around the president, these are how these meetings leak. And so, I -- you know, some of these governors have a right to, you know, want to meet with the president. That's totally fair. And the communication should be two ways. But they're leaking this too, for a reason. So, where -- they're also driving to continue the conversation. They can meet with the president and private and not be leaking the meeting. So, I -- there's a little bit -- you know, that makes me also a little uneasy about their motives here. But they have a right to meet with the president, as it's everyone. And this is up to the voters. And they have to be strong surrogates for him moving into the election. Like -- just like you said, their voters and their states depend on them to give a fair and balanced message when they go out for him. So, it's not unreasonable if they want to meet with him.",

Wants to see -- wants a better snapshot of actually what played out on Thursday night, and how that has trickled down. What I've heard from Republicans is we're just going to sit back and watch this happen. Perhaps not surprisingly.But even in the early polling, I will say the debate has not shown. And the chaos perhaps that we're seeing among Democrats has not shown a bump for former President Trump. It is not necessarily working in his favor. BRYAN LANZA, DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: I mean, I'm -- listen, first of all, thank you for having me. I'm just going to disagree with that. New Hampshire, which has gotten Democrat for 24 years at the gubernatorial level is -- and the presidential level is now plus four President Trump. I mean, New Hampshire is a solidly blue state. And they're responding to the debate performance from President Biden. And that performance was anything beyond a resignable event. I mean, we are a superpower with nuclear weapons. We have, you know, strong enemies out there that saw this debate. And realized that our current president has a cognitive decline, that he probably doesn't have the mental fitness to execute his charges as president. So, this is a dangerous situation. I think it's troubling that the Biden campaign is trying to be dismissive and say it's a one-off event. Remember, we had the special prosecutor who also interviewed President Biden, and he said this thing's -- this the exact same situation. He was forgetful. He did understand his record. Didn't know why he was there. These are dangerous things when you're talking about a superpower and we're talking about our strong enemies. And we shouldn't be gaslighting America and say everything's fine. It was a one-off. Joe Biden's cognitive fitness is in severe decline. We've all seen it. The White House has covered it up. That should -- that my feeling is a crime. And we need to be very careful going forward. I actually think Kamala Harris should be elevated to the presidential level. And Joe Biden should resign. We cannot have this uncertainty at the presidential level during these dangerous times.",

The heatwave season has expanded by over 40 days since the late 60s there. And so, there's no telling. This is going to be another summer of record-shattering weather events, climate events, as a result of, you know, a century and a half of fossil fuel pollution that's holding in all that -- all that heat right now.The president is expected to really draw distinctions between himself and his opponents who doesn't really want to even acknowledge the issue of the climate crisis. And by local governments in Florida and Texas, which have recently stopped active heat protection for workers, shade breaks, water breaks at a certain temperature. Only three states in the country, including California -- and I'm sorry, my phone's going off. Three states in the count -- in the country, California, Oregon, and Minnesota, protect workers who work indoors in the heat, which can be just as relentless. And worker productivity goes down when these heat waves extend for days at a time. So, this is a new era. The president is expected to announce both mitigation to try to stop the climate pollution problem, but also adaptation to the heat that is already here. If you look at the heat-related deaths now, 2300 last year. But experts say this particular crisis is vastly underreported. Maybe up to a factor of five because it preys on older folks and older homes. There's a lag and data as it comes through. There's other -- you know people may blame a health issue when it is the heat in some cases. But this is a staggering stat, Erica, I just read on Monday.

He -- you know, the law is ingrained in him he. Once called the law the love of my life. He almost became a priest and then decided to become an attorney because that was just as much as a calling to him. And to be disbarred -- especially in New York where he served as this trailblazing prosecutor in the 1980s, probably the most famous prosecutor in the world at the time in the 1980s, a beloved figure in many quarters, now to be disbarred in the same state, is it just incredibly humiliation which must really strike at the heart of kind of who he is.",
