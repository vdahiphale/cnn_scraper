President Biden is not expected to face a major challenge in the Democratic Party as we know so far, Kate.",

We want to show you some new drone video -- footage that has come in to really show how extreme this flooding event is becoming and how serious the situation is. River levels are rising all along the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Iowa, and communities are preparing for more as the snowpack is continuing to melt. Of course, the biggest impact so far has been to have been seen in rural areas and parks along the river.CNN's Jennifer Gray. She's tracking this threat for us. She's joining us now. What's the very latest that you're seeing, Jennifer? What are you tracking now? JENNIFER GRAY, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): Well, Kate, we're continuing to see the river rise. Basically, we had a blockbuster snow season across portions of the Midwest. That snow has to go somewhere. And just about a week ago, we had temperatures in the 90s across portions of the Midwest and mid to upper 80s. And so, that snow melted very quickly. The result is going to be the river rising. And so, these are pictures that we're seeing all along the Mississippi River, as you mentioned. And this is going to be a slow rise, and it's going to be a slow fall. And so, as you mentioned, cities all along the Mississippi are preparing. Let's take a look at the floor graphics because we can show you all of these river stages -- all of these rivers -- all of the dots, I should say that are in purple, those indicate major flood stage. We have more than 20 right now. And as this continues to fall downstream -- this water flowing downstream, we're going to continue to see those purple dots populate farther and farther south. So, we are going to expect to see some pretty significant flooding anywhere from say like, as you mentioned, Minnesota, and then could be all the way as far south as some of the southern states in the coming days and weeks. So, it is going to be something to watch for several weeks. So, this white line right here is where the Mississippi River Valley began. So, basically, all the snow south of that is going to flow into the Mississippi River. So, a lot of it has already melted. We really don't have that much more to go. But this bubble of water is just going to continue to flow downstream. That's why we have the flood warnings in effect for a large chunk of the Mississippi, more than 400 miles extending all the way down to St. Louis. And you can see the purple dots right there, those are all major flood stages. The red dots are moderate flood stages. And a lot of these rivers are going to be the highest they've seen in 20 years, so we are going to see some significant flooding. This one right here in La Crosse, Wisconsin, not expected to crest until Thursday, almost at crest level. And then you can see across portions of Iowa, not cresting until next week. So, it just shows you how slow of a process this is, Kate. Unlike flash flooding, this one's going to take a while.",

Seven people were arrested just moments after the crowd began chanting let her speak in support of a Democratic state representative, Zooey Zephyr who is transgender.

What exactly caused the madness on the floor there? LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, Sara. The interruption is basically the latest development in a three-day fight over Montana State Representative Zooey Zephyr's remarks against lawmakers who support a ban on gender-affirming care. I actually spoke to one of the protesters who was arrested and released. He described the scene saying that protesters gathered outside the capitol yesterday. It began as a peaceful rally. They went inside for the session. The representative, she attempted to speak again but her sound was silenced yet again. And that is when protesters began chanting. You saw the video there. Riot police were entered. They began arresting people. Representatives Zephyr has not been allowed to speak on the Statehouse floor since Thursday because she told Republican colleagues last week that they would have \"blood on their hands\" if they banned gender- affirming medical care. That was the supposedly uncalled-for language that you referenced. And here's her on CNN describing why she chose those words. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, Sara, this is also part of a broader effort to restrict LGBTQ Plus and especially transgender rights in various Republican-controlled states. In Missouri, for example, the Attorney General there issued an emergency rule that limits transgender care for minors and adults. And that's expected to go in on Thursday.Several advocacy groups including the ACLU, and Lambda Legal have sued the Missouri AG over this rule. He responded to CNN about this lawsuit claiming, \"these organizations are racing in an effort to continue their ideologically-based procedures masquerading as medicine.\" Lambda Legal fired back in an e-mail to me saying that they've been working to overturn this rule in response to the Attorney General's decision to implement \"sweeping draconian regulations that threatened trans people's access to medically necessary care.\" And I should close with saying that gender-affirming care has been provided for decades. It is considered the standard of care by every major Medical association, Sara.",

A family spokesperson says the award-winning performer died this morning at the age of 96.After launching his career in the 1940s, Belafonte blazed a trail for African-American performers, becoming one of the first black leading men in all of Hollywood. CNN's Stephanie Elam is joining us now. It is impossible to overstate all that this man has done not just in the world of acting and singing, but in the world of civil rights. STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Of his humanitarian work. I was thinking, Sara, and you'll appreciate this. I was telling my daughter this morning that Harry Belafonte died and so, she went to listen to his music. And she said, these are all the songs of my childhood, which is hilarious for a kid to say. But it shows you the impact of his music. And so, if you're just going to say that his music was timeless, that children are still listening to it now, that'd be one thing. But he did so much more. This is a man who was a child born in New York from Jamaican immigrants. And was there and kind of fell into the arts accidentally working as a janitor and going in and seeing a performance of being swept up by it and thinking this is what I want to do. Going on and becoming in a workshop with the likes of like Marlon Brando, ending up in a band as well with like, you know, singing and then learning all of these tricks that he could do with his voice. And all of that and how we can move people. But that wasn't all that Harry Belafonte was. He was also very much a humanitarian, and a civil rights activist, so much so that even put his career on the line at different times and befriended people like MLK. But I just want to -- before we go into more of that friendship, I want you to also hear about the relationship he had with people younger than them -- than him and that he mentor. Take a listen to what just happened today. That Chris Wallace was sitting down with Smokey Robinson and asked him about Harry Belafonte. Listen to what Smokey Robinson, a legend in and of himself had to say about Harry Belafonte. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
