It comes after Israel carried out strikes against what it says are Islamic Jihad targets in Gaza for a second straight day on Wednesday.The Ministry of Health in Gaza says one person was killed in today's strike. The attackers, you can see in this video shared by the IDF, allegedly struck Islamic Jihad operatives as they traveled to a rocket launch site. Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins me live from Jerusalem. What's the latest, Elliott?",

      "sentences": "Max, the latest is that sirens continue to sound as far north as Tel Aviv. And also in the last few seconds, I'm receiving notes from the Israeli Defense Forces saying that sirens were sounding in Bat Yam, Holon and Rishon LeZion. These are kind of satellite towns of Tel Aviv as well.So the sirens keep sounding and the airstrikes keep continuing as well. Israel says that it is only targeting potential attackers and attacks emanating from the Gaza Strip towards Israel. And Daniel Hagari, the IDF's chief spokesman, pains to emphasize that they are only targeting Palestinian Islamic Jihad. They're not targeting Hamas because they say Hamas, the militant group that, of course, runs and rules the Gaza Strip, isn't involved, according to the IDF, but Hamas says otherwise. Now, for now, Israel remains solely focused on the militants of Islamic Jihad and on rocket launchers, weapons manufacturing sites, storage facilities, and the like. We've had reports, as you said, of another death today. We don't have more details on that just now. And that follows 16, 17 other fatalities in the Gaza Strip, including those Palestinian Islamic Jihad commanders and others that Israel says were planning to launch antitank missiles at Israel, which is what happened yesterday. And, of course, those airstrikes themselves by Israel were in response, they say, to more than 100 rockets being fired by Islamic Jihad towards Israel a week earlier. So there's no sense we were waiting. We had this eerie sense of calm, you know, for about 24 hours or so after Israel carried out those airstrikes. But certainly the response from Islamic Jihad that it promised has begun. I don't think anyone's under any illusions that we're just at the beginning of this conflict between Israel and the militants of Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. And as I say, they are sirens sounding in Tel Aviv and other towns, some 70 kilometers north of the Gaza Strip. For now, no casualties in Israel. A house was hit in Siddharth just surrounding the Gaza Strip. But most of those rockets coming from the militants of the Gaza Strip towards Israel have been taken out by Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. Max?",

Elliott in Jerusalem, thank you for the update.Now to Pakistan, where former Prime Minister Imran Khan has just been indicted on a corruption charge at a special court hearing in Islamabad. This comes a day after Khan's dramatic arrest by paramilitary troops in a separate corruption case, a move that has sparked protests nationwide. Khan denies all charges, calling them biased and political. CNN's Ivan Watson following all of this for us. Ivan, just take us through these different cases and the reactions.",

On Tuesday, a Manhattan federal jury found him liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996. The jury also found Mr. Trump defamed Carroll when he denied her allegations. Carroll calls the verdict a victory for her and all victims of abuse. In social media posts on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called the verdict a disgrace and a political witch hunt. His lawyer tried to put a positive spin on the decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Right now, NATO is keeping pretty much a low key approach. We don't have any kind of timetable or specific as to when this would take place. But this Indo-Pacific security is also going to be talked about at the upcoming G7 Summit in Hiroshima here in Japan starting next week. Max, the foreign minister did tell me that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been invited to attend and at this point, it looks like he will make an appearance, albeit virtually, but we'll make his presence known at that summit.

Marc Stewart in Tokyo, thank you.Now to Ukraine, where the military says it has inflicted huge losses on Russian forces near Bakhmut, the embattled eastern city that has been seeing fierce fighting for months now. Meanwhile, Kremlin-backed officials in the Zaporizhzhia region are evacuating civilians living in occupied towns. That includes the area around the nuclear power station. Ukrainian workers at the plant are not being allowed to leave, though, their family members are being evacuated. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in Zaporizhzhia and joins me now live.

      "sentences": "Yes, it is extraordinary themes, reversal against Russia here, a significant part of the front line apparently given up by conventional Russian troops who are seen on some footage put out by Ukrainian officials fleeing the area. Now, this was first brought to light indeed by Russia itself.Russia's mercenary head Yevgeny Prigozhin talking about how he'd lost 500 of his fighters holding and taking this particular area. But it was the conventional Russian military that appeared to have fled that was then confirmed by Ukrainian military figures as well, who claimed, and, you know, it's always hard to put too much stock into casualty numbers in this conflict, but claimed that 200 had been killed and 200 had been injured as Russia gave those positions up. But remember, this is a stark change in the narrative here. A few weeks ago, Russian forces were talking about the possibility they might be able to encircle the remaining Ukrainian holdout forces in the city, cutting off some of the last roads. Then we had this extraordinary public spat, Yevgeny Prigozhin demanding more artillery shells, pointing the finger squarely at the Russian Defense Ministry for not providing adequate resources for him. He threatened to leave today. Yesterday he said he hadn't, in fact, even received those artillery shells. And now today he's suggesting that the Russian conventional military has abandoned some positions that his men had fought and lost for. So a startling display of public disunity, frankly, from the Russians here. He's consistent in his criticism, vocal, frankly, almost in a way unheard of in Putin's Russia against the top brass of the Russian military. And Ukraine clearly seeking to capitalize upon this. It isn't clear if this marks the beginning of a broader Russian route around that city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian officials are saying it's not actually artillery shells that Russia appears to be short of there. They're saying the barrage continues as it always has done, but in fact, Wagner are running out of people on the ground. So certainly a testing moment around Bakhmut. It's been the singular objective of Russia, both Wagner and its conventional military, over all the winter. They said they'd take it by yesterday. They just simply haven't managed to achieve this one comparatively simple task, despite throwing thousands of men at a city which is strategically not that significant for Russia's broader goals here. So remarkable, frankly, that we're hearing this disunity and this reverse from Russia here and its fortunes on the front line. Max?",

In El Paso, Texas, migrants are being urged to turn themselves into immigration authorities ahead of the looming expiration of Title 42. That's the COVID era policy which empowered border agents to bypass standard procedures and swiftly expel migrants. But Title 42 will be allowed to expire Thursday, which means normal legal procedures will be in effect. Authorities encountered nearly 10,000 migrants along the southern border on Monday, continuing an upward trend in border arrests in recent weeks. The federal government estimates more than 150,000 migrants are waiting in shelters and on the streets of northern Mexico. Independent advisers with the Food and Drug Administration are expected to vote today on whether they'll recommend that the FDA make a birth control pill available over the counter for the first time ever in the United States. That pill, named Opill only uses the hormone progestin. The FDA's independent experts heard from the company that manufactures the medication on Tuesday as it made its case for why the pill should be more available, more easily available. But scientists have expressed concern about the pill's effectiveness in women who are overweight or obese. The vote by the panel is non-binding, and a final decision by the FDA is expected this summer. A new draft recommendation says women should start getting regular mammograms after the age of 40 instead of 50. The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force says breast cancer is treatable when caught early, and screening would reduce their risk of dying from the disease. CNN's Jacqueline Howard has more.",
