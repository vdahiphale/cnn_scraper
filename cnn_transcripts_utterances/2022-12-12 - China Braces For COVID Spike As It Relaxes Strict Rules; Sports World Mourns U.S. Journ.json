For the most at-risk group, over 80 age group, only 40 percent have received booster shots as of December 1. That's according to official data. And another factor, just not enough medical capacity in China. While the U.S. has 25 critical care beds per 100,000 people, according to the Organization for Cooperation Development, China has fewer than four for the same number. Last Wednesday, China dropped most of its strict zero-COVID curves following protests against the hardline policy. Mass testing has been rolled back and some people are allowed to quarantine at home. And today, China announced it will eliminate one of its digital track and trace services. Now, other systems, though, including the health Q.R. code, remain in place. As China slowly lets go of its top pandemic policy, one of the top disease experts is warning of a surge in cases. In an interview with state news agency over the weekend, Jo Nanan (ph) called for an intensified COVID-19 booster drive, especially as China's spring festival travel season nears. He says this, quote, \"Preparations need to be beefed up. I suggest those planning to travel back home get a booster shot so that, even with COVID-19 infection, they don't become seriously ill,\" unquote. Jo Nanan (ph) added that Omicron's fatality rate is in line with the flu, effectively downplaying the risks of COVID-19 as restrictions slowly ease across China. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN, Hong Kong.

He was just 49 years old. Tributes continue to pour in for the pioneer of U.S. soccer journalism. This from Secretary of State Tony Blinken, saying in a statement today, \"I so appreciated Grant Wahl whose writing captured not only essence of the beautiful game but also the world around it.\" CNN's Don Riddell joins live from Qatar. And Don, you wrote a touching piece for CNN.com on Wahl and your reaction to his sudden passing. Do we know how he died or a cause of death? DON RIDDELL, CNN ANCHOR, \"WORLD SPORT\": No, we don't know that yet, Ana. obviously, we do know that Grant's remains have been repatriated to the U.S. I understand they're arrived back home at roughly 8:30 this morning, accompanied by an official from the U.S. embassy in Doha. But we don't have further details. We do know that an autopsy is planned at some point. And really all we have to go on at this point is what Grant Wahl himself said about his health in the days before his passing. That he had been struggling with bronchitis or a similar condition, that he had felt a tightening of the chest, that he had been a workaholic and burning the candle at both ends for what is a really entertaining and exciting tournament to cover, but it can be a grueling one as well. So, those are really the only details that we have. Hopefully, we'll get something more official soon.",
