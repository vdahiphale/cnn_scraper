Lee is live at the White House this morning with that. M.J., good morning. The White House responding. How are they responding to these investigations? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Don, on these new threats of investigations and oversight from Republican lawmakers, the White House is saying there is politics at play and there's a good amount of hypocrisy too. They're pointing to the prior administration and also some of these very same House Republicans as having supported in the past deregulation of environmental protections and rail safety measures. Broadly speaking, the White House, of course, has really been on defense about this East Palestine train derailment that took place more than three weeks ago. The administration has faced a lot of questions about whether it acted with enough speed, whether it has been engaged enough. And that is why we have seen the White House insist over the last few days, that within two hours of learning about the accident, they had federal agents out on the scene and actually taking in what had happened and also over the week. The White House saying various federal agencies were going literally door-to-door to various residents in East Palestine to do health surveys, to pass out information so they know exactly what they can do if they're concerned about their health and have questions. But there is no question that the White House is making a full effort right now to try to quell some of the criticism that, again, the federal government has not been fully engaged in trying to deal with this problem.",

They have forged this tight bond. It's a kind of circumstantial bond based on the fact that they both feel the sense of hostility towards the United States.But if, in fact, Putin fails, if Russia fails in Ukraine, that begins to draw into doubt the project that China is engaged in, which is to try to make a case that the political system, that the autocratic system is a rival to the western system.
