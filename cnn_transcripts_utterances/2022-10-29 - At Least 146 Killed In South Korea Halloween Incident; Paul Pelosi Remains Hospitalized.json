Why did these people, you know -- why did this presume stampede happened but also a rapidly try to identify the people who were killed. People from South Korea and likely people from other countries as well, because it was people in their late teens and early 20s, young people who were out here in costume celebrating and something happened, something triggered this. And they ended up with a, as you mentioned, a pile of people packed into these narrow streets. I will just show you really quickly, Pamela, because the police have this area blocked off.

This was a targeted act. And of course, Pamela, this comes as we've seen this wave of violent rhetoric directed towards lawmakers. We know from this suspect social media profile he followed a series of conspiracy theories from election denying to COVID vaccines, the January 6 insurrections. And we've heard a lot of condemnation from lawmakers about how this rhetoric is leading to violence. I actually spoke yesterday, Pam, with Congresswoman Karen Bass, she was here in San Francisco and she said in her view, she can draw a direct line between the conspiracy theories about the election that the former president has been proffering. And the violence that took place here Friday. Watch. REP. KAREN BASS, (D) CALIFORNIA: The idea that he was violently attacked with a hammer, it's just frightening the level of political discourse that our country is in right now. And it reminds me of January 6, because when the insurrection has broken the Capitol, one of the first places they went was to the Speaker's office. They think that we all thought on election day, when Trump was defeated, that the Trump era was over.

I do think that we need for the rank-and-file members of Congress, we do need a better pathway for security for them and their families. So, they can govern appropriately.But for the political leadership of Congress, especially those and those who are in line for presidential succession, we need to have a different litmus test for them. We have to elevate the bar in terms of protection. And, you know, what we saw, with the residents, with Nancy Pelosi's residence in San Francisco, that should never have happened, right? That threat should never have gotten inside the home. So, we have to do a better job at actually protecting our political leaders at all levels. And the way that we're going to do that, again, is being smart about how we apply these control measures. And you're really, it's not just protecting an individual or a specific leader, this is about protecting our democratic process, our democracy as a whole. BROWN: Absolutely is. So, I want to put the numbers on the screen for you right now. According to Capitol Police, there were nearly 10,000 concerning statements or threats directed towards members of Congress this past year, that's up from about 4,000 in 2017. So, I know you talked about some of the political rhetoric. But let's talk a little bit more about what is behind this increase in threats.

So, Capitol police, FBI, law enforcement at large, they're going to follow a model that was actually put forth by the Secret Service when it comes to protective intelligence and threat analysis. And that's really looking at the means, the opportunity and the intent for the individual that making those threats to cause harm towards, you know, towards the target.Now, what's complicated these days is, one, the volume, right? We saw that rise from 4000 to 9000, concerning statements or direct threats made to members of Congress that's difficult to manage. Two, the way that those messages are being disseminated, digital media, social media, they're creating this instant pathway for threats to be made.

That's creating big drag on home sales.New construction purchases are down 11 percent since September and about 17.5 percent compared to this time last year. Danielle Hale joins us now. She's the chief economist for realtor.com. Daniel, thanks for coming on. This time of year, qualified buyers -- this time a year ago, I should say, qualified buys could get a mortgage for around 3 percent. That's more than doubled now. How many perspective buyers have been priced out by this spike in interest rates? DANIELLE HALE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, REALTOR.COM: I think the sales data show us that quite a few buyers have been priced out. If you look at the monthly payments with home prices the way they were a year ago, roughly 14 percent below where they are now and mortgage rates 3 percent, the cost of buying a home with a mortgage was $1,000 than what today's home shoppers are facing. To put that in comparison, that's more than 70 percent increase. And we're all getting very familiar with percentage increases now because of inflation. Inflation is up about 8 percent to 9 percent. The cost of a mortgage is moving up much faster than the pace of overall inflation. That's been really challenging for a lot of home shoppers.",

That all factors into this.Are most potential home buyers just deciding to rent or are they looking in neighborhoods farther out that are more affordable? What trends are you seeing? HALE: A combination of all of this above. We are seeing more households continue to rent. That's keeping the rental market relatively competitive. There's not a lot of vacancy. It's hard to find a rental. At the same time, some home shoppers are looking into further out in the suburbs. And in some cases, looking in different markets entirely. This is really benefitting affordable markets that we see in the northeast, the Midwest and some parts of the south. We recently released an index with the \"Wall Street Journal,\" our Emerging Housing Index. And the number-one market was Johnson City, Tennessee. It's an affordable market. It's attracting a lot of buyers from a lot of places because the real estate dollars stretch further and where those prices are much more affordable.",

Because consumers are really trying to make their dollar stretch further against this higher inflation, against higher housing costs. And it's getting harder and harder to do. I think we will be in for an interesting couple of months. We're heading into holiday season and where we see consumers make lots of holiday expenditures. It will be interesting to see whether they can keep up the pace. The savings data doesn't give me a lot of confidence for this holiday season.",

While they say they don't see signs of eruption as imminent, experts recorded 36 small earthquakes there between Thursday and Friday. Of course, Mauna Loa's rumblings are nothing new. Back during an actual eruption in the 1930s, the Air Force bombed its lava to keep it from reaching a nearby city. It is exactly one month now since Hurricane Ian tore into southwest Florida. And for many residents, the storm's impact remains very real. Some areas still have no electricity or running water and schools are still closed. As Carlos Juarez shows us, many people are either still waiting for relief or confused about what they're receiving.

And the pile of garbage and debris around Kimberly Payano's neighborhood and outside her north Ft. Myers house grows by the day. Most of what she owned is ruined.
