The former president and all his alleged co-conspirators now must answer a critical question, go slow or go speedy. It is tricky for both prosecutors and for Mr. Trump. Ask different lawyers and you'll find varying answers about the strength of the Fulton County case against the president. And in case that wasn't enough to keep track of, yet another legal fight over what the Constitution allows already is taking shape. I want to bring in now Jamie Raskin, the congressman from Maryland. Thank you so much, Congressman, for joining me. Let's start with the question of what I was just mentioning, which is the fourth arrest. You have seen, first of all, how incredibly viral this mug shot has gone? Given how intensely political it was -- it is and that is obviously an expected thing, do you think taking that mug shot was necessary? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  Well, I think the critical thing is that Donald Trump and his co-defendants be treated exactly like everybody else would be treated in a similar prosecution. Fani Willis, the prosecutor involved, has undertaken numerous state RICO prosecutions, and as long as this is consistent with everything that's happened before, I think it's the right thing to do.",

It applies to a pattern of racketeering activity that is organizing people together into a conspiracy in order to achieve an illegal end, in this case the overthrow of a presidential election and substituting a counterfeit process made up of fake electors for the actual process that the people voted on.So there are lots of component criminal parts to it and there were a lot of people involved, and that to me seems as if it's custom made for a RICO prosecution the way that we've developed it.

You can just think about a federal official employee who engages in abank robbery or a murder, obviously the state would get to prosecute them. That is a statute which says that if a federal office or employee is conducting their federal work under an order from a superior to execute a federal policy, then they can petition to have that removed to federal court. If they're being prosecuted for work they were doing as part of their job. So, that, of course, raises the question, when Mark Meadows tries to remove from Georgia state court to federal court, whether he was actually engaged in the work of the federal government and he was acting pursuant to a federal policy, the court is going to have to rule on that. In any event, even if it is removed, all that this means is that the federal court will conduct the state criminal prosecution under the auspices of the federal judiciary.",

Donald Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection against the union and then 57 of 100 senators determined as a constitutional fact that Donald Trump had incited an insurrection.

And, in fact, he wasted little time going on offense attacking his potential rivals on the other side of the ballot on abortion. But days after Republicans tangled in Milwaukee, Mr. Biden finds himself questioning -- trying to answer a question that's hard to shake. 436 days from the 2024 election, should he be the Democrat on the ballot in 14 months? His age and economic pessimism leave some inside of the party saying, maybe there should be another option. Let's talk to my next guest about all of that, Democratic governor, J. B. Pritzker of Illinois. He was a member of the Biden advisory team. Thank you so much for joining me, sir. You are -- I think you're currently on the president's advisory board for re-election. Recent national polling has him neck-and-neck against Donald Trump, a candidate who, of course, was just arrested for the fourth time. Why is it so close? GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL):  Well, let's face it. All of the attention's been on the Republican side with the in- fighting and the debate that just went on. They can't decide on who the challenger on their side is going to be to Donald Trump, and it appears that the guy who is rising in the polls and the one who is going to be the big challenger to Donald Trump will be Ramaswamy, who I just heard on your program say that he thinks that racism is over in the United States and that white supremacist is OK. I think the American people understand that that's not where they are and that's extreme. In fact, we see a smorgasbord of extremism on their side of the aisle where Joe Biden is just doing his job, and for the last two and a half years gotten more done than most presidents get done in eight years for working families across the United States.",

So, each of them tempered themselves. And I think, in this debate, you saw Republicans refuse to do that in most cases. And so, ultimately, the goal is, yes, to win a primary, but it is to persuade the majority of Americans. And I think that this debate, watched by a lot of Americans who were not Republican primary voters, may serve to alienate them.",
