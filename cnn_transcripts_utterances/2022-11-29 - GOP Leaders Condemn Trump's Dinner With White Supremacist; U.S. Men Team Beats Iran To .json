He talks about there is a mythology about what police officers can do.So, what we need to make clear is that, first, this is not consistent with the movement in most jurisdictions towards non-law enforcement intervention in mental health issues. That's the rise of the 6-1-1 phone number, that if people do seem disturbed, even if nonviolent, you do not want to have police come in because of just the nature of the potential conflict. The second is, of course, if you are saying, as the mayor was saying, that you can commit nonviolent people, perhaps even involuntarily, what is the trigger that is going to convince a police officer or a fire official that that person is in fact a threat? And that gap seems to me to be something that has to be filled by the mayor and public policy people.

That's kind of the biggest number we've seen in New York since the Great Depression. now, the old standard was, for someone to be picked up and forced to go for a psychiatric evaluation or to be involuntarily commit, they had to pose serious risk of imminent harm to themselves or others.The new standard has expanded. The law has not changed. The interpretation of it has. The new standard is persons who appear to be mentally ill and who display an inability to meet basic living needs, even where there is no recent dangerous act. So, to talk about, you know, what are the standards, they give a number of case studies in the memoranda which are being studied, and there are co-response teams that are mixed with police and clinicians.

You could see that. You know it was not about that joke. You know that joke may have been a culmination of a lot of things that maybe he had been bottling up. I will say this, though. Hearing him say he was going through something that night was very interesting because when we were on the red carpet, my co-host Kevin Frazier and I, and Will came in with Jada on the Oscar red carpet, they just kind of breezed by. It was very odd. He did not talk to anybody. He did not say anything. And that is so unlike Will Smith. So, we both looked at each other that night and said, something going on?
