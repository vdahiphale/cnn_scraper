Just ahead, anger is spreading in France over the government's decision to force through its pension reform without a vote in the National Assembly. We'll be live in Paris.Then China has announced that President Xi Jinping will travel to Moscow next week for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin rather details of their agenda. And new smelly, massive seaweed is heading to the U.S. state of Florida, already affected by the accumulations of algae on its shores. CNN speaks to residents about how they are preparing for the impact. America's biggest banks have come together to try to help a smaller bank that was on the brink. First Republic Bank is set to receive a $30 billion lifeline from 11 large banks the largest U.S. banks. Shares of First Republic began sliding after last week's failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last weekend. The money will give First Republic much needed cash to meet customer withdrawals and build confidence in the U.S. banking system. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was on Capitol Hill Thursday assuring lawmakers that there's no crisis with American banks and markets across Asia, the Asia-Pacific region have spent the day in positive territory as a result. So it all seemed to work. This is how the European markets are currently looking, they're up. I can tell you, although we can't show you exactly how much at the moment or they're down now, but only marginally. Let's bring in CNN's Chief Business Correspondent, Christine Romans to sort this entire out for us. And actually, considering the conversations we've been having Christine, there's been quite a positive story to tell here that the system did react and the markets responded positively.",

      "sentences": "Yes, trying to draw a line under this crisis and show that on many fronts from the FDIC, Treasury regulators, banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, and now the banks themselves trying to contain this problem. This is really the biggest banks in the United States throwing a lifeline to one of their competitors, because the feeling here is of course, financial stability is for the public good, right?And financial instability is bad for business for these other banks, as well. I mean, some of the reporting on the inside back, and you know, back channel negotiations between a Jamie Dimon the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary and trying to get all of this together. And what is really in recent decades been an unprecedented rescue of the industry by itself, putting $30 billion into First Republic, a smaller competitor to these other banks, because there were deposits flowing out the door every day. Now the CEO of that company, the company says that those deposits are slowing the outflow is slowing and so that appears to be a sign of stabilization. But again, this is a remarkable series of events you have the Fed with a new lending facility that has been led to get $12 billion has been lent out under this new Fed facility. We know the disc the so called discount window, lending out records amounts tapped at the discount window. And then you have the banking sector itself, lend - putting money injecting money into this smaller rival so just a remarkable moment here, as everyone tries to say and reassure like the Treasury Secretary did yesterday, Max that we got this under control.",

Look at these live pictures coming in to us right now.Huge crowds and the streets pretty much deserted the roads rather deserted there. On the left earlier today, demonstrators angry over the retirement age being raised from 62 to 64 blocking Paris's ring road for 45 minutes disrupting the morning commute before being dispersed by police. And at least 310 people were detained on Thursday after impromptu protests broke out across the country. We'll have a live report from Paris coming up in just a few minutes' time we can see the extent of the anger in those images. Slovakia's Prime Minister says promises must be kept to see announced that his country will send 13 fighter jets to Ukraine. Slovakia has just become the second NATO member to pledge the aircraft. Poland says it'll supply four Soviet era MiG-29 jets to Kyiv in the coming days. Warsaw's move could be a catalyst for other countries to follow suit, the Kremlin brushing off the pledges. [08:05:00] CNN's Ivan Watson is following all the developments joins us from Kharkiv in Northeast Ukraine. The big question being then, Ivan, whether or not these moves by these European states will open the door for the United States to also send these fighter jets?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and after Poland made its announcement yesterday, the White House basically said that American F-16 going to Ukraine for now, that is not on the table. But these are kind of incremental announcements of ongoing support for the beleaguered Ukrainian government.The tweet coming from the Slovakian Prime Minister saying that, \"Military aid is key to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself and all of Europe against Russia\". This isn't the first time that Slovakia and Poland those governments are declared that they were going to provide these MiG fighter jets to Ukraine. There were some announcements last year that they then have to step back from the Polish government saying that those four MIG's that they've promised could come within a matter of days, and then more after that. Would they transform the battlefield? Probably not, because most of this war is currently being fought on the ground by infantry, and with artillery, with both militaries burning through just incredible amounts of ammunition. It is a test of manpower between much larger Russia and Ukraine and logistics and ammunition, but they are symbolic, largely symbolic gestures as well and it also contributes because Russia never established aerial superiority over Ukraine. It's still quite dangerous for Russian warplanes to fly into Ukrainian airspace because of the Ukrainian air defenses. Meanwhile, the war on the ground continues. It's a war of attrition, it is grinding. We're getting statements from Ukrainian Military Commanders from the British Ministry of Defense that the tempo of Russian attacks along the Eastern front has diminished somewhat, but that doesn't make life any easier for civilians living in these frontline communities that have been pounded day and night for months now by a Russian long range artillery. Meanwhile, Ukrainians are looking somewhat nervously at the impending visit of the Chinese President Xi Jinping to Moscow. China, which purports to be neutral in this conflict, has never criticized Russia for its invasion of Ukraine never criticized openly Russia for occupying Ukrainian territory and then declaring that it is going to annex it. But the Ukrainians would much rather that a China claim some kind of neutrality than openly arm the Russians in this terrible and bloody test of wills, Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, well, what we're hearing from U.S. Officials is that the Russians have reached that crash site. And they have been able to collect some small pieces of debris, some small fragments, like Plexiglas things that are not all that significant from that crash site.But as far as the U.S. goes, we are not being informed of any debris that the U.S. has been able to collect. And the reason for that is that the U.S. has no naval assets in the Black Sea that can readily retrieve that debris in the U.S. has said that they are assessing the possibility of going to the crash site and seeing if they can collect anything. But ultimately, they don't believe that there's going to be anything of value really, that even the Russians can get because the drone when it crashed into the Black Sea. The U.S. believes that it craps that it basically broke into several pieces. And the U.S. importantly wiped that drone have any sensitive information. So they don't believe that the Russians can get anything of value from the remnants of that drone. But we're also learning that the U.S. is assessing its drone operations over the Black Sea moving forward because they don't want this to happen again, right? And so they are assessing whether or not there are ways that they can better de- conflict with the Russians, who are of course, conducting operations over the Black Sea as well as part of their invasion of Ukraine. Now, the flights in the meantime, during this assessment, they have not stopped those drone flights, we're told have actually continued since the incident happened of the collision between the Russian fighter jets and that drone earlier this week. And in fact, just hours after that collision happened, the U.S. sent another drone up over the Black Sea to monitor what the Russians were doing in terms of collecting that debris and seeing how they were reacting to the crash. So the U.S. clearly not deterred here in terms of flying those missions, but they are looking at ways that they can better de- conflict and figure out really the value of the intelligence gathering capabilities versus the risk of escalation with Russia, Max.",
