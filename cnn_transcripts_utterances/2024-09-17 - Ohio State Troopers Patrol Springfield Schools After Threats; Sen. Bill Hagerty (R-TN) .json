And one of the prevailing things that I've heard from many people is, yes, sure, from that particular debate, many, particularly in the Haitian community, were surprised to hear those things come about.But more broadly, you look at what's happened over the past few days here, yes, the governor has said that these -- these believed threats to the school system, city buildings, and more over the past few days were believed to be hoaxes coming from overseas. But they did have a very real effect here in the sense that students still had to be evacuated from buildings. City -- city buildings had to be evacuated as well. And it created a general sense of tension over the past few days. And as you mentioned, now, they decided to make a stand and say that schools will be opened. But they've deployed nearly 40 extra Ohio State Highway Patrol members to these schools just to assist and actually sweep through these schools to essentially combat any potential further messages or hoaxes. Again as the government now has described it as well. I want to play some sound for you from - this is a Haitian immigrant, of course, that I spoke to here who actually goes to one of the schools, Clark State College, that was -- now, that is now virtual, I should, say. They were not evacuated or canceled. But take a listen to some of what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As some have come, word has spread.But it's gotten to the point where it makes up -- they make up about 25 percent of about 58,000-person population here. And it has led to real strains on resources in regard to traffic accidents, as we've heard from officials, but also some health resources and also housing resources as well. So that was the backdrop before all of the national politics got involved. And of course, that has only inflamed some tensions. But interestingly enough, that Haitian immigrant I spoke to told me, when I asked him, is Springfield still a great place to live even through all of it, and he unequivocally said, yes, because here is a place where he believes he has opportunity, one that he didn't have back home in Haiti.",

Boris, normally, I would be able to predict at this moment what they do. And it's really tough. I will say for American borrowers out there, actually, it's about the destination, not the journey. So whatever they do tomorrow, look at their projections because we'll get a sense of how much they plan to cut, particularly over the next six to 12 months.
