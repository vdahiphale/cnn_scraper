But the E.U.'s second biggest economy is facing political gridlock after no party won an outright majority. I'm here for the coming hours for you in Paris, where earlier, it looked like France's prime minister was heading for the exits until President Macron asked him to stay put for now. And this comes after Sunday's second round parliamentary vote that saw a left wing alliance win the most seats in a stunning turnaround. As you can see that right there in your screen, the French headlines really tell the story. Amazement followed by the big question. Now what? And it's important to note the far right national rally pushed third into third place had been expected to come out on top. But now, with no single party winning outright, France is facing hung parliament. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARINE LE PEN, FRENCH FAR-RIGHT LEADER (through translator):  The quagmire that I warned about has, of course, come true. France will be totally blocked with three groups that have more or less the same influence in the National Assembly. Well, we're going towards that. It's sad. GABRIEL ATTAL, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  I know that in the light of tonight's results, a good many French people feel very unsure about the future because there is no absolute majority.

We've just been hearing from asource speaking to CNN, a source close to Emmanuel Macron, on the fact that at this stage, they simply don't know whether there will be a government in place in time for the opening ceremony of the Olympics. So, you can see there on the National Assembly the reminder of what should be Paris' big event this month, which for now is being overshadowed by the political chaos that's ensued from this election, 18 days to the opening ceremony. What the source tells CNN is that it is impossible to tell yet whether there'll be a government in place in time for those games. The negotiations are happening even as we speak. And even if you want to consider how difficult those negotiations are going to be, to give you an idea, Isa, you need to understand that it will, no doubt, take negotiations amongst several different parties on the left that have traditionally found it very difficult to coexist and cooperate. So, just finding a candidate they can all agree on is going to be something of a challenge. The negotiations are ongoing. For now, though, Gabriel Attal remains in his caretaker role. But until France has a prime minister who can therefore name a government, it is going to be a period of complete political deadlock and chaos. And even when, and assuming that they do manage to find agreement on who the candidate should be to become the next prime minister, that that person then becomes the next French prime minister. You're looking at a period of cohabitation between Emmanuel Macron and someone who will come from that left-wing alliance. Again, a number of parties who've been very opposed to what he had to do on a number of issues these last few months and years, Isa.",

We heard very early in the day from PedroSanchez, who -- the Spanish prime minister, who sort of drew the similarity between sort of a left-leaning coalition there, potentially being formed in France to govern the country, the one in the U.K., the sort of left-of- center government that's arrived there, and what they have in Spain. So, you know, trying to sort of draw some positive conclusions from it. But, of course, we're not there yet on the French government, and a hung parliament is something that would be a worry for allies and partners in Europe. The German chancellor has alluded as much, the deputy chancellor said it specifically, but the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he hoped that France would be able to form a constructive government because they play an important role in the European Union. Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, said, look, you know, excitement in Paris, disappointment in Moscow, relief in Kyiv, and if that's what there is, he said, then that's good enough for us in Warsaw. And he's a very experienced European politician, having served as a European Commission president, you know, had to wrangle all those European Union leaders in one room together. And if one, an important one like President Macron, is unable to function effectively, then he knows what that does to the rest of the room.

But obviously, when you have figures like President Macron, who may be weakened, and also, let's not forget Olaf Scholz, his coalition government is not the strongest, as well. If the NATO countries individually are not strong and their leaders can't be strong, then the question becomes, does that make the whole entity less strong? Of course, they'll want to put that strong message out when they're in Washington, but perhaps behind closed doors there, President Macron will be able to ally the fears of some of his contemporary leaders about what's going to happen in France next, that they can pull together an effective, constructive coalition that will allow him to have these strong policies that the rest of Europe has come to expect.

When you ask if it'senough, you're asking that because you're hearing from a lot of whispers, anonymous quotes and the five elected Democrats who are saying that President Biden needs to step aside. What I think is not being talked about enough are the grassroots voters, the people that the campaign is hearing from, the people that all of the grassroots of the Democratic Party are hearing from, women's rights groups, immigration rights groups, Latino voters, black voters, young voters, so many of whom are saying we are sticking with President Biden. He has had our back for the last four years. He rescued this economy when it was spiraling after the disastrous four years of Donald Trump. If, for example, if you're a Latino voter in this country and you live in a mixed status family, the executive action that President Biden took to give your family members a pathway to citizenship is transformational. If you're a black voter who had massive student debt, the student loan forgiveness program is transformational for your family. If you're a woman who is looking to raise a daughter such as me, who now has less rights in this country than I did, that is not something that is acceptable to you. And if you're a normal, common sense American who wants our democracy to continue to be a democracy, then you know that this election is existential. You know the contrast between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, that there is really no -- no other choice than somebody like Joe Biden. And while President Biden had a horrendous debate, Donald Trump had a horrendous debate, too, if you focused on what he said, which was such a dangerous kind of vision for the country.",

It might not exist today. We will know what will happen to NATO if Donald Trump wins in 2024. It may not exist in the next four years. This president brought NATO together. This president strengthened NATO. This president also got a lot of the other countries to pay more into NATO, which was Donald Trump's big message. So, I think this president needs to continue to demonstrate to world leaders, to Americans, that he is the one leader that will offer stability, that will offer experience, that will offer common sense global leadership at a time when the world is on fire and you need somebody who understands the nuances of the history of what's going on around the world, has those relationships with all of the global leaders that are critical to what's going on and to peace and stability around the world.

But what we're learning, Eleni, is that this was a sophisticated Russian attack all across the country, starting around 10 o'clock in the morning local time. Some 38 missiles, the Air Force said, were fired by the Russians, different kinds, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles. Thirty of those 38 were intercepted, they say. But, of course, the remaining caused a significant amount of damage. Of course, the shrapnel falling to the ground also causes a significant amount of damage. One of the biggest targets that was hit was that children's hospital in Kyiv, the biggest children's hospital in the country, which does so much work, including on children who have cancer. At last count, some two adults had been killed and 16 people wounded. But CNN spoke earlier with the mayor of Kyiv, Vitaly Klitschko, who said that that death toll could certainly go up, that they're hearing people beneath the rubble. Now, President Zelenskyy has vowed that there will be a forceful response. He has called for a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council, which is now due to take place tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. in New York. But, Eleni, already this NATO summit here in D.C. set to start tomorrow was going to be focused so much on Ukraine. Now, the importance of NATO shoring up its support, making sure that the systems are in place for continued support to Ukraine, becoming all the more vital. For the past few months, what we've been hearing time and time again from Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian leaders is not just the needs for those offensive weapons, artillery and missiles, but for air defenses to guard the cities, for Patriot air systems and others to guard Ukrainian cities. And now, this series of strikes all across Ukraine, which killed at least 36 people with the potential for that number to go up, really driving home the point that NATO allies need to do all they can to get more air defense to Ukraine.

But what we have seen since then is the Israeli military has had to continue going back on the ground into areas of the Gaza Strip where Hamas has basically reestablished a presence. This is a very dangerous and long- term game of whack-a-mole, it seems. And the latest iteration of that came overnight as the Israeli military issued evacuation orders and then went back into parts of Gaza City, the second time that it has had to do so since it withdrew from Gaza City much, much earlier in the war. And it seems absent a ceasefire agreement and absent a long-term strategy for an alternative governance structure in Gaza, this is what we are going to continue to see in Gaza. Eleni.",

They managed to agree on a program -- 27 pages of program, pretty detailed, you know, given how fast they had to come together. Now, whether they can survive the pressures of having to form a government, that's the big unknown right now. And certainly Macron and his camp are trying very hard to split them and divide them and trying to peel away from the far-left, let's say the center-left, but even some of the Greens.",

If all of these come together and they agree on a coalition government, they become the biggest group, but no one has an absolute majority, which means that any version of a government will always be extremely vulnerable to being toppled by a no-confidence vote.",

One is the one you started with,which is that the far-right is at a historic level and a historic number of seats in Parliament, and that just can't be spun as, you know, a win. The two other things is that Macron said, when he called for snap elections, that he wanted to get a Parliament that was more governable, with a clearer majority. We are actually in the opposite of that. We have the most unstable, the most ungovernable parliament since General Charles de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic, which is the current political regime in France. We also have another issue, which is that Macron actually is weakened after the snap election. Even the hold that he used to have on his own parliamentary group, which was utterly complete in 2017, they all owed him their seats in parliament. Today, his group is a hundred less -- a hundred seats less. They lost a hundred seats.

Now,here in Port Lavaca, along the central coastline of Texas, we were largely spared from the worst of the storm. We've got wind, we've got rain, but spared from the worst damage. Now, the same cannot be said. Just about 100 kilometers to our north and east in downtown Houston, this area was racked hard by strong winds and extremely heavy rain causing localized flash flooding. In fact, get this. Houston actually received its first hurricane-force winds from a named tropical system since 2008 when Hurricane Ike struck the region. That's really saying something. Now, the heavy rain also has flooded local roadways within the areas, causing rapid river rises, as well. So, that is a concern going forward as additional rain is still on the forecast for Houston and points north and east as the system tries to exit the region. Now, it's lost its energy source, which is the warm Gulf of Mexico waters directly behind me. So, as it moves away from the ocean, it no longer can feed off of the warm ocean waters. So, it is on the weakening trend. That's the good news. But it's still going to rinse out all of that moisture it picked up from the ocean and deposit it in the form of heavy rainfall across much of the central parts of the U.S. So, that's what we're going to track for the next couple of days as the system barrels towards the border of Canada and U.S. by Wednesday and Thursday, bringing a wide swath of heavy rain and the potential for severe thunderstorms as it continues to spin and rotate across that region.
