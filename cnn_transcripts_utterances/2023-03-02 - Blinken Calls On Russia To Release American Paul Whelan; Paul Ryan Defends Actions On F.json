So the Justice Department is taking the position that, certainly, presidents have a level of immunity while they are in office and even after they leave office. But in this case, because of the violence involved, it's not the same thing. So I'll read a part of what it says in this brief filed in court today with the appeals court: It says, \"No part of a president's official responsibilities includes the imminent private violence.\" And the Justice Department is taking a position that they want the appeals court to issue a narrow ruling. They want them to essentially allow for perhaps the president to claim immunity in other things, for instance, political or electoral speech, but not for things related to this. They are also not taking a position, Abby, on whether the former president has immunity on criminal matters. So that's something that is going to be very relevant as the investigations continue into January 6th, something that the special counsel is looking at -- Abby?",

He's looking at a possible trial. He's looking at damages. But the larger significance is in the coming possible criminal cases that Georgia -- Atlanta D.A. has said that charges are eminent there. There's been much analysis about whether that includes the president. And even though DOJ goes out of its way to say, well, we're not reaching the criminal cases, this is a sign of DOJ saying, staging an attempted coup is outside the outer-most boundary. The legal term is outer penumbra of a president's duties. So it's a bad sign for him if he gets charged in Georgia or other criminal cases.",

So legally, FOX is exposed to potentially a massive verdict in this case for libel. It's ethically wrong. When you see something like that -- when I was the ethics in the White House, our philosophy was, you have to speak out. You have to stop the wrongdoing. Not just say, oh, I gave my opinion. And I think it's politically disastrous because this election-denial ideology has hit the Republicans in swing states, where you had election deniers running on these continuing lies. They ran well behind so-called Team Normal in the Republican Party. So on every front, Paul Ryan's behavior is far short of what of he should have done.",

The pair say they've been asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage, the five- bedroom home that the queen gifted them for their wedding. CNN royal commentator and history, Kate Williams, is joining us now. Kate, for those not on the inside, from the outside, this kind of looks like retaliation after this tell-all period for both Harry and Meghan. What do you think it is? KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL COMMENTATOR &amp; HISTORIAN: Well, Abby, we did hear initially that the movement for evicting Harry and Meghan from Frogmore Cottage happened not long after the publication of \"Spare\" back in January. And it seems that the king has made the decision that it's not their home anymore. We understand they're unhappy about this. Sources say they're distressed. That they consider it their house. It looks like what the king is doing is really moving around. So Prince Andrew, a disgraced member of the royal family, he has a large property near Windsor Castle. It has a swimming pool. It's gigantic. It seems that the king wants him to move into Frogmore Cottage, Harry and Meghan to move out, and someone to move into Royal Lodge, Andrew's house, possibly William and Kate, we don't know yet. But the royals said, look, Harry and Meghan can stay at Windsor Castle. But it's not the same. It's their home. So certainly, I think Charles is really getting tough here. That's what he's saying.

And I think Harry and Meghan feel very strongly. They loved it. They've got memories there. But also, they suffered for it. Because let's not forget, in the British press and press all over the world, how much they were criticized for the $2.4 million that was spent on this property to renovate it.
