There are some smaller brands, though, John, that are getting involved in politics because they feel like they align more with their customer base. The brand Away, a suitcases company, has put out I am Voter suitcases for celebrities to post on Instagram. You see Halle Berry right there. They feel like it does engage with their customer base. So, it's really, John, about knowing your audience, knowing what your audience is going to like. And at the end of the day, it should be non-partisan. If you endorse a candidate or you don't endorse a candidate and say that outright, you run into a situation like \"The Washington Post,\" which is losing tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of subscribers right now.
