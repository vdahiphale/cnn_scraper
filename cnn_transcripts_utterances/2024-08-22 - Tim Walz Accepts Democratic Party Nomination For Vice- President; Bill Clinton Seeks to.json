For many walls came out of nowhere, and we Minnesota tried to get offended when you think that the GPS says nowhere when you go to Minnesota, but another day. But for many people, even a governor and former congressman, seemed unfamiliar when Kamala Harris picked up the phone and called the Minnesota Governor and asked him to run with her, told the governor of the home of the Golden Gophers that they were, in fact, underdogs, and tonight, Walz delivered that message in a way some say only a former high school football coach could.

The two members of the \"Pod Save America\" crew because they were two of the most critical voices for Joe Biden sticking in the race earlier this year. And so I was really interested in catching up with them to get an understanding of how they think the campaign's been going since Kamala Harris, of course, became the likely and now actual Democratic nominee.
