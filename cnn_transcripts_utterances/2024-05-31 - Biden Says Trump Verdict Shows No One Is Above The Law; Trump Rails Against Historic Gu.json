Judge Grasso, Karen Friedman Agnifilo as well.The political impact now, some new polling from Reuters-Ipsos, it appears to show Republican voters doing what Republican lawmakers have been doing since the verdict, namely falling in line. Take a look at the row in the middle of the screen. Post-conviction, 14 percent say they would not vote for the former president. Pre-trial, 24 percent said they would not vote for him if he were a convicted felon. Said another way, Republicans in this poll say they are now more likely to vote for the former president since he became a felon. Joining us now two CNN political commentators from the right and left respectively, David Urban and Van Jones. Van, I mean, you see Republicans support for the former president has grown post-conviction, at least in that poll. Should the Biden campaign be worried about a similar effect do you think in swing voters?",

And so, it's not surprising that you're seeing this kind of effect.

So clearly crime does pay for the former president, at least when it comes to fundraising.But that's not a big shocker to me, Anderson, because that's something we've seen before. Look at the big Trump fundraising day so far. What do they all have in common? They all have to do with crime or being in court. You know, you go back last year, the New York arraignment, right? You go back last year, that Fulton County, that Georgia mugshot. And now today or yesterday, what we saw again was another thing involving Donald Trump. And the courtroom, big fundraising, and this is something I think a lot of people need to get through their heads. Earlier on this year, there was all this talk about this Joe Biden fundraising advantage. Well, last month, Donald Trump and the RNC out raised the Democrats and Joe Biden. This is probably going to be another month, May, another month, where Donald Trump is able to out raise Joe Biden. Money is probably not going to be the difference in this election. The fact is, both parties are going to have a lot of money to compete come November.",
