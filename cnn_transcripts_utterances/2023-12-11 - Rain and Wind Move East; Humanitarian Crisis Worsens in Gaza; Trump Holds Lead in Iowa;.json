Very similar images of women and children being pulled out of the rubble, rushed to hospitals in southern Gaza as we saw in the northern part of the strip.And, yesterday, Israel's national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, saying that Israel's offensive likely can't be measured in weeks and perhaps not even in months, making very clear that Israel is going to continue to push forward up until it reaches its goal of destroying Hamas and capturing or killing Hamas' leader.

(END VIDEO CLIP) DIAMOND: And Secretary Blinken also making clear that Israel needs to establish better deconfliction routes and times for humanitarian aid to get into Gaza for civilians to be able to flee. Look, Israel has been directing civilians to move to Rafah, for example, in southern Gaza, but the ability of Gazans to actually do that is very, very difficult.

So, it is a commanding lead and an historic one. And he's at majority support. That's key.You've noted there's been change over time. Trump is up eight points since this same poll in October, from 43 to 51. DeSantis is up 3. Haley is holding steady at 16 percent. And I would just note, guys, when you dig into these numbers, things that have been true throughout this year remain true. Trump's supporters are the most committed and the most enthusiastic. They are least likely to say they're going change their minds. In fact, half the Republican electorate in Iowa says their mind is made up. And the other key point, 63 percent of first-time caucus goers say they're backing Trump. That's 50 points ahead of anybody else.

So, unless that changes dramatically, this isn't going to change dramatically LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. And it shows that also the debates have not been helping these candidates, the rivals of Trump, because of the fact that since October he has increased by, what, David said eight points or so. So that means that more and more are rallying around Trump, including new caucus-goers. I mean Trump, right now it looks like, is going to be the nominee unless, as you said, Poppy, something dramatically changes.

People are saying, you know what, I'm willing to write that off because things were better three years ago for me than they are today.
