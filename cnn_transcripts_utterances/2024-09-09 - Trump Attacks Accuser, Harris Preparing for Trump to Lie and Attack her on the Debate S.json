If as the polling suggests, she will be making a first impression on so many voters. Now, in that same polling, just nine percent said they need to learn more about the former president. Trump spent much of the weekend on familiar ground suggesting, yet again, with no evidence yet again, that this election will not be free and fair and threatening campaign and election officials.

So that his depravity of justice does not happen again\". He went on, \"Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our country\".

We do know, obviously we've reported that he has these policy sessions in which he talks to his leading advisers about various policy and how to pivot away from specific questions to the topics they want him to focus on, like immigration, like inflation and the economy, like crime. And whether or not that works, we'll see on the debate stage on Tuesday, but I can tell you this, talking to a number of his allies, the big concern they have is not what he says about a policy, but it's whether or not he lets Kamala Harris get under his skin and whether or not he lobs those personal attacks. They want him to stay away from all of that. They are very keenly aware of, obviously of his tone and temperament and think that it could be bad if he has any reactive moments to Kamala Harris. They have stressed this to him. They are just hoping that Donald Trump, who shows up on Tuesday abides by this, listens, and stays calm.",

That's why the Republicans are in all-out panic mode because they want him to be something that he's not. So, the pressure in this debate in my opinion is on Donald Trump because she's got room to grow to your point earlier, there's 28 percent of the American public that don't yet know her, so she's got room to grow. There's very little percent of the country that doesn't know Donald Trump and he cannot pivot, he can't present another Donald Trump and it is proving the point that people are over a third season Donald Trump, they don't want it any longer. So he's got the pressures on him tomorrow night to show the American people something different. And I don't think that he can.",

Because those are the details that make it come to life, that the kind of person it is.I mean, as we've been reading that Harris has been preparing for days and watching all of the old Trump debates. And then she was slammed by Trump for having locked herself in and prepared too much. And he feels like he can be easy with her because he's got a great experience. But that same echo -- this is why I always go back to history, right? The same dynamic was there in 1960 where Nixon was sure he was the better debater. He didn't prepare for it. He was campaigning until the day of it. He was in seclusion on the day of it. And JFK prepared for days and days and days, even to the extent where they were each given a chance to go to the TV studio to look at the backdrop. And Kennedy's people went, and they saw that it was a gray backdrop, so they made sure he had a blue suit on. Nixon didn't go, so he wore a gray suit and sort of melted into the backdrop. You know, but more importantly, Kennedy had 105 bad (ph) cards. He had memorized anticipated questions and anticipated rebuttals to Nixon, and he sat on his bed the morning of the debate, flipping them off to the floor, as he memorized each one.",

But they had something called the Nixopedia, which was every statement that Nixon had ever made, huge binders.And Dick as the younger speech writer had to carry that around from place to place. So they just really imagined what he would come back with. And they had an answer for it, because they knew that he had to have facts. That's what's interesting. In 1960, what mattered is you had real facts so that JFK could look like he was experienced, look like he knew what he was talking about. And Nixon just winged it.",

The former president came down that escalator in Trump Tower 2015. So nine years ago. If you're 12 or 13 years old Trump politics, it's kind of all you know. GOODWIN: Yes, it's just heartbreaking to me that history is being diminished in schools and that these young people have lived through a really difficult time of polarized politics where they're not heroes in our current moment for them to look for. So what I was able to do was to go back to my four guys, the guys that I've lived with my whole life, Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and LBJ, all of whom lived in turbulent times. But all of whom came through those times, and the book starts with stories. I mean, history should be about stories. It's about people. Stories of them when they were young. So you watch them become leaders, because they can't just become an icon. They can't become somebody on Mount Rushmore. They have to evolve into leaders. They acknowledge errors, they learn how to accept loss with grace, and triumph and -- triumph with modesty. And I think a young person can really see, I can develop leadership of my team, of my school, of, you know, of my country eventually, if I learn these qualities which are empathy and humility and resilience and ambition for something larger than yourself which is probably the most important thing.",
