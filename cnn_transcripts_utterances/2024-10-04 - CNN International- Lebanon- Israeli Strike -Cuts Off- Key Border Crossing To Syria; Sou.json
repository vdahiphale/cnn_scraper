It also says its troops have killed around 250 Hezbollah fighters since launching its ground campaign in southern Lebanon.Meantime, new evacuation orders, you are seeing there, are in effect for civilians today. Some one million people are now displaced, and many shelters, as we've been hearing on CNN, are full. Some families have been fleeing into Syria on foot, but Lebanon says a key border crossing is now inaccessible after an Israeli strike destroyed the road leading to the crossing. The IDF says it targeted an underground tunnel crossing used to smuggle weapons into Lebanon. Let's get more on all these trends for you, Jomana Karadsheh is in Beirut, Jeremy Diamond for us there in Tel Aviv. Jomana, let me go to you first, because it seems that these strikes that we've just outlined, that we have been seeing, despite us hearing that this would be limited, localized and targeted, are becoming more frequent, right, more frequent, more intent. Just bring us up to date with the very latest there, Jomana.",

An Israeli military spokesman earlier today telling me that it is one of the most efficient routes for smuggling weapons into Lebanon, and the Israeli military in a statement saying that they targeted an underground tunnel crossing to, quote, \"prevent weapons from being smuggled into Lebanese territories\".But, there is no question that it is having yet another major impact on the civilian population in Lebanon, some 160,000 of whom have already fled from Lebanon into Syria. Interestingly, the majority of those are Syrians who fled the civil war there into Lebanon, and are now going back in the other direction, as conflict goes from one country to another. The Israeli military, other -- of their actions, have also clearly had an impact on civilians. They have directed the evacuation of dozens of Lebanese villages in southern Lebanon, as far as 18 miles away, some 30 kilometers from the Israel-Lebanon border. And yet, for now, the Israeli military continuing to insist that this is a limited ground operation focused on the Lebanese villages closest to the border with Lebanon, where the military says that Hezbollah positions are established there that could be used to carry out infiltration operations into northern Israel. They've provided very little evidence of actual active Hezbollah plans to use those posts to go into northern Israel, but they have shown us videos of some of these posts that included go bags that these Hezbollah fighters had prepared in tunnels very close to that border. But, the question is, as they direct the evacuation of communities much further north, as far as 30 kilometers away in southern Lebanon, is that limited ground operation, as it is being currently characterized, going to continue to expand? And the IDF spokesman, Nadav Shoshani, told me earlier that at the moment, the IDF is focused on those border communities in Lebanon, but the at the moment there, I think, is the critical terminology --",

Following that, an Israeli official told me that this was an Israeli military strike, and that it was indeed targeted at Safieddine, someone who is viewed as a potential, perhaps even likely successor to Hassan Nasrallah. The Israeli military, as I understand it, is still conducting what they call a battle damage assessment to determine whether or not he was actually killed in this strike. But, he was indeed the target, and if indeed he was killed, it would be another significant blow to Hezbollah.",

And in the last few hours, our team spoke with the director of a hospital, one of the southernmost towns, Marjayoun in the south, and they told us that their hospital has had to go out of commission because of a strike on the premises of the hospital.

Now, the hit on the border between Syria and Lebanon, there could be many military explanations to that. However, it only adds another layer of desperation for people that are moving or running away, seeking shelter from Lebanon to Syria, in addition to Syrians themselves that have been in Lebanon for over 12 years now that have been trying to move back to Syria. Now, that does not help.It just makes the country more of an isolated island. It just makes the -- our only entry point into a land border to Syria was that area, was that location, and now it's not there. It's not accessible.

I mean, we benchmarked it with many countries that had similar wars in the past. There is not one country that had in less than five days, 1,200,000 displaced people.So, it's true. Hospitals are filled. Schools are filled. Most governmental places like buildings, real estate that can accommodate and provide shelter for people are filled. It is a serious, serious humanitarian condition, particularly for kids. About 40 percent of those people that are displaced are kids under the age of 15. So, we have a serious problem.

And I wonder what Lebanon's message is to Iran, of course, as we see the region tittering on the brink here? SALAM: Well, our message has been very clear. Lebanon cannot tolerate, but have an immediate ceasefire. We don't want to see Lebanon another Gaza. We don't want to see Lebanon another -- a second Gaza, because everybody, including -- Hezbollah is member of the political mosaic here in Lebanon. They are members of the parliament. They are members of the cabinet, and they have sent very clear messages through the meetings between the Speaker of the House and Lebanon, who works very closely with them and the Prime Minister. They all said, we want a ceasefire, and we're working very closely with the United States, with a number of the Arab countries, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, to push for an immediate ceasefire. Because I can tell you, Isa, with all honesty, we cannot tolerate another day of this. And I mean it when I say another day. I mean, it's very stressful on the economy, on the social situation, on every front. So, his visit today, he left with the same messages we've been hearing from the Iranian side all the time. While on the other hand, from the United Nations, the President of Iran was very clear in his message when he said, we don't want a war. He is looking for peace. He is looking for a better life for his people, and that's a message we should embrace and focus on. So, that was really our take on his visit today. I don't think anything will change --",

So, what are you hearing from the State Department as to what kind of the options here for the Israeli war cabinet and what they may be considering?KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, U.S. officials are not getting into the explicit details of what is potentially on the table for the Israelis here. They're trying to keep those conversations private. But, what they're saying is that they are in, as Kevin was saying, regular, constant dialog with the Israelis here. And what is notable about this week in particular is the tone coming out from U.S. officials is very clearly one that is giving the Israelis a green light to respond. Of course, there are some limitations on what the U.S. would like to see that response look like, with President Biden saying that he does not want to see Israel go after Iran's nuclear facilities. But, we heard earlier this week, just hours after Iran's very aggressive missile attack on Israel that the National Security Advisor said that there would be severe consequences for Iran. So, those discussions are ongoing. But, simultaneously, while you have the U.S. giving a green light to some sort of response, we'll have to see what that looks like, and if it is proportional, as the U.S. has said they hope it will be. We also had U.S. officials making very clear that they see a need for Israel to continue carrying out its operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. U.S. officials saying that they believe that Hezbollah's capabilities should be degraded. And this is different from what the Biden administration has been saying in the past, where they have been putting the first most emphasis on diplomacy and a diplomatic resolution and ceasefires and the like. This week, we aren't hearing that as their number one goal right now. They're giving the Israelis the right to continue on, on both fronts here, and that is noteworthy. It's also, of course, a matter of concern, because they are cognizant. They don't want this to turn into a state-on-state conflict between Israel and Iran. So, they have to calculate very carefully going forward. So, we'll watch and see what the next few days bring here. But, it's very clear that the U.S. and Israel are in close contact, just how much influence the U.S. has at this point, though, is still a question.",

We're a long way off some of the recent peaks where we were sort of talking about potentially $100 a barrel. The challenge for the United States, of course, is that what they've done in order to keep prices relatively low is that they've sold out a lot of the inventory that we've had. So, the inventory for the United States, the Strategic Petroleum Reserves are at a four-decade low. So, I mean, quietly behind the scenes, I'm sure that they're saying, look, don't hit any of those oil assets, because we know and Iran is very important to oil supplies out there, and the supplies that the United States has in backup, as I say, are relatively low compared to where they've been.But, there is some degree of nervousness in the market.
