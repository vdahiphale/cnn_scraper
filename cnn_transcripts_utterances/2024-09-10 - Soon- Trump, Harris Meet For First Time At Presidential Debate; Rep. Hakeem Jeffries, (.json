Think about this, it has been 51 days since she has risen to the top of this Democratic ticket. Of course, she has raised $651 million since then last month, tripling -- nearly tripling, Donald Trump's fundraising alone. This is an entirely different race for the next 56 days. But tonight, I am told advisers to the former president say a chief objective is to try and paint her as a San Francisco liberal, as we've seen them try to do in television ads, and also tie her to the Biden administration on inflation, on immigration, on the economy, on crime and other matters.The Harris campaign has been intensely preparing for this moment. The Vice President, I'm told, has been watching all of those hours of old debate tapes. No one has debated more than Donald Trump in a general election setting. Tonight will be his seventh. She's been watching all of those, talking with Hillary Clinton talking with Joe Biden. She is intending to present herself as a candidate of change, someone to move beyond this Trump era. So, Wolf, for all of the sort of back and forth between these candidates in the last six weeks, this is a new moment, a new evening. This is not going to be a repeat of the 2016 debates with Hillary Clinton. The Vice President has no interest, I'm told, in going after the former president for misogynistic comments and racist comments. We've seen her say it's time to move on. That old playbook simply won't work. But it's those personal attacks obviously can be so unscripted. So this will be the biggest unscripted moment so far of the Vice President's rise here as a presidential candidate. But Wolf, playing out against the backdrop in Pennsylvania, the most important swing state on the map. Wolf.",

On the Harris side, you say that she actually needs to focus on Trump voters and a very, very specific small segment of Trump voters. If she were to target who she needs to win over, who are they? KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; POLLSTER: That's right. So when you look at Donald Trump's voters, most of them, almost all of them, like Donald Trump. And if you're somebody out there who likes Donald Trump, you're voting for him, period. But there is about 7 percent of Donald Trump's vote that says I don't like the guy. I don't feel favorably toward him, but they like his policies. And so for them, Kamala Harris needs to come out tonight and give them an excuse to say, you know what, maybe I don't have to vote for the guy I don't like. But in order to do that, she has to make a very strong and persuasive case, not just that she is more moderate than 2019 Kamala Harris on a bunch of policy issues, but also that she is not just going to carry on the Biden agenda that these voters also don't necessarily like.",

I get stressed before I come on television to see, you know, is the tweet coming. But I would say this, you know, I think the challenge, you know, for President Trump is a lot less than it is for Harris. I mean, he is -- this is his seventh debate. People know him. People have sort of already, you know, decided, you know whether he's offensive or whether it matters. Like you said, it's only seven percent of the voters who liked his Trump's policies but are offended by his behavior. I think this debate is primarily about Kamala Harris, and if Trump can successfully finish the picture, you know, this is a San Francisco liberal. You see that in the \"New York Times\" poll, you see that in the CNN poll, and the San Francisco's liberals are values outside of the mainstream of America, and they are. And the more and more you go into those details, the more and more it showed, especially in Pennsylvania, she wants to do a mandatory gun buyback program. Pennsylvania is not -- is a proud Second Amendment state. You know, they have some pockets where, obviously they're not that, but that is outside the mainstream, that San Francisco value is outside the mainstream of Pennsylvania. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: You know, it's astonishing to listen to this, because what you're hearing is that Kamala Harris has this huge bar to rise to. She's like the Ginger Rogers of candidates. She has to do it backwards and in heels, while you're just saying Donald Trump has to basically show up and appear normal. And so, you know, already there is these two different expectations that I think, you know, we don't really discuss in the way that we should. Kamala Harris has a lot to prove. Of course, this has been a short runway for her, but she has been vice president for three and a half years.

HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER: Well, this is a big night for the campaign. It's a big night for our democracy and a big night for America. Kamala Harris, of course, is ready, willing and able to do the job and to make sure that she articulates a clear vision for how to bring the country together, how to make sure that everyone has access to the great American dream, how we lower costs, how we grow the middle class, and of course, defending our democracy and fighting for our freedoms, particularly a woman's freedom to make her own reproductive health care decisions. So I think tonight, she'll have the opportunity before 10s of millions of our fellow citizens, to lay out a clear contrast between her vision for America, which is inclusive, which is forward looking, which will create an opportunity economy, and Donald Trump's vision for America, which is to jam Project 2025 down the throats of the American people so that extreme MAGA Republicans can exercise total control over every day Americans and hurt working families in the middle class.",

The former New Jersey governor and presidential candidate, Chris Christie, has just written an op-ed in \"The New York Times,\" and he has given some advice for Kamala Harris. Christie writes, I've debated Mr. Trump six times and I'd wager I've participated in at least 30 debate prep sessions with him since 2016. No one has more experience in the arena listening to his attacks and debunking them than I have. That's how I know that Ms. Harris's goal during the debate cannot be merely besting Mr. Trump or out-insulting him. If she spends most of her time tussling with him, she will end up, like so many who have come before, stuck in the mud against the best political insulter in my lifetime.Joining me now, Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire. And Governor Sununu, of course, you know Governor Christie well. He knows Trump as a debater better than almost anyone. So he comes out with his advice. I mean, do you think Harris will have taken this advice and that it will work? I mean, do you think, as Bakari Sellers said a few moments ago, it's possible that she dominates Trump tonight? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): No, no, I -- I don't. I mean, and -- and if the advice is, don't try personal attacks on Trump, I'd be shocked if she was even thinking about that in the first place. That would be a terrible idea. So let's just get the obvious out of the way. What she needs to do is show folks that she can answer questions. Because she's never done that, right? She's never sat down, really. I mean, a couple of -- other than a couple of interviews, taking questions on the fly show her confidence on her feet, or grasp of issues and why she is somehow the agent of change for her own administration that's currently in place. That's what she has to focus on. Former President Trump, on the other hand, has to -- has to not just talk about the borders a disaster and the economy is a disaster. He's got to get to specifics.

If you talk about the border, talk about public safety, talk about the Fentanyl crisis. Those are the things that we as Americans see in our community. If he can make that real connection with the voter, he'll have an opportunity. But she's just got to show that she can stand on her -- on her feet, and answer questions. [17:35:06]",

Just to state the obvious, it's so close. So you know, Christie says for Republicans and independents who do not support Mr. Trump, this is how she earns their vote. They want to be for something, not just against someone. Now, do you agree with that? And do you think, I guess governor, do you think that Trump is capable, for 90 minutes, of being for something, as opposed to just against her and turning this into the mud?",

And -- and, you know, how far is she going to throw President Biden under the bus to show that, you know, she didn't agree with any of that, and under her, it would be very, very different.To your point, Trump has a lot of trouble staying on, you know, being forced something and just getting into specifics and giving the answers which are right there. They're spoon fed to him. But sometimes he does get in his own way. He gets blustery, whether -- whether it's with personal attacks to the candidate, personal attacks to the moderators, personal attacks to the media, whatever it is, he's obviously going to show part of that fire. That's his brand, for better or for worse, as we all know. But it's how much can he, you know, stay disciplined. If it's similar to the first debate, he'll be OK. I don't think it's going to be a knockout win for either of them. I think it's a very, very important debate. I think it really introduces, I mean, it's the first time the two are meeting, for goodness sakes. So really introduces what this campaign is going to be about.

And so this is, you know, Donald Trump has done this. This will be his seventh time that he's been on this stage, not this particular stage, but it's the general election presidential debate as -- as the nominee of his party. This is the first time for Harris. She's a relatively new candidate. Has not done, obviously, any debates, only one big interview.

She initially tried talking to reporters in the hallways. She had some stumbles. She kind of pulled back, became less available, took some time, figured it out, came back out much stronger, having figured out, OK, this is how to handle the situation. And you've seen her do that. I interviewed her in 2018 and she raised questions about whether she wanted to abolish ICE in that interview. They had to clean it up. It was one of the examples that she's since had of challenges in interview settings. It occurred again when she became vice president, and that's why there were a lot of questions before she took over the top of the ticket about whether or not President Biden himself was asking, saying, I don't think she can win. Then he was asking, can she win? And my big question is, I have seen her, and I think we have all seen her learn and grow into these roles. Has she gotten to the point where she is ready to stand on that stage and command it? And I think that's what the American people are going to be looking for.",
