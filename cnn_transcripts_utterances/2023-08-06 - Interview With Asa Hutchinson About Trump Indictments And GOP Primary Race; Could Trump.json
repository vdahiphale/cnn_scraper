Joining us live from Iowa, Republican presidential candidate, former governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson.Governor, thanks so much for being with us. We appreciate it. Let's just get right to it if we can. This week -- this past week, as you heard, Trump, the leader of the Republican Party, the current frontrunner for the GOP nomination, was indicted on charges of attempting to overthrow the 2020 election. He traveled to Washington for his arraignment. And since then, he's been issuing these threats on social media, saying, if you go after me, I'm coming after you. He described the special counsel, Jack Smith, as deranged. He's now attacking the judge handling the case, saying there's no way he can get a fair trial from her. How do you think the judge should handle this situation? Does he need to be issued a warning, do you think? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think she will, and of course there's a whole trough of evidence that's going to be turned over to the defense which will show and share with Donald Trump. And what he does with that information is a legitimate question. Obviously if he sees something to his political advantage, he's going to put it out on social media, and that's a concern if it's used to intimidate witnesses. You know, the last statement, I'm not sure who that was focused on, and they're going to have to explain that. It could be his political competitors in this race or a member of Congress, if you criticize me, I'm going to go after you.

One, they want to keep the public relations, which is that they believe Donald Trump has been victimized. He's been picked on.I'm here in Iowa. There's a sense among Republicans that that's exactly the case. So there's sympathy for him. And then secondly, a part of their defense is that it's free speech, that he had a political rally there that he's entitled to. And so this is not easy for the prosecution. It's a heavy burden of proof as it should be. And so that's the defense strategy, and of course the prosecution is going to really have to show this goes beyond political speech if they're going to make their case.",

I don't think it's a good defense strategy to be attacking either the judge or the jury pool in Washington, D.C., or the prosecutor. It doesn't make sense, but he's playing to his crowd because he's intertwined both his campaign with his legal defense strategy. And so the voters are going to have to sort this through. It's not easy for them, and he's making it complicated for them.

And so it's not justified. You know, the former president has brought this on himself. He's going to be held accountable in a court of law on it.But it's a challenge with the Republican voters because they see a justice system that needs changing, and that's why I support the FBI, I support the criminal justice system, but I also want to see it reformed. That's why I sent a whole package of reform measures that focuses their jurisdiction more, brings in more accountability and transparency. That's the right way to approach it. There are challenges, but it should be separated from the case that Donald Trump faces.

This is a question that's on a lot of Americans' minds. I mean, could he somehow assume the Oval Office even after being convicted? I was talking to former Governor Asa Hutchinson about this in a similar fashion a few moments ago. You know, what happens if Trump is convicted and sentenced to jail, and this happens right around the Republican nomination, but I supposed it could happen before inauguration, and then we ask that question, too. What if? Can he go into the Oval Office? RICHARD HASEN, SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRACY PROJECT, UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW: Well, the first thing to say is that the Constitution has very few requirements to be president. You have to be 35, natural born citizen. You have to be a resident of the United States for a certain period of time. That's it. So, you know, Trump lives in Florida.

We're also following multiple explosions at a critical road bridge linking Crimea to Russian-occupied Ukraine. Russia says the explosions were caused by Ukrainian missiles supplied by the U.K. Ukraine acknowledged the strikes but didn't say whether the missiles were British-supplied.

MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Partly, Jim. And Nick just mentioned the targeting. You know, many people don't understand that in the military, there is such a thing as a targeting process. What kind of targets are you going after? How will it affect the battlefield? What kind of things do you need to do to literally restrain your enemy from doing the kinds of things he wants to do? And that's what's occurring here. When you're talking about the offensive operations of Ukrainian forces in the southeast, they are attempting to liberate the two provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. As you look at the map that you have posted on the screen right now, a lot of the supplies are coming into those two provinces where the red area is from Crimea. Others are coming from a small town across the border in Russia called Rostov-on-Don along a major supply route, or what the military would call a line of communication. When you interrupt that passage of supplies, whether it be ammunition, food, resupply, personnel, equipment, arms, all of those things will hinder the defensive operations of Russia. And that's what I believe the Ukrainian main effort is, is not only to continue their offensive operation in a smaller way than anticipated and perhaps a little bit slower, but they're doing it by literally taking away the capability of Ukraine to reinforce -- excuse me -- Russia to reinforce and resupply their forces on the frontlines.

Hundreds of miles away from the territory of Ukraine, in the north -- excuse me, in the southeast sector of the Black Sea. That's almost 500 miles away from the coastline of Ukraine.When you endanger boats in those areas, ships, main ships, with something like this small motorboat, it's really significant because Russia then has to calculate, gee, how do I defend that, right, and where do I take forces from other places in order to do that?

Right now several Republican presidential contenders are stumping in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, making the case about why they are better suited to be the nominee than former President Donald Trump.

Trump continues to dominate the Republican field with 44 percent support among likely GOP voters in Iowa. His next closest rival Ron DeSantis is at 20 percent. All other candidates are in single digits or less. And joining us now to talk about this and the current state of play in Iowa right now is Des Moines bureau chief for \"The Gazette,\" which is based in Cedar Rapids, Erin Murphy. Erin, great to have you on. Thanks so much. What do you think? Do these poll numbers reflect what you're seeing on the ground in Iowa? Is Trump that far ahead?",

They believe former President Trump.They believe he is the victim of political persecution despite all the evidence to the contrary.
