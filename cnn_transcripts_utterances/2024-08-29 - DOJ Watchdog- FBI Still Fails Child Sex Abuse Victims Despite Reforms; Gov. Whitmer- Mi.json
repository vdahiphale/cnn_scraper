      "sentences": "A critical report is out about the FBI and how it handles child sex abuse cases. An audit done by the Justice Department's Inspector General states this, despite reforms put in place after the botched investigation of disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar, the FBI is still mishandling allegations of child sexual abuse.We have CNN's Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez on this story. This is pretty stunning because they should have cleaned up their act after that giant, giant failure. What are the key failures mentioned in this audit?",

      "sentences": "Well, the Inspector General for the Justice Department went back and looked at a subset of cases, right? They looked at 327 cases and what they found was really concerning. They found that some of the same problems that happened in -- that they found after examining the Nassar case were happening again.And among the problems that they found, they found that the FBI, that agents were not reporting some cases of abuse to local authorities. They were supposed to do that within 24 hours. That was not happening. They found that in some cases, there was no indication or no record of investigative activity happening. Again, quickly, that it's supposed to happen quickly and they found repeatedly that that didn't happen. And they also found that in some cases, you have agents that were juggling too many cases. And that's one reason why it appears that, you know, the investigations were not being handled the proper manner. And so one of the things that, you know, obviously that comes out of this is how do you respond after, especially after you've found the same problems back in 2021? Here's the FBI director back in 2021, after the Nassar investigation, responding to those victims in that case. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We had a call with the FBI officials who were responding to this.And you know, they said that these were anomalies. They said in the vast majority of these cases, they did do investigative work. There were some paperwork issues, essentially, where they didn't document what they had done. But that's a problem. Because if you pass on an investigation, for instance, to your local police, what they need to see is what the FBI did. And so that's a big, big part of this problem. They also say that they're going to do some more training. They're going to launch some new training for the FBI agents around the country to make sure that this problem is fixed. Brianna, the issue is that they said this before. And so it appears they're going to make sure this time that agents are trained and that they are doing the right thing with these cases. These are obviously the most vulnerable people that the FBI has to deal with and protect. And so they need to do better.",

Trump is back on the campaign trail for the first time this week, stopping by key swing states.Later tonight, he travels to nearby Wisconsin, where he's hosting a town hall. And as we wait for Trump to take the podium in Michigan, the state's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is trying to cast the former president as a threat to the economy. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER, (D) MICHIGAN: Michiganders already know what Donald Trump would do to our economy, and it's a no thank you from us. When I came into office, Donald Trump had shipped Michigan jobs overseas, including thousands of auto jobs. He tried to undermine our unions every way that he could. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Nobody had more plans than Elizabeth Warren. And we saw that that wasn't enough for a lot of voters.So what I'm telling voters is to pay attention to what each of the candidates focus on. Vice President Harris is talking about the things that matter, cost of living, our fundamental rights, our reproductive rights, our LGBTQ rights, water quality, climate change, the care economy, something that she is centering about child care and families. And Donald Trump right now is all about grievance. He is still relitigating the 2020 election four years later. He is making this really a referendum on himself. He wants to get back into the White House to avoid jail time, to get out of lawsuits and to weaponize the government in a way that we would pay for. So you've got to strike the right balance. I do believe, I agree with Congressman Kildee, this is about character, and it's about the issues that we will focus on as they matter to Michiganders and the American people.",

People told me that I was crazy, I was out of my mind. And you look at where we are months later, and he's falling in line. He's endorsed Donald Trump. He is promoting dangerous conspiracy theories. The more that we learn about him as it relates to dropping a dead bear off in Central Park or apparently cutting a whale head off, it's just, you talk about character. It's not quality character. And I think that we see who he is, and I'm not worried about him pulling support from the vice president.",
