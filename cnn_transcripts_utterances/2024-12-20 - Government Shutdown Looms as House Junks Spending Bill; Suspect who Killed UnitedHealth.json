Remember that issue of a debt limit was a complex, complicated issue that typically Congress spends weeks, if not months, to try to negotiate. No one wants to vote really to raise the borrowing limit in the United States, and Donald Trump does not want this to be part of his first year agenda, so he wants to take it off the table now. He's saying deal with it now, and so he doesn't have to worry about when he's president. But there's a problem. There are Republicans in the ranks who say they will never vote for a debt limit increase, especially if it does not have spending cuts. REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): It just stinks.

It's the first in-person visit to Damascus by U.S. officials since the fall of the Syrian President Bashar al- Assad. The White House has tapped former ambassador and Syria envoy Daniel Rubinstein to lead the effort in the final weeks of the Biden administration.

VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I don't know when we'll meet because he hasn't said anything about it. I haven't spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I'm ready for this at any time, and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it. TODD (voice-over): Vladimir Putin's claim that he hasn't spoken with Trump in more than four years contradicts reporting by journalist Bob Woodward that the two men have had as many as seven conversations since 2021. Trump has also denied having multiple calls with Putin since leaving office. But Trump told CNN last May he could end Russia's war on Ukraine within 24 hours, a promise he repeated throughout the 2024 campaign, though offering few specifics.

JILL DOUGHERTY, ADJUNCT PROF., GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY AND FORMER CNN MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF: He says, yes, I'm open to discussing, et cetera, but he doesn't really get specific. And I think that is because he doesn't know exactly what Trump is going to propose. TODD (voice-over): At the news conference in Moscow Thursday, Putin put a positive spin on his war in Ukraine, insisting Russian forces will push the Ukrainian army out of the southern Russian region of Kursk, where it's been since August. PUTIN (through translator): The guys are fighting. There is a battle going on right now, and serious battles. It's unclear why. There is no military sense in the Ukrainian armed forces entering the Kursk region or holding on there now as they're doing, throwing their best units there to be slaughtered.

It doesn't matter who you are, anything can happen. And that's the risk that we all take. And that's part of, I think, the thrill of downhill is that it's dangerous. You have to be willing to risk everything in order to succeed. And it's always been the case. You know, I wouldn't be doing downhill if I wasn't willing to take the risk. And things haven't changed now that I've had a knee replacement. My doctors have cleared me. You know, they're very confident in what I'm doing. I wouldn't be doing it if it was like a reckless, you know, idea. I'm, you know, I think a lot of people have a lot of wild ideas about how crazy it is that what I'm doing. But I'm not as -- I'm not a dumb person. I've talked to the best doctors in the world and they've cleared me to do this. So it's not a bigger risk. I'm sure I'm going to have to have another knee replacement at some point in the future because I'm only 40 years old. But that would happen whether I skied or didn't ski. So to me, it's the same.",
