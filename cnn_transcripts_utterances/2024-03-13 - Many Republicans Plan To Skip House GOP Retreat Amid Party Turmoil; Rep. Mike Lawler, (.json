And this hour and overnight helicopter mission to rescue Americans trapped in Haiti as violent criminal gangs run rampant, prisoners are freed, police stations are burned to the ground. Best Selling Author Mitch Albom who runs an orphanage in Haiti was evacuated in that mission. And he'll join us live.Plus, I've got some brand new reporting about possibly the most well- known person on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shortlist for vice president ahead of the candidates planned announcement later this month. You'll want to hear this. But leading this hour, a new sign of the clear dysfunction in the Republican Party right now. I mean, how bad things have to be to turn down two days, all expenses paid at a luxury resort? Well, that's the reality for many House Republicans. And a source says fewer than half of them have RSVP'd yes for the annual event starting today that is meant to build party unity. Republican congresswoman Nancy Mays, she's doing a T.V. appearance instead. Congressman Kelly Armstrong says he'd rather focus on his campaign for governor. And Congressman Tim Burchett remarked, quote, \"I don't retreat I move forward. I got a farm to run.\" This comes just one day after a Republican lawmaker said he's quitting Congress all together next week because of the fighting and bickering. CNN's Melanie Zanona is is live for us in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, where this retreat is taking place. Melanie, nice gig. What are you hearing from lawmakers who did show up? Apparently we lost Melanie Zanona's sound. OK. No wonder she didn't laugh at my funny joke. Let's go now to Congressman Mike Lawler from New York, a Republican. He's live on Capitol Hill. Clearly not at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. Congressman Lawler, are things really so bad amongst House Republicans right now that you all can't even spend a few days together at a luxury resort in the mountains? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Listen, Jake, we spend a lot of time together, obviously here on Capitol Hill. I have some events in Washington tonight. And I'm going back to my district for events tomorrow. But look, obviously, you know, we have been focused on a lot of the pressing issues. In Washington, I know, there'll be having a good retreat and discussion about the path forward on a number of key issues, including the supplemental package, which I've introduced a bipartisan bill defending borders, defending democracies to secure our border and get aid to our allies. And I'm sure I'll get the Cliff Notes version of the discussion. But you know, look, we talk daily on these issues on the work that we have ahead of us. And you know, being at a retreat is not going to change the fact that we have a lot of work to do.",

Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats who are in the majority down the hall have not passed much of anything.We have been focused on issues that impact the American people from border security with H.R. 2 which we passed in May of last year to energy independence, which H.R. 1 which we passed last year, as well. So, there's a lot that we have focused on. Just because the Senate chooses not to act, can't put that solely on the House. Obviously, we would like to get a lot more legislation across the finish line. But you know, we are focused on the appropriations process. We'll be coming back next week to pass the second tranche of appropriations bills for fiscal year '24 and get right to work on fiscal year '25. We have the supplemental package before us. I signed a discharge petition yesterday to bring that to a head because we need to support our allies, we need to secure our border. And these are issues that I'm continuing to focus on despite some of the noise, despite some of the infighting and despite some of, you know, the friction in a divided government.",

I think the speaker obviously has some concern about some of our members trying a similar tactic because they don't get their way. But ultimately, the responsibility of Congress is to act. And I and others are willing to do that and will force the issue, which is why I signed a discharge petition.You know, my hope is that Republicans and Democrats not only can unify behind getting a border security package and foreign aid package across the finish line, but protect the institution. You know, remember, it took eight Republicans and over 210 Democrats to team up to remove the House speaker in October of last year. I know Hakeem Jeffries has intimated that they won't go along with that again, you know, which certainly, I think is important for them to clarify that they would not be party to another effort at undermining the House and the institution. But we need to get our work done. It requires both parties in a divided government, Democrats control the Senate and the White House, working together to get these issues across the finish line from our appropriations bills, which we're in the process of doing to this supplemental. We're not going to agree on everything, there does need to be negotiations that's why we've put this bill forward. But my objective and that of my colleagues, bipartisan group, many of us part of the problem solvers caucus is to get this across the finish line. Ukraine needs the support, Israel needs the support. We see the threats emanating from the unholy alliance of China, Russia and Iran. This is the moment for America to be the leader that it is of the free world and we need to pass this bill across the finish line here in Congress.",

That is the concern here.

And I think that speaks potential to the power of the app and how they can have an impact on our own government here in the United States.Again, we want people to be able to use social media to express their First Amendment rights, to be able to communicate their ideas, to be able to create videos and entertainment.

Judge Scott McAfee today tossed out six of the 41 charges against Trump and his codefendants in the Georgia election interference case. Trump still faces 88 criminal charges and four different indictments just no longer 91. Still, this is a legal win for Trump and some of his codefendants who had filed to dismiss those counts on the grounds that they were, quote, \"legally deficient.\"Apparently the judge agreed writing, quote, \"As written the six counts contain all the essential elements of the crimes but failed to allege sufficient detail regarding the nature of their commission, i.e., the underlying felony solicited,\" unquote. Let's bring in CNN, Elie Honig. Elie, translates for that for us. I'm not a lawyer. What does that -- what does that mean? He took the six counts about trying to get an officer to violate his oath of office, right, the one about the Secretary of State and said, you can't do that. Why not? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Right. So Jake, the very fundamental purpose of an indictment is to serve notice, to notify the defendant, here's what you are charged with doing that was illegal. And in this case, the six charges, they all relate to a sort of unusual Georgia law that makes it a crime to ask a public official to violate his oath of office. The way those charges are charged in the indictment here it says while the defendants tried to get certain Georgia public officials to violate the Constitution, and the judge said that's not specific enough because there are dozens if not hundreds of separate provisions in the constitution. So, you haven't adequately informed the defendants what actual crime they're specifically being charged with, that's why the judge threw out those six counts.",

The DA has served subpoenas on Republicans, Lindsey Graham, and then use that subpoena immediately to try to solicit donations for her campaign.

Now on the outside that sounds like a reasonably Democratic transition of power, but to the violent criminal gangs, who are actually ruling much of Haiti right now, it's an empty statement.The situation is so volatile, the U.S. is sending a marine unit specializing in terrorism to support security at the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Since Haiti declared a state of emergency earlier this month, there has been some Americans in Haiti who have had to find a way to keep themselves safe, and try to find a way out, rescued in an overnight operation organized by Republican Congressman of Florida Cory Mills on Tuesday, was acclaimed author and journalist Mitch Albom, his wife, and a few volunteers from the Have Faith Haiti Orphanage operated by Albom's nonprofit. And we're honored to have Mitch Albom join us now. Mitch, we're so glad that you and the others made it out of Haiti safely. What was the situation like before the evacuation?

You know, there every night gunfire that we hear from outside our gates while kids are praying, building set on fire, police stations set on fire, neighborhoods chased out, we have people living with us who were chased out of their homes by the gangs and just can't return this. And that's been going on for a long time. It got much worse over the course of the last 10 days or so with prisons were broken into. This is all while the Prime Minister was out of the country.And ultimately, when the airports were closed down, the ports were closed, the borders were closed, the streets were blocked, it became apparent that we weren't going to be able to get out anytime soon. And with a bunch of volunteers that have come down to help out our orphanage, I felt it was our obligation to get them out. I go every month and have been for the last 14 years operating our orphanage. So this isn't that new to me. We were actually there when the President was assassinated. And the same kind of thing happened, the country shut down. But these guests, you know, needed to get out. And so as you mentioned, there was middle of the night helicopter operation that was able to get us out safely.",

And sadly, you know, while we learned a very harrowing lesson about what it's like not to be able to move, not to be able to go when you want to go or leave when you want to leave. That's the way Haitians live all the time. And that's the way our kids live all the time.Our kids at orphanage haven't been out of the orphanage in nearly three years, because it's not safe to go outside in the streets of Port-au-Prince. And imagine, you know, you can't even go for an ice cream. You can't take kids to the beach. You can't go out for the park. And so I'm trying to use the opportunity that this provided to tell people the world that, you know, it's not about stories like people like us who manage to get out. It's about that people in Haiti have to live like this all the time, because the terror of the gangs and something needs to be done.

OF ALABAMA FOOTBALL COACH: All the things that I believed in for all these years, 50 years of coaching, no longer exist in college athletics. Name, image and likeness is a great opportunity for them to create a brand for themselves. I'm not against that at all.
