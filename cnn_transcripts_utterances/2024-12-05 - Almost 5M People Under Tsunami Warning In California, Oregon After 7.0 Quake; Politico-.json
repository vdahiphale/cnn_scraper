So earthquake waves, the shaking -- the waves that give us shaking from earthquakes, those travel much faster than tsunami waves.So tsunami waves in the ocean, you know, in the open ocean tends to travel about as fast as a -- as a jet plane flies, whereas earthquake waves travel much faster. And that means that its -- its, you know, it's easier for us to give tsunami warnings because there's a little bit of a -- of a time delay there. So that's the reason for the kind of the -- the difference in arrival time between the shaking from the earthquake and any potential tsunami wave that gets triggered.",

So the USGS has -- has issued already an aftershock forecast for this event.So folks can go and look that up on the details of that up on the USGS Web site. You know, they are forecasting that there's, you know, maybe about a 40 percent chance of an aftershock larger than about a magnitude 5 or 5 and a half. So certainly, it's something that we need to be aware of. Because this earthquake happened beneath the ocean and not directly under any population centers, it's certainly the most likely scenario is that any aftershocks will be smaller than the initial shock. We can't rule out the possibility of a larger earthquake, but the most likely scenario is that any aftershocks will be smaller. So certainly, again, for folks who are in that affected area, it's good to be aware of the possibility of -- of aftershocks, because that is something that we -- we do expect for an earthquake of this size.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the depth if -- if correct, because we don't actually know, it's been fluctuating up and down a little bit. But if the depth is correct at really about a half a mile deep, that means the ocean floor moved an awful lot.And if the ocean floor moves, it pushes water. It usually pushes water up. It doesn't matter if it pushes water down, water will fill in and waves will still be made. That's why the tsunami warning has been posted from Oregon all the way down to San Francisco. And 7.0 is a significant shake here, and likely in the Cascadia Subduction Zone. We've always known about this, but very close to Fort Bragg is where the -- the first shake happened. I've seen some pictures online already where there is some damage to some businesses, where bottles are knocked off. But the problem is not that. There are 19,000 people without power. So something was shaking up there. Certainly, we know that. But the problem is, how much water did this 7.0 actually move? It is a large movement of the ground and considered a strong and right on the edge of a major quake. So when the earth is moved close to the bottom of the ocean floor, very close to that, that means a lot of water got pushed. And somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15 of these seven earthquakes happened per year. So one per month. But they typically don't happen so close to land. This was not very far offshore. There will be aftershocks. We know that people are already feeling them there. But it's the shallow part of the quake that is the problem. It's the movement of the water. If you're down around San Francisco area, somewhere probably still another 30 minutes for that wave to arrive. But in closer to northern parts of Oregon, also, of course, at Fort Bragg. It happened already about 20 minutes ago. But if you get close to that coast and you don't have a lot of time to get warnings -- we know the phones were going off. We know those alarms were going off. And it said, head to higher ground. So hopefully, if you needed to head for higher ground, your phone did go off as well. There was the emergency alert system there that went off. But this is part of the Ring of Fire. Brianna. This is expected. We expected the Cascadia Subduction Zone to, well, go off one day, and maybe today it did. We'll have to see if the 7.0 holds, and we'll have to see if that depth holds. The depth is the problem.",

What does he have in mind? He's issued a list in his book of deep state people that he doesn't see with favor. So, you know, I think the broad-brush general kind of amnesty that has been offered in the past -- we go back to George Washington and the Whiskey Rebellion. He didn't know any of the people who might use the pardon, but he issued it to give them safety. Same thing happened with Lincoln and Andrew Johnson during the Civil War. More recently, Jimmy Carter did it for draft dodgers during Vietnam. So it's not an unusual situation to do this. But it provides protection for people who don't need to be taken and dragged through the criminal process for behavior that has now been forgiven.",

MILES SLATTERY, (D), CITY MANAGER, EUREKA, CALIFORNIA (via telephone): So, we just started -- well, it didn't just start, but prior to the warning, we evacuated the area of town that's in the red zone, which is basically north of Fourth Street here in Eureka, and had everybody move south of fourth street. It's basically our old town, kind of commercial area of town, as well as an industrial portion of our town. So that area of town has been evacuated. The National Weather Service told us that it was supposed to come around 11:15, but there was a 45-minute to an hour window of when it could come. And so we're kind of in a holding pattern right now with those locations evacuated. I just drove by Eureka Slough, which is attached to the bay, and we're not seeing any evidence of one, but we're still preparing as if it may still come.",

And we have a spit on the outside of Humboldt Bay that has a bunch of dunes, and that is an area of potential for run up to happen. But there's dunes in a close proximity that they could go to high -- higher ground to avoid it. But here in town, which is on the inward bay side of it, it's -- you know, people have this perception of it being, you know, some waves that you can pull out your board and paddle into.
