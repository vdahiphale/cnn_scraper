      "sentences": "Yes, I think it's a pretty good assessment there, Max. And I do think that it's going to be a pretty fundamental speech that Vladimir Putin is going to hold here. We can already see the folks there inside that auditorium getting ready. That is the Prime Minister of Russia, Mishustin, that you see there next to the head of the Duma, Mr. Volodin, who are obviously everybody from Russian political prominence is there from both houses of Parliament.Now, it was quite interesting because earlier today, the press secretary for Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov, he came out and he laid out some of the things that are going to be part of Vladimir Putin's speech. And as you guys already mentioned, he said that there is going to be a reasoning on why what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine was inevitable, why this is something that Russia had to do. But he also said that Vladimir Putin would layout the way forward and how Russia will move forward and then Peskov said, and we definitely will move forward in all of this. So, essentially, what we're looking to hear, waiting to hear, is what Vladimir Putin believes the next couple of months this year is going to bring for Russia on the battlefield. One of the things that we do not expect Vladimir to do is to indicate that Russia is in any way, shape or form backing down. Something that I've heard from folks who are in Russian politics over the past couple of days in the run up to all of this, is they say that right now, Russia actually believes that it's still in a fairly strong position. Russia believes that it can wear out not only the Ukrainians, but that it can also wear out the west and Western support. And of course, one of the things that was very important in all that was the visit by President Biden to Kyiv yesterday. And, you know, the kremlin actually didn't say anything about that yesterday. They didn't comment on President Biden's visit to Ukraine. There was a lot of commentary on state media about it. However, this morning, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, he said that, yes, they were very closely watching President Biden's visit and that it could indeed be factored in to Vladimir Putin's speech, that Vladimir Putin was aware of that visit as well. So we're going to see whether or not any of that is going to be the case. There certainly are some commentators who believe that if it does factor in, that it will make Vladimir Putin's speech even harsher. Because, of course, one of the narratives that the Kremlin has been putting out there, Russian media has been putting out there as well is that they essentially now view this not as a war or a conflict of war, really, of Russia against Ukraine, but they view it as a conflict of Russia against the west, and specifically Russia against the United States as the leader of the Western world. And so that's certainly something that we could hear in Vladimir Putin's speech today. Certainly, though, we do not expect him to announce that Russia might back down in any way, shape or form, guys.",

And one of the things that we did yesterday is we actually spoke to the leading pollster herein Russia, the head of Levada, and that pollster said that the support for the special military operation is strong and remains strong.And they also believe that it's not going to wane in the next couple of months. So, clearly, the message that the Kremlin has been trying to send is something that's being received by people and is being heard by people. Vladimir Putin's approval ratings themselves, of course, have been very high ever since the war started, and really they've waned a little bit in between. And there have been some military defeats, but recently they've sort of stopped on a very high level, and it's certainly something that seems to be holding. So right now, Vladimir Putin has the full support both in his role as president of the Russian Federation and also as far as the special military operation in Ukraine is concerned as well. And so, therefore, yes, of course, the Kremlin definitely believes that people need to remain on side. However, also, Vladimir Putin very much has the people on side so far, guys.",

Kevin Liptak is standing by in Warsaw. And Clare Sebastian is with us here in London. Kevin, let's start with you. Obviously, President Biden made this trip to Ukraine to reaffirm his commitment to his ally and to say that America will be with the Ukrainians for as long as it takes.

There wasn't a lot of talk from the Kremlin or even, you know, some of the higher ranking officials that quite often speak out about this.We did hear, though, from the former President Dmitry Medvedev, who is known for being very strident, belligerent even in his commentary. He made a lot of the idea that Russia was warned couple of hours before for deconfliction purposes, according to the U.S. He said Biden, having received security guarantees in advance, finally went to Kyiv. And he went on to accuse the west of profiting from the war in Ukraine, which I think most economists will tell you the opposite is true. It was interesting that we did also get some criticism from some of the influential military bloggers that we often hear from. One calling this a demonstrative humiliation of Russia, and another noting, ironically, that Biden made it to Kyiv before Putin did. So there is obviously still concern in some quarters about how this operation is going for Russia. And certainly, the optics of that event really show the goals backfiring, Ukraine moving closer to the west when, you know, a year ago, Putin made a speech saying that he wanted, essentially, Ukraine to become part of Russia.",

They said that this is an opportunity for both sides to exchange views on the relationship and also to discuss international hotspot issues, which is code for the war in Ukraine. This visit also comes at a time of deepening tension between China and the United States over the Chinese balloon and, of course, over the war in Ukraine.
