      "sentences": "That's right. I mean, there is a lot of activity, Jessica, going on on that island behind me. I'm told that Donald Trump has really been hold up at Mar-a-Lago very closely going through all of the candidates that he wants to fill for these key roles. I'd also note that it's pretty interesting that we really haven't seen or heard much from Donald Trump ever since he won the election.We have not seen him publicly. He hasn't talked to press or anything like that. He hasn't done interviews. And he also has very rarely been on Truth Social. So that's just one interesting thing. I'm told it's because he is really digging in and taking seriously this new job of trying to figure out who is going to serve in his Cabinet as well as top White House roles. Now I want to walk through what some of those most important roles are at least in the mind of Donald Trump. Number one, the most important job that he feels in his mind that he is going to fill is the role of attorney general. I would remind you that after Donald Trump had left the White House in January of 2021, he had said that one of his biggest regrets while in office was who he had selected as his attorney general. He was mainly referring to his attorneys general Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr, but that is very much at the top of his mind and one of the top priorities for him at this current moment. Now some people who are on that list. We recently just reported that Eric Schmitt, that senator from Missouri, he is one of the contenders for this role. He was previously the attorney general of Missouri. He is very close with Donald Trump. He helped him prepare for both of the debates, the first against Biden, the latter against Kamala Harris. He was with Donald Trump on Tuesday night to celebrate his election victory. So he is definitely one person to keep in mind. The other people, keeping with the Missouri theme, the current attorney general of Missouri, Andrew Bailey, is on that list as is John Ratcliffe, his former director of National Intelligence. Mark Paoletta, he's someone who worked as an attorney in the previous White House. There are other names on there but I'll just say this is going to be a very key role. And another thing I would just remind you as well about attorney general, what Donald Trump has said is that he does not want the Justice Department to operate as independently as it has for the last several years. It is tradition that the Justice Department tries to operate on its own independent of what the White House and the rest of the executive branch is doing. Donald Trump wants to change that. He also wants whoever his attorney general is to help him carry out his legal goals. Part of that is potentially prosecuting his political opponents, and I'm told whoever he chooses for that role is really going to be someone that Donald Trump trusts explicitly and believes is very loyal to him.",

You have a different -- completely different personality at the helm as chief of staff this go around. I don't expect there will be infighting and backbiting and leaking like there was last time. It's a unified command so to speak. Everybody on this team is a very cohesive -- just there was during the campaign.There was no leaking, no backbiting. I think it was run very professionally. This transition thus far has been run very professionally. They are moving forward with deliberate pace, doing incredible amount of meetings I know from talking to people who are involved, directly involved. Some people who are up for Cabinet positions. You know, their participation thus far. So I think that they've learned and there'll be a lot less bumps. I think that it will be staffed much more quickly at the top positions at least. They'll in very talented people. There's no shortage as you saw there from Alayna's reporting on very quality people for the attorney general. And I do agree that's probably one of the preeminent roles. You got the chief of staff, that's number one. The attorney general is probably number two. White House counsel is three and then kind of so forth, secretary of Defense and Treasury and State are all going to fall into line pretty quickly. But if you look at the names that are being bandied about, these are quality people. People are putting their hand up in America saying I want to help America get back on track. And so, you know, Democrats have all been wringing their hands and people are saying, who's going to want to serve in a Trump administration? Well, take a look at the list. It's incredibly quality people. I think Americans are going to be surprised. I think Americans are going to benefit from it because the economy is going to turn around. You're going to have a secure border. Things are going to happen incredibly quickly. Day one there'll be, you know, 200, 300 executives orders out, you know, offered up by the president.

IRS, OMB, there's lots of different people that are involved.You can't just say, I want to do this and then expect it to happen. They are incredible giant -- you know, the government is too big obviously. It's part of the reason that this administration wants to shrink it, but to effectuate change in any presidency, in the federal government is incredibly complicated. And so these folks that are going in there are going to have to go in there not with just scalpers. You're going to have to under meat cleavers to begin with. You remember, Jessica, the first -- in the beginning days of the 2016 campaign, when they had the -- for every regulation we'd promulgate we're going to cut six. And then at one point in time they had a pile of regulations about four feet tall in a short period of time that they got rid of, right? And reducing the regulatory burden on American business, reducing taxes, these are things that are going to help stream line the economy, bring back the economy, reduce inflation, make prices drop, make things for affordable for individuals at home.

I mean, that was kind of standard fare at every Trump rally. And I'd just ask your viewers to think about how many days that Hillary Clinton spend being prosecuted or persecuted by the Trump Department of Justice? Zero days. That's how many. How many days did Donald Trump, how many days was he persecuted and prosecuted by the Biden administration? Probably more than he can count on one hand. Ans so I think this administration will not to do that, it will not weaponize the Department of Justice. I think they will clean house in lots of places, file lots of individuals and streamline the government.

The Israeli military is claiming it's dealt a, quote, \"severe blow to Hamas\" in recent weeks saying a thousand Hamas militants have been killed and a thousand more wounded during IDF operations in northern Gaza. Meantime, Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began last October.CNN cannot independently verify those numbers, and we should note that Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and Hamas militants killed. A recent U.N. report estimates that women and children account for some 70 percent of deaths in Gaza. Matthew Chance is joining us now from Jerusalem with more. Matthew, what more are you learning? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, absolutely aappalling numbers, though, aren't they? And the humanitarian toll inside Gaza Strip appears to be getting worse by the day. Look, I mean, there's been the IDF chief of the general staff has been visiting Israeli troops near the Jabalya Refugee Camp in northern Gaza which has been one of the areas that has been the focus of military operations in the past month or so. He's saying to the troops that in the past three weeks there have been a thousand Hamas militants killed and another thousand captured, something he described as a severe blow to the Hamas organization. As they say, Jabalya has been a focus of military activity for the past month because the Israeli military say that Hamas militants have been resurgent there so they've had to move back in, clear people away, and fight in very close quarters against Hamas they're trying to destroy, and of course part of the process as well is to try and free hostages that are being held there still -- more than 100 Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza. Meanwhile, those U.N. reports, there's a couple of them as well from UNICEF, the U.S. children agency, saying in the past month 64 schools across the Gaza Strip have been struck. That's almost, well, two a day, just over two a day, and about 128 people have been killed including children inside those schools. The Israeli military of course haven't commented on the report but they say that Hamas frequently uses places like schools and civilians as human shields. There's also been a much more broad general detailed report by the United Nations, looking at the casualties in the war over the first six months of the conflict and they've reached the conclusion that 70 percent of the casualties have been women and children, and they've criticized the Israeli military for that. There hasn't been a reaction yet by the Israeli military to that. But it just underlines again that humanitarian cost, just how intense the fighting is there in Gaza, and just what a massive impact it's having on the people of the Gaza Strip -- Jessica.",

But Pelosi in this interview with the \"New York Times\" said, quote, \"Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have other candidates in the race. The anticipation was that, that if the president were to step aside that there would be an open primary. And as I say, Kamala Harris may have I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward.\" She added, \"But we don't know that that didn't happen. We live with what happened because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier it would have been different.\" Now these comments are also interesting because one of the things that Biden advisers often pointed to after he dropped out of the race was that they believed it was a good thing that he quickly moved to endorse Harris because it caused the party to go quickly coalesce around her. Really avoiding any infighting in those just three or four weeks before the Democratic National Convention. But the relationship between Biden and Pelosi has been a very interesting one. While she was not publicly calling for him to drop out after that debate performance, she did leave the door open. And in many ways, gave Democrats permission to openly question whether he should remain in the race. So it remains unclear whether the two have spoken since this whole situation happened over the summer.

SAENZ: Yes, she pushed back on some comments from her statement earlier in the week from Senator Bernie Sanders, that Independent from Vermont, who had said that the Democratic Party focused too much on identity issues instead of talking about kitchen-table economic concerns that Americans are facing. And Pelosi was very blunt in this interview saying, respectfully, that Bernie Sanders hasn't won on that national level, and that she does not think these are criticisms that really need to be brought forward. She tried to argue that some of the inroads that Republicans made with working-class voters did have to deal with the cultural issues. She pointed to guns, transgender issues and also abortion, reproductive rights as well. But what's happening right now in the Democratic Party is likely to continue for quite some time. There is a lot of soul searching, a lot of debate about messaging and strategy, and trying to determine what exactly went wrong for them in this election.
