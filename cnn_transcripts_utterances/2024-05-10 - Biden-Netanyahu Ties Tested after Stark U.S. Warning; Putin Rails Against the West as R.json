Republican lawmakers in the U.S. and former President Donald Trump also attacked President Biden, falsely accusing him of abandoning Israel.

How could these be fixed? The short answer, John, is it cannot be fixed. Because in that different segment that you showed from CNN from last night, Oren Liebermann mentioned a constitutional coup. That's where it all started. I mean, I'm not going 15 years and delving into history here. But in the last year, relations between Netanyahu and Joe Biden and President Joe Biden have become untenable and unfixable. So yes, you know, it could be mitigated.

Daniels defended herself saying just because they met for dinner does not mean they ate, saying, \"I've maintained that I didn't see any food. It was dinner, but we never got food.\" The two also went back and forth about an old tweet Daniels sent that said she is, quote, \"the best person to flush the orange turd down.\" Necheles argued the tweet meant she'd be instrumental in putting Trump in jail. Daniels disagreed, saying, \"I don't see 'instrumental' or 'jail' anywhere in that. You're putting words in my mouth.\" Also on the stand, Trump's former White House assistant Madeleine Westerhout, whose desk was right outside the Oval Office. The jury reviewed a contact list of people Trump spoke most to, which was sent to Westerhout, that included Cohen, tabloid executive David Pecker, among others. Westerhout testified about an email confirming a February 2017 meeting between Trump and Cohen in the Oval Office. Prosecutors alleged Cohen and Trump worked out the reimbursement for the hush money payment at the crux of the case in the Oval Office that month. She also confirmed that, in her experience, Trump liked to read things before signing them. Westerhout explained that checks were regularly sent about twice a month from the Trump Organization to Washington. She described bringing them in for Trump to sign and would then FedEx them back to the company. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
