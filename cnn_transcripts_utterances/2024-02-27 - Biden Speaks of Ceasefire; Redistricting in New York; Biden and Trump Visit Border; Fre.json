      "sentences": "All right, joining me now to continue the discussion is CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force colonel, Cedric Leighton.It is always a pleasure to see you. You just heard from Jeremy Diamond, both Hamas and the Israeli government is pouring water on something that the president said. Sort of an off-the-cuff comment on what is happening and the negotiations with the hostages and with the ceasefire in a coffee shop. What do you make of this? And can there be damage done if a president says something like this, like, something could happen by Monday, and the negotiations are ongoing? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, good morning, Sara. I think, yes, certainly damage can be done in a case like this. But I think what President Biden was doing was trying to exert some pressure on both sides. Both sides, you know, as Jeremy pointed out in his piece, they were looking at their posturing, their ability to get the maximum that they possibly can from these negotiations. The good news is that negotiations are going on right now. The bad news, or at least questionable news, is that neither side is really ready to say that they are ready to make these agreements. So, I think both Hamas and Israel are trying to gain maximum advantage at this particular point. They're not ready to say that they've reached an agreement yet, but an agreement is still possible. Whether that's going to happen by Monday, that is definitely a question, but I think President Biden was exerting some pressure there to try to get them to do exactly that. SIDNER: I do want to ask you about this. We've just learned here at CNN that an agreement would likely be implemented in multiple phases once an initial deal is made, and it could lead to a truce lasting for potentially as long as six weeks. How would this work if a deal is implemented in multiple phases?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it really depends on exactly what's specified within each of those phases. But normally, Sara, what you would see is something like this. The troops would -- fighting the Israeli troops would cease firing on Hamas. They would stop going after specific targets, or at least have some minimum parameter where they could go in against somebody but not against others. They would probably also withdraw from areas within Gaza. Some of those areas such as Gaza City, Rafah, of course right on the border with Egypt and the area where most people are now concentrated, and operations against Rafah would cease. So, that would be the kind of thing that I would expect to see in a situation like this.And then, you know, with a phased withdrawal of troops, that could coincide with the phases of the agreement. And then what you would also see is an exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners. That would be the kind of thing that I think would happen probably in like a second or a third phase of an agreement of this type.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Hamas probably wouldn't like that. On the other hand, the Israelis are insisting on something like that, or at least they have in the past. So, there could be a presence of perhaps as many as 30,000 IDF troops in Gaza. That would be a lot of troops, you know, somewhere around, what, seven or so brigades worth. And that would be the kind of thing that could potentially be a stumbling block in negotiations like this. I mean we're definitely not in the home stretch of something like this. But if the Israelis were to withdraw, there would be the possibility of, you know, some other force coming in to do this, but no other force has raised their hand to come in. No Pan-Arab (ph) force, no, you know, organization of African Unity (ph), no other Middle Eastern entity or multinational entity from the U.N. has been, you know, put forward as a possible peacekeeping force.And that, I think, presents some difficulties at this particular point as well. That's something that should be considered. But, of course, it would be very difficult for an international force to gain a foothold in Gaza as well.",

So, we've seen a tripling percentage of Americans say that immigration is the most important problem. A record high.And with this record high comes changing attitudes on something that a lot of people have been looking at over the past few years. Polling, a U.S. border wall with Mexico. Of course, Donald Trump has always been claiming that I'm going to build the wall. Take a look here. What do we see now? A majority of Americans agree with that position. Fifty- three percent believe that we should, in fact, have a U.S. border wall with Mexico. If you look back where we were five years ago when Donald Trump was president, it was just 42 percent.

You were in Congress for a long time, including many times when everyone got close to an immigration deal only to see it fall apart. A couple weeks ago there was a bipartisan agreement that a lot of people looked at and said would make things better, yet Republicans walked away. How frustrating is that for you? FRED UPTON (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, it was really frustrating because we've got to deal with immigration. I went to the border a whole bunch of times. It needs to be bipartisan. We've got divided government. And there's a little -- little good news this morning in that Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania and Jared Golden from Maine, Republican and Democrat, have introduced some legislation that could -- actually could be -- actually be on the floor is early as next week to deal with not only Ukraine, but also the border security. It's - it's got a one-year limit on remain in Mexico, so that's something that many Americans support. It takes us through the election and lets the next president then set the gauge. But, you know, we've got to deal with this issue. And we can't -- we can't punt the ball down the field, kick the ball down the field any longer. We've got to deal with it. You know, Ronald Reagan -- it was disappointing that the Senate didn't pass their bill. It was disappointing that former President Trump came out against it. I worked in the Reagan White House. And the theory back then was, if you can get half a loaf now and work to fight for the other half another day, that's a victory. We can't let this thing languished until next year. And now we've got a proposal. \"The Wall Street Journal\" actually endorsed it today, I'm told, in an editorial. It could still take some -- make some changes. But it's doable. And I just hope that we get some momentum on this legislation to deal with it, perhaps as early as next week.",
