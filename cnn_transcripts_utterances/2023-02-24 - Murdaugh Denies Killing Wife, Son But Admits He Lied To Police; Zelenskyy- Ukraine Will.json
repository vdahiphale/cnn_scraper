I also thought that he effectively put before the jury a redirect, so at the very end, that he was facing charges for the fraud crimes that he had just admitted to.

And in this case, it's not the case. And to expect the juror to make -- that one juror to make that leap from a drug addict to a serial liar, to a double murderer, that's a huge leap to ask people to make, especially in light of an alternative motive, which is social media and people, while it might be a long shot, people do know how devastating social media can be.

So I guess, I don't know, do you think jurors can separate somebody being a serial liar from being a murderer? O'TOOLE: I definitely do think that there are people that can do that. People can be extremely forgiving of someone that seems to be repentant about their past. And, again, that may not be the makeup of all the people on this jury, but all they need is to have one person that really relates to that, that has a very forgiving nature, that has a very empathic nature, and has those life experiences, for example, similar to what he was talking about today and that could be the combination for someone that decides to really side with him.",
