      "sentences": "Donald Trump's transition team is blasting a judge's ruling that the president-elect does not have presidential immunity in the New York hush money case.A jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts back in May for falsifying business records to cover up payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. But after his conviction the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, which caused the court to postpone, for example, the sentencing indefinitely. Now, New York Judge Juan Merchan has decided the conviction stands because the evidence that led to Trump's conviction was not related to his official conduct as president. CNN's Kara Scannell is joining us now. How did the judge come to this decision? You were there for the trial. You watched all of it. You watched as even one more person after another took the stand. How'd he get here?",

That one is focused on saying that the D.A.'s office and the judge can't move forward because Trump is president-election and any ongoing litigation would interfere in his decision-making -- you know, like hang over his head. And the D.A.'s office is saying that is not the case they're challenging this. The judge will have to decide that first.And Trump's team is also teeing up a motion to dismiss based on some juror misconduct. We don't know what that is yet. We might learn the details today or tomorrow. That is expected to be made public at some point. So there are two ongoing motions. But lawyers I've spoken to have said that there really is nothing to stop Judge Merchan from sentencing Trump before election. The D.A. makes that argument. And in the -- one of the D.A.'s filings they even say that the judge, because Trump is a first-time offender and based on the crime that he was convicted of, he doesn't have to be sent to jail. So for that reason they're saying there's also another -- that's just another reason why he could sentence him before the inauguration. It would tie it up. And a sentencing would be final judgment, which means that Trump would be a convicted felon even if he goes on to appeal it.",

Igor Kirillov is certainly one of the highest ranking Russian military members who was killed outside of the battlefields in and around Ukraine. And you can see behind me that the investigative committees are still very much working the scene. The area has been widely cordoned off. It has been so since the early morning hours since we got here. And it was in the early morning hours that Gen. Kirillov and an aide left that entrance that you see over there where you see those investigators there right now. And then apparently there was a bomb inside of an electric scooter that was planted there that went off as the two left that building, killing both of them instantly. The Russians are saying it was about 300 grams of TNT that was inside that bomb. There was also a lot of shrapnel which obviously caused severe injuries, in effect leading to their death. You can see now that the investigative committee has parked two vans over there seemingly trying to block the vision for us and obviously other people as well. Those were not there before. And just to give you an idea about how powerful this blast actually was, 300 grams of TNT doesn't sound like very much but if we pan over there we can see that in the adjacent building on the other side of the street, even several floors up, there are windows that have been shattered by the power of this explosion. As you can imagine, John, the Russians absolutely furious about this. There's been Russian politicians who have come out. This is officially being dealt with as a terrorist attack. There are many who are ripping into the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians, for their part, have already claimed responsibility for this, calling the general a legitimate target, John.",

And everything we're seeing to date, our assessment tells us that these are commercial drones, hobbyist drones, or law enforcement drones all operating legally and lawfully.I mean, when people shoot video of that, Kate -- I mean, they're -- you're seeing the lights on these things - the navigation lights. That's what's required if you're going to be flying in U.S. airspace at night are navigation lights. So clearly, they're being operated in a lawful and legal way. And we've seen nothing from their behavior -- nothing that tells us there's a public safety threat or a national security threat. I do want to add one point though. We've still got about 100 leads that the FBI is following up on, and if we learn something that contradicts that or something more -- something additional, something more specific, my goodness, we're going to come public and we're going to talk about it. We have been trying to be as transparent with the American people as we can.
