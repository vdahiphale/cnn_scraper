The U.S. Supreme Court keeps controversial border restrictions in place, leaving countless migrants with nowhere to go. Plus, reopening after zero COVID, how some countries are responding to China easing its troubled rules. And Ukrainian civilians come under attack again after maternity ward is hit by Russian shells. The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Biden administration's plan to lift Title 42. It's the ruling that the Trump era border restriction will remain in place while legal challenges play out. Since March 2020, this controversial policy has allowed border agents to turn away migrants in the name of COVID prevention and 19 Republican led states have filed a lawsuit saying that unwinding Title 42 would result in a migration catastrophe. Although this is a blow to the Biden administration's plan, the White House says it will comply with the ruling. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued this statementOur CNN Leyla Santiago has more on how migrants are reacting to this decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): There was a bit of a disappointing mood in conversations that I had with many of the migrants here, there was one mother who told me she was fleeing violence in Venezuela and she took months bringing herself as well as her two young children, including a toddler all the way here, said that they had been robbed in Mexico and that her intention had been to cross into the U.S. legally but because of Title 42, she was sent back. So, hearing that that remains in place for many of these migrants, not just this mother, many of the migrants we spoke to kind of echoed that same sentiment because as you can see behind me, these are migrants that have nowhere to go at this time. The city says that they have capacity at shelters. But many of these migrants say that they fear getting on any sort of bus not knowing exactly where they will end up, not having trust in any sort of individual who may be trying to help them. So, the city is saying that this is an issue trying to find a place where they can put some of the migrants that have come up that are refusing to go into shelters and staying on the sidewalk here where you will see children and toddlers under blankets sleeping overnight. The other big thing that the city is also continuing to do is they are moving ahead with their contingency plans. They are working on two vacant schools to serve as potential shelters in the future. Because despite this decision from the Supreme Court that keeps Title 42 in place, they still expect to have a lot of migrants because of what they're seeing across the border, seeing a lot of migrants just waiting for their moment to enter into the U.S. whenever that may be. I did speak to one shelter who said to me, an organizer at one of the shelters who said that he too was disappointed with this decision saying that this is something that could extend the bottleneck that they're seeing and put unsustainable pressure on law enforcement on the border. But for Republicans, this is a win. The Republican states that escalated this legal fight. This is a win for them. Governor Greg Abbott here in Texas was very quick to tweet when this was announced. Leyla Santiago, CNN, El Paso, Texas. (END VIDEO CLIP) [00:05:08] STOUT: Dylan Corbett joins us now from El Paso, Texas. He is the executive director of the Hope Border Institute. And thank you, sir, for joining us. Let's first talk about Title 42. The Supreme Court has ruled that the border program to expel migrants must remain in place. So, what does this mean for your work and what does this mean for migrants? DYLAN CORBETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (on camera): Yes, you know, it's a really difficult moment, this was sad news. Title 42 has been around for about three years. And during that time, we've had major restrictions on the ability of asylum seekers and migrants to access protection at the U.S.-Mexico border. This is really a relic of the previous administration. And the previous administration did everything it can to really deploy a politics of xenophobia, a politics of fear, and seal the border to vulnerable people. And that's precisely what Title 42 does. It's put too many people's lives in danger. It's returned migrants back to situations that are really dangerous for them and has taken people's lives. And so, today's decision is disheartening. It adds another layer of confusion to a really difficult situation at the border. But we'll continue to work to pick up the pieces.",

As we heard, the Supreme Court has decided that there will be several months before it gets a final hearing at the Supreme Court and we get a final decision, even though this administration is committed to rolling back the policy.But effectively, what it means is that asylum seekers trying to get an access asylum protection at the border could be turned away and are effectively be turned away -- turning away -- being turned away. And what that means is they're being sent to communities in northern Mexico that really don't have the social supports, the services that are necessary to take care of people. We're navigating a really complex system of asylum from the other side of the border, that people are there for weeks, people are there for months, I've known people who are -- who have been there for over here. We're talking about families, we're talking about moms and dads with children, and people who are bonafide asylum seekers, they're fleeing desperate situations of violence and persecution. We know the situation right now in Nicaragua, in Cuba, in Venezuela, the difficult circumstances in Central America. And people know the risks. As you said, right now, it's cold at the border. We've had several nights where we dropped below zero. But these are people who are very conscious of the risks, conscious of the dangers, conscious of the fact that they might be put in danger by a policy like Title 42. But still make the risk, still make the journey because they're looking for a shot at freedom, they're looking for a shot at safety.",

Italian officials are also testing every traveler from China who comes to the Milan Malpensa International Airport in the north.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The world's harshest quarantine is no more. As COVID sweeps through China, the country is scrapping quarantines for inbound travelers from January 8th, and promising to gradually restore outbound tourism. Since the start of the pandemic, China has severely limited who can go in and out of the country, drastically cutting the number of flights and forcing all incoming arrivals into government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines in China this year lasting as long as 21 days. There is no choice of where you go or what room you get. Once the doors closed, you can only open them for COVID tests and food pickups. Workers spray disinfectant in the hallways every few hours. Food delivery is not allowed for breakfast, lunch and dinner are part of quarantine fees. All of that is now soon going away.

Whether or not that's going to, you know, stop the spread, I don't think we really can say that, specially with Omicron sub variant, we've seen that, regardless, it finds a way to spread among populations.

Scholz, who is picking up his predecessor, Angela Merkel's, peace- making mantle, used his recent visit to Beijing to try to shut down Russia's war and head off one over Taiwan. SCHOLZ (through translator): It is important for China to use its influence on Russia. It is about principles of sovereignty and territory and integrity.

ROBERTSON (voice-over): As with previous years, 2023 will offer opportunity to develop diplomatic off-ramps. Perhaps none more poignant than the G7, to be hosted by Japan in Hiroshima. There will be another climate summit, too, but as this year's COP27 in Egypt showed, during global economic hardship, domestic politics trump collective salvation. The G20 in India could be a place where compromises are made. The war in Ukraine would be in its 19th month, and by then, battlefield realities hard to ignore, despite Putin's new threats of a long war. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: This will end, and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. ROBERTSON (voice-over): So the big diplomatic question for 2023: how to get Putin to agree? The answer may lie in the soaring food and energy costs triggered by the war. If the global situation worsens, collective pressure for some kind of peace will increase. The test of 2023: what to do if Putin ignores the warnings. Nic Robertson, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
