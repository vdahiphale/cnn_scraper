This hour I will speak to the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator about ending the conflict. But first, a Moscow court has upheld the detention of an American journalist accused of spying on Russia. Evan Gershkovich's lawyer plans to appeal the decision. The FBI has arrested two men in New York accused of operating an undeclared police station on behalf of the Chinese government. Prosecutors say the station in Chinatown was used to monitor and intimidate Chinese dissidents in the U.S. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited the frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the town of -- surrounded by Russian forces on three sides. This comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin made a rare visit to Russian occupied Southern Ukraine. The Kremlin says he also met with Russian troops at a military base in Kherson. Right now we're watching developments in Sudan where a 24-hour ceasefire is scheduled to begin in less than one hour but there is a lot of uncertainty. Earlier today rival generals from Sudan's armed forces and paramilitary forces said they agreed to the truce. A short time later Sudan's military disputed that on its Facebook page vowing to defeat the paramilitary force. We are monitoring all of this closely for you as the start time of that proposed truce approaches. But for the moment there is no letting up in the fighting and innocent lives are being lost and official with \"Doctors without Borders\" says most of the wounded are civilians who've been caught in the crossfire take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MACFARLANE (voice over): Fighting rages on in Sudan's Capital Khartoum, key targets are the airport and the presidential palace state TV broadcaster. And it's not limited to the capital fighting also spreading in other parts of the country. Water and electricity cut off hospitals coming under fire. At least 180 people killed since fighting started on Saturday, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors, diplomats also in the line of fire, ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I can confirm that yesterday we had an American diplomatic convoy that was fired on all of our people are safe and unharmed. But this action was reckless. It was irresponsible and of course unsafe. MACFARLANE (voice over): And the EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Burrell, confirming a European Union Ambassador was assaulted in their residency in Sudan, a worsening situation as the international community scrambles to find a solution. ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: I strongly condemn the outbreak of fighting that is taking place in Sudan, and the appeal to the leaders of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to immediately cease hostilities restore calm and begin a dialogue to resolve the crisis. MACFARLANE (voice over): The latest fighting making an already dire situation in Sudan, much worse. Three World Food Program employees have been killed in the fighting, forcing the United Nations to temporarily shut down many of its more than 250 programs across Sudan, leaving an estimated 16 million people without much needed aid, a reminder of the true human toll of armed conflict.

So the UN has been asked about this, are you referred to a variety of diplomatic efforts in the same way, what from a humanitarian perspective, we know this from experience around the world, what is important is that any commitment made by the Sudanese Armed Forces, or the RSF, should be accompanied by charity about what is going to happen or not happen in what places for what period of time? Otherwise, people will come out of their homes, try to make it to hospitals, and be caught in a crossfire again, and that's what's happened in the last couple of days, we must hope that there is much clearer accountability and publication of the promises made by those two generals.

That it should be a 24-hour ceasefire as a beginning, for example, that it should operate in certain ways that there should be a hotline and so forth. So that there is clarity from the international community and consensus among those interests, which can be brought to bear on the two militaries, to encourage them in this direction. That's very, very important. There is a lot of diplomatic activity. There is the African Union, the United Nations, as you know, together very much involved in the transition of the peace process, now focused on this.

There has been looting of our premises, there has been occupation of hospitals, there has been occupation of homes, UN has 4000 staff and dependents in Sudan. So we are among those who may be targeted. We are very, very vigilant about this. We will of course, be making inquiries as to who has perpetrated these crimes in due course, to hold them to account. But meanwhile, those pauses, those ceasefires are the condition precedent to get us back on the road. And I want to stress because that's only a condition precedent, the real challenge is going to be getting that massive humanitarian aid program back into shape, and producing aid to those up to 60 million people across the country. Stocks are down, hospitals are looted, we'll need to find out what's left? Where we can resupply from? Where we can find people who can move humanitarian workers who can move safely?

The U.S. Ambassador to Russia is calling for the immediate release of a Wall Street Journal Reporter who's just been denied an appeal against the terms of his detention. Evan Gershkovich is the first American journalist to be detained in Russia over espionage allegations since the Cold War. That hearing took place in Russia state media report -- as Russia media state reported that Russia, Vladimir Putin has made a rare visit to parts of Ukraine's occupied by Moscow. A video released by the Kremlin appears to show the Russian President meeting military commanders in the Kherson region. The Kremlin says the visit happened on Monday so a lot to discuss here. Let's bring in Matthew Chance who's here in London. And Matthew to this court hearing first, I guess this was the first sort of glimpse we've had of Evan Gershkovich in many weeks.

There was some concern or some question over when it actually happened. The Kremlin have clarified it happened on Monday, but it's only today. They've released the images. It was a surprise visit and a very rare one, as you rightly say. But it was just in March I think that President Putin also visited another area of the war zone where the special military operations Russia calls that it is being carried out when he went to Mariupol to see civilians and inspect troops there as well.

And one of the biggest moments of the day there are plenty of ceremonies all throughout the day are those sirens that you just heard. So, at 10 am exactly what are normally air raid sirens go off for exactly two minutes and the entire country freezes in place. Even people who are driving along the highways will stop their cars and get out of their cars and stand to attention. People crossing the street will stop exactly where they are, and standing attention in respect to the millions of people who lost their lives. Now much of the main ceremonies happen of course here in Israel at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial and Museum there are six torches to represent the 6 million Jews killed. They are lit by six Holocaust survivors. It is 2023 and there are more than 147,000 recognized Holocaust survivors still alive, living in Israel. More than 400 of them celebrated their 100th birthday this year, though, so they have very clear memories of the Holocaust. And interestingly, Christina, more than 500 of them just recently actually moved here from Ukraine leaving of course, the Russian invasion of Ukraine to come to safer places here in Israel. They have more than 500 of them recognized as survivors of the Holocaust, but their numbers of course, are dwindling. There is a race against time by Yad Vashem to get as many of their testimonies recorded as possible. Now, what's interesting is at the ceremony today, we saw the Israeli President Isaac Hertzog appearing alongside the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and even the head judge of the Israeli Supreme Court, Esther Hayut. And it has been, of course, been a very divisive time in Israel, and especially within Israeli society over politics over these proposed judicial reforms. But in his speech, the Israeli President Isaac Hertzog called in the country to set politics aside, at least for today to call on people to unite. And remember, one of the central themes, of course, of this year's Remembrance Day is the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising but just a very somber day for this entire country. It kicks off a week of memorial days here in Israel next week will be the Memorial Day for the soldiers and it will end in the Independence Day next week, Christina.",

Rockefeller, this founder of Standard Oil the company which wants control 90 percent of petroleum production in the United States. It made its founder one of the richest men ever. The Rockefeller Foundation got its start in 1913 when the oil tycoon provided an endowment of $100 million. The mission of the foundation has been to harness science and technology to promote the well-being of humanity throughout the world. And since then, the foundation has provided over $22 billion to programs initiatives. One of its main goals now is to empower people by connecting them to renewable electricity, creating green jobs and cutting carbon emissions. It helped launch the Global Energy Alliance for people and planet. In November 2021 with 19 partners, including two other major worldwide philanthropic organizations, the Bezos Earth Fund, and the IKEA Foundation. The Council of the Alliance met today to pledge to reduce dramatically the cost of renewable energy technologies. Well, joining me now is the Co-Chair of the Alliance and the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, Dr. Rajiv Shah. Doctor, thank you so much for joining us! Let's talk first about this meeting that has just happened today. Bring us up to date on what was discussed and what tangible action came from it? DR. RAJIV SHAH, PRESIDENT, THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION: Well, Christina, thank you for having me. This alliance is you so effectively introduced is actually constituted of 19 major organizations including philanthropies like ours and the others you mentioned, but also the World Bank, other regional development banks, investors and private sector investors. And together we've mobilized more than $11 billion to help lower income countries get access to renewable energy. And believe it or not, that is so important for two reasons. One is actually the fight for whether or not the earth stays at one and a half degrees Celsius, will now be won or lost in 81 low income and low- and middle-income countries around the world. And the second is because, in reality, even today, almost a billion people have almost no access to real electricity and power and are therefore trapped in poverty. So today, our council came together and committed to take certain steps that will help dramatically reduce the cost of renewable energy access in developing economies. And also, specifically to expand access to important technologies like batteries, which right now are simply not available to most developing countries, those supply chains are very tight, and most battery production is going to the wealthier parts of the world.",

And even though the family has been out of that business since 2011, they only pledged, or you only pledged to divest its endowment away from fossil fuel investments in 2020. So why has it taken so long for the foundation to come to that decision? DR. SHAH: Well, it took perhaps too long, you know, I started and we put a process in place and then made that decision within a few years of when I got here. But the reality is we're the first major foundation of our type in our peer group to make that pledge. I think a number of others have followed us since then. Frankly, the universities went before us, many more courageous universities went ahead and made that pledge earlier. So, the reality is, we think more institutions should stop financing, fossil fuels and focus as we have on investing in renewable energy in these economies. But it's not just about investment. The council that came together today includes political leaders like Prime Minister Jonas Store of Norway. And a lot of what we have to do is help countries around the world change their policies, and make much larger public investments in renewable electricity, and frankly, and renewable electricity that reaches everyone. And so, we spend a lot of time with heads of state in dozens of countries, getting the commitment level up and focusing on applications of renewable electricity that can finally reach everyone, and energy poverty and make sure that the next cycle of growth is much, much more inclusive as we go forward.",

So, the work you are doing, we know is vital. And let's hope that countries and organizations will work with you. Unfortunately, Dr. Rajiv Shah, we'll have to leave it there, but it's great to hear your perspective on this and have an update on how this is progressing. DR. SHAH: Thank you for having me.",

This year's tournament is the biggest inhistory with 32 teams competing up from 24 in 2019, and eight teams on debut. My colleague Becky Anderson chatted with Sarai Bareman, who is the first ever FIFA Chief Women's Football Officer and asked her how the preparations have been coming along, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARAI BAREMAN, FIFA CHIEF WOMEN'S FOOTBALL OFFICER: We are in full delivery mode, making sure that everything is ready. The stadiums, the pictures, the training sites, basically to welcome all the teams and the international fans. So yes, it's a very exciting moment. There's a lot going on at the moment in Australia and New Zealand. And yes, it's building up to be the biggest woman's world cup that will ever see. BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): And as far as ticket sales are concerned, go on; tell us where you at are?",

And we'vesold more than 100,000 since we launched that. So yes, we're really, really pleased with the way things are tracking. However, in saying that, you know, there are still tickets available for matches right across the tournament across the nine incredible host cities. ANDERSON (on camera): Yes, so right, FIFA launched its global strategy for women's football then in 2018. It described the state of play to be and I quote here, \"in rude health and in need of fundamental change and it aim to double the number of female players to 60 million by 2026\" Are you on track?",

You know, there's nothing like a Women's World Cup once every four years to create a huge boom for the popularity of our sport for the commercial value of our sport for our athletes to be showcased. Everything that women's football is about a spotlight really shines on it during this moment once every four years. ANDERSON (on camera): What are the other bigger challenges in growing the women's game globally right now, do you believe?",

You know, we're for the first time we have unbundled the rights to the woman's world cap. We have a dedicated strategy for women's football commercially, and we want to drive the commercial value of our sport. ANDERSON (on camera): FIFA recently announced a 300 percent jump in prize money increase ahead of the tournament; bring it to $150 million. FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced last month that the organization aims to have equal pay for the 2026 Men's and 2027 Women's World Cup. He said though, it would be complicated to get there. What's the strategy so right to pull that off?",

And I've been very fortunate in my last, you know, six years at this organization to be able to visit many of them. And when you're in this global position, you're dealing with countries that are so vastly different. Their cultural background, their religious backgrounds, you know, the, the way that they vote, the way that they elect leaders, all these things are totally different. And that's why when we take an approach to things like commercialization, we take decisions around football and how we organize it. We have to put a global lens on these sorts of things.
