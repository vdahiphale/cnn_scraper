This is a popular narrative with conservatives and, frankly, Jim Jordan who has really made it his mission in this Congress to investigate what he says is alleged political bias at the Justice Department, at the FBI. He has provided pretty scant evidence to back this up so far.But in this subcommittee hearing today, we are going to hear from Senator Chuck Grassley, Senator Ron Johnson, two senators who have previously looked into this issue. We're also going to hear from ex- Congresswoman, ex-Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, as well as a couple of former FBI agents, as the Republicans try to make their case. But, again, the issue here is actually providing some evidence to bolster these bombastic claims. And this was a problem that we saw for Republicans yesterday in a House Oversight Committee that focused on Twitter and focused on the temporary suppression of the story about Hunter Biden's laptop ahead of the 2020 election. Republicans had a lot of big claims in that hearing, essentially insisting that Twitter did the work of the FBI, it was a subsidiary of the FBI, and that just wasn't backed up by the witness testimony. Take a listen to what a couple of the former executives from Twitter had to say in yesterday's hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We heard from James Baker saying he didn't recall speaking to the FBI about this issue.And we also heard some pretty fulsome pushback from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee yesterday. We are going to hear that same kind of fulsome pushback from Democrats on this so-called weaponization subcommittee today. They don't even agree with the premise that there is this weaponization of the federal government.

His music spanned generations, providing signature hits for acts like The Carpenters, Dusty Springfield, Luther Vandross, Tom Jones and Dionne Warwick. Bacharach collaborated with other songwriters, including Carole Bayer Sager, the third of his four wives. His second wife was Actress Angie Dickinson. Their high-profile marriage lasted 15 years. Bacharach was born on May 12th, 1928 in Kansas City, Missouri. As a young man, he won a scholarship to the Music Academy of the West and had a short stent in the Army before becoming the music director for Actress Marlene Dietrich, a prophetic sign for his career where music and movies would intertwine. Bacharach won an Oscar for Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head, the theme song for Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid and another for the movie score. He took home is third Oscar for the theme song from the film, Arthur. He also won six Grammys.",
