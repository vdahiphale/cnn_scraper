Both candidates swept Tuesday's primaries in three states, capturing enough delegates to win their party's nominations.A projected win in Washington state helped put Donald Trump over the top. His last remaining Republican challenger Nikki Haley dropped out of the race last week. And President Joe Biden wrapped things up with a win in Georgia. He will officially be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. Poll shows voters are concerned about Biden's age and many in his own party disapprove of his handling of the war in Gaza. Meanwhile, Trump is facing 91 felony charges for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, mishandling classified documents and covering up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. More now on Trump's quest to retake the White House from CNN's Kristen Holmes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: While former President Donald Trump clinched the Republican nomination on Tuesday night, it was too much little fanfare. He didn't come out. He didn't give any remarks. He didn't even hold an event. It was almost as though he was also the incumbent. But Donald Trump's team has been focused on the general election for weeks. They had started to pivot to try to build out their ground game operation in pivotal states, battleground states, particularly Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, states some of which Donald Trump won in 2016 and lost in 2020. They believe this matchup against Biden is going to be incredibly close. And as one senior advisor put it to me, they don't want to leave a single vote on the table. Now, we have heard a lot about Donald Trump's struggles with suburban voters. Donald Trump's team is keenly aware of that. And the former president is not going to change and likely to not win over huge swaths of suburban voters. So part of the strategy there is going to try to offset those voters with different blocks of Democratic-leaning voters, or traditionally Democratic-leaning voters. Donald Trump's team sees an opening with black male voters in the state of Georgia. They see an opening with working class voters in the state of Michigan. This is not all of these voters, but it is enough. They believe they can siphon off enough of these different voting demographics to try and offset what they are seeing in the suburbs, what they are seeing with independents. Now, what they are doing, they're hunkering down right now and coming up with exactly what that strategy is going to look like and what exactly their ground game is going to look like in these various states, because Donald Trump and his team, as we have reported before, believe that he has a path to the White House. But it is a very narrow one, and it is going to require them to fight again for every single vote. So that is what they are turning their attention to right now. Kristin Holmes, CNN, Washington.

If conditions get better, though, Rosemary, what's really important for Biden is that he show he is in command and he's making progress on the things people really care about.

Crucially, 155 mm artillery ammunition. This is some of the most needed basic weaponry to hold the line against the Russians. Russia able to fire a far greater amount of artillery ammunition because of its supply lines and its ability to put its economy on a wartime footing. Ukraine has had to rely on US supplies and the last U.S. aid package was back on December 27th. In terms of what else is in this package, it also includes anti- aircraft missiles. Those are needed to repel Russian air assaults, as well as more of the necessary weapons and equipment. But the U.S. made it clear this is only a tiny fraction of what Ukraine needs. And this may only be able to help Ukraine for a matter of weeks, perhaps as little as a couple of weeks, according to the White House. And that is why the U.S. pushed both the White House and the Pentagon to put forward a need for the supplemental $90 billion that's already gotten through the Senate, but it's stuck in the House. Critically, it includes $60 billion for Ukraine. That, the White House, the Pentagon and Ukraine have made clear, is much needed, especially at this point in the fight, when Ukrainian forces are having to ration some of their ammunition to make sure it doesn't run out. They need U.S.-supplied weapons, essentially, to be able to push back against these Russian advances. Some of the other countries in Europe have stepped up and tried to fill that gap, but it is the US that has been the bulk of the provider here, and it is the US that is still very much needed in this case.

ARIEL HENRY, HAITIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): My government will leave immediately after the integration of the council. We will be a caretaker government until they name a prime minister and a new cabinet. Haiti needs peace. Haiti needs stability. OPPMANN (through translator): Henry had traveled from Haiti to Kenya to sign an agreement with the government there to provide troops to fight the out-of-control gangs terrorizing his beleaguered nation. Once he left, the gangs united to further batter the Haitian government in a series of coordinated attacks. The latest explosion of violence leading to a massive jailbreak that freed thousands of prisoners closed the country's main airport indefinitely and forced the United States and other embassies to evacuate diplomats by helicopter. The news of Henry's impending resignation is not placating the leaders of gangs, though, who have threatened an all-out civil war. JIMMY CHERIZIER, HAITI GANG LEADER (through translator): We in Vivasan are demanding that the Haitian people must choose the person who will lead the country. OPPMANN (through translator): But it is the Haitian people who are suffering the most. More than 300,000 have been displaced by the violence, the U.N. says. Gangs block access to food, water and hospitals, using hunger and sexual violence as weapons of war. Bodies of their victims lie uncollected on streets. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with regional leaders in Jamaica. And announced an increase in U.S. funding to the security mission to be led by Kenyan troops. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm announcing today that the United States Department of Defense is doubling its approved support for the mission from $100 million to $200 million. And that brings the total U.S. support to $300 million for this effort. OPPMANN (through translator): Following the announcement that Henry will resign, Kenyan officials now saying a government needs to be in place in Haiti before their troops can deploy, creating more doubt of when exactly they will have boots on the ground to begin fighting the heavily armed local gang.

But Hur insists politics played no part in his report and said those references were necessary and accurate. Were they legally necessary? JACKSONI'm in the minority on this and I'll tell you why. What happens is taking a step back. First of all, this is a person who's in a no win situation. Why do I say that? Number one, you're in an election year and in an election year, people want their candidate to win. The political parties want their candidate to win. And so if you're Republican, you're hoping that the special counsel indicts the former vice president, then vice president, now the president, right, Biden, with respect to the classified documents. And if you don't do that, that -- that is indict. The Republicans are upset about that. So now you're before the committee with a whole bunch of upset Republicans saying, why wouldn't you indict at the same time that you don't indict? But you call out the president by speaking to him, being elderly and having memory loss. The Democrats are going to go wild. Why? OK, you didn't indict him, but you impugned his character. And here's why I come full circle of why I'm in the minority, Rosemary, in terms of why it was appropriate for him to say that most legal analysts will tell you it was not appropriate. If you are rendering findings of fact and drawing conclusions of law and essentially what Hur said is that there was a willful retention of documents, classified documents, and there was even a sharing of those documents. But you're not indicting. The critical question becomes, well, why not? And then I think the answer has to be because I've made the determination that a jury would conclude that we can't prove our case. Well, why would a jury make such a conclusion? Then Hur goes on to say it's because a jury could in fact conclude that it was because Biden was elderly. Biden had potential memory problems. And as a result of that, they would not be willing to convict him.",

It's sort of like the way it happens in our legal system is, say, for example, you do get charged and you go before a jury and you're found not guilty.One could make the argument that you're not exonerated there. Why do I say that? Why I say it is because a jury doesn't make a finding and a determination as to innocence. They make a finding and determination as to you not being guilty. Same reasoning applies here. What Hur is saying is that he didn't indict, not to say that the former vice president and now President Biden didn't do anything wrong, but he didn't find that it met the legal standard. And so technically, it's not an exoneration. It's just an indication that he could not prove his case.",

Tate's spokesperson responded swiftly to the arrests, calling them bewildering and saying that they had left the brothers quote \"dismayed and deeply troubled\". Both brothers categorically reject all charges, the spokesperson added. The pair appeared before a Bucharest court on Tuesday, with Andrew telling the judge he wanted to quote \"remain in Romania and clean up his reputation rather than be extradited to the U.K.\" Tate, who previously had his social media accounts suspended on several occasions, also made a typically cryptic post after the news broke, saying, The Matrix is afraid, but I only fear God. The former kickboxer turned social media influencer built up his fame and loyal following online, drawing attention for his posts encouraging young men to engage in money-making schemes. Long accused of promoting misogynist views to impressionable audiences, things took a darker turn when Andrew and his brother were arrested in Romania in 2022 on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal group to sexually exploit women. Little has been heard from the brothers since their release from house arrest last August. Their lawyers are now set to be kept busy with these fresh charges, with a Romanian court hearing still looming on the cards for later on this year. Bianca Nobilo, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
