We are getting word that the White House, and House Republicans are getting closer to a deal, to raise the debt ceiling, one week before the U.S. runs out of money. CNN's Melanie Zanona is live for us, in Washington. Melanie, so what do we know, right now, about where the deal stands, between Kevin McCarthy, House Republicans, and the White House?",

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, I think we should caveat by saying nothing has been agreed upon yet. Nothing has been finalized.They are moving closer to a deal. We have seen some progress, over the last 12 hours, particularly on the spending issue. That has been something that has been really bedeviling the talks. But they've started at least floating the idea, of a potential compromise that both sides could try to claim, as essentially a win. And one of the things that they're discussing is raising the debt ceiling, for two years, which would be longer than what House Republicans had proposed, in their debt ceiling plan, in the House, and then instituting spending caps, for two years. So, caps on federal spending levels. Again, they have not agreed on those top 10 (ph) numbers for those spending caps. But one of the emerging sort of compromises here is the idea that they would spare Pentagon funding, so they would spare specific domestic programs, so that Democrats could say, \"We actually didn't cut certain things,\" and other programs would see some cuts, which Republicans could then claim as a win. So, you're starting to see the contours of how a spending provision deal might come together. But I will caution that there are a number of other outstanding issues, particularly on the issue of tougher work requirements, for social safety net programs. That has been something that both sides have been really dug in on. Republicans included it in their bill in the House. They are demanding it. They say it's a red line for them. And then, you have Democrats, who they're going to need to supply votes, to get this thing, over the finish line as well, saying they can't support something that has really any form of tougher work requirements. So, that's really where the issue lies. And there's other issues, where they're starting to see more agreement. One of those issues is clawing back unspent COVID money. That's something that they agree on. Permitting reform generally has agreement, but again, they have not finalized how to get there yet. So where we're at right now is that negotiators, they left the Capitol building, for the evening. They are not expecting a deal, to come together, tonight. But they are going to work tomorrow, through the weekend, and try to really wrap this thing up as soon as possible. Because, of course, the timeline, Abby, is such a crucial factor, here. They are trying to raise the debt ceiling by June 1. But that process takes time. Even when they have an agreement, they still need to turn it into legislative bill texts. They need to get what's called a score, from the Congressional Budget Office. Then they need to give members, 72 hours, to be able to actually read the bill. That's a promise that McCarthy made to his members, during the Speakership race. And so, once it gets through the House, then it starts to go over the Senate, where you already have conservatives, like Mike Lee, who are threatening to hold things up, if they don't like what they see in the deal. So, a lot of obstacles between now and the finish line. But we are starting to see some slight signs of progress, which is obviously a welcome development, after days of talks of it, and really up and down and back and forth, Abby.",

A new twist, tonight, in the intensifying federal investigation, into Donald Trump. Was a dress rehearsal held at Mar-a-Lago, to move around sensitive documents, before the Feds came to get them? And if so, the crucial question is why? And did Donald Trump himself take part in or direct such a dry run? So tonight, the Washington Post reports never-before-heard evidence that may be crucial to the Special Counsel's investigation. On June 2 of last year, according to The Post, two Trump employees, allegedly moved boxes of papers, that day, back into the storage room, at the former President's Florida Resort. It was just one day, before the FBI showed up, to retrieve classified documents, in response to a grand jury subpoena. Now, the timing that The Post's sources are saying is suspicious, to investigators, and could be an indication of possible obstruction. And another big headline, from this reporting, is the alleged dress rehearsal that Trump, and his aides, are said to have held, practicing, moving around papers, even before his office had received that subpoena, last May. And finally, The Post says prosecutors have gathered evidence, indicating that Trump sometimes kept classified documents, in his office, where they were visible. And he even showed them to others. Even he didn't give a full-throated denial of that during CNN's Town Hall, this month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We spend a lot of time, as lawyers, assessing not only factually what someone does, but we assess what their mind frame was, when they did it. There's a distinction, for example, between doing something, intentionally, or doing something, recklessly, or doing something, knowingly. At the end of the day, if you're moving around boxes and that type thing, what may that evidence? It evidences a consciousness of guilt. If you don't think anything's to see in the boxes, what's the basis for moving them? If you don't think you did anything wrong, why do anything with the boxes at all? And so, it's troubling, with respect to the obstruction of justice charge, when you look at the shifting and movement. And then, of course, it gives the Special Counsel, reason, to believe, there was something amiss, which was the basis and purpose, for them being moved, in the first place.",

He's leading the field with 60 percent of the Democratic or Democratic leaning voters, as his first choice.And Robert Kennedy Jr. is at 20 percent. Marianne Williamson, she's at 8 percent. And despite a wide lead, for the nomination, the new CNN poll also shows President Biden's overall favorability, declining, and many Americans seeing a second Biden term, as a negative thing, for the country. My panel is back with me. And Catherine, we talked about President Biden's approval rating. It's low. It's in the 30s, at this point. That's still around President Trump. He's at 37. That's within the margin of error. But this, for Biden, I think, is a little bit different. Typically, he has benefited from generally people giving him the benefit of the doubt.

      "sentences": "Yes, exactly. I mean, there's a number of reasons why sharks will occasionally bite people, sometimes eat people. And mistaken identity is one of these big factors. But in that situation, they think you're something else. The visibility is murky. The water's rough. They think you're a seal. They think you're, on a surfboard, they think, white shark thinks you're a seal.In this case, in Turks and Caicos, it's an amazing dive location. The visibility is essentially limitless. So, in this situation, I really don't think it was mistaken identity. Another reason why sharks occasionally bite people is curiosity. When this girl lost her limb, definitely not curiosity. Another reason is defense. They get provoked, they get aggressive, because they're defending their territory, or defending themselves. And then, lastly, hunger. And, in my opinion, in this situation, based on what I've read, and what I've heard, there's so many, in clear water. They're offshore. There was reference of it could potentially be a Caribbean reef shark. But from what I'm hearing about the loss of limb, it could have been a tiger shark, a bull shark, I would put my money on either of those two species.",

There's more coastal population that is exploding, here in Florida, especially. So, it's kind of tough to say. The bottom line is if sharks thought humans were a viable prey item, something a food source that it could eat regularly, they would. They would hunt and kill us every single day, because we're slow, we're easy to catch. And -- but the reality is, everything we just talked about, mistaken identity, curiosity, defense, or hunger? These sharks, at the end of the day, they are predators. We are protein. So, it's a risk you take. My condolences to the family. I mean, this sounds like a really interesting situation, where they're snorkeling off shore, and then seemingly out of nowhere --",
