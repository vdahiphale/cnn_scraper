The bad weather is complicating travel for those celebrating Father's Day on Sunday and Juneteenth on Monday. Sixty million people are waking up today under severe storm risks.Yesterday, we saw more than 8,600 flights in the U.S. delayed, and that's according to FlightAware, and nearly 600 flights were canceled on Friday. Well, today is off to a better start. Even so around 120 flights have been canceled so far with just over 500 delays from Colorado to Florida. Severe storms could produce very large hail, damaging winds and a few tornadoes. Oklahoma and parts of surrounding states are in the crosshairs. CNN's Pete Muntean has the latest on the busy holiday travel from Reagan National Airport. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT: The Federal holiday for Juneteenth is not until Monday although so many people are traveling right now. In fact, at one point here at Reagan National Airport the line for the security checkpoint behind me was passed where I am standing 2.73 million people screened at airports across the country, just yesterday, according to the TSA. That is 10,000 people shy than the pandemic era air travel record that was set back on the Friday before Memorial Day. Fourteen percent higher than the same day last year. The numbers have been huge all week, above 2.4 million people each day leading up to this weekend. Here's what's happening and confluence of things. Summer travel, it's also Father's Day weekend, the Federal holiday and more states are recognizing Juneteenth as a holiday. It's going to be so busy in the skies. In fact, the FAA says that Thursday was the biggest day for air traffic it has seen since the start of the pandemic, 52,000 commercial flights scheduled, about 50,000 scheduled on Friday. So now, we're seeing really agenesis of a long holiday weekend for travel from here on out. Added to the list with Labor Day, Memorial Day, and July 4th. And that pent-up demand for air travel because of the downturn in the pandemic. Travel site, Hopper, says folks are actually paying a little bit more because of that. In fact, the summer average round trip ticket, domestically, $288, but this weekend, they're paying about $312. Pete Muntean, CNN, Reagan National Airport. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, we're not talking about classified information here, we're talking about the other sensitive information that is part of this case. Now, among the rules that prosecutors are seeking here have to do with the defendants, former president Trump and his aide, Walt Nauta. They are insisting that the two defendants not be able to view any of the evidence that is shared with attorneys without their attorneys present. They also request that they not be given copies of it or be able to take notes and then take those notes. The notes need to be protected and kept safe by the attorneys. Now, prosecutors say in this request that they worry that sharing this information with the public or others could compromise other ongoing investigations, witnesses, or other people who haven't been charged. We know the Special Counsel is, of course, looking at the events in and around January 6, and efforts to undermine the 2020 election. We also know that many of the witnesses in the Trump documents case are also interviewed in the January 6 investigation. Now, when it comes to classified information, they're not quite there yet because the Trump attorneys need clearances before they can handle any of those sensitive secrets that are at the heart of this case. The former president is accused of taking over 30 documents. Now earlier this week, the judge overseeing this case, Aileen Cannon, she told the lawyers to begin that process to get their clearances. She wants an update next week. Now the lawyers, Todd Blanche and Chris Kise have said they're already in touch with the Justice Department to get that process started so that they can eventually be able to view classified evidence as well.

And the next big thing we expect to see, of course, is King Charles and Queen Camilla leaving Buckingham Palace in a big procession.They will leave from the palace and they will go down the Mount Horse Guards Parade where the Trooping of the Colour will take place. This is a really old ceremonial tradition. It's taken place for well over 200 years now to celebrate a monarch's birthday. That official birthday, because as you say, unfortunately, U.K. can't really better monarchs having birthdays that are conducive to parades in terms of weather. You may remember the coronation only five weeks ago. The rain really did ruin the parade to some extent. Today, the weather is beautiful, the sun is shining, potentially a little bit hot for all those soldiers in their fit woolen [ph] tunics and the big bear skin hats. There were some faints, unfortunately, actually last weekend during the rehearsal, hopefully not today. This will be a long procession to Horse Guards Parade and then quite a long ceremony. And Trooping the Colour really dates back to when regiments would need to show their regimental flag and they'd pass it through a regiment so all the soldiers would recognize it in battle. So that's really where it dates back from. And each year, this is the Household Division, so there are five Foot Guard regiments, two cavalry regiments, and each year one of the Foot Guards regiments gets to troop their color. And this year it is the Welsh Guards. Now, the colonel of the Welsh Guards is Prince William, the new Prince of Wales, which makes it extra special really. And actually once upon a time, King Charles was the colonel of that regiment as well. So really, a passing of the baton in many ways at this year's Trooping the Colour. We are expecting the King to be leaving Buckingham Palace very shortly, but I was told called a pass [ph] that potentially we're running just a couple of minutes late at this stage. We will be seeing the king on horseback. This will be the first time we've seen him on it on horseback to inspect the troops and be a part of their ceremony. Actually, since 1986, Queen Elizabeth II did do it on horseback for some time before retiring into a carriage. We'll see, I think, in the carriage today Queen Camilla and Kate, the Duchess, sorry, not the Duchess of Cambridge. She was the Duchess of Cambridge, she's now was the Princess of Wales. They are also both colonels of regiments as well. And other members of the Royal Family will be on horseback. I expect to see Princess Anne, who was colonel of the Blues and Royals. The Duke of Kent, he was the colonel of the Scots Guards. We will likely see the Duke of Edinburgh as well, Prince Andrew, who is now colonel of the London Guards, which is the reserve unit of the Foot Guards. And all this should be taking off fairly soon.

He did serve in the Blues and Royals which is one of the cavalry regiments of the Household Division which plays a huge role. Today, they will be part of the procession for King Charles taking him from the palace to Horse Guards Parade. So I think for Prince Harry, wherever he is, it might be a tricky day to actually look at all the ceremony taking place here.

(END VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): The use of nuclear weapons undoubtedly is theoretically possible for Russia. For Russia, it is possible if there's a threat to our territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty to the existence of the Russian state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But, of course, this is a concern. And we heard from the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.K., in fact, issuing warning saying that the West should be taking this very, very seriously. Kim.",

The King is joining 1,500 soldiers and 300 horses taking part in the birthday celebrations. King Charles was actually born in November, but British monarchs usually hold the official ceremony in the summer when the weather is more ideal.

He actually trained with the RAF, he served with the Royal Marines. Early on in his military career, he was the colonel of the parachute regiment, an elite regiment and he decided to actually go through the very grueling training for that, just he says so he could look the soldiers in the eye when he took out that ceremonial role. He was also, of course, the colonel of the Welsh Guards, which is the regiment that's been true today and the regiment that his son, the Prince of Wales, is now the colonel of.So many links here and Prince of -- Prince of Wales. King Charles is, of course, extremely competent on horseback. So I don't think anyone's got any qualms about that. He will be taking a slow pace, I imagine, down The Mall as well. And I'm sure this horse has been incredibly well trained. And I must add, I have heard that the horses that you'll see today, there are 300 horses taking part. They go through a rigorous grooming process to make sure that there is not a hair out of place, so they should be gleaming and resplendent down The Mall. Kim?",

We've seen the kings chief Royal Horse Artillery take up position because they'll be firing off a gun salutes later in the day at the end of the Trooping of the Colour.
