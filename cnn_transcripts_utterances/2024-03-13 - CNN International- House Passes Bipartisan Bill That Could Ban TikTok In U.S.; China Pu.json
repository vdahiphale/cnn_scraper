Today, lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives voted to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the mega popular social media app, or risk of being banned in U.S. app stores. Most Democrats and Republicans back the measure, though some members of Congress have raised concerns about free speech protections in this country, and the singling out of a single social media giant over others. Take a listen to the debate, the supporters and the opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Our intention is for TikTok to continue to operate, but not under the control of the Chinese communist party. REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (D-WI): This is a common sense measure to protect our national security. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): This is not an attempt to ban TikTok. It's attempt to make TikTok, tic tac toe, a winner, a winner. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Who will be the next to control the data of over 170 million Americans? Are we going to trust Mark Zuckerberg to control their data? I certainly don't. REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): If you're going to address this issue, we've got to take the same approach to also some media platforms. We can't just single out one. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There were 50 Democrats, mostly progressives, some younger members, too, voting no, as well as. Fifteen Republicans voting against this as well.This really came together because of the concerns over national security, top national security officials have been on the Hill briefing members, warning them about the Chinese communist party in the potential of exploiting the private data of so many Americans. And that really took over the concerns that were levied about how this could stifle free speech. But at the same time are the concerns about the political ramifications of all of this. There are some Democratic members who are worried that if Joe Biden were to sign this into law, that he could face backlash from young voters at a critical time in this election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL): I don't think it'll be helpful with young voters, but, you know, my argument here, yes, it has to do with young people, but taking a step back, I just think its bad policy. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): Just for politics is addition, multiplication and cutting out a large group of young voters is not the best known strategy for reelection (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Senate takes its own time with legislation. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has not expressed any support for this bill, simply said that the Senate would review this matter yesterday. He indicated this would go through the committee process which can take a long time.There are a lot of members who have their own ideas. Some of the supporters of this effort to ban TikTok actually don't believe this legislation is constitutional. Some of them raised concerns about naming a specific company, ByteDance, call -- force ByteDance to sell TikTok, if not the TikTok will be banned in the United States, they say that by naming TikTok that could run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. So there'll be changes made in the Senate and will Chuck Schumer gives us a priority in an election year with the possible blowback that they can endure from voters. That's why there are so many questions still that despite this overwhelming vote can actually become law. That is uncertain at this moment -- Jim.",

So I would just simply suggest that all things China right now are really being closely scrutinized, and there's a lot of hostility.So I'm not surprised it was a strong bipartisan vote. You know, whether or not this is great policy or whether it becomes law, is another matter.

If we want to make sure that foreign countries do not interfere in our elections. And the communications that we're seeing, there's a way to do that without just specifically targeting one company. I think there's been lots of conversations in Congress about what'shappening on Facebook. I'm not saying Facebook has China interference, but we have seen people being targeted by Russia during the 2016 on their platform. So this is manifesting in many different ways. And I think there's a different way to solve this problem. I do think that because -- you need to go where voters are and the reality is that young voters, voters of color, even millennials and folks who are using TikTok as a form of commerce to sell products. That's where they are. And so to ban it, it could have political ramifications both on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. So I think there's another way to solve this problem. I have often said, we don't want China in our politics and in determining what people were reading. But we also so want to make sure that people can communicate and interact with one another",

And that's how he came to this decision.We should also note to that some people who are very close to Donald Trump are doing work for TikTok and they may have gotten to him. So the way Donald Trumps sets policy, it's not very deliberative. I mean, he's not looking at necessarily for what the public interest is or what's in the best interest of national -- in the United States. But he's looking at it from the standpoint of how it affects him, how it affects True Social, how it affects his vendetta with Mark Zuckerberg. That's on the one hand, its very disturbing and alarming but not surprising. And I think Congress though by the way, has made a fair point here about TikTok. I mean, the issue here is what date is being shared between TikTok or ByteDance and the Chinese communist party. That is really the issue here.

The caveat here though, is that he's left the door open for an appeal, saying that if the district attorneys office able to fill out these details are fill in these details. They can re-indict.

There he is walking down the steps. CNN's Jeff Zeleny, he's in Milwaukee where the president is headed. He joins me now. Jeff, I mean, clearly this is part of a post-State of the Union Address tour. They felt they did well, there. Can you tell us what are you hearing from voters in the back this key battleground state? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Jim, as the president arrives in Milwaukee, as you said, just leaving Air Force One, he's really stepping on the ground of the critical place he needs to win back the White House. Of course, Wisconsin is at the center of this campaign, really unlike any other previous year, and here's why Donald Trump, of course, will be re-nominated here this summer. The Republican National Convention is going to be here in Milwaukee. In 2016, Donald Trump carried Wisconsin by some 23,000 votes or so. Four years later, Joe Biden won it by about fewer than 21,000 votes. So very, very narrow margins here. So President Biden coming back to Milwaukee to really begin his march to the general election campaign. And there's no doubt that he has a bit of a bounce in his step. White House advisers and campaign advisers believe that that State of the Union Address indeed energized voters. And we've been here for the last several days talking to many of his voters and supporters, and indeed it has among Democrats. And that is the first of business trying to get Democrats and Democratic leaning independent voters back on this side of the Biden campaign really trying to ease some of those questions about if he's going to run and try and draw some excitement about the fact that he is running. He'll be announcing an infrastructure program here in Milwaukee, part of that bipartisan restructure law. At a granular level, he'll be saying that some of that money will be used to revitalize a critical street, Sixth Street, leading into downtown Milwaukee. But, Jim, there is no doubt the road to the White House leads through Wisconsin. It's a key part of that blue wall including Michigan and Pennsylvania as well. He's already hit Michigan. He's already hit Pennsylvania. He'll hit Michigan tomorrow. So you cannot win the White House without these three Great Lakes states, Jim.",

They feel that the abortion issue moves them and we've seen proof of that in the states, they feel that their mobilization to win back control of the state supreme court, that they've got the infrastructure and they've got the energy.

That was an off, off-cycle election, and they had record turnout and were able to secure judge, that actually is pro choice.So between the issue on abortion, Joe Biden talking about what he is doing right now for the economy in Wisconsin, that's really what folks are going to have to do, is go out and explain to people for years ago, we were literally going on lockdown because of COVID and because of Joe Biden, we are now back out, our economy he is still recovering and be able to convey that message.

Many of them think it's simply a communication problem. I happen to think it's a policy problem. They're going to have to moderate.But it's clear that both parties, both the Democrats and Republicans, in this case, Biden and Trump have very serious based problems. Biden's is, of course, with young people, he's experiencing serious erosion among Hispanics, some erosion among African Americans, he's got real issues. And Republicans on the other hand, have a very real problem, not just in Wisconsin but elsewhere where there's a significant number of Republicans who are not going to vote for Donald Trump under any circumstances. And many of them are Nikki Haley voters. And so, Donald Trump, he's got a base problem, too. If he gets convicted, that base problem becomes even more pronounced. I -- by my estimates, he needs at least 90 percent of the Republican vote to win the presidential election. I just don't know how he gets there now. I mean, I think he's going to have a real problem.
