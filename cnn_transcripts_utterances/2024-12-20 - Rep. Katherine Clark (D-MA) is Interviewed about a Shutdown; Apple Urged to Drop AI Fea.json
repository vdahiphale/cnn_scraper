KATHERINE CLARK (D-MA) MINORITY WHIP: Well, good morning, Sara, and I apologize for my voice. There's been a lot of heated conversations going on, but we have no idea. The Republicans have failed to put a budget together over two years. We have -- they have taken us to the verge of a shutdown for the sixth time. And every time Democrats have come together to be the voice for the American people to prevent that. We had a negotiated deal. It was signed off and posted by the Republicans. And then Elon Musk sent out 150 tweets, told them they shouldn't do it. Donald Trump weighed in afterwards and joined the chorus, and they pulled back on the deal they had negotiated. They are now not talking with us. They are continuing the chaos and infighting, and we will see what they do this morning. But we stand here ready to fight for the working people of this country who expect Congress to fulfill this fundamental responsibility of making government work for them.",

That's how it's supposed to work.And when you fail, as Mike Johnson and the GOP and the House have, to put a budget together, when you come to Democrats and negotiate to get you out of that position that you've put yourselves and the country in, you should honor the agreement that you made. There is nothing business as usual or status quo about having an unelected, richest man in the world blowing up negotiations. Why? So that he can earn even more money and take it out of the pockets of families that are counting on Social Security, food assistance, cancer research that impacts their children's lives.

They have not.And so their only choice here on the verge of another shutdown is to come together and work with us. We did it with them. We made compromises. The bill we agreed to was not everything we wanted, but it was a good start. It was -- it is a positive bill that keeps government functioning until March and makes some key investments the American people need. What do we have now? They have blown that up because of an unelected billionaire decides that that bill doesn't work for him. That's what this is about.
