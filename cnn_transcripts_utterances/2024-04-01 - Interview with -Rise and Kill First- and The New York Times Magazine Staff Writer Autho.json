The fact that Hassan Nasrallah and Iran decided to create a low-intensity conflict with Israel, from the point of view of Israel unprovoked, from their point of view, showing solidarity with the Hamas and with the Palestinian in Gaza. And the fact that it started, it gave Israel an opportunity to target a lot of people and facilities that Israel didn't -- or decided not to do before because of fearing escalation. Now, as ironic as it sounds, both sides, so Iran and Hezbollah on one hand, and Israel on the other, are doing to each other things that if even a fraction of them happened a year ago, so before October 7 would happen, then we would be in a regional war long ago. Now, because both sides are not interested in all-out war, then they continue to do those things that, you know, I'm not very good with assessing the future, but the current assumption is that even this event, which is very significant, will not lead to an escalation to all-out war.",

Let me ask you to another -- about another story that we've been covering, and that is Israel ending its two-week-long siege at Al-Shifa Hospital. Israel says that this had been a precise anti-terror mission and that it killed 200 militants and it had gone to great lengths to avoid any civilian deaths or injuries. But the images are pretty shocking to see after the IDF had left the hospital that the CNN had been provided with and what we have seen from eyewitnesses. Talk to us about what more you're learning in your reporting about what actually took place and the fact that Israel had to return to the north to Al-Shifa. I know Israel is saying that they've received a lot of high-level intelligence that they're parsing through right now, but even the fact that they had to return after they had left the north, that is significant in and of itself, no?",

Obviously, they have different agendas, and it seems that their goal is not necessarily to end the war, bring -- A, to bring the hostages home, and to see a change in leadership. And Bibi Netanyahu finds himself in a position like he's never been before, pulled from both sides, from the right and from the left.

So, Hamas is not loved by all Gazans. Many people wanted to get rid of Hamas, but not by killing them, of course. So, I think what Palestinians need to have is to not have anyone control them, because we need our own country. We need to decide who would rule over us, just like anyone in the world. About a million people in Gaza, half of Gaza's population, are under the age of 19, which means that they were born in 2004, and the elections were in 2006. So, half the population in Gaza did not vote for Hamas, including me, who is now 31 years old. I'm 31 years old. I've never voted in my life.",

      "sentences": "Jonathan Haidt, thanks so much for joining us. Your latest book is called \"The Anxious GenerationHow the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\" And you and I have talked before, and, you know, you have been very careful about not seeming alarmist. And this book, what's fascinating to me about it, is that you supplement so much of your ideas with empirical data and research that is proving this point. What is the epidemic of mental illness, and where do we find the data for that? JONATHAN HAIDT, AUTHOR, \"THE ANXIOUS GENERATION\":  When you and I first spoke about this, it might have been back in 2019, I was not as alarmist because we weren't sure. It was clear that something that was going wrong with teen mental health. We had graphs showing that around 2013, rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm began rising rapidly. But there was an academic debate, and there still is, there's an academic debate about whether it's caused by social media. It's correlated with it. Girls who use it heavily are three times as likely to be depressed. But, you know, scientists are going to debate, is it causal or is it just a correlation? Since then, I have learned a lot. I've gathered all the studies I can find, including experiments. There are now a lot of experiments that show that when you randomly assign people to different conditions, it causes them to get more depressed or less depressed. So, we have experimental research. But the really shocking thing to me, the thing that really made me into, I'd like to say an alarm ringer not an alarmist, is the discovery that the exact same thing happened to us in America as happened in Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia at the same time in the same way, hitting girls hardest and young girls even harder. So, once it became clear, this is an international epidemic of teen mental illness. It began in the early 2010s. It's hitting girls hardest, although the boys' story is really interesting and is also very bad. It's just a little different. So, that's why I've been in this book, if you want to say I'm sort of leaving my old self behind and saying we need to act like now, like not in 2025, like we need to really make changes this year because otherwise, another year of kids is going to be consigned to this phone-based childhood, which interferes with the development.",

      "sentences": "So, first we have to establish the numbers here, which are stunning. The latest data from Gallup is around nine hours a day is whatthey spend on their phones and screens. Five hours a day of that is social media. Another three to five is all the other stuff that they do. So, imagine if your child, if you take nine or 10 hours out of their day, every single day, where's it going to come from? They spend less time sleeping, less time with other kids, less time outside, less time exercising, a lot more time just being sedentary and solitary. So, for all those reasons -- oh, nobody -- very little reading of books, no hobbies, there's no time, there's no time for anything. So, that's the first thing, it pushes out all the good things of childhood that we want our kids to have. When you give a kid a smartphone, it's likely to move to the center of her life, and that's what she's going to do for the rest of her life. And so, that's one of the main ways of harm, it just deprives you of everything else. Another thing it does is it fragments your attention. You and I are probably -- you know, we can pay attention to things, we can do our work, but it's harder now than it was 10 years ago. There's constant interruptions, but we're still able to do it, but it's a struggle. A teenager just starting puberty, age 10, 11, 12, the prefrontal cortex has not yet rewired for the adult configuration. They're not very good at paying attention. And early puberty is when that skill really develops. And so, to have them trying to develop that skill while being interrupted every few minutes, the average teen now gets, one study found, 257 notifications a day, 257 interruptions every day. It's very hard to focus on anything. So, you get fragmented attention, and we don't know how permanent this is. Another harm is addiction. The brain adapts to that constant level of stimulation that when you're not getting it, you're in a deficit mode. You're irritable. You're unhappy. You feel terrible. So, these devices are designed to grab hold of our kids' attention and never let go, and they're very effective at that. I could go on. There are so many other avenues of harm, but those are some of the big ones that I cover in the book.",

I have tohave Instagram because everyone else has it, and I'll be left out. So, that's what's called a collective action problem. It's hard for us as parents because everyone else is doing this. And so, what I'm proposing is that we coordinate, we set some norms, and norms that would be hard to do on our own, but much easier to do if we do them together. So, just to go back to the parent struggling to put limits on, to maybe give a warning, what you were describing is actually quintessential withdrawal symptoms from any drug. When brain circuits are used to getting this stimulation from, whether it's cocaine, heroin, slot machines, or social media, if that happens every day, when you take the kid off, they feel horrible for a couple of weeks. It takes two or three weeks, three or four weeks, actually, to detox for the brain to reset. So, it's vital that we give our kids -- that we delay the entry into this craziness, and that we give our kids time away.",

So, give them a flip phone. The millennials had flip phones, and they turned out fine. My second point, though, is school security experts say there are procedures in place to deal with a school shooting, and they involve listening and cooperating and working together with the teacher and the administration. So, where would you rather send your kid? I would ask any parents who have this concern, and we all have the concern. Would you rather send your kid to a school in which when there's a potential problem? Everyone, they're silent, they follow directions, they do what they're supposed to do, they follow the procedure. Would you rather have one where at the first sign of a serious problem, everyone pulls out their phone, they're crying to their parents, they're making a lot of noise, they're not listening? So again, I understand the human urge to talk to your kid if there's a crisis, but the teacher has a phone, all the administrators have phones.

I do believe that if they could make it healthier and not lose any users, they would do it. But Meta in particular has shown it's always prioritized growth over everything else. There have been many internal whistleblowers pointing out problems. They generally don't respond. They don't do the things that would be effective because that would, for example, kicking off underage users. They know how old everybody is. But, you know, when most 11 and 12-year-olds have an Instagram account, they should be kicked off, but Meta won't do that. Snapchat won't do that because they lose most of their users. So, they know what the problems are. There have been many internal reports, and they don't act. And they don't have to because Congress gave them immunity from lawsuits. This is one of the most insane things about our country. We have this thing, this environment that is incredibly toxic for our kids' development, and we can't sue them.",

Even that National Academy's report that claims that there's not enough evidence to prove causation. In that very report, people should read chapter four. It's an amazing catalog of the research that shows causality. So, it's a bizarre report in which the report itself documents dozens and dozens of avenues of harm and dozens and dozens of experiments. But yet, for some reason, the way it was written, they said, well, we can't prove that it's causal. I've collected -- if you go to my Substack, afterbabel.com, I've gone through all of the studies. We itemized them. We show how the correlational studies come out, how the longitudinal studies come out, how the experimental studies come out. There is a ton of evidence. The preponderance of the evidence shows it's not just a correlate, it's a cause. Zuckerberg was pointing to the few studies he could, but in the long run, I believe they're going to lose that case because the evidence keeps mounting. And by now, everybody sees it. The teachers, the parents, all those parents we saw at that Senate hearing, like, were they wrong that their kid -- you know, that their kid is dead because of something that happened on social media? Were they all wrong about that? So, at this point in time, it just defies belief that social media isn't contributing to this mental health crisis.",

Right now, current law says 13. At 13, companies can do whatever the hell they want to your kids. They can take their data. They can do anything. They don't need your permission. They can treat them like adults. That's current law. And there's zero enforcement. As long as they don't know your kid is 10, they can do whatever they want to your kid. So, the current law is horrible. It's not enforced. The age is too low. It's 13. We need to raise that to 16 and enforce it. And that's what the Florida bill is going to do. They have a little carve out so that if parents really want their kid to be on it, 14 and 15, they can specifically sign a permission. That'll be interesting to see how the tech companies implement that. But I'm a big fan of the Florida bill.
