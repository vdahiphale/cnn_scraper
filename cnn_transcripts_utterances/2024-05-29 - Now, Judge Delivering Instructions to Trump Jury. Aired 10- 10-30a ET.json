The defendant, Donald Trump, has just arrived here. He did not speak to cameras, notably, as he typically does.After six long weeks on trial, though, as Trump is walking into that room with his legal team in tow, he is now on the cusp of learning his fate, whatever it is that the jury decides.

      "sentences": "And I'm Jake Tapper in Washington. You are watching special CNN Live coverage of Donald Trump's hush money cover- up trial. Court is reconvening right now. And soon, seven men and five women will begin jury deliberations with huge stakes, not only for Mr. Trump, but also for the 2024 presidential election, and for the entire United States of America.But, first, Judge Juan Merchan will present the jurors with carefully crafted instructions that will frame their discussions in the jury room, and potentially help shape the verdict. The judge will walk jurors through the charges against Mr. Trump, 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, and the legal issues that they must consider in deciding whether they find the former president of the United States guilty. It's in the jurors' hands as they meet behind closed doors and review key questions from the trial, including was Michael Cohen's testimony credible? Was the alleged cover-up of the payment to Stormy Daniels an unlawful effort to help the 2016 Trump presidential campaign? Has the prosecution proven that this misdemeanor was carried out in the service of a completely different crime? And have they done so beyond a reasonable doubt? There is so much to consider in these truly historic deliberations. CNN has a team of reporters and producers inside the courthouse are going to bring you constant updates to capture all the drama of the day. Kaitlan, we are in the final critical moments of this trial. COLLINS:  Yes, Jake, we are. And one thing to note about the final moments of this trial that's interesting is once the judge gives the jury these instructions, which he is set to do, he said it will take about an hour, as he explains to them what they are supposed to be considering, what the law is that they're supposed to be considering, which the two parties did not do in their closing arguments yesterday, that is reserved specifically for the judge here, is that as the jury goes into that jury room, Trump and his legal team actually must remain inside the courthouse as the jury is here Deliberating what their verdict is going to be. They have to stay here in case they do reach that verdict in short order. Of course, we don't know how long it'll take the jury. I do have CNN's Paula Reid and John Berman here with me. And, Paula, obviously, I should note, Trump has more family members in tow with him today. Donald Trump Jr. is seated next to Alina Habba in that first row behind his father. He actually just recently, you know, made an appearance here at this case. But it is notable that Trump has to stay inside the courthouse as the jury is going to be in that jury room. Deliberate.

He said something that I thought was interesting, and I want to get you your assessment on it and, and fact check it if you will or at least explain.So, he says, it's very critical of Judge Merchan and the case. And one of the things he writes in the National Review, it's quite amazing how explicitly the state of New York is relying on violations of FECA, that's federal election campaign laws, as the other crime that Donald Trump was allegedly concealing by causing his business records to be falsified. Just to take a second there to explain this. This is a misdemeanor case, the business falsifications, but since the theory of the case is it was done in service to another crime, the federal election campaign laws. That's what makes it a felony. The judge just said, as a juror, you were asked to make a very important decision about another member of the community. In any case, Andy McCarthy writes that the state is relying on Merchan. I know you would not want to make that decision based on such stereotypes or attitudes. So, anyway, he's saying the state is explicitly relying on this second crime federal election campaign laws as the other crime that bumps it up to a felony. The judge telling the jurors, you must set aside any personal opinions you have in favor or against the defendant. It is impossible to draw any conclusion that, Andy McCarthy writes, other than the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg knew that, and as a state prosecutor, his enforcement of federal law would be incredibly controversial since he has no such authority. The federal agencies that do not, that do have such authority investigated Trump and opted. Not to prosecute. The FEC looked at this and decided not to. And to get the prosecution done, Bragg is simply making up his own version of federal law. So, Trump is right now sitting back as Merchan is reading the instructions. So, he's basically saying that this other crime that the business falsification was done in service of was kind of like hidden until the very end into this closing argument. And that it's kind of like not fair the way that Alvin Bragg did this and the way that Judge Merchan allowed it. What do you think? HONIG:  So, I agree in part. It is very unusual. It's unprecedented to have a state prosecution where the predicate, the underlying crime, is a federal election law violation. I don't agree with the imputation of bad motives on Alvin Bragg's behalf. I think Alvin Bragg took a look at this, did his research. I think he understands it's not an automatic there will be an appeals issue. However, I think he decided that it was worth a shot.

Remember when he's saying reasonable doubt, they called Michael Cohen, the defense did, the human embodiment of reasonable doubt.And on that, we also have former U.S. District Judge John E. Jones here with us. And, Judge, it's great to have you because right now, Judge Merchan is defining reasonable doubt saying it is not sufficient to prove that the defendant is probably guilty. How does a juror know when it's reasonable doubt? I mean, it seems obvious, but when you're actually the one in that room deliberating, how important is it for you as a judge to make sure that that's in crystal clear to this jury? JOHN E. JONES III, FORMER U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE:  I think it's pretty abstract the way the jury receives it. It is not stated necessarily in a layman's terms. You know, it's that it is a real doubt not a fanciful doubt, something that would make you pause or hesitate in a matter of importance to you. Jurors, I think, receive that differently. You know, so it's an imprecise science. But I have always found that jurors could assimilate that instruction and, and that intuitively they understood what that meant, that they needed to be more sure of the guilt on any elements than not, you know? So, it's really -- it's a clinical description, but in practice, I think jurors do pretty well with it.",

You know, he has developed a rapport with this jury in the sense of how he is considerate of their time and what they're hearing and making sure that these proceedings are incredibly fair and that they're not influenced in any way. He says, quote, if you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the charged crime, you must find the defendant not guilty.But, Judge, it is that fine line of reasonable doubt but not all possible doubt that that this jury is kind of finding themselves when they look at these checks and these invoices and the testimony that they've heard of where they believe this falls,",
