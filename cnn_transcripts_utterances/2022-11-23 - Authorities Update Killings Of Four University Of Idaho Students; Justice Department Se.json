We ask anyone with any information related to what happened with these four in our community, their interaction with others, and whether they express concern or commented about someone or something strange to get that information to us. Even if you don't believe it is relevant, investigators will review and determine if and how your information builds the picture. Sometimes, you know, video or pictures doesn't show is equally as important as what might be there. Information on how to submit tips and updates on the investigation can be found on the Moscow police department page, to continue moving forward to understand why this occurred in our community and seek answers to bring justice for the victims and their loved ones because they deserve it. I personally want to know, we care and we're looking team to work hard to get these answers for these individuals.

What's really noteworthy here is how we didn't learn really much at all. They still have no idea why this happened, they don't have an idea of who, they do not have a weapon. They are still on the lookout for a fixed blade knife.They have put in so much work between the Idaho state police, the Moscow police, and the FBI and other jurisdictions as well. So far, they just appear to not be able to find any information about who did this, although they are issuing this plea for people to share any information. They said it can be helpful even if people think the information may not be helpful, it is something that may actually lead to a break in the case. We are going to continue, of course, to follow that story in the coming days. I do want to turn now to our other top story which is a big development in the Justice Department's investigation into Donald Trump. Prosecutors hope to question former Vice President Mike Pence in the criminal investigation of Trump's attempts to stay in power following the 2020 election. \"The New York Times\" Maggie Haberman was first to report this, along with her colleague Michael Schmidt, and she is with us now. Maggie, what can you tell us about what the DOJ wants from Pence?",

But he is the only person who can answer certain questions about what Trump was saying. About Trump's mindset, about the final phone call that they had the morning of January 6 for which Pence was not surrounded by aides, although Trump had people in the oval office. And he can talk about exactly what Trump was saying to him, what he was saying to Trump.Now they have interviewed two witnesses who are close to Pence, Mike Short, his former chief of staff, and his general counsel, Greg Jacob. But again, Pence is really the key and a lot of this, and this is preliminary. This conversation just began but if that happens, if Pence were to be interviewed, it would be another extraordinary turn in this investigation.",

I'm not sure whether that invitation ever happened but he made it clear in the last we could have that he has no intention of doing so variety of reasons. He is said to see this differently. A criminal investigation led by the Justice Department, and then a select committee led by house officials. So that is said to be governing how he is looking at this. But there are so many unanswered questions still. You know, will there be a subpoena, would Trump try to prevent him testifying. Trump is tied with limited success to assert executive privilege to keep people from testifying. So this is still very beginning but it is a significant development.",

LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:  Well, it is really difficult to see right now a constituency for Vice President Mike Pence, former Vice President Mike Pence. But I thought that the article was interesting because it is difficult to tell where exactly this was coming from. It is hard to imagine that this is necessarily being linked by the DOJ. If it is coming from Pence's world, I noted that a number of people who were familiar with the former vice president's thinking, said that he may be open to talking to the DOJ. And so, ultimately, I think that -- you are shaking your head -- at Pence for talking to the DOJ. But, ultimately, I really think that this could be headed towards a subpoena because it is hard to imagine that Pence is going to just willingly talk to the DOJ without that being handed to him first.

But I think at this point, if you don't like Mike Pence because of January 6th, whether or not he talked to the DOJ isn't really going into your decision-making.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The latest target in Russia's ruthless missile barrage. A Ukrainian maternity ward pounded from the skies. Emergency workers pulling a doctor and a young mother from the rubble. But a newborn baby just two days old couldn't be saved. Tatiana (ph) is the grandmother, now an unbearable pain. Her daughter's face and legs were wounded by shrapnel, she says, but it's the loss of the child that's left her daughter emotionally shattered. Another life, another family now in ruins. Across Ukraine, the roar of Russian missiles is tearing up the skies. Near the capital, Kyiv, a residential building was hit. The yard outside, turned into a smoldering disaster zone. Officials say casualties are high, with dozens injured or killed, as Russia tries to target energy and water infrastructure across Ukraine, on apparently deliberately attempt to make the people here suffer.

Places where people can go and get some hot food, or they can charge their phones, get on the internet, just keep warm as the temperatures across Ukraine really start to plunge below freezing.
