Whereas, 24 percent say that that is a positive thing, and 11 percent say that's a negative. Now Harris, for her part, has been trying to make inroads with key groups of male voters.

The former president spoke for about an hour and 20 minutes, and there was much of his normal Pennsylvania type speech. He spoke about fracking. He bashed Vice President Harris and the Biden administration on their handling of immigration. He also, actually, at one point made fun of Vice President Kamala Harris and her rally with Beyonce on Friday night. Saying that Harris can't draw a crowd on her own and making fun of Beyonce, the superstar, because she did not sing. But when I mean that the campaign has been reaching out specifically to young men, part of the theme of this particular event in State College was all about focusing on the Penn State wrestling team. The former president admiring the members of the wrestling team's muscles. At one point, bringing them up on stage. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was freewheeling. But again, it speaks to the campaign's efforts to try and reach out to these younger male voters, who perhaps some wouldn't be encouraged to vote otherwise. Now, on Sunday former President Trump is not going to be in any of these battleground states. Instead, he's going to be in New York City in the evening for a rally at Madison Square Garden.

We think, you know, apparently that Israel has responded in such a way, in such a limited way, that perhaps we could see a bit of a truce, at least on the Iran front going forward, at least through the U.S. election. Clearly, that's in the backdrop here. But Iran, you know, Israel is still fighting on several fronts, to the north and to the south, and they have to maintain their political charisma, if you will, with the United States and other players. If I were guessing, I would say that perhaps we're at a point where each side has responded proportionally, and we'll wait a bit to see what happens with the rest of the conflict to the north and to the south with Hamas and Hezbollah.",

And because of these elevated fire concerns, any outdoor burning is being strongly discouraged.Joining us now is meteorologist Tyler Mauldin. So, tell us more. TYLER MAULDIN, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on-camera): Good morning, Victor. Good morning, Amara. It's hard to believe that we're talking about a wildfire risk in the Northeast because it's quite a cold start to Sunday. But that is what we're talking about from New Hampshire all the way down to Delaware. A gusty wind is bringing us some dry air and that is leading to that elevated risk. Exacerbating that fire risk is the fact that some of us haven't seen any rain for 27 days. Talking to you, New York City. Also talking to you, Atlanta. Mind you, today is October 27th. So, the entire month has been dry for New York City and Atlanta. Expanding the view here, it's not just those two areas. It encompasses much of the eastern two-thirds of the country. Houston hasn't seen a drop of rain at all this month either. When you total it up, about 80 percent of the country is abnormally dry right now. Good news, though, we do have some relief on the way. There is a system that's moving into the Pacific Northwest. It's going to bring some heavy snow across the higher elevations out west. But notice what happens once it pushes east of the Rockies. We are going to see some very beneficial rainfall. Houston, I think you'll finally break your streak as we end the month of October. But we're right on the cusp here in Atlanta and New York City. Ahead of that system, we are going to see some record heat. So that chilly start to the day that we're seeing in the northeast, that's going to be a thing of the past once we get to the end of next week. Notice this, our temperatures are going to go from the 60s in New York City all the way up to 78 degrees. The average temperature right now, 61, and that temperature of 78 degrees on the last day of October, that could break a record. Amara, Victor?",
