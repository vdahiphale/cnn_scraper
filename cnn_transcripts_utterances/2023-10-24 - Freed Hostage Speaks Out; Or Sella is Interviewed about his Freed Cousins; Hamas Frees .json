Again, trying to fix their mess and come together to elect a House speaker after three weeks. We are entering day 21 to be exact without a speaker of the House. Now, there are eight Republicans left, if you will, or still vying for the job, but there really is no clear path at this moment for any of them to get to what they need. It is -- what is clear is that Republican lawmakers, at least some of them, are exhausted by the chaos and getting an earful from their constituents back home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DON BACON (R-NE): I think people are so discouraged by what's happened the last three weeks that they want to come together. REP. MARCUS MOLINARO (R-NY): We have to act like mature adults and come to a conclusion. And I think that with can. REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD): At least half of them could get there. The other half might struggle a little bit. But we're going to have to figure out how to get our act together.

She says she was kidnapped on a motorbike, riding on her side. She was all bruised up as she was taken into Gaza from that ride. She is a grandmother and one of the founders of the Nir Oz kibbutz and a long-time peace activist as well. Here is some of what she said after being a hostage by Hamas for 16 days deep in those tunnels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, HOSTAGE RELEASED BY HAMAS (through translator): I went through hell that I could not have known. I was kidnapped on a motorbike on my side while they were driver towards Gaza. As we got there, the people told us that they are people who believe in the Koran and that they will not harm us and that we will get the same conditions they get in the tunnels. We began walking inside the tunnels with the wet ground. There were guards and a paramedic and a doctor who took care of the fact that we would have the same medicine that we need. There, we lied on mattresses. They took care of the sanitary side so we won't get sick. And we had a doctor who came to see us every two to three days. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And one of the things about running an air campaign is, you run out of targets. I mean how do you get -- for each target you have to know why you're striking it, how you're going to approach it, what the right weapon is, the pilot has to be briefed. It's a real process. So, if you're striking 300 targets a day and you're generating those targets, you must have a lot of intelligence built up on it. So, I think as this -- if this -- there is a pause and if the Israelis continue these air strikes, I hope they will share with the international community some of the thinking about the targets and why they're hitting these targets because, remember, they're not only in a kinetic war, they're in an information war.

This three-week circus that began with McCarthy getting booted enters this new phase. It might even be the most chaotic phase. This time they are choosing from eight declared candidates. Why eight? Well, because Congressman Dan Meuser, he dropped out last night. So, then there were eight.They will keep voting behind closed doors on these eight candidates until one of these people gets a majority of the conference. So, it's on. Let's get right to CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill. Where are they now, Lauren? LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they are just heading in, beginning this meeting behind closed doors. And like you noted, John, it could take a significant amount of time to get through the secret balloting process today. That is because every round of voting takes roughly about an hour to complete. They have to hand count the votes. And after each round, the lowest vote getting candidate will be dropped from the race. But because there are eight candidates, that could take a significant amount of time. Now, the big question is whoever gets the majority of support in that conference meeting today, that does not necessarily guarantee that they are going to be able to get the votes they need on the House floor. That is the issue that has bedeviled Steve Scalise. It's the issue that bedeviled Jim Jordan last week. And you can expect that it is going to be a tough climb for any one of these candidates to actually get the votes they need to become the next speaker. Now, I did talk to Representative Tom Cole. He's sort of someone who has a lot of respect within the conference. He's also someone who has a good pulse on where Republicans are in this moment. And he told me that he thinks a lot of the bloodletting, a lot of the emotion has really started to dissipate within this Republican conference after three weeks of a search for a new House speaker. He said that he believes that by the end of the week they are going to be able to unite. But again, it's just a really huge, looming question right now because if Tom Emmer, the Republican whip who is seen as the frontrunner in this race right now, if he gets the nomination, I think there are still some questions about whether or not hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus are going to back him.
