And this was a very receptive crowd. He said that if he were elected President again, the first day in office, you would appoint a special prosecutor to continue the work Congress was doing, looking into investigating the Biden family. He also claimed that's less because he was doing well was seeking rabid Democratic left-wing lawyers on him and also claimed that these charges were only brought because he was leading in the polls.Now one thing to keep in mind is that this is the playbook for these indictments, for these charges, these arraignments. We have seen time and time again and it's not going to stop. They are claiming, Trump and his team, that this is election interference. And this is something they believe that they can sell to voters. Now particularly they believe this, as we ramp up campaign season. They point to the fact that he is the front-runner. But on top of that, that there is a time in which these trials will interfere with the campaign. Now, I have spoken to a number of Republican voters and there are quite a few who agree with the fact that this could actually impact the election of believing this narrative that Trump is spinning. So clearly something that is working there for them among the voters that I'm talking to in the Republican Party. But they are going to continue saying that this is fully political, ignoring the legalities, and at least trying to play this out in the court of public opinion. Amara and Victor.",

In 1974, Richard Nixon actually spoke with a member of the White House who had actually already gone to prison for crimes associated with the Watergate scandals and asked him what was it like to be in prison because Richard Nixon fully expected to be in prison. So this is a -- this is not the first time that a president has contemplated the possibility of prison. But it's the first time that it's a possible reality now.Richard Nixon, as we remember, was pardoned so he never faced an indictment. That's a -- it's a big moment for the United States because this is not a small case. This is a case about whether the President of the United States is responsible when he undertakes any illegal campaign to stay in office. The President will argue that he got advice and he followed the advice. But when that advice is illegal, as was the advice from these six un-indicted co-conspirators listed in the indictment, the President ultimately is responsible for the actions he takes. As Truman said the buck stops here. So Donald Trump may say that he believed one thing. But what he was doing was illegal. And he had many members of his inner circle telling him it was illegal, the false -- the false elector scheme, the -- the statements -- the public statements that were based on an actual fraud themselves. All of these are acts, which the President must be held accountable for. And that's what this indictment does.",

We are not immune to the seductiveness of demo -- demagogues who appeal to certain emotions, certain prejudices in our society. This is not new. So it is not a surprise that millions of Americans have still an emotional attachment to Donald Trump who's made them feel that they share victimhood with him. But the key here, Victor, is that our institutions of justice are moving forward.Donald Trump may argue that this is political. But if you read this indictment and read the documents indictment, you will see that they would have gone forward, the grand juries would have gone forward with these indictments regardless of the fact that Donald Trump tried again for the White House. You know, Donald Trump is the one who made this political by running for office again. I'm not saying he didn't have a right to of course, he had a right to run for office again.

But I would say that the person who is the reason why we're seeing a shift among Republicans is Vice President -- former Vice President Pence. I think Vice President Pence has that -- has not only the moral right but the historical right to set the record straight. And he's been very clear since this latest indictment about President Trump's responsibility for the chaos that we saw in January of 2021.So it's going to be very interesting to see the recalibration by the other Republican putative nominees as they absorb the effect of this indictment. This indictment is damning. It is also a reminder to the American people that they were the victims of a fraud but it was not an electoral fraud in five different states. It was a national fraud perpetrated from the White House, at least that's the allegation. The indictment is very clear though in making that argument, we'll see what a jury of President Trump's peers decided at the end.",

This report looks just about right. Employers added 187,000 jobs in July. It's a bit below expectations. It's also the second slowest pace of job growth since late 2020. But make no mistake, this is a very healthy number, especially given the historic job gains during this recovery. And the economy has now added 1.8 million jobs so far this year.The unemployment rate continues to also defy those recession forecasts. You know many economists even ones at the Federal Reserve predicted that the unemployment rate would gradually rise this year and yet it remains historically low dipping to 3.5 percent in July. That is just a touch above the half-century low of 3.4 percent. Moody's Analysts, Chief Economist Mark Zandi described the jobs report as down the middle of the fairway couldn't have been much better. Now there's one catch here, there always is, wages. Wages remain a bit hot. Of course, that's great news for workers and more evidence that workers have considerable leverage over bosses. In fact, paychecks are now growing faster than prices and that is huge. But strong wage growth is not really what Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the Fed wants to see. They want wages to cool even further to help drive inflation down. S till, big picture. There's a lot to like about this jobs report.

You know, there -- there are a lot of reasons for that. But I think what happened is, we got COVID, we got a lot of fiscal stimulus being poured into the economy. We got those checks to consumers, you know, those still haven't been spent down fully, largely, but not completely. So you have an administration that in some ways, was bailing out people this time around rather than bailing out banks, like we did in 2008 the last time we had a big crisis. And I think that that has really stuck. You know, there are other factors here. We're seeing the reindustrialization of America, which is creating jobs. You know, you've seen really a lot of tightening at the lower end of the wage scale because of such tight job markets and leisure, you know, restaurants, things like that.

That's true.Ratings agencies, you know, it's not a science, let's face it, and they make plenty of mistakes as again, as we know, from the great financial crisis. But I am concerned about the U.S. debt and deficit picture, no question. I mean, right now, the U.S. is in a Goldilocks moment, particularly relative to the rest of the world. China's having a huge financial challenge right now, a lot of debt there, Europe has kind of met in terms of its recovery. So the U.S. is still the prettiest house on the block. Now at some point that changes and when that changes, the debt and deficit picture becomes more important at a national level, at an international level in the markets.

And in fact, just in the last few hours, Ukrainian authorities have issued coastal warnings for several Russian ports to shipping company saying that these are conflict risk areas, so we can anticipate from these signals from the Ukrainian authorities that we will continue to see further attacks. And in fact, we've heard from the head of Ukraine's -- the secretary of Ukraine's national security and defense council in the last few hours, he's commented on these attacks, he says that the drone attacks are growing more accurate, and their operators with each combat mission are becoming more experienced.
