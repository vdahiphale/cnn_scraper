He's going to want to be able to talk about everything he's done comprehensively to try to tackle this problem. Yes.But secondly, remember, this comes after Republicans walked away from the comprehensive border bill, probably the most stringent and significant piece of proposed legislation on this issue in decades. And Republicans walked away. So by, you know, taking executive action here, now Biden can now say, listen, I -- you know, I wanted to do a bipartisan deal. Republicans didn't want to come to the table and participate in the solution. And so my hand has been forced. And so I'm going to do everything that I can alone to take this on. So I think it's important, you know, contextually to think about the fact that this comes after that bipartisan conversation fell apart. It's -- frankly, I think it strengthens Biden -- Biden's hand in this conversation, because he can say, we tried to get this done. They were all, well -- all talk and no walk.

So Biden is now facing difficulty and criticism from those in tough districts and those on the progressive left who have said that this is not the humane and American way to go about immigration.

First of all, you know, remember, he doesn't have to win voters who say that the border is their top priority. He has to mitigate some of the damage. Right? I mean, he doesn't -- he -- the majority of voters who say that the border is their top issue are Republican voters who are going to vote for Trump. There's absolutely a cohort of swing voters who are concerned about it. But you know, he's not -- he doesn't have to actually win those voters. He has to limit his damages here. Secondly, I would say don't forget, Donald Trump is not absent from this narrative. The way Donald Trump talks about immigration is also incredibly alienating to some of these moderate and swing voters: talking about immigrants poisoning the blood of the country, calling them vermin. So as this conversation unfolds over the next five months, Donald Trump and the -- and the kind of grotesque way that he talks about immigration is going to be a factor here, too.",

And we can see on this, we can see on Israel. We can see a whole bunchof things, he -- as the party moves in various ways, the center of gravity moves, and so does Biden. And I think that this sort of reinforces trying -- this image of him just sort of trying to chase this political compromise that will please everybody in his coalition. And it ends up reinforcing the image that he's -- he's kind of indecisive and vacillating. And I'm not sure it's going to have the political valence that he thinks it's going to have.",

So I don't think that they need to be shy. I don't think they need to be afraid to say he's a convicted felon, to say that a jury of his peers found him guilty of crimes. That is a relevant piece of information if you're deciding who you want to be president of the United States. However, it's not the entire ballgame. It is not -- it is -- the outcome of this trial is not something that is going to impact people's lives day-to-day, and Biden has to keep driving the contrast on the things that are going to impact people's lives day-to-day, like abortion, like the economy, like, as you're seeing them do today, the border.

And the fact that Donald Trump's a felon is sort of going to be just priced in as part of the chaos of Donald Trump. The real impact of this is how it changes candidate behavior, not voter behavior. And I agree with Kate: if Biden makes this the centerpiece, that would be really bad. If Trump makes it the centerpiece, where he uses it as an excuse to do 20 minutes at rallies, where he just gets reinforced from his fans about how this is the most important thing that's ever happened. And he listens to all the people who say you're a political prisoner, which is such an unbelievably stupid -- he's not a prisoner. I mean, whatever, I mean, he's just not freaking prisoner.

That's a completely wild statement about the state of things right now. But I do think for -- for Biden and for Democrats to sort of -- to take their eye off the ball and let this argument subsume all of the other important things that they're talking about and all the ways in which Donald Trump is going to have a negative impact on your life, if you're a voter in Michigan or Wisconsin, I do think that would be a mistake.
