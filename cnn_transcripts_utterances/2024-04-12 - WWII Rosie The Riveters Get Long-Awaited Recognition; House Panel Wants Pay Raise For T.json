This morning, some U.S. servicemembers and their families could get a pay raise and other new benefits. A bipartisan House panel just put out its report with a recommendation after looking at the quality of life in the military. This came out after concerns about recruitment.That panel from the House Armed Services Committee is led by the subcommittee Chair Don Bacon of Nebraska and the Ranking Member Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania. They are both with me now. And I'm not going to lie. Anytime we can speak to a Democrat and Republican at the same time, I feel like an angel gets its wings. So we're excited about this. Representative Houlahan, let me just start with you. You call this one of the most exciting days of the 118th Congress, that might not be such a high bar, but be that as it may, why are you so excited? What's in this? REP. CHRISSY HOULAHAN (D-PA): Well, we have to celebrate this. This is, as you mentioned, an example of us at our best working together as Democrats and Republicans to help the very people who serve us and who are willing to die for us. Those men and women who are in uniform. And this is a really exciting culmination of nine months' worth of work together. A report that is expansive, you mentioned pay, but it also is spousal employment, it's also childcare, its health care, its housing access, all of those things that allow for us to honor correctly, those who serve us every day in uniform. I'm very, very excited about the opportunities to follow through on this now.",

DON BACON (R-NE): Well, first of all, we had to identify a problem, we have a lot of our listed folks around SNAP, rely on food banks, the barracks, the dormitories are getting failing grades, our spouses are the leading demographic in America for being unemployed, I can just go on and on. So we recommended, it was a 15% pay raise for E1 through E4, significant pay raise that will get them above that threshold, so they won't have to rely on stamp or food banks. Now we're going to put a lot of money into dormitories and barracks. The military has been subtracting 5% from their housing allowance. I don't think that's right, we authorized it, allowed it to happen, we're going to shut the door on that. And make sure that people are getting 100% of their housing allowance. And we're going to work on day-care to get more workers there so we can have 100% occupancy there. Right now, we're limited by how many people are working. We're going to work on health care, people shouldn't have to wait two months to get specialty care for example. We're going to continue to work with their chambers of commerce, to help get our spouses employed for those who want to be right when they do a new move. So there's a lot of things in this report. And I'm excited to be a part of it. By the way, I want to praise my - my co-leader here. Chrissy Houlahan has done a fantastic job. It was a total bipartisan effort. And we're very proud of it.",

The norms have been violated here. And I don't think it's been good for the institution. Probably - it's not good for either party, frankly.I think today that we're bringing this bill back up. It's needed. I believe that people are confused between 702 FISA versus Article I FISA, two different things. We need to have FISA to track foreign terrorists, to know what Putin is doing, what President Xi is doing. It's in our national security interest that we get this done. And we built in 51. additional protections to protect folks' Fourth Amendment rights. So this is a better bill. It's a good bill. We need to get it done.

Officials there say they have successfully deterred migration by 10% since December, in part because they established checkpoints and expansion camps at some of the biggest and busiest entry points. CNN's David Culver, got to tour those entry sites himself. David iswith us now. What have you seen?",

So to your point, we wanted to see that firsthand and get a really better understanding as to what was really sparking that stronger implementation of border policy.And it's interesting where we found it. It's here on the Mexico side of things. And you can see here at National Guard's Truck Park, we've got Mexican Army, National Guard, as well as migration officials who have stepped up patrols a significant amount. Now, what are they trying to do on the Mexico side in particular? Well, you have images like this, and we can show you what we saw yesterday. Large crowds, that as you see, in some of the drone footage are between two massive walls. We should point out, they're already on the U.S. side, they've already crossed from Mexico illegally. But the Mexican officials have stepped up where they have put some of these National Guard's troops, where they've put some of the Mexican Army soldiers, as well as migration officials to start deterring some of these migrants from crossing. A lot of them will cut using smugglers, some portions of the wall so that they can then go through, or they'll climb over using ladders. And they can do this on average in about a minute, 20 seconds. Now, what we've also seen is some increased frustration on part of Mexican residents, people who live on the border and certainly we've seen that on the U.S. side. We've covered that in San Diego County, where people who have property that goes right up to the border with Mexico, are seeing the floods of migrants come through. Well, on the Mexican side here, we have found that same frustration, and I want to show you some of these images. You'll see some national guards members from the Mexican side, who have been called to patrol neighborhoods. So imagine just regular suburban communities. And this was one of those where you have smugglers who will come at all hours, and they're often cartel backed, and they will drop off groups of migrants, who will then go through these neighborhoods and go onto people's patios into their backyards, and then jump the fence to get into the U.S. So they have now John, troops going through these neighborhoods to patrol and stop the smugglers from coming through. And for now, it seems the numbers are showing that it's seeming to work.",
