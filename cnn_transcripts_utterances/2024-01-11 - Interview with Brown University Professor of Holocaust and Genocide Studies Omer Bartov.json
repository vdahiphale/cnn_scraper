Now, South Africa lays out its argument, I'm joined by Omer Bartov, a professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Brown University. Then, more on the crisis in Israel and Gaza, as well as fears of a wider war. I speak to Alon Pinkas, a former adviser to several Israeli prime ministers. Also, ahead, the Ukrainian ambassador to Washington tells Walter Isaacson why her country desperately needs U.S. support. And they discuss if it's time for peace talks with Russia. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program, I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Hearings have begun in the International Court of Justice that could change the course of Israel's war in Gaza. South Africa arguing today that Israel is committing \"genocidal acts\" against the Palestinian people. It's an extraordinary case that has its roots in October 7th, when a brutal attack was launched by Hamas, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and seeing hundreds more kidnapped. In the three months since, Israel has waged a devastating war on Hamas in Gaza. According to Palestinian statistics, 1 percent of Gaza's population has been killed and many, many more have been displaced. Today, South Africa told the court 17 judges that history will be made by their verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Clearly there is a lot of pressure there. Israeli journalist, Anshel Pfeffer even wrote, Israel isn't committing a genocide, but it has genociders within its government. How damaging is that for Israel, a democracy, which as defenders would say, listen, we can't control every single thing that our members of government say, that these are backbenchers, that they're not part of the war cabinet, what do you make of that argument?",

It is not only all kind of backbenchers who are makingthese statements, it's the minister of defense, it's the prime minister, it's top generals in the military, these are actual decision-makers. So, that's one thing that has to be taken into account. What does it mean in terms of Israeli democracy? We are in Israel in a very precarious condition. Because Israel right now has sort of put itself in a position where the prime minister cannot make a decision on what will happen after these operations is over or how you define success of this operation, because any decision that he makes about the next day, what will happen later, may cause his cabinet to fall and because he's under indictment, he may end up in jail. And so, his own interest is, A, not to make any decision, about the next day. And B, basically to let the war go on, not only in Gaza, but as we know, also things are deteriorating quickly along the Lebanese border with Hezbollah. And so, the best thing for Israeli democracy and for this war would be for this cabinet to be removed. It has already entirely discredited itself by what happened on October 7th, and as has the military, but it -- of course, there's no interest in leaving power. And the military declared three -- two main goals in that war, which is to destroy Hamas as a political and military organization and to free the hostages. And it has been fighting for three months now, and it has failed in doing that. And, in that sense, if there is no political horizon, then the killing will just go on.",

I don't know whether they'll talk about the third phase that they are implementing but they will probably talk aboutincreased humanitarian aid, but that humanitarian aid is completely insufficient and the third phase means that there will be operations precisely in that area where most of the population of Gaza is now concentrated. And so, any military action there is bound to, A, bring many more civilian losses, and B, just make the humanitarian situation even worse. We know that it's deteriorating now. We know that there is not enough aid coming in. There are about 200,000 civilians in Northern Gaza who seem to be getting no help at all, and there's very little reporting on that.

The establishment of the State of Israel followed the Holocaust as well. Israel has accused the U.N., as you know, a bias for many years.

One is, as you say, that of course the Genocide Convention, which was pushed byRaphael Lemkin, who was himself a Jewish Polish lawyer who ended up in America, invented the term, was supported largely because of what happened in World War II, and particularly the mass murder of the Jews, the genocide of the Jews, and that Israel now would stand accused of that is a very sad moment. But it doesn't mean that it shouldn't be if there is enough evidence. And the second is, that it's South Africa that is lodging this complaint. And South Africa was a country that became a pariah country in the International Community because of the apartheid regime there and has a kind of long story with the State of Israel, which was one of the only countries that worked together with the apartheid regime while South Africa was otherwise isolated from the rest of the International Community. And for South Africa to be bringing this against Israel is, to my mind, it's a very important moment, of course, but it's also very sad because in some ways you would have thought that South Africa and Israel would be on the same page and not opponents.",

I mean, it's going to be very difficult to prove genocide because, as you know, and I think Professor Omer Bartov referred to it, you need to prove intent. And intent is very difficult. You can barely prove intent on the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You can barely prove intent on allied bombings of Dresden or German bombings of Coventry. Surely, it's going to be difficult to show intent here. But what made this complicated, and you and Omer Bartov, both referred to it, is those reckless, moronic, idiotic statements by Israeli politicians on all sides, making all these, you know, ridiculous ideas, you know, flatten Gaza, burn Gaza, nuke Gaza, relocate the population of Gaza. So, this is taken very seriously. You saw the prime minister speak in English, you alluded to it earlier. He sent a nemesis of his Former Supreme Justice -- Supreme Court Justice and President of the Supreme Court, Aharon Barak. That was not an easy thing for him to do, because if there is an injunction or so-called a provisional ruling it could then move to the ICC, the International Criminal Court, where Mr. Netanyahu, among other people, may be indicted.
