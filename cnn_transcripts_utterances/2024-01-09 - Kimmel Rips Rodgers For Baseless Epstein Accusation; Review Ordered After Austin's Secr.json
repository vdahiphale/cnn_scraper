That's the New York Jets quarterback who came under fire last week when he claimed without any evidence that Kimmel could be revealed as a Jeffrey Epstein associate. In response, Kimmel threatened to sue Rodgers, saying the claim is completely baseless.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!\":  You know, when you hear a guy who won a Super Bowl and did the -- all the State Farm commercials say something like this, a lot of people believe it. A lot of delusional people honestly believe I am meeting up with Tom Hanks and Oprah at Shakey's once a week to eat pizza and drink the blood of children. And I know this because I hear from these people often. My wife hears from them. My kids hear from them. My poor mailman hears from these people. He genuinely thinks that because God gave him the ability to throw a ball he's smarter than everyone else. The idea that his brain is just average is unfathomable to him. Aaron got two A's on his report card. They were both in the word \"Aaron,\" OK? Aaron Rodgers is too arrogant to know how ignorant he is. They let him host \"JEOPARDY!\" for two weeks and how he knows everything. And by the way, congratulations to Aaron Rodgers who has done the impossible. He made the New York Jets look even worse.

And so, Aaron Rodgers insinuating this draws back to many years, at this point, of people who have sort of right-wing viewpoints alleging without any evidence that folks, especially in media, are tied to pedophilia.You heard Jimmy Kimmel sort of blasting Aaron Rodgers on his show yesterday. Now, Aaron Rodgers is expected to go back on ESPN -- Pat McAfee's show today. He's expected to address whatever Kimmel said in his monologue. I would not expect an apology though, Poppy, from Aaron Rodgers. Aaron Rodgers has been pretty vocal about his political viewpoints for a long time. He tends to say pretty outlandish things, whether it's about not supporting vaccines, et cetera. So I think this feud is just going to continue to boil over.",

They gained so much popularity. And if you're a traditional media company you want to tap into the zeitgeist of what's happening on the internet. But, of course, as we're seeing, it comes with some brand safety risks. Obviously, you don't want infighting between two different voices within two different shows within your company.

His chief of staff has now directed a 30-day review of the process and the procedures around notifying national security leaders and the White House. Austin is still at Walter Reed eight days after being admitted from complications from an elective procedure. He is out of the ICU, so that's good news. Again, it took three days though before the White House was notified. President Biden says he has complete confidence in Austin. And joining us now, someone with a lot of perspective on the importance of that job, Mark Esper. He served as Defense secretary in the Trump administration. Secretary, good to have you. Appreciate it very much. Primary importance is his health -- how he's doing. He appears to be getting better. He's out of the ICU. But you've got a Republican congressman who is calling for the Defense Secretary to now be impeached over this. You've got concerns from Democrats as well, including Sen. Jack Reed, who is chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who said he is still concerned that, sort of, the vital chain of command here and procedure were not followed. What do you think needs to change having sat in that seat?",

Look, I think a big part of the problem here at his point is not just that it wasn't revealed early on but each and every day it seems like there's an additional piece of information that trickles out, right? When I was first on CNN over the weekend it was the press corps wasn't informed. And then on Sunday, we learned the White House wasn't informed. And then we learned that Deputy Sec. Hicks was given authority but not told. And then we heard that he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. Every day there's been a more -- a new detail coming out, which is I think causing this concern on Capitol Hill by members who are -- who are talking about things that you mentioned -- impeachment and inquiry. And I think it's been a big communications blunder as well built around something that is a very serious matter, and that is the president and the national security community knowing where a cabinet member is and how he's doing.",

I mean, it's one of the terrible aspects of war that innocent people die, and you have to be very discriminate in how you do it. So hopefully, they'll improve the procedures. Look, I think the other important news coming out of the -- out of Sec. Blinken's trip is that he seems to have done some type of agreement from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Qatar -- I'm sorry, Qatar and the UAE that they will participate or consider participating in some type of post-conflict governance and reconstruction.

We had a strike yesterday. And then there was breaking news this morning that another vehicle that was in southern Lebanon was targeted by a drone strike. No news yet on who was in the car. But the Israels have clearly ramped up the game here in terms of targeting individuals and that, of course, is what could provoke the escalation. But I -- you know, I assume that Israel didn't want -- I don't think Hezbollah wants it because of what happened last time they had a major conflict with Israel. And then, of course, we don't know what Iran is doing and what they're providing, provoking, and inspiring the background. But those are key factors here as this unfolds.",
