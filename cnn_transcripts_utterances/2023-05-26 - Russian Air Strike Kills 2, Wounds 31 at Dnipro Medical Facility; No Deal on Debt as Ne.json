You could see a video here from the scene showing the fire, but also just the rubble of that medical facility following the strike. Ukraine's president, Zelenskyy, has called it an attack by terrorists. CNN's Sam Kiley, he's in Dnipro, Ukraine. Sam, you've been watching this closely since it happened there.

What we do know, though, is that eight of the injured, of the casualties, were doctors and it could have been a great deal or worse, the local authorities saying, Jim. Saying it's nothing short of a miracle, because at 10:30 this morning, when the missile or whatever it was, struck the building, the medical staff were actually in the middle of a handover between shifts. So the numbers of staff on duty and therefore the numbers of patients were less than would otherwise have been the case. So a happy fluke meant that - and I use the word carefully - only two people were killed. It's only a term that's applicable in these civilian strikes that we've seen against not least Dnipro where in the past more than a dozen have been killed and several dozen around the country in these cruise missile strikes against residential areas. And this, Jim, was not only a residential area, but it was a medical clinic. Now, the Russians might say that that was an accident. But according to the World Health Organization, nearly a thousand medical facilities, staff and other infrastructure associated with the health services have been attacked by Russia over the last year, Jim.

They have been demanding tougher work requirements for social safety net programs. They say that is an absolute must have for them. It is a red line. They are still pushing for it. But as Jeremy was mentioning, the White House is also digging in against that. And that is because Democrats here up on Capitol Hill have made crystal clear that they cannot support a deal that has work requirements in it. And in fact, there's a closed-door conference meeting yesterday where a number of them stood up and said, do not take us for granted. You need our votes, but there is no guarantee that we're going to support something even if it has the President's blessing. And it's important to keep in mind that any bipartisan deal is going to require votes from both sides of the aisle, especially because Speaker Kevin McCarthy has his right flank that he has to worry about. A number of conservatives also saying that they're not ready to support really any form of compromise, but especially if it doesn't have things like work requirements and strict spending cuts. So that's where we are in these negotiations night now. Patrick McHenry, he's a Republican congressman who's been in these negotiations, framed it as we are on the brink, either things are all going to come together or all going to fall apart.

And when they realized their mistake, police say they started to turn around and that's when they say Monahan fired two shots from his shotgun, one of them hitting Gillis as they were trying to turn around in that driveway. And we know that Gillis died just a short time later. If you also remember, as we've been following this case, Monahan says that he believes he was being menaced because there were loud noises from those cars and the other vehicles that were with that pack of friends. So we'll see how this continues to play out. But that 20-year-old dead died next to her boyfriend.

And these documents show that the FBI was on high alert when it came to British royalty visiting the United States.So one of these memos, the one that you mentioned, shows that there was a very loose plan reported of someone wanting to assassinate the Queen. Someone had called in saying that a patron at a well-known Irish Republican bar in San Francisco, who said that his daughter had been killed by a rubber bullet in Northern Ireland \"claimed that he was going to attempt to harm Queen Elizabeth\" and would do this either by dropping some object off the Golden Gate Bridge onto The Royal Yacht Britannia when it sails underneath or would attempt to kill Queen Elizabeth when she visited Yosemite National Park. Now, it doesn't give more details than that and it's not really clear what exactly the follow up was. It's important to keep in mind, though, that this was marked priority rather than immediate, which would have been treated much more urgently.
