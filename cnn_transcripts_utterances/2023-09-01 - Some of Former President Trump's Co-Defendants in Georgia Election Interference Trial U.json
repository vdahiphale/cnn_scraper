This hour of CNN THIS MORNING starts right now.Former President Trump has pled not guilty for the fourth time. This time he is saying he didn't conspire to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia in the case brought by Fulton County D.A. against Trump and 18 alleged co-conspirators. The former president opted not to enter the plea in person next Wednesday, waiving his arraignment. And that's not the only legal move Trump is making in this case. His legal team has also filed a motion to sever his case from the co-defendants would want a speedy trial. That would be attorney Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro so far. Now, Chesebro is the alleged co-conspirator who wrote the memos advocating for the fake elector scheme. The district attorney is pushing for the trial to again on October 23rd, a date that Trump's attorney says will not give them, quote, sufficient time to prepare.",

And in fact, they are so expensive that one of the co-defendants, Harrison Floyd, who leads Black Voices for Trump, actually spent a week in jail because he couldn't afford these attorney fees, or to hire an attorney.Because of this, they are turning to many different ways to try and raise the funds that they need for a legal defense, and that includes crowdfunding. Four of them are raising money on these crowdfunding sites. I want to pull it up here and show you just how much funds they are getting. Jenna Ellis, who was an attorney for Donald Trump, raised $180,000. John Eastman, another election lawyer for Trump, raising $500,000. Jeffrey Clark, the former DOJ official, $56,000. And Cathy Latham, who was a fake elector, raising $15,000. You can see here, this is a lot of money. These bills really add up. And one other person I want to point out is Rudy Giuliani. His son created a PAC to help pay his legal bills, and Trump is helping him a little bit. I don't mean financially, but he is hosting a fundraising for Giuliani next week. it's $100,000 a plate for that fundraiser for each person. So again, he will be there for that. But as of now, not actually paying any of the bills, but I was told by one Trump official that if people wanted help, they should apply to Trump's legal defense fund, which is something that was set up in July.",

Remember, I think you broke the news that they were going to create it the same time period as when the FEC was disclosing just how much money the super PAC had been spending on his behalf, his leadership PAC, on his behalf. What's the latest on that?[08:05:01] HOLMES:  Well, first of all, when we talk about that leadership PAC, they have spent more than $41 million since 2021 on legal fees. And in fact, they are bleeding out so much money on these legal fees that they requested a refund for $60 million that they gave to a super PAC that is defending -- that is supporting Donald Trump, and they do expect to get that money back. In terms of the legal defense fund, it is a non-profit. We are told that Don Jr. and Eric Trump are doing most of the fundraising around that, and they have a significant amount of pledges. Therefore, someone was telling me that these Georgia defendants, if they get enough money in this legal defense fund, could apply and potentially get help here. As of now, though, it's doesn't seem clear how much is actually in there and how much of this is just pledges. And I do want to make one thing clear -- that fund is for these legal bills of aides and advisors, not for the former president. It just goes to show you, again, they are bleeding money from that Save America PAC, enough to have to request a refund for a donation that they need to a super PAC. Clearly they need the money, and clearly that's why they set up this defense fund.",

Maybe you don't at all because it seems like there is so much going on. But it's important to take a step back here. That's what CNN's Stephen Collinson did this morning in a digital piece on CNN.com, saying, quote, \"A net of justice is tightening around 2020 election deniers.\" What is he talking about there? There are actually significant legal losses for people who tried to overturn the election results just this week. Top Proud Boys lieutenant Joe Biggs is now facing 17 years in prison. Biggs led the march to the Capitol on January 6th, who is convicted of seditious conspiracy. And former marine Zachary Rehl, president of the group's Philadelphia chapter, he is looking at 15 years. He broke down in tears during sentencing and told the judge, quote, \"for what it's worth, I stand here today and say that I am done with it all. I am done with politics. I am done pedaling lies for other people who don't care about me.\"Also, two men pleaded guilty to threatening election officials in separate criminal cases. Chad Christopher Stark of Texas pleaded guilty to making threats against public officials in Georgia after the 2020 election, while Joshua Russell of Ohio pleaded guilty to threatening an Arizona election worker, during the 2022 midterm election season. The cases are part of the Justice Department's election threats task force which launched in June 2021 to address the rise in threats against election officials.",

That's what the TSA says. And it's the record. It's the biggest summer for air travel ever. Think about this, though.

The odds have been -- have mostly played out in the travelers' favor in 2023, with the X factor, of course, being how will mother nature cooperate?

And from my understanding, one of the benefits of severing a trial would be that Trump's lawyers would not then be at that trial. Anything that comes up that implicates Trump, maybe if the trial is severed, the codefendants aren't going to, you know what I mean, aren't going to argue against it. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: So first of all, I think Shelby's exactly right. One of the advantages to a defendant of having a severed trial, meaning two separate trials, is the ones who go second have a huge tactical advantage. You get to see the other side's playbook. I mean, that is invaluable. On the question about payments for the codefendants, this is very unusual for a Trump case because he has historically, dating back to impeachment, covered himself by having his PACs and his associated entities pay for lawyers for co-counsel.

Like I said, this started about 24 hours ago at 8:50 A.M. on Thursday, yesterday morning. That's when law enforcement says that Danelo Cavalcante escaped from the Chester County Prison. Again, that's about 30 miles west of where we are here in Philadelphia. And I just want to repeat what you said. He was last seen at 9:40 wearing that white T-shirt, gray shorts and white sneakers. And, Phil, that's important because law enforcement officials believe that he was able to actually change clothes after he escaped from the prison. And just to drill down on why law enforcement is being so strong with their language here about this inmate this man was just convicted of first-degree murder two weeks ago. He was just sentenced to life without the possibility of parole last week. And that's all once he was found guilty of stabbing his former girlfriend, stabbing her 38 times, and killing her in front of her children. And, Phil, the prosecutors in this case, say that the motive for that killing was that the girlfriend actually discovered that he was wanted in connection to a murder back in Brazil. Prosecutors said she was going to expose that, and then that was the motivation for him killing his girlfriend. I want you to listen to exactly how dangerous the D.A. feels this suspect is. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEB RYAN, CHESTER COUNTY D. ATTORNEY: His depravity knows no bounds. I mean, this is someone who has nothing to lose, as you indicated. So, I don't know what he's capable of doing if he's already engaged in a murder in broad daylight in front of her two children there's no stopping him from doing anything more egregious. (END VIDEO CLIP) So, Phil, this manhunt is now in its second day. We know there are dozens of agencies that have been involved in this search. We've seen canines, we've seen drones, we've seen helicopters, and of course, a lot of officers on foot trying to bring this man back in with clear urgency.",
