Why not? There is, however, in a Republican primary a risk because this is a report from congressional Democrats. And so you could see Donald Trump saying, well, of course, they're using Democratic attacks against me, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Again, open question.

But as I've said, previously, the two of them have just not taken it to Trump to the degree that a lot of Republicans wanted to see. And a while back when I asked a top Trump campaign advisor why do you think Ron DeSantis is not doing so well against your candidate, this Trump advisor told me in one simple phrase, DeSantis never established dominance.

But, of course, Qasem Soleimani was a bete noir, if you will, to the - to ISIS because they see him as being one of the leaders in Iran who was part of a coalition trying to eradicate ISIS so picking Qasem Soleimani's commemoration as a time and place to target people perhaps really does fit with their mo and it certainly fits with their mo that they would target and kill innocent civilians in large numbers. They said they used suicide bombers. That doesn't quite gel with what Iran said yesterday. Iran had said yesterday that at least one of the explosives was in a suitcase and that it was detonated remotely. Even the Iranians yesterday were blaming Israel and saying that there would be a harsh response for this attack but at this stage even though ISIS hasn't put forward credible evidence most of the circumstantial evidence around this, what they've said, their rationale for it, their style of attacks in the past does seem to indicate and support the fact that this mostly seems like after all it was an ISIS attack.",

And what's probably confusing to voters is that we've got this Shia-Sunni thing and it's all mixed up because Hamas is Sunni, ISIS is Sunni, Iran and Hezbollah are Shia.But let's kind of understand that a lot of this has to do with this whole idea of the resistance against the West, pushing the United States out of the Middle East, and who gets to run and own that mission.
