Seconds ago, we saw a series of rockets taking off out of Gaza.What you're looking at now is in the direction of Gaza City, where the head of the IDF Southern Command says, IDF troops are currently fighting in the heart of Gaza City. Yet we've just seen a series of perhaps eight rockets at least coming out of Gaza City headed towards central Israel, and when those missiles are not intercepted here close to us, that means they -- that means they're very likely going to trigger the alarms in central Israel, perhaps around Tel Aviv, perhaps in other places, and the Iron Dome intercept rockets. Will intercept them further north from here. But I think that just gives you an indication that while the IDF is making gains against Hamas on the ground, they said they killed 10 Hamas operatives today that they've taken control of a number of Hamas rockets, a number of Hamas rocket launchers. They're continuing to move forward on the ground. Hamas, despite that, is still able to fire out. There is still a huge network of Hamas tunnels in the north of Gaza and the south as well that the IDF has yet to get into. And as we were -- as we've been hearing, the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that he is open to considering what his terming tactical pause is. That is the humanitarian pauses the United States is pushing for. They're certainly not the ceasefire Israel's Arab neighbors are pushing for. The Prime Minister says no ceasefire without a release of all the hostages. But when he speaks about tactical pauses, he said, maybe for an hour or so, maybe we've had these before, maybe we can consider them again.

A man identified as 69-year-old Paul Kessler was allegedly involved in a physical altercation with at least one counter protester when he fell and struck his head. Kessler's death has been ruled a homicide and the investigation is still ongoing. Here in Washington later today, the Democratic Party's divide over U.S. support for Israel will be on full display.
