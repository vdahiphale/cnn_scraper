Today, it was on student loans, and gay rights, on the heels of yesterday's affirmative action ruling. President Biden has said that he is angry, and disappointed, after the Supreme Court blocked his student loan forgiveness plan.

Today, the court also ruled in favor of a Christian web designer, who refused to create websites, to celebrate same-sex weddings, because of her religious objections. It was a blow to LGBTQ protections that could have further ramifications. My first guest tonight was the lead plaintiff, in the 2015 Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage. Joining us now is Jim Obergefell. Jim, thank you so much, for being here, tonight. You were at the center, just one of those consequential decisions that we have ever seen, from the Supreme Court. I wonder what went through your mind, today, when you heard this ruling. JIM OBERGEFELL, LEAD PLAINTIFF IN OBERGEFELL V. HODGES, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Well, thank you for having me on, Kaitlan. And when I learned what the Supreme Court did today, I was disgusted. This is an incredible overreach, I believe, and a misinterpretation of religious freedom. This is giving businesses, businesses, open to the public, the constitutional right, to refuse service, to an entire community of people. That isn't religious freedom. That is using religion as a weapon. That is not the intent, of religious freedom, in this country. Not everyone believes the same thing. And yet here, people are allowed to take their interpretation, of their particular belief, and use it against others. And I always thought most religions believed in the Golden Rule.

And it was clear that some of them disagreed, vehemently, with one another, on the ultimate outcome. We want to go behind-the-scenes, tonight, the scenes at the High Court, with our CNN Senior Supreme Court Analyst, Joan Biskupic, who literally wrote the book, on the Supreme Court, and knows it better than anyone. Joan, you are actually in the room, as a lot of these opinions and dissents were being read. What stood out to you about these last few days, and the interactions that we saw, between these justices, who come from very different ends, of the spectrum, here? JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST, AUTHOR, \"NINE BLACK ROBES\": And you're exactly right, Kaitlan, that they're a buttoned-up group, and they try to keep it in check. But by the time we get to the last week, in June, they just can't anymore. They have kind of a -- they operate under a fiction, of a fairly useful fiction, for a group of nine, that is appointed for life, and have to deal with each other, every day. And that fiction is \"Everything's OK here.\" But let's just use, for an example, the student loans case. Chief Justice, John Roberts, he won that one big. You've already talked about it. But in the -- at the end of his decision, he says, he admonishes critics, to say, we don't -- \"We're not disparaging each other, in this case. We actually get along in any disagreement that we have, should not at all be interpreted in a way that would cast doubt, on the integrity of the court.\" And Justice Kagan, who read part of her dissent, from the bench, had a bit of a \"Get Real\" attitude. Her dissent was dripping with ridicule, at many turns. And she said of the Chief, from the first page to the last, his opinion departs from judicial restraint. But here was her bottom line. \"The Court acts as though it is the arbiter of political and policy disputes, rather than of cases and controversies... The result here is that the Court substitutes itself for Congress and the Executive Branch in making national policy about student-loan forgiveness... With all\" due \"respect, I dissent.\" But Kaitlan, I have to add, sometimes, the justices, even drop that reference, too, \"With all due respect.\"",

They thought that the entirety of their balance had been forgiven. And it turns out, it hasn't been. And the Administration has done relatively little outreach, to date, to get in touch, with those people, to say, \"Hey, how we told you that your debt was going to be wiped out? That may not happen.\" And when I've talked with the Administration about that, why haven't they been in greater communication, with people, about the potential risks, of such a Supreme Court outcome? They've basically said some combination of they didn't want to get in the way of their own court case. They didn't want to undermine the argument that the U.S. government, the Biden administration was making, to try to pursue student debt forgiveness. And also, they were worried about sending conflicting messages, to the general public, to borrowers. But the end result is that there are a lot of people who, I think, are going to get hit with a surprise bill, because they haven't been following this quite as closely, as those of us, in the media, and in the administration, have been doing.",

But if that had been the solution to this problem, that had the firmest legal footing, I think it would have been their Plan A. And so, it may very well work. I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. But it will at the very least take some time, to go through that regulatory process. And if indeed, it does stand up in court? And presumably that will be challenged as well.
