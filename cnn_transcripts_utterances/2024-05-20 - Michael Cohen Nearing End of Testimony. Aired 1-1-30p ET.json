      "sentences": "Welcome to CNN's special coverage of former President Trump's hush money criminal trial. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, along with Abby Phillip, who's out -- just outside the courthouse in New York.Today, Michael Cohen, Trump's former fixer and lawyer, is back on the witness stand. Prosecutors appear to have some work to do during their redirect of Cohen after he made a truly stunning admission during cross-examination today. Defense attorney Todd Blanche was able to get Cohen to admit to stealing tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization. Abby, you were inside court today. Explain how it all went down.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf.Earlier in the trial, during the direct examination, Cohen had actually said this, that he had pocketed money from the Trump Organization that was meant for a technology company. But, today, while he was being pressed by the defense attorney Todd Blanche, Cohen agreed that it was theft, essentially. Blanche said -- quote -- \"So you stole from the Trump Organization?\" Cohen then answered: \"Yes, sir.\" With me now, CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Also with us, CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes. Court just took a break for lunch. They were just having a little bit of a sidebar with the judge about a few different issues before -- after the jury left the room. But this was really -- of all the moments this morning, as someone who was sitting in -- I was in the overflow room today. This was probably the one moment when something happened that everybody's ears perked up, right? And to Michael Cohen's credit, he didn't try to sugarcoat it. But what do you think ultimately is the significance of this revelation that he received $100,000, essentially, from the Trump Organization and only gave $20,000 of it to the person or the entity that it was intended for?",

      "sentences": "The blame here really lies with the prosecution, because, on direct, as you just noted, they did -- they walked up to the line. They acknowledged that he did take some money off the top, and this $50,000.But they didn't follow up with the important question, which is, how much did you take? He took tens of thousands of dollars. You might have expected that, yes, maybe he took a couple grand, but to take $30,000 and then to allow Todd Blanche on cross-examination to get Cohen to admit that he stole from the Trump Organization, that allowed Todd Blanche to land a punch that the prosecutors really could have staved off if they had gotten out ahead of this. Now, when they had a chance to go back to Cohen, he had a chance to explain it. He said -- quote -- \"I was angered because of the reduction in the bonus.\" He was upset about the amount of his bonus that year. \"And so I just felt like it was almost like self-help. I wasn't going to let him have the benefit of this way as well. I wasn't going to correct the conversation I was having with Allen Weisselberg,\" which is talking about when they sketched out those notes about how he would be paid $420,000. \"I had not only protected him,\" Trump, \"to the best that I could, but I had also laid out the money to Red Finch a year-and-a-half earlier and had -- again, $130,000, to have my bonus cut by two-thirds was very upsetting, to say the least.\" So, not exactly perfect English there, but what Cohen seems to be saying is that he felt he was entitled to steal this money from the Trump Organization. Not a great moment for prosecutors. They should have gotten out ahead of this. Whether this will sink their case, I mean, it just depends how the jury sees this.",

Donald Trump is.But I want to just take a moment, Kristen, because I wondered, and I think a lot of people wondered, what on earth is Red Finch and what were they doing? And we got an answer to that today. And the answer is, in some ways, it's very Trumpian, but it has to do with a poll.",

      "sentences": "Just one other thing on this, and the reason I think the question of what is Red Finch and what they were doing is important is because it actually goes to a broader issue, which is that Michael Cohen is a shady person, OK, and he's doing shady things on behalf of Donald Trump.One of the interesting things about the Red Finch thing is that Cohen testifies that Trump didn't want to pay them at all. They did this work for him. The poll was discarded for whatever reason by CNBC, and Trump didn't want to pay them at all.",

      "sentences": "Yes, he wasn't happy with how he was faring in the poll, so, therefore, he did not want to pay them. And, initially, Cohen suggested that's why he only gave them $20,000, but, under more questioning from Todd Blanche, then he admitted that in fact he stole it.And he seems to again feel that he was entitled. This seems incredibly problematic, not just because he's saying that he stole from the Trump Organization, but this number, the amount that he was reimbursed, this is central to the allegedly falsified business records. And when you look at that math, one of the only pieces of information that we have from the other person who was allegedly engaged in this conspiracy, Allen Weisselberg, and this math matters. And if it's Michael Cohen who gave false information about how this money should come back to him, I mean, that doesn't help the prosecution. Well, what they needed from Cohen was credible testimony that Trump was directing all of this. And, instead, Cohen undermined himself. This could potentially be a real problem for prosecutors.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby, so, I mean, a lot of the cross-examination was a bit meandering.And they were, though, trying to focus in on Cohen's memory of a variety of things, including the one phone call in October of 2016, not the one that was the big blockbuster moment, but another one where Cohen had spoke with Donald Trump twice before he had gone to the bank and opened up the bank account in order to transfer the money, the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels' lawyer. And what Todd Blanche did in that moment was go through all the other things that Michael Cohen had on his plate, other things that he could have possibly been speaking with Donald Trump about at that time, again, to try to sow some doubt in the minds of the jury of what Cohen's recollection was on all of these phone calls. And part of the reason gets to what the prosecution is now trying to address on redirect. And just before we broke for lunch, prosecutors are trying to get in photos taken from October 24, 2016, at a rally of Keith Schiller and Donald Trump. And that's because that does go to this moment that happened on Thursday, where Michael Cohen was shown text messages with Keith Schiller, the bodyguard, just before he got on the phone with Schiller, who Cohen had testified when asked by prosecutors that that's when he told Donald Trump that things were resolved with Stormy Daniels, they were moving ahead. And then, on cross-examination, he was shakier and was now confronted with these text messages that showed that Cohen was texting the bodyguard about a prankster who was calling and harassing him. So, the prosecutors want to get to this point now once we have returned from lunch. And they want to introduce photos from a campaign rally that were taken at 7:57 that show Keith Schiller and Donald Trump exiting the stage. And so they're hoping to get that in so that they can argue that he -- Keith Schiller was with Donald Trump. But even one of the prosecutors acknowledged that doesn't completely address the bigger question here about the content of that phone call and whether Cohen did in fact speak with Donald Trump. But they're trying to repair some of what Cohen had got tangled up with last week on cross-examination and going to the issues of his memory and the strength of his memory to try to restore his credibility to the jury.",

It is not always in the interest of prosecutors to keep hammering a point when it comes to trying to rehabilitate a witness' credibility. They had 17 hours, or however many it was, with him on the stand, where they built up his credibility, opened the door to some of the questions that we have been talking about today. They don't really benefit by getting into an extended back-and-forth with another hour of questioning to try to rebut everything that the defense put on. They can clean it up in their closing statement, maybe ask a question or two to this extent, because, look, the defense has already made the argument that -- or at least alleging that Michael Cohen seeks to benefit financially and has an interest in seeing the president taken down, but that's nothing new to the jury at this point.

And the question that I have is, when Donald Trump found out about this -- and I'm sure he knew about it before today's testimony -- I'm sure his lawyers informed him about it. There was some reporting that he shook his head today. And he must be furious about this, because nobody steals $30,000 or $60,000 from Donald Trump. I mean, if you buy the prosecution's argument that he knew about the Stormy Daniels payment, this might have been one payment that he did not know about.

With us now, retired New York criminal court Judge George Grasso. He's a retired Queens County Supreme Court judge in New York as well. He was inside court during the course of this morning. Judge, thanks, as usual, for joining us. As you know, earlier, Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, got Cohen to admit on the stand, under oath, of course, that he stole money from the Trump Organization.

And these guys are not aboveboard dealers. Cohen was not defensive at all. He explained it that he originally had told Trump and Weisselberg that it was a $50,000 contract. They didn't pay. He made Trump look very bad when he was talking about this poll, the most famous businessmen, and Trump wanted this Red Finch to work to manipulate I.P. addresses and things like that. And then, when it came time to sit down with Weisselberg on the final payouts, Cohen felt like -- he said he's already testified in front of the jury that he felt he was shortchanged on his bonus, that he thought this was a good time to make up for the bonus. He was the one who took care of Red Finch. He thought he did Trump a favor. I mean, objectively, is it honest? Is it ethical? No. But is it consistent with Michael Cohen's character and the way he did business? Yes. So, on balance, I don't think they hurt Michael Cohen's credibility at all. And I think, as a sideline, it just showed how devious Donald Trump could be in manipulating data and the truth to the general public.

So, as we speak, the judge is considering ruling on whether or not C- SPAN footage that apparently show Keith Schiller and Donald Trump together at a rally at, I believe, 7:57 p.m. on October 24 will be shown to the jury to establish they were together. So this is a step forward that they are taking and showing that the DA knows they have worked to do on that particular conversation.
