Maybe, it could help clear up the concerns from some of those Republican senators. But also, there's a question of whether or not his name is actually one of the ones submitted by the Trump team to the FBI to conduct that background check, because what this means by signing this agreement that typically incoming presidents sign when they win the election to have the DOJ go ahead and start carrying out these background checks, is that they'll have them submit these names that they are going to nominate to Capitol Hill to the FBI.Now, that does not mean they have to submit all of them. There's no legal requirement actually for Trump to do so. And I also think, Anderson, one other question that is still raised tonight is whether Trump trusts those background checks. He obviously has a very hostile attitude toward the FBI. That's part of why it's been nearly a month since he won the election and they're just now signing this Memorandum of Understanding. And so, even if an FBI background check came back, it doesn't necessarily imperil someone's nomination in Trump's eyes because he doesn't trust that, he's overridden concerns before for security clearances. He did so with Jared Kushner, his son-in-law the first time around. And so, I think that's really the question here of what that looks like now that they have signed this agreement, they will move forward.

It says in Korean, \"President Yoon's Martial Law: A Betrayal of the People\" and that's exactly what so many people here, myriad citizens of Seoul and surrounding area, are saying right now. In terms of the why question, Anderson, why this happened and why we got here, the best guess and best analysis that we can marshal right now is that the president of South Korea felt as though, he was backed into a corner facing myriad scandals, many scandals here domestically with a popularity, a favorability rating under, I repeat, under 20 percent. And in his words, a Parliament, you know, a couple of yards behind me that wasn't able to play a part in furthering his domestic agenda.

There's no plan B, and that's why it's -- President Biden was not called on it. His own Parliament wasn't called to let them know what was going to take place.

We like democracy. We don't want anyone to take that away from us. And so, what the president tried to do is imposing martial law, become a dictator as such, because he was frustrated that he couldn't get his budget through. He couldn't get his Cabinet approved or not impeached. So, democracy in that sense, worked with the people, spoke out and said, no. You'll work with a system democracy, it can be messy but dictatorships are a menace. And that's the choice they have made here.
