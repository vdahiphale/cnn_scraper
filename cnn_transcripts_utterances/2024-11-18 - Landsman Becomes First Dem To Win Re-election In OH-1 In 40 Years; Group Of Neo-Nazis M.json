And he is the first Democrat to win re-election in his Cincinnati area district in 40 years.So what can he tell other Democrats? Based on his lessons. Well, he's right here.

That includes asking for information about programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion that has been vilified by the right, but also asking for the text messages and emails sent by employees looking for terms such as Elon Musk or climate change, hoping to find partisan back and forth in the daily communications of federal workers. Another group, the American Accountability Foundation, has been calling through campaign finance contributions, social media posts, as well as the online work bios of people working in the federal government, specifically in the Department of Homeland Security. Looking for people who they think will not be able to execute Donald Trump's plans for mass deportations. And they have used that information to put together a list of 60, quote unquote, \"targets\" that they think Donald Trump should get rid of. Now I asked them, what is the purpose of this work? And they said, quote, \"If the president wants to be able to execute on the agenda that the American people told them they want, they can't have liberal activists in senior positions.\" Now this has had a chilling effect on these agencies, we are told. And the question is, does Donald Trump intend to use this information? And their campaign, excuse me, the transition did not answer that.

Apart from the moral and legal questions, CNN has new reporting that shows the devastating effect this could have on the economy. The very economy he says he is going to rebuild.
