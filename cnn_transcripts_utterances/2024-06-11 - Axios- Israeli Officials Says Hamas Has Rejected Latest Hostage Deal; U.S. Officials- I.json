So first, Hamas did not say that it rejected the deal. Hamas said that it gave a response to the Qatari and Egyptian mediators that it gave several comments and remarks on parts of the Israeli proposal. Israel, the Israeli government, Israeli officials are the ones saying that after they received Hamas response and analyze it, they treat it as a rejection. I think we still need to hear from the mediators and most importantly, from the White House that White House Spokesman John Kirby said that the White is still analyzing and studying the Hamas response. So, Hamas is saying they just gave few comments, Israel is saying Hamas rejected the deal. The White House still hasn't said anything of substance.

They also displayed this flag, celebrating the October 7 attack which slaughtered more than 1,200 Israelis and others. New York politicians ranging from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to Governor Kathy Hochul condemned the celebration of the slaughter of Jews with even Israel critic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calling the protest and the display atrocious anti-Semitism. But Hamas and Hamas supporters' callousness about the death of Jews is not particularly new nor is it news. What might be is the state of callousness about the death of Palestinians. Necessary sacrifices is how Hamas terrorists leader Yahya Sinwar describes the deaths of 1000s of Gazans, his own people theoretically, this according to messages viewed by the Wall Street Journal would shed more light on how Sinwar may be influencing a potential ceasefire deal despite the fact that he's been in hiding ever since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7. CNN's Oren Liebermann examines the messages and what could come next in ceasefire negotiations. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In an all- out push to stop the fighting in Gaza, negotiators are hoping for elusive success. The focus is on Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's military leader hasn't been seen in public since the start of the war, hiding somewhere in the bombarded enclave, but Sinwar may believe he has the upper hand. We have the Israelis right where we want them, Sinwar said in recent messages to Hamas officials, viewed by the Wall Street Journal. Sinwar's leaked messages which CNN hasn't seen and cannot independently verify shed light into his mindset during eight months of brutal war. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's assault on a territory. In one message to Hamas leaders in Doha, Sinwar wrote, these are necessary sacrifices. The Israeli military responded on social media saying \"Sinwar profits off the deaths of Gazan civilians. Hamas leaders don't care about Gazans. How many times do they have to say it for themselves before the world believes them?\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the region to push a ceasefire proposal aimed his message directly at Sinwar.",

They have struggled to prove anything in that case. But this is what James Comer, who was leading that investigation said. He said, \"Today's verdict is a step towards accountability, but until the Department of Justice investigates everyone involved in the Biden's corrupt influence peddling schemes that generated over 18 million and foreign payments of the Biden family, it will be clear Department officials continue to cover for the big guy, Joe Biden.\"But again, that investigation really has not borne out that Biden -- Joe Biden acted corruptly or enriched himself based on his sons, Hunter, business dealers. Now, Democrats have a much different view. They say it essentially confirms that the Justice Department system works fairly and treats both sides equally. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

      "sentences": "In our Politics Lead, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to outline his foreign policy agenda to campaign speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library tomorrow night. Domestically, RFK Jr. is perhaps best known for his opposition to vaccines after he falsely asserted a link between childhood vaccines and autism and a story published by \"Rolling Stone Magazine\" and Salon.com. In 2005, both Rolling Stone and Salon.com later retracted the story.My next guest says RFK Jr. called him 20 years ago to talk about vaccines for that article. And he says that RFK Jr., quote, became a bona fide source of disinformation, falsely saying vaccines cause autism ever since, unquote. Dr. Paul Offit joins me now. He's the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the great Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. And He's author of, \"Tell Me When It's Over: An Insider's Guide to Deciphering Covid Myths and Navigating Our Post- Pandemic World.\" Dr. Offit, thanks for joining us. So you write about this conversation with RFK Jr., and you say, quote, Kennedy had sandbagged me. The article was full of misstatements. Do you regret having that conversation? DR. PAUL OFFIT, DIRECTOR, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER: No. He called me 20 years ago and asked the question, I have had mothers come into my office telling me that they're concerned about this ethyl mercury containing preservative thimerosal in vaccines, could it do harm? Because certainly Mercury at high levels can be harmful. Were these the levels contained in vaccines harmful? So and at that point that he called me around 2004. Thimerosal had been at a pretty much all childhood vaccines since 2001. And so it was easy to do those studies. You can look at children who got thimerosal containing vaccines, compare them to children who got the same vaccines that didn't contain thimerosal. There were four or five studies that had been done at that time. And I went through those studies with him. And he seemed perfectly amenable to them. He was he was appreciative. I went home that night and told my wife that I thought that I had a really good conversation with RFK Jr. Then roughly a year later, there's an article published in \"Rolling Stone\" called Deadly Immunity, which just had a complete misstatement of series of facts. And what he said was that I was basically just a shill for the pharmaceutical industry, because the viral vaccine that we were working on at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, a rotavirus vaccine was, quote unquote, laced with thimerosal. And that's why I said it. But in fact, no live attenuated viral vaccines contain preservatives. So that was wrong. There were also many misstatements of fact, I called \"Rolling Stone\" and went through those misstatements, and ultimately, they retracted the article. And that to me was his birth as an anti-vaccine activist. His birth as a science denialist because that's what he is. He refuses to look at the data that prove that he is wrong.",
