The balloon was so high up when it was destroyed, the sound of the blast took several seconds to reach the ground. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER (voice-over):  And the shoot-down ended days of concern and speculation about the balloon's purpose. The Chinese insist it was a civilian research balloon. The Pentagon says it is confident it was conducting surveillance and on Saturday over the ocean, an F-22 jet fired a single heat-seeking missile to destroy it. The debris landed in water that's about 47 feet deep or 14 meters. Anything recovered will be taken to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. Former CIA officer Bob Baer offered his take.

So ultimately the president heeded their advice and waited to have this balloon shot down until it was over the waters on Saturday afternoon. President Biden was briefed on those final plans Friday evening and ultimately Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin gave that final go-ahead shortly after noon on Saturday. The president was flying on Air Force One from Syracuse, New York, to Maryland and was on the phone with his top officials as this operation was underway. Here's what he had to tell reporters about the considerations given. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  On Wednesday, when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down on Wednesday as soon as possible. They decided -- without doing damage to anyone on the ground. They decided that the best time to do that was, as it got over water, outside -- within our -- within the 12-mile limit. They successfully took it down. And I want to complement our aviators who did it. And we'll have more to report on this a little later. Thank you.",

Now of course, one of the casualties of this balloon scandal is that secretary of state Antony Blinken was supposed to be traveling to Beijing this weekend. That visit was postponed, as Washington has accused China of violating international airspace. We'll have to see where this goes from here.

But I read that part of the statement as a hint to the potential next steps. As far as doing the same thing, of course, I think we would assume that China would, you know, blow up a U.S. spy balloon that was floating over its country, whether it did it over the land or over sea.

And so there was loss of life in this case. And it had to do with an emergency landing on Hainan Island. There was a whole diplomatic fiasco. But the roles were sort of reversed then. It was a U.S. spy plane. They had to negotiate an apology and a release of the crew and the plane itself. So I think, if you think about that incident, it underscores how the relationship between the U.S. and China has changed in the 21st century.

LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  There were reports of sightings of a second balloon in at least two Latin American countries looking a lot like the Chinese surveillance balloon shot down Saturday after flying over the United States. CNN is aware of at least half a dozen eyewitnesses in Latin America, who have reported seeing it and sharing images on social media. An airborne object similar to the Chinese surveillance balloon seen flying over the United States was spotted over Colombia near Valledupar. As this video shared with CNN shows, it was around Friday noon local time. Colombian media have also reported sightings of a balloon flying at about 70,000 feet over the South American country's airspace, citing the Colombian military. We've seen reports a balloon has been spotted over Costa Rica. A lawyer, Esteban Carranza, posted a video of the balloon on Twitter, saying the same type of balloon spotted in the U.S. was visible all day in the Costa Rican sky. Carranza confirmed to CNN he filmed the white balloon flying overhead above San Jose on Thursday. CNN geolocated the video to a village, a shopping mall in San Jose. On Friday, the Pentagon confirmed sightings of a balloon over Latin America and said it was another Chinese surveillance balloon. Civil aviation authorities in Costa Rica confirmed the sightings but not the origin of the flying object. CNN has been unable to confirm whether these objects are indeed Chinese balloons -- Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "CNN has learned that, long before the leak of that draft opinion, security protocols, when it came to documents at the Supreme Court, were very lax. That could have led to the leak or, at the very least, it hindered the investigation into the leak.For example, several of the justices, over the years, sometimes would put sensitive information into personal emails. That information belonged on secure servers. And the person who told me this wasn't suggesting that it meant a justice had leaked a draft copy of an opinion but, at the very least, it showed that the justices themselves weren't setting a good example to the chambers, to their employees about how to deal with sensitive documents. Another issue concerned so-called burn bags. These are bags where you put sensitive information that are later burned or shredded. At the Supreme Court, they're taken down to the basement, put into a locked bin and later picked up by a shredding company. But a source tells me the problem with this is there's no uniform policy in chambers on how to deal with these. At one chamber sometimes they would be stapled closed, sometimes the bags would pile up under the desk but sometimes they'd be left in the hallways for pickup. The problem is these hallways were nonpublic but this is no way to deal with sensitive information. In her report, the marshal of the Supreme Court laid out a lot of security recommendations here and Chief Justice John Roberts said he's going to launch a review into how documents are handled. But for this particular leak that so rocked the court and the nation, all this comes too late -- Ariane de Vogue, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Russia's state news agency says more than 60 Russian troops were freed by Ukrainians in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates.

If you take a look at the south of the country, especially around Kherson, there's massive Russian shelling going on the past couple of days, really the past couple of weeks.But it has been intensifying. One person was killed in a flurry of attacks in Kherson, mostly artillery used by the Russians. They're not near Ukrainian positions and there's a body of water between them and the Ukrainians but they certainly are shelling that area with a vengeance. A very different situation in the east of the country with the battle for Bakhmut, which has certainly been the most brutal in the past couple of weeks, getting more intense. The Ukrainians had been losing ground but now they might be stabilizing the situation there. From what we've seen, Ukrainians are moving some of their most battle- hardened units into that place and that seems to be making a difference on the ground. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said they're not going to be giving up Bakhmut and they're going to be fighting for every inch. And they're not going to give up any territory without a massive fight. Other places on the eastern front, there's also massive fighting going on. Ukrainians certainly believe this very well could be at least a prelude to that massive Russian offensive, which both the U.S. and the Ukrainians have been expecting. Ukrainians say they're well entrenched. They said they need more Western weapons to not only hold the line but go on the offensive as well. Certainly that last batch of weapons coming from the United States is welcomed by Kyiv -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This extends to refined oil products, things like diesel and gasoline, that will be capped at $100 a barrel.The price takes into account the fact it's been upgraded and refined into a usable product. A Treasury official said -- an American Treasury official says, look, the goal is not to completely tank the Russian economy. The goal is to make the Kremlin have a choice between either propping up its economy or funding its war and it can't do both. The way that this is going to be enforced is through shipping. So essentially Western ships are not going to be able to carry these Russian oil products if they've been purchased above the caps. And insurance companies will not be able to provide insurance on the ships. What it does not do is prevent any third party from purchasing the oil, though, given the lessened demand for Russian oil the price is falling. Brent crude from the U.K. and Russian crude typically trade around the same price, give or take a few cents. But as of late, Russian oil is trading at a discount of more than 30 percent. Now Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pushed in the last week the E.U. to do more with sanctions. He says the Russians have adapted. In an IMF report recently, it said the Russian economy was forecast to actually grow slightly this year, though, in response the European Commission president said this. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
