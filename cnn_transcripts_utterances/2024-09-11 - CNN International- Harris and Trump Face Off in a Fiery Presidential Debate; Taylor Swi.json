And so, they feel as though he wasn't disciplined and that the vice president was, and came across as having a really firm command on the issues when it comes to reproductive rights, when it comes to foreign policy and the economy, and really showing compassion.

      "sentences": "While Trump himself is claiming that he won the debate, that this was the best debate ever. You heard him say that last night, but also this morning, he just called in to \"Fox and Friends\" to praise himself for his debate performance, but that is not what we are hearing and I'm hearing from some Trump allies, people close to the former president, even some of his advisers. Look, they recognize that Donald Trump needed to do one thing tonight, which was not take the bait, to not go into the his harsh, aggressive rhetoric, to go on rants, to go off script away from policy, and the focus that they wanted him to stay on.They had prepped Donald Trump. Donald Trump's team and his advisers had prepped him not to fall for some of the goading that Harris was expected to use and tried to get him to fall for that. And yet, they were unsuccessful. I think was very clear last night that Donald Trump got derailed by some of Kamala Harris' needling of him. And look, I think, you know, when I talked to some people about this, there are some key arguments that Donald Trump himself, but also many of his allies and his advisers are making, the top one being that they believe that the ABC moderators were biased against him. [08:15:00] They are saying it was a three-on-one debate. You heard that from Tulsi Gabbard. I heard that in my conversation with Brian Hughes, a senior Trump adviser. Trump said that this morning. I will note, Amara, that we know when people often try to attack the refs, it normally means they are on the losing side of that, but that is a key argument that they are making. They're also I've also heard though from people that some of this was on Donald Trump himself to do. There was a couple of moments there where Donald Trump's advisers and allies think Harris stumbled, particularly when the moderators asked her about how she would fix inflation, about her record on the economy. They believed that she did not answer that well. Same thing when they asked her about her changing positions, some of the flip-flops, including her position session on fracking. Again, another area where people thought Donald Trump really should have jumped in and held her feet to the fire. We know that a key argument going into last night was that they wanted him to say if you want all these changes, why haven't you done them throughout the past three- and-a-half years. Donald Trump really didn't get to that point until his closing statement. So that was something I heard a lot of people, a lot of Republicans very frustrated about in my conversations with them. And then one other note as well on this and I picked this up in the spin room, was the sense that Donald Trump, there was a couple of moments when he was getting derailed. Those were some of the moments actually that they wanted him to talk about the most, including when she went after him on crowd-size, said people were leaving his rallies early. Donald Trump kind of went off there on to his own airing of grievances, but that was during the segment, the section that was on immigration, an issue we know that they believe Donald Trump wins on. And again, the economy, I mentioned that already, but that is another issue that many voters say is their number one issue and it is also one were Donald Trump polls higher, except he didn't pivot and land his policy points. Instead, he kind of went off, went on the attack and that was exactly what Trump's team did not want him to do. Amara?",

CNN's Stephen Collinson is here with us now, live from Washington, D.C. Sum it up for us, Stephen. I mean, Trump was Trump last night.",

If she was able to make a case to, what some polls say is about a third of Americans who say they want to know more about her, this could end up being decisive. Of course, debates have already been decisive in this campaign because President Joe Biden's disastrous performance in the first debate in Atlanta in June knocked him out of the race completely, and it was extraordinary to reflect last night, watching that debate -- the historic and political forces that landed the vice president on that stage, where she never expected to be.So, I think what is crucial now is, and you see this off the presidential debates, is that the post-debate period is almost as crucial as the debate in defining how it went in the public mind. So people will be seeing clips on social media. The Trump campaign and the conservative media complex is already out there trying to recast this Trump is claiming without any evidence that the debate was rigged, that Harris had the questions in advance. And we also have to bear in mind that what pundits see and what people out in the country see is not always exactly the same thing.",

One of the things that has changed and that it's so clear looking at that tableau of political leaders, is that 9/11 was once a source of unity. And at this moment, and it's sad because it should remain a source of unity, that we are divided as to what to learn from that terrible day.There was a time that Americans understood that preventing another 9/11 involved engaging with the world. That a mistake we had made after the cold war was to think that the world would be such a more peaceful place, that we could simply focus on our own domestic concerns, of which we always have many. And the lesson initially was no, we need to play a role in -- again, in stabilizing or helping to stabilize parts of the world, so that they're not a source of future attacks. But today, we see a disagreement over whether to engage the world or not. And that disagreement mean is personified by that tableau of political leaders that we just saw.",

Tim, as we look at this, there are a number of these rituals which are so important to not only the families of the victims, but in many ways to the nation. It is traditions like this that are a reminder of not only the tragedy that has happened, of the loss and the void that will never be filled for those families, but also of what it means to come together as a nation, to pay respects to those who were lost and also to those who were lost in service trying to save so many, Tim.",

I was just reflecting on the fact that it was the 23rd anniversary and 9/11 shook America the way that Pearl Harbor, the surprise Japanese attack on the United States in 1941 had shaken the country. And to put this into perspective, we would be in 1964, where this -- a similar anniversary of Pearl Harbor and for two generations of Americans. So in other words, a generation that was not even alive at the time of Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor meant something to them. It was a symbol of a great shock and also a source of vulnerability that America could be hurt and could be surprised.And so, 9/11 I think has the same effect on the American people and to some extent on others. First and foremost, keep in mind that not just American citizens died on 9/11. But -- and so, the interesting thing for Americans is how they work through that shock and grief, and what lessons generations take from it, and not -- and Pearl Harbor presented one set of lessons that actually she remained pretty clear and pretty widely accepted by Americans for two generations. It is not clear that Americans now agree on what to learn from 9/11. And over the next generation, I think we'll work through is a people how to deal with surprise, so that a 9/11 doesn't happen again. But for the families affected, the meaning of 9/11 will never change. It will always be a source of deep, deep sadness and loss.",
