      "sentences": "Good to have you with us. Donald Trump could be just hours away from formally challenging decisions to ban him from primary ballots in two states, Colorado and Maine. A source says an appeal from his legal team is expected today. Anti-Trump challengers succeeded at using the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban to remove Trump from ballots, though those decisions have been paused pending potential appeals. But challengers in several other states were rejected and now Oregon'sSupreme Court will decide whether to ban the former U.S. President from the ballot over his alleged role in the January 6th insurrection. Tuesday's expected appeals are coming at the start of a busy month for Trump, which includes closing arguments in the New York Civil Fraud Trial and the start of the presidential primary season. Well, the first test of this year's presidential election comes in less than two weeks at the Iowa caucuses. Trump has maintained a consistent lead in the polls there, but rivals Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are hoping for a strong showing. CNN's Kristen Holmes reports from Washington. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It is officially that final sprint to Iowa. We're looking at two weeks, and the candidates are going to all be on the ground, or at least most of them, trying to scoop up every last-minute voter that they can, talk to any kind of Iowan who might be on the fence. And really going into it, when you look at the poll numbers, you still see that Donald Trump, according to these polls, has a very substantial lead. He is the front-runner. And their goal is to keep that margin really high between him and whoever the second-place person is. Now, the polls show that would be Ron DeSantis right now, and after that, Nikki Haley. Now, the thing about Ron DeSantis is that Iowa is critical to the Florida governor. He has made this essentially his make or break moment, put all of his cards or all of his eggs in the Iowa basket, and is really focused on that. However, we have seen some substantial rise in the polls from Nikki Haley, but it still looks as though that would be the order. Now, whatever happens in Iowa is really going to set the tone for the rest of the primary and caucus season. Right now, Donald Trump is leading in most states, but there is a part or there are several Republican operatives who believe that if Donald Trump is slowed down in Iowa, if that margin is not as big as those polls show, it's possible that someone else could take the lead, we could see someone else surge. But right now, it's just still very early and the big focus still remains on Iowa, on the Hawkeye State. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington.",

White House officials are closely watching the coming weeks to see whether Israel actually transitions to a lower intensity phase of fighting. That is something that the U.S. has encouraged Israel to do in recent weeks. And a senior U.S. official said that they believed that they were starting to see the beginning of that strategy, that tactic, when Israel, on Monday, announced they would be withdrawing some of their troops from Gaza as Israel is preparing for a prolonged fight heading into 2024. Now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be traveling to Israel later in the week, as he is expected to start talking about that next phase in fighting with officials on the ground there. But there's also a host of domestic issues that President Biden has to tackle once he is back in Washington. That includes the border crisis, as there has been a recent surge in migrants on the southern border, really adding additional stresses to an already strained system. Congressional negotiators have yet to settle on a deal regarding border policy changes, even as President Biden has said that he is willing to make some concessions. There's also big questions about whether the White House will be able to push through additional aid for Ukraine, as that debate is currently locked in the fight over those potential border policy changes. The White House, of course, has warned of what inaction could mean for Ukraine on the battlefield. And then there's two major government funding fights looming. In just the next five weeks, there are two deadlines that Congress will need to try to reach to try to pass additional funding to prevent a government shutdown. Of course, all of this is playing out as the backdrop of the 2024 election. President Biden really has not been doing his day-to-day campaigning, but that is expected to change in the early months of 2024. He is also expected to ramp up his attacks on former President Donald Trump, as his campaign believes that he will eventually become the Republican nominee. Of course, President Biden has been trailing Trump in some recent polling, and the President still has much more work to do in trying to keep his coalition together, even as there have been some strains among some groups who have previously supported him. So, the President coming back to Washington with tackling a huge plate of issues as he is heading closer to that 2024 election in November. Arlette Saenz, CNN, Washington.

The region was the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake, which hit near the Noto Peninsula Monday afternoon.Japan's Prime Minister says access to the northern part of the peninsula is extremely difficult because the main road into the area is destroyed. The U.S. Geological Survey has recorded more than 35 aftershocks and warns they could continue for days, even months.

And more and more people are expected to head to those shelters as the day goes on.You mentioned the aftershocks. I think that's one of the biggest concerns and plus the fact that some buildings will have been destabilized by the initial quake and the force of it. And so there are those who are very concerned about their safety. And it is cold right now. It is wintertime along with those power outages which have affected more than 45,000 homes. People are trying to stay safe and they're trying to stay warm. Let me give you a little bit more detail from the Prime Minister. You mentioned that the Prime Minister Kishida had mentioned how extremely difficult it was to get to some of the more remote areas of the prefecture. He said, to secure the route there, we are to mobilize all the means of transport, not only on the ground, but also aerial and marine transport. Let's not forget that this particular area borders the coast, that was why we were concerned about those initial tsunami warnings. All of which have now been revoked, thankfully. And some of those warnings went as far afield as eastern Russia. So, you can imagine the kind of concern there was in the region. Just in terms of the forward-looking aspect of this situation, the Prime Minister has also said that an emergency -- an emergency disaster headquarters has been set up in Ishikawa Prefecture. This is where the earthquake struck, and they will coordinate the emergency response. But otherwise, local officials in Wajima City, Shiga Town, Anamitsu Town, they are still evaluating just how many evacuees will seek help at this time. But the race against time is definitely on to reach those people who might be trapped under collapsed buildings. So, that will be the concern and it will be that aspect of the story that we'll be watching from here on out, Rosemary.",

But other people within the Cabinet opposed to the Supreme Court's decision -- people like Ben-Gvir, the Israeli National Security Minister had this reaction. He said, \"This is a dangerous anti- democratic event and at this time, above all, ruling that harms Israel's war effort against its enemies.\" So, divisions right there on the Supreme Court decision. Now, of course, the Supreme Court decision came about a law that was proposed a year ago, had nothing to do with in fact the war in Gaza and a number of even Prime Minister Netanyahu's opponents say that this is something that should be looked at after the war is over, not necessarily right now. But in any case, the Supreme Court, very narrowly ruled against Prime Minister Netanyahu with his verdict 8-7. There's also some reason to believe that if this ruling had come later, because two of these justices are now retiring, will retire in the month of January, in fact, it would have been different. It would have come down differently and been quite ruled on the opposite direction and in Mr. Netanyahu's favor. As you said, by the way, Rosemary, that in fact the other announcement that came out of Israel today was this announcement that thousands of military now involved in the Gaza conflict are going to be brought back home, some for retraining, some to be released from their military duty, and that a number of the people who have been evacuated right along the Gaza border will in fact be able to go back to their homes.

He had no heat source in that tent, limited supplies of food and water. And they described him as very cold and scared.Now, apparently he had been kidnapped, but not in the traditional sense that we know it -- cyber-kidnapped. So, he never actually came face to face with his kidnappers. He was just coerced over his phone and over the internet. So, what appears to have happened is that he was contacted by these kidnappers and told that unless he did exactly what he was told, his family back home in China would be in danger. They asked him for a photograph, which they then sent to his family in China with a ransom demand. And they told 17-year-old Kai Zhuang to isolate himself. That's why he was in this tent in the middle of nowhere. The family, they say that they paid around $80,000 into Chinese bank accounts. They also contacted the high school in Utah. The high school contacted the police and the police by looking at this 17-year-old's spending patterns, what he'd bought, they worked out that he was camping. So, search parties were sent out and eventually he was found in this tent. Apparently, this cyber kidnapping is an increasingly common occurrence targeting foreign exchange students, particularly Chinese foreign exchange students. Now, this story ended well and the student was found alive and well. He asked to speak to his family. He asked for a warm cheeseburger. He is safe. But as I say, this is apparently an increasingly common trend seen in this country of cyber kidnappers targeting these young, vulnerable kids far from home. They never come face to face.

Right now, I think New York has something like 68,000 migrants in shelters.And what New York City is asking from Texas is really quite simple. They're just asking that the state of Texas give them notice of when the buses are arriving, whether the people on the buses need medical care, and whether they have relatives here, just to make the processing efficient and also humane. But Texas does not want to do that. That's why they're playing this game, a ploy as you called it, of sending them to New Jersey or other suburbs, knowing full well that the migrants will face a degree of chaos and confusion when they first arrive, until they are connected with non-profit groups and social service groups around New York City who can help them through this really complicated process.",

I mean, right now our country, our lawmakers, a lot of them promote this idea that the U.S. is somehow full and we cannot absorb these people even as we have labor shortages all around the country and a 3.7 unemployment rate.So, one solution might be to potentially create more pathways for legal immigration. But that's really a non-starter for all the Republicans in Congress and many centrist Democrats. Another solution would be to send more resources to the border to expedite this tremendous backlog of asylum seekers and asylum claims by Republicans. And again, some Democrats, as well, are resistant to allocating more money for this type of immigration infrastructure until they, in their view, the border is completely sealed. So, think of it as a goalpost that are basically on roller skates that constantly keep moving. And meanwhile, Congress just does not want to take, you know, the type of action we need. And our presidents, Trump or President Obama, now President Biden, they have attempted various executive actions on their own. And the only thing that really seems to result in long term is more lawsuits challenging these moves. And so we end up in sort of this status quo that stays the same. It is unsustainable in the long run. And we've seen also for decades that these deterrence-based efforts, they do not work. And I'm playing a bleak picture here, but the worst part of it is that people from throughout Latin America, Central America, and increasingly from all around the world, they are coming to a country that guarantees them the right to apply for humanitarian relief. We have laws that, you know, they have the human right to claim asylum. And yet we are doing all we can, it seems, to keep them out.

Now, Sanofi becomes the third major U.S. manufacturer of insulin to offer a $35 per month price cap, at least on what people are paying out of pocket for their medications.Now, this may be kind of complicated for people to access. They may have to go to the drug makers' websites and download a coupon, but at least this now becomes available across the board from these three major manufacturers. Now, more than eight million people in the United States depend on insulin to live. And according to the American Diabetes Association, a quarter of those people have at one point needed to ration their medicine in order to pay for it. And that can have really severe health consequences. Another thing going into effect starting January 1st is decreases in the list prices of insulins of more than 70 percent. And now the list price is the actual price of the medicine before insurance kicks in or any rebates or discounts are paid back into the system. And now the reason that is actually happening is because of a Biden administration 2021 law, the American Rescue Plan Act. Essentially that changed the way drug makers have to pay rebates back to Medicaid for drugs on which they've raised the price a lot over the years. Insulins have been going up for decades. If you look at this graph we have here, this one actually comes from a congressional investigation into drug prices. And you can see how much those list prices have increased. Now, because of this change which goes into effect January 1st, companies that have raised the price of medicines a lot over time could actually end up paying Medicaid for drugs, so losing money on those medicines. So, by reducing the list prices by 70 percent or more, these companies are actually avoiding having to pay these rebates back to Medicaid. Some analysts put this at hundreds of millions of dollars a year in savings these companies will have because they're reducing the list prices of their drugs. And so while across the board, it's hoped that insulin prices are coming down from everyone, there's a lot going on beyond the surface here. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
