That could include a ground war. That includes massing thousands upon thousands of troops along its border with Gaza. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Sderot, Israel, where he has been with the troops of the Israeli Defense Forces who are training in that area. Give us some sense of what they are doing when you talk about training, what that entails there on the border, Nic?",

But when you have reservists in the force and regular troops, you have to bring them together to train to do that. So they've been training to do that. They'd been training as well for fighting in a combat environment in these mock Palestinian towns, there are mosques, there are stores, there are traffic circles, there are people -- there are homes.So the troops are going and training for exactly the sort of environment absent the people that they'll face when they go into Gaza. So now they haven't been given that order. Everything that we see, the tanks parked in the fields, the troops doing the last minute repairs to the tank tracks, there dozens upon dozens, probably hundreds of armored fighting vehicles lined up nose to tail in the fields close to the border as well. Some of those waiting for troops to join them. You get that real sense that a possibility of an incursion is getting closer, the whole force not ready yet. Fighter jets in the air -- in the skies above us and still miss our runs taking place in the last half an hour or so.",

Right now, U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken back in Israel. The State Department says during meetings with Israeli leaders this morning that Blinken reaffirmed U.S. support of Israel and its need to defend itself. The State Department also in a readout, if you will, says it Blinken is also focused on the efforts that are ongoing and underway to secure the swift and safe relief of the hostages being held by Hamas terrorists. And today, that number of hostages has increased a great deal, unfortunately, 199 people are being believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, John.",

Nic has said that some of the firing from Gaza has been going toward Ashkelon and Ashdod, which are up here on the Israeli coast. And he's hearing more incoming.And Nic are getting other information, by the way. This is also Wadi Gaza, people have been told to leave northern Gaza and head south. We are getting this information, Nic, that U.N. fuel trucks, some five of them have crossed the Rafah crossing, which is right here, from Egypt into Gaza, bringing fuel, one might presume to the southern part of that country, it is a significant development, because it's the first aid to get into Gaza since this conflict began.

So if those trucks have gotten through that proves that to some degree, that road is possible. We knew that these empty fuel trucks were lined up inside the Rafah border crossing, inside Gaza, waiting to pass to go across into Egypt.If they've now fueled up and filled up and they're coming back into Gaza, that will give some temporary relief principally to the hospitals and the medical facilities there in Gaza. The U.N. agencies say that those medical facilities that rely on generator power, because most of the electricity has been cut to Gaza, that those generators will now have enough fuel to run for another number of hours. It's not clear how much fuel, how many more hours those generators can keep running. But the hospitals in Gaza have approximately 3,500 beds for the residents, those 2.2 million people that live in Gaza. So keeping the hospitals running, particularly for the elderly, particularly for the many casualties, and people who are in them already, on dialysis, on life support machines, this fuel is vital to help keep them alive. So that will be we expect would be the sort of first principle use of that fuel once it crosses back in. But again, not just the fuel, in a way the proof if you will, that that border can be crossed by trucks.",

Thank you so much, sir, for joining us at this really tense time in Israel and in Gaza, and frankly, in the West Bank as well with the leadership there. Sir, can you just give us some sense of how diplomacy can work and whether it is already working to some degree because for the entire past eight days, nothing has come in and out of that Rafah border, the border between Gaza and Egypt. But now, we've just learned and seen evidence video of it of five different trucks coming in with fuel into Gaza from that Rafah border, which has effectively been closed to people trying to get out.

He's trying to get Egypt to open that Rafah gate that you just mentioned, that's super important, both for moving supplies into Gaza, but also to create a safety valve for some Palestinians to leave Gaza.And that's going to be the most controversial for Egypt because they don't want a mass influx of refugees from the Gaza into the Sinai Peninsula, which is where the Rafah gate opens up into in Egypt. Moreover, he's trying to show strong unwavering support for Israel publicly. But privately, he's urging Israel to be proportional its response, to limit the casualties for civilians, and not to ultimately occupy Gaza. Yes, Israel has to do what it has to do to decimate Hamas, but he doesn't want to see an ongoing humanitarian crisis from Israel staying in Gaza, and controlling Gaza, and continued fighting an insurgency in Gaza.",

You know, one of the ways we got here is that Hamas has provided very poor leadership in Gaza. It has betrayed the average Palestinian. I would note that Hamas last had elections in Gaza in 2006, which is stunning, you know, half of Gaza's population is under 18. That means most of them weren't even alive, or many of them were not alive, the last time they were elections.The reason Hamas has not had an election since then, is because it knows the people of Gaza are unhappy with their leadership, so they betrayed the Palestinians. But there's also been mistakes on the Israel side. Of course, Israel did not deserve this attack. It was unwarranted, it was atrocious. But Israel has made mistakes in terms of going forward with settlements that have made it more difficult for there to be the two-state solution. And in terms of not working hard enough to press for a two-state solution to press at least the more moderate partners in West Bank, to agree to some kind of deal that would give the Palestinians more rights to self-determination and put the Palestinian territories, both Gaza and West Bank on track to ultimately be independent.

And it is clear that the land that they want to occupy and they once lived on has shrunken enormously over these past few decades. That has been a huge bone of contention from the Palestinian side.I want to talk to you a little bit about this visit from Secretary of State Antony Blinken. This is the second time he has come to Israel within a week, which is highly unusual. We're looking at the podium where he is going to be meeting with the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in just a bit here. You know this second visit, is this a sort of emergency move to try and find some way to help those who are in particularly in Gaza, while also showing the United States full support to Israel?",

Obviously, he needs to take care of the U.S. citizens that are in Israel, you're in Haifa, there's a, you know, there's a now a way for Israel -- for American citizens in Israel to leave by boat from Haifa. So the State Department is likely involved in organizing that. He's very worried about the hostages. So he's working on discussions with those who can have influence with Hamas to release the hostages, especially the hostages that are U.S. citizens or dual Israeli-U.S. citizens. And then he's also pressing for the opening of the Rafah gate by Egypt and for Israel to allow in fuel, to allow in water, to allow in food. On an average day, Gaza is on the brink, even before this crisis, it barely has enough in resources barely has enough in medicine barely has enough in food. I spent a week in Gaza several years ago. And it's a place that feels like it's going to collapse, even when it's not in the middle of a crisis like this.So, Antony Blinken is also worried about those things and trying to get Israel to allow that type of humanitarian support to care for the civilians. Ultimately, we need to make sure that we do some protection for the civilians, because if you injure and harm civilians, if you put them in a humanitarian crisis, and if you put them in a human rights violations type situation, you're only going to promote the cycle of violence. You're going to have a new generation of Gazans who feel like they've been betrayed not only by Hamas, but also by Israel.",

A 199 hostages inside Gaza, how will that complicate or shape what seems to be an impending ground operation? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, it certainly it will complicated things. But more importantly, will shape how the Israelis decide to fight. Obviously, if they go into hard, there's a very, very strong risk that Hamas will kill the (inaudible), which is tough thing to say.
