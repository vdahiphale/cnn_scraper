He said that he's spoken to America's key allies to ensure that they are coordinated in their response. Also saying that it is very important that we are all aware that even if Moscow tries to blame the West for the events over the weekend, that the U.S. is reiterating they, of course, had nothing to do with the attempted insurrection by Yevgeny Prigozhin. Of course, that is straight out of Moscow's playbook to blame the United States. He said that he also spoke to President Zelensky and reiterated that, listen, regardless of what happens in Russia, the U.S. will continue to fully support Ukraine. All right, we are also following breaking news this hour about the events over the weekend. Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin released an audio tape in the past hour outlining the two factors, he says, led to his troops turning around some 125 miles from Moscow. He says, first, his mercenary group wanted to avoid Russian bloodshed. Second, he says, the march was just a protest and not a move to overturn power in the country. As the dust settles after that very short-lived insurrection, a number of questions are still swirling around this weekend's extraordinary events. Among them, what exactly will be President Vladimir Putin's next move? The Kremlin has released a prerecorded video of Mr. Putin that does not reference the rebellion at all, but experts say that the revolt was pretty much the most serious challenge to his authority in his 23-year rule. For now, Moscow remains quiet, with the mayor saying all security restrictions have been lifted. But observers warn the rare uprising could certainly have consequences down the line.

They demonstrate that they are, you know, arguably one of the most capable combat forces. Send them back into Ukraine, send them into the thick of the fight where many of them will die, given that's how Russia has waged this war to date. And many of them dying wouldn't be a bad thing for Putin or of military perspective because it would solve the problem of many pretty, potentially disgruntled fighters. So, I would expect to see them sent back to Ukraine into potentially the most dangerous places. And this is how Putin's dealt with separatists back in 2014 and 2015 in the Donetsk and Luhansk, how he dealt with some of those fighters.",

If you go back, Prigozhin's, right, his call out was really to relieve some of the military leadership. It wasn't so much of a direct attack on Putin as it was really to relieve some of those militaries who had demonstrated, I mean, he wasn't wrong on that, right? This has been a massive blunder by the military. It's surprising that Putin has actually not relieved some of those military leaders that have hollowed out his military after two years of corruption. And so, but even if Putin does change some of the leaders, I mean, the entire military regime is corrupt. And he's just going to replace one bad leader with another bad leader.

Sierra Leone's main opposition Presidential Candidate Samura Kamara saysthe headquarters of his party was riddled with gunfire in Freetown on Sunday, one day after national elections. Reports say one woman was badly injured, and there are reports that she later died. Sierra Leone is on edge as it awaits the results of Saturday's presidential elections and parliamentary vote. Greek Prime Minister -- the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has won a second four-year term, defeating his main rival by a huge margin. With nearly 100 percent of the votes counted, his center-right New Democracy Party received more than 40 percent of the vote. The main opposition, the leftist Syriza Party, received some 17 percent. Millions -- also, millions of Muslims are converging on Mecca for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. This is the first year since 2019 without COVID-19 restrictions. More than two million worshippers are expected. It is one of the five pillars of Islam. All able-bodied Muslims are required to make the trip at least once in their lifetimes. All right, back to breaking news. At this hour, not a single soldier on the ground was killed. We're finally hearing from the man at the center of a short-lived revolt in Russia. Wagner Chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, released an audio tape in the past hour outlining the two factors he says led to his troops turning around some 125 miles from Moscow. He says first, his mercenary group wanted to avoid Russian bloodshed. Second, he says the march was just a protest, and not actually, in his words, a move to overturn power in the country. Earlier, the Kremlin had said Prigozhin agreed to a deal to end the uprising and leave Russia for Belarus. Here's a translation of Yevgeny Prigozhin's audio tape. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over): At this time, Alexander Lukashenko extended his hand and offered to find solutions for the further work of Wagner PMC and the legal jurisdiction. The columns turned back and left for the field camps. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, that is still unclear. And this 11-minute audio message, it's unclearprecisely when that was recorded or clearly after he struck a deal, it seems, to leave for Belarus or where Prigozhin was when he recorded it. Now, that may be a side issue because I think the major thrust of it appears to be a bid to try and claw back some of the mess that Prigozhin has made over the weekend, being very clear that his march on Moscow was a protest action about the misconduct of the Russian top brass, how catastrophically they prosecuted Putin's invasion of Ukraine and not directly aimed at removing Putin himself. Remarkable, I think, that Prigozhin could have misread the situation quite so badly, particularly given the strident statement that we heard from Vladimir Putin about how he and those marching with him should face inevitable punishment. It seems that the Kremlin has washed away that statement from Putin and is willing to allow Prigozhin to leave. But he also paints a picture of a Wagner PMC that says it can possibly find a way forward in Belarus, that maybe it may find a legal way through the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, permitting them to continue to exist there. But also, a Wagner which said that it had essentially been asked to disband itself by the end of the month and that only one or two percent of its fighters are willing to join the Russian Ministry of Defense because the rest of them realized how catastrophic that would be for their ability to fight on the battlefield. Essentially, the core of this message was to say, I was not looking to necessarily confront Russian President Vladimir Putin even though that's overtly clearly what ended up happening on Saturday, and also suggesting that Wagner were acting to keep itself functioning and may continue to do so in the future. But still again, over 11 minutes to remind the Russian people listening to this message that it's the conduct of Russia's top brass, Putin's generals that he has really launched this to try and confront. So, he's alive. He's looking to possibly calm things down with the Kremlin head. He may be in Belarus or certainly thinks his organization may have a future there, but startling to see him march on Moscow, retreat, maybe we don't know the full story about why he chose to do that. Putin threatened him and his men with punishment, turned that idea around and now appear to offer amnesty and still Vladimir Putin functioning out of public view at this time, re-releasing pre-recorded statements. So, a lot of questions still circulating, and I think a view here that only gives us about 60, 70 percent of the full story.",

A former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine suggests this may be the beginning of the end of the most dramatic challenge to Putin's 23-year rule. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN E. HERBST, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: This is not a 24-hour blip.

But just in terms of how his leadership style changes, I mean, you think about how Putin normally responds to humiliation, to opposition, to any kind of dissent. I mean, I imagine that he's going to have a tighter grip on power or attempt to have a much tighter grip on power and on information out of Russia at this point in time.

The biggest threat to his power right now is in fact, Prigozhin, right, and so -- andof course, the precedent set by Prigozhin and by acting with both acting politically and using force visibly to Russians. Putin has had a monopoly on political action and of course a monopoly on violence for more than 23 years, right. So, one way for Putin to handle this would be to bring Prigozhin back into the fold. Prigozhin never wanted to leave the fold. Prigozhin, it should be noted, never meant to stage a coup. He was going, he was marching on Moscow in order to talk to Putin, in order to get Putin better informed, in order to restore justice as he sees it. So, the option is open for Putin to bring Prigozhin closer in, and this has generally been Putin's MO, is to keep his friends close and his enemies closer within the elite circles. Nobody leaves that Maatia family alive. In order to do that, he would have to get some contrition out of Prigozhin. He would basically have to get Prigozhin to go and say that he went a little overboard, but his conflict was only with Shoigu, the Minister of Defense, not with Putin. But if Putin did that, he would become essentially hostage to Prigozhin. So, he is a bit stuck there. I mean, I think in the immediate future, he is going to try to crack down on information even further in Russia. Information is already hugely restricted. But that's really not his biggest problem, not.",

Moscow was clearly gearing up for the Battle of Moscow. So, I think that's what Putin found most alarming. It's an interesting question, you know, why Ministry of Defense troops didn't put up much of a fight against Prigozhin. It appears that they hit it from the air -- hit Prigozhin's troops from the air a few times, although we don't know this for sure. But there was no resistance on the ground. And one possibility is not so much that they were scared or passive as that Prigozhin is perceived as being so well connected to Putin, as being -- as having his ear that going up against Prigozhin may not be the best thing for any given general or especially colonel, right? So -- so I don't know, first of all, how much Putin knows, and second of all, what kind of conclusions he can draw.

MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, so those recovery operations are continuing. The submersible isn't able to lift heavy parts of the Titan, but it may be able to bring up some of it. And then they have other gear out there that, if they want to bring up larger pieces of the Titan, they probably can. But it's going to be a very, very difficult process at those depths and with those pressures down there. This is the investigations are underway. Six different investigations or inquiries by four different countries. The TSB, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, is really kind of taking the lead right now. The Polar Prince, this was the ship that took the Titan out to the wreckage of the Titanic. It was docked up across the harbor at a Coast Guard dock for the weekend where the TSB got in, spoke to people, took data, voice recordings, video, any sort of evidence they wanted. It also documented everything on the Polar Prince, as well. But the U.S. Coast Guard now has announced an investigation, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. The British and French Maritime Safety Boards will investigate. And then the RCMP, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, say, sort of the national police force here says that if there's an indication of criminal wrongdoing, that it will then launch its own investigation, as well.
