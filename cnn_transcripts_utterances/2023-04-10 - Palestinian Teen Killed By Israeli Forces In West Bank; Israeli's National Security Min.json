Leaked Pentagon documents reveal U.S. intelligence secrets. A deadly Easter Sunday attack in Zaporizhzhia. And later this hour, 2 John Rahm takes the Masters by storm. We begin with more on a Palestinian teenager shot and killed by Israeli forces. That is according to Palestinian health officials. Israeli military confirms they were operating in one refugee camp in the occupied West Bank earlier and say they opened fire after they were targeted with Molotov cocktails. This is footage of that rate obtained by CNN. Well, Salma Abdelaziz is standing by in Jerusalem for you. And CNN's Scott McLean is standing by in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. Selma, let me start with you. A relatively quiet weekend given the recent violence but the death of a Palestinian teenager and the mother of British Israeli sisters killed in a West Bank shooting has also died of injuries. What are the details as we understand?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Let's go straight to the West Bank, Becky, where there seem to be events taking place today. You had --earlier this morning, Israeli police saying that they raided a Palestinian refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. They say that -- Israeli police say the Israeli military says it raided that camp because they were seeking to arrest a terror suspect. The Israeli military says during the course of that raid, that Molotov cocktails, explosive devices were thrown out their soldiers and that they responded with fire separately. The Palestinian health ministry said that a 15-year-old boy was injured in those -- rather killed in those clashes and several others injured. Those clashes happening almost at the same time that very close by also in the occupied West Bank. Thousands of settlers were gathered at an illegal outpost. An illegal outpost again in the occupied West Bank that they want to see legalized. In that group, those thousands of settlers were emboldened really by what is now under Prime Minister Netanyahu, the most far-right government that this in Israeli history. And they were also emboldened, Becky, by the people that stood in their ranks. But the people that joined that rally, members of Prime Minister Netanyahu's government including, of course, the far-right National Security Minister, Ben-Gvir. A man who is extremely controversial to some absolutely inflammatory. A man who was convicted of supporting terrorism. He was among the crowd of those thousands of settlers, obviously supporting their calls for that illegal outpost to be legalized. And all of this, of course, in the wider context of what's been taking place over the last several days. These escalating tensions, this mounting violence and of course, rhetoric like this, feeds and fuels the fire of this conflict lately. And of course, I also have to mention two separate incidences, two separate funerals rather taking place in the West Bank, as well. One for a Palestinian man that was killed. Israeli -- the Israeli military says that he was shot during an incident in the West Bank after they were fired upon. Also separately, you mentioned the funeral for that mother -- for the two sisters, their mother now declared dead as well. Again, so much at play here. And all of these factors continue to feed, continue to fuel this escalating violence, Becky.",

Slow drip of this awful news, frankly, for Ukrainians, tragically commonplace. And I think there's a lot of focus now, certainly here about the impact of the leaks, you were just talking to Natasha about a lot of which details specifics about Ukraine's capabilities ahead of a counter offensive, which has been long anticipated. Essentially, a fulcrum moment really for this conflict in which Western backers I'm sure would want to see Kyiv make significant gains against Russia. And so, there is -- I think it's fair to say with all the focus around Bakhmut and parts of the East alone on other parts of the front lines. Outside of those awful attacks on civilians that we have indeed continued to see hitting residential blocks. Increasing anticipation though as to when this counter offensive may indeed begin. And the significant drop of this leak of documents. How authentic they are, quite how long they've been available. Still things that have yet to be entirely clarify. But certainly, provoking a very full throated, very vocal, rare, frankly, open statements of alarm from U.S. officials about how important they necessarily are. Now they show as Natasha said exactly how much U.S. knows about Russians own capabilities, Russia's own conversations amongst its more confidential circles. That's bound to cause great consternation, certainly in Moscow, who will have known that the U.S. can eavesdrop on them at will to some degree but maybe not the extent of information that the team seems to casually hear to have found leaked at some point. So, Ukrainian officials today clear that some of their plans may have been tweaked because of this leak, suggesting again that Russian officials have reposted some of these documents, now doctored and changed to tweak the information they're in. Increasingly confusing, frankly, to understand how these may indeed have emerged. It doesn't seem to be a Russian intelligence operation. Why would you post them online? U.S. officials, they say, very forthright in saying how damaging they are which to some degree is odd. You might expect them to play them down or say they were sophisticated fakes. Quite the opposite is the signal indeed we're having. So, a lot of anticipation heightened by them by what they say Ukraine can and cannot do. The timings potentially of how long Ukraine's air defenses may be able to last out. All of this feeding in to a climate here of real concerns as to when this offensive may begin or whether or not this leak will change is potential outcome for those hearing Kyiv. Becky?",

We are on the ground working our sources and as we get more on this story, of course. We will get it to you directly. Do stay with us for that. Artificial intelligence has been top of the global agenda this year. Sparking discussions ranging from education to health to art. Let's take a quick look at some of its most notable strides in 2022. I want to do a deep dive on this. Deep fake technology. So, a jaw dropping leap forward, yet eerie leap forward. It has to be said with a number of photos like this one depicting a rather swagged out Pope. It also reached new heights in the world of art after an image generated by the system mid-journey scored first place in a Colorado State Fair fine arts competition. It proved to be quite a lab assistant after successfully training a reinforcement learning agent to control nuclear fusion, plasma and innate brain twisting development. Nvidia used A.I. systems to prove its latest GPU chips. An essential element to training and testing A.I. systems. In the heat of all of this, rapid development. The other side of the coin is starting to flip questions on ethics, on bias and dangers of A.I. are being raised. Concerns reaching a boiling point. Tech leaders like Bill Gates, Elon Musk are calling for a pause in the out of control, in their words not mine. A.I. race. Well, Eric Xing, president of the Mohammed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence joins me now live here in our studio. Decked out with A.I. generated art, Eric. I hope you are enjoying what you see around you. Let's start with this recent letter calling for a pause in A.I. development. Some of the biggest names in tech are calling for A.I. labs to stop their -- the training of powerful systems for at least six months. They are citing profound risks to society and humanity.

And you think, Becky, that John Rahm four-putted and double bogeyed his very first hole of the tournament.And then when it's all said and done, he ran away with the Masters winning by four strokes. And he's now one of only seven guys ever to win both the U.S. Open and the Masters before turning 30 years old. And Becky, believe it or not. He's the first European player -- born player ever to win both the Masters and U.S. Open. He couldn't even believe that stat. So, we'll be hearing a lot from John Rahm coming up here on World Sport about his big win and we'll head back to Augusta and wrap up the entire tournament. That was quite the wild one between the weather and what we saw from Rahm and Brooks Koepka and Tiger Woods having to withdraw is certainly was eventful.",

And he saidhe's plantar fasciitis and his foot started acting up but you could just tell the injuries that he suffered from that car accident still really make it hard for him to play a full round of golf. And considering the way the weather was, it was remarkable that he even made the cut -- and but going out there again on Sunday to play more than a full round of golf just didn't seem realistic. And he did end up pulling out. And when we see Tiger again now, that's also a big question.",
