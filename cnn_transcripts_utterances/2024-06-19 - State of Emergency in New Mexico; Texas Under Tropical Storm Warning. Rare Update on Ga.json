About 20,000 acres in all been burned. As you mentioned, 1,400 structures according to state officials here that have now been destroyed or damaged because of these fires. And more than 8,000 people have headed the evacuation warnings.And you can understand why. It's just so - you know, the - with the mountains and the trees, it's very difficult to kind of get a sense of where the fires are moving from, how quickly they're moving. So, just a very dangerous situation. And that is why, as we look around here, there is almost no one left here.

Right now you can see the waves crashing onto the beach and the water levels rising. Now, this is not unique to Corpus. The entire Texas Gulf Coast is expected to have some sort of coastal flooding. And that's exactly what we're seeing seen here in - in Corpus. Now, this street that I'm live on right now, you can see that it is flooded. You can see that the parking meters are pretty flooded right now. From talking to officials, I can tell you that they don't appear very concerned. Again, the Texas Gulf Coast is used to hurricanes. Let me show you the water levels here right now. You can see that it's about eight inches deep. And the water has ebbed and flowed. And look around me. Like, you can see that the water level stays pretty level all the way to the end of the street. Now, this street meets up to the highway. And you can see public works vehicles parked out there. We've seen them driving around. They are prepared to block roads if needed. Again, officials telling us that they are preparing for the worst. They always do. But, Sara, they also tell us that they have high water vehicles, boats, rescue equipment on the ready just in case, but they are not expecting to issue evacuation orders. Sara.",

It's because it's so disorganized and lop-sided, which is why it doesn't have the name Alberto yet. The hurricane hunters need to find that center of circulation, and it's just tough to do that right now. It doesn't mean, though, that you're not getting some of that heavy rain already on the coast there of Corpus Christi, down towards Brownsville. We've had some gusts up to about 30 miles per hour so far. Storm surge already observed, as we just saw in Rosa Flores' live shot, where you've got - this storm surge already up to two to three feet along the coast from Galveston.So, as this thing continues to move inland, you can see where you have the tropical storm warnings going up into Texas. The classic example of impacts outside of the cone, right? And like I said, the storm is wide. It's got a lot of moisture with it. So that will continue to sling on. Some of the showers and thunderstorms as we go through the day today and into tomorrow and could dump some heavy rain. We're looking at some widespread four to six inch totals of rain possible, some up to ten inches possible. Plus, we're also watching the heat. Eighty-two percent of the lower 48, that's 260 million people, will have temperatures above 90 degrees as we go through the next couple of days, in an area that's not quite as used to extreme heat. I mean we're talking about the Midwest and New England. More than 150 temperature records, both daytime highs and overnight lows can fall. Exactly - especially today, 96 degrees would be the hottest temperature ever in Caribou, Maine. And we could hit that today. Parts of the state have their excessive heat warnings for the first time ever. So, truly unprecedented in an area that just doesn't get as much extreme heat. John.",

Number one, the president actually introduced legislation on comprehensive immigration reform the first day in office. And unfortunately, the Republicans walked away from what would have been one of the most consequential and far-reaching pieces of legislation that we've seen in a very long time. So, I think the president was motivated by two things. Number one, theneed to do something at the border and if - and to solve the problem. And if Republicans aren't going to join him, what can he do by executive action. That's why you saw him announce those actions, you know, a couple weeks ago about the border. And at that time he said, we are going to do some other measures to make sure that our system is humane. And by that I - this is exactly what this measure is meant to do, to say, let's keep families together, because previously, you know, someone would have had to leave the country and then tried to come back in to be with their family - with their spouse and their children. This is going to affect about 500,000 families in this country. And so I think this is the right kind of approach. And polling shows us this is actually what the American people want.

I 100 percent support legal immigration to the United States of America. But this announcement yesterday is rewarding undocumented immigrants who are in the United States. So, if he's looking at polling, he's misreading the polling because the number two issue on the minds of the American people is immigration. And it's because of the border situation.
