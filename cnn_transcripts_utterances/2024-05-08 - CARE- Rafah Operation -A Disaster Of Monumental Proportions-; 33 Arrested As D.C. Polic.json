But it is not clear if aid will flow because we have not heard of any update about drugs, slash, aid coming in from Kerem Shalom. Even if that happens regardless, the lifeline is Rafah. Because the scale at which drugs and medical aid and humanitarian aid is needed, we need an opening like Rafah. And then there are several other crossings. The northern part of Gaza is on the brink of famine. People are dying due to starvation, dying as we are speaking. Kids are dying. New ones get to die. I have heard a lot of stories about when a child was born and then died before any registration could be done, as if the baby never, ever existed. In the north of Gaza, there's a crossing called Erez, which means we have the possibility of bringing it into Gaza to save lives through the Kerem crossing but that is blocked. Open the border crossings. Let the aid in. Don't kill humanitarian workers, protect civilians, and civilian infrastructure, and release the hostages.",

But clearly something changed leading to that dramatic scene overnight, 33 people arrested, and some facing charges for trespassing, others for assault on police officers. Police using tear gas on -- some pepper spray, I should say, on some of those protesters not far from where were standing. And if you look back there, you can see the yard where there were dozens of tents over the past couple of weeks. Now, entirely gone. So you ask what changed. What we heard from D.C.'s police chief, a little earlier today, who laid that out, and said that she believed the protests had become too volatile to continue. She gave a couple of examples, saying that a campus police officer had been allegedly assaulted in recent days and that protesters in the camp had been gathering items that could be used as weapons, although the police department hasn't clarified exactly what those items were. And I should say, and that protesters were occupying, were found inside one of the campus buildings, multiple of them, and potentially probing to occupy one of the spaces. Similar to what we saw at Columbia up in New York. And so all of that led the police department to make this decision, as far back as Monday, that they were going to clear this camp. But of course, so much frustration from these students who have been involved in these protests. Take a listen to what one told me a little bit earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It can resolve, even on its own. But more typically, what happens is you're given certain medications to try and address the atrial fibrillation. But to also reduce the chance that you're going to develop blood clots, which are often associated with AFib. And those blood clots are really what can lead to problems like stroke. Another thing that can happen, especially if someone is hospitalized, is they can do something known as cardioversion. Well, essentially, it's placing a little bit of electrical shock on the heart to try and take the heart rhythm out of atrial fibrillation. So any of those things are possible. It is possible that it resolved on its own. More likely that he took medications that maybe helped resolve, may still be on those medications.
