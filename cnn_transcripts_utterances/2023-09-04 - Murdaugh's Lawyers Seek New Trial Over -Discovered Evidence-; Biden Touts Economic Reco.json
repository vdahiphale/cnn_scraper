Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:40:55] JIMENEZ: President Biden, spending part of this Labor Day in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. He praised union workers, defended his handling of the economy and slammed former President Trump's record. But even with unemployment at historic lows, a healthy stock market and falling inflation, the President is having a tough time selling his Bidenomics. A new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll out today shows just 37 percent of those that responded approve of Biden's handling of the economy. Nearly six in 10 disapproved. So let's get to CNN senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche. Look, he took shots at Donald Trump's economic record today. What did he say here?",

And contrasting that with President Trump and saying he's only one of two presidents in history to lose jobs in office.But he also is borrowing a page from Trump's playbook and trying to drill down on one critical concern of this constituency that is union workers who feel that their jobs have been shipped overseas.

Prescription rates for the medicines are at record highs, up more than 45 percent in the U.S. over the last decade. A CDC study this year found an especially large jump in prescriptions for adults in the first year of the pandemic. Also complicating the picture, drugs like Adderall are stimulants -- control substances the government says have a high potential for abuse. So the Drug Enforcement Administration sets limits on how much can be produced. But in a joint letter with the FDA last month, the DEA said manufacturers aren't producing as much as they're allowed to. Last year, they said there were about one billion more doses that they could have produced but did not, and said data for 2023, so far, show a similar trend. For some, the shortage could mean dashed dreams. NG: A lot of young people that I've seen have just given up. That they've either just felt that, you know, it's too difficult. Maybe I shouldn't go to college or maybe I shouldn't have this job. TIRRELL (voice-over): Despite those worries, Clara is looking forward to school, planning on majoring in electrical engineering.

Only two got back to us and said they were making as much as the DEA allows them to. So there is still a lot of lack of clarity and what is going on in the market here. But you know the FDA and the DEA are trying to do more about this. The FDA just approved some generic versions of Vyvanse, which is another ADHD medication. And you know, hearing from patients who are dealing with this shortage, they say you can find it, but it often takes calling a lot of different pharmacies or talking with your doctor about treatment alternatives.
