      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Russia destroys more of Ukraine's powerplants, and CNN gets exclusive access to the aftermath of the bombardment. And while Putin accuses the West of playing a, quote, \"dangerous, bloody and dirty game\". Then big economic indicators out today. A strong U.S. GDP tells one story, consumer spending, though, might tell another. And then later, Prince Harry's book released set for January. What you can expect to read in the royal's memoir. But first, tonight, Russia is stepping up its aerial assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Moscow is determined to deprive the country of light, heat, as well as water, as Winter approaches. Ukraine's energy agency says a wave of Russian missile and drone attacks overnight destroyed more of its already damaged power plants, including the main network of the grid in central regions. The agency says they have to implement severe as well as unprecedented emergency power cuts in Kyiv to avoid a complete blackout. The U.N. humanitarian office warns the continuing attacks will deepen the civilian suffering especially for people along those front lines who have been traumatized already by relentless shelling and whose homes have been destroyed. The question of getting the damaged power stations repaired is a tricky one, of course. Our Nic Robertson brings us an exclusive look at a plant which was targeted twice by Russia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (on camera):  This is where power plant officials say one of two drones slammed into the ground. It was the same day the plant was hit by a cruise missile as well. The drone, they say, got tangled up in the high voltage cables up here, ripping equipment apart all on the ground here, all around the entire cables. And over here, burnt out equipment, and the problem officials say is that, this part of the site was the most sensitive part, they point that it's the easiest to take the whole system down. The plant now completely offline. And the other problem is that, some of this equipment here is very hard to replace. It's scarce. Some of it is not even made anymore. What they're saying they're doing is turning to other power plants across the country to scavenge useful items, repair work is going on all the time. But for many of the engineers here, part of their days are spent underground in bunkers because you still get a lot of air raid sirens alerts. This is still a target, and they're worried about it. Already, some of the easier to repair parts of the plant have been put back together. New concrete columns here. The cruise missile landed right here, taking them out. But it raises the big question for the government now, can they repair at a faster rate than Russia is destroying? Thirty to 40 percent of the country's electricity generating capacity is down. The public have been told to expect blackouts. They've been told to keep their phones and power banks charged, not to use high energy appliances in their homes, particularly during peak hours in the evening. It is a real problem facing the government. A real pressure point that President Putin is putting on them right now. Nic Robertson, CNN, at a power-generating plant in Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What we're seeing from Putin in this speech and, you know, his spokespeople as well, we're seeing this mirror- imaging thing where the Russians will do something, and then accuse the West of having already done it. So, in this case, you count Vladimir Putin for example saying Ukraine is no longer a sovereign nation. Well, Russia cares a great deal about sovereignty, as do most nations. And the only people attacking Ukrainian sovereignty at this point are the Russians, who invaded with the intent of making the entire country part of Russia, robbing them of their sovereignty.

He remembers that, and what he's trying to do now is try to walk that fine line between telling the Russians, look, this is an extremely important thing, any illusion to World War II, which he did quite a bit in this speech, is basically sort of -- it's a symbol to the Russians that we all have to, you know, hunker down and you know, have some sacrifices to include perhaps even our sons.

So this GDP report today, Isa, suggesting that in the third quarter, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent. That was stronger than expectations. There were a few things that really drove that growth for the U.S. economy, net exports, Isa, there were still strong demand overseas for U.S.-made goods and services. Imports, however, fell. Americans did not buy things, physical things from outside of the country. Government spending at every level, federal, state, local, was also strong. And consumer spending, while still positive, slowed. Also on things like services, not physical goods. And this is part of the reason why economists who not paying as much attention to the top line number, but looking at the details say maybe this suggests we're not in a recession right now.

To help combat the problem, scientists in Abu Dhabi have found a way to reduce the waste. They are getting help from some tiny players, take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): As you can see here, we have a couple of trays, where the insects start to eat the fermented food we prepared for them. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): A local Abu Dhabi start-up is banking on these little critters to fix the UAE's growing food waste problem. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): We are company that tries to use the most natural way to transform organic waste that we have in the environment into something that is useful and efficient. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): It is an initiative contributing to a circular economy, a sustainable process that puts raw materials back into the economy. With the help of these insects, the company upcycles food waste to produce fertilizer, larvae (ph) oil and livestock feed. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): It is a ferocious eater. It's able to consume 500 times of its body weight and grow in a matter of 10 days. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): These ferocious eaters are black soldier fly larvae. Eating through mounds of wasted food. They are farmed in this small lab at this start-up accelerator. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): When we harvest these insects, what we get is high quality protein which can be incorporated in your chicken feed, fish feed and so on. If we were to go for a further step to roast the insects and then put them in an oil grinder, what we can get is oil from them, which can be a supplement as well for the animal feed. Last of all, the excretion of the insects are very high quality fertilizers, which can be used for plants. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): In wealthy countries, like the UAE, one of the richest nations in the world, food waste is a major contributor to the climate crisis. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): So currently the food waste is being thrown into landfills. When we do that to the landfills, we create a lot of greenhouse gases when the food decomposes. What we hope to do is reduce the waste and transform it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Inaugurated as Abu Dhabi's first waste to feed program, Circle Biotech Circular (ph) company aligns with the goals of the UAE government. Abu Dhabi is investing more than $2.5 billion to boost growth and innovation in manufacturing sectors. This help support circular economy initiatives. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): We have all these valuable resources put back into the economy. (MUSIC PLAYING) (END VIDEOTAPE)",
