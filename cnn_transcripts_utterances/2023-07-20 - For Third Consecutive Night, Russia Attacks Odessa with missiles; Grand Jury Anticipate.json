I can't overstate the terror that the citizens of this city have had to experience over not one, but the last three nights, and it is no mistake that Odessa is home to Ukraine's most famous port.I want to show you some of the destruction from last night. This is an administrative building. It looks like it was around four stories high. You can see it has completely collapsed. We are told this is still a search and rescue operation. We know that at least one young man was killed. There were several people who were injured. You can see those firefighters trying to put out the fires in this building, both in -- from among the rubble and up on that ladder up there. There are firefighters, there are rescue workers, there are volunteers, and residents of this neighborhood who are just trying to make sense of what we experienced last night. We are on the edge of the port. The -- one of -- the biggest port in Ukraine, which we can't show you for security reasons. But that is almost certainly why, according to Ukraine authorities, Russia has been carrying out strikes on Ukraine. Now, this attack started just before 2:00 a.m. local time. It was a combination of drones and missiles. We could hear those drones very clearly buzzing the rooftops in downtown Odessa. I want to play you some of the video that -- sorry, we're just going to get out of the way of this water. I want to play you some of the video shot by photojournalist, Scott Mc Kiernan (ph), of one of the explosions of the missiles here in Odessa last night. Take a listen. That is the kind of thing that we heard for an hour and a half. Now, it was not just Odessa that was hit, it was also Mykolaiv, which is another southern port city. There, 19 people were wounded. This was an incredibly sophisticated attack. Almost 40 drones and missiles. Most of the missiles got through. Russia used long-range strategic bombers, supersonic bombers, they used four different kinds of cruise missiles, they used those Iranian kamikaze drones. Just the symbolism of what they used is sending a very large message to Ukraine. President Zelenskyy has said, it is very clearly Russia trying to target the grain infrastructure just a few days after Russia pulled out of that critical grain deal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you.Well also today, a federal grand jury is set to meet as another potential indictment looms over Donald Trump. The panel in D.C. will be hearing more testimony from Special Counsel Jack Smith's witnesses as they prepare to decide if Trump will face criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Today, is also the deadline for Trump's lawyers to tell Jack Smith if they want to offer any of their own witnesses, including, potentially, Trump himself. Now, we're now learning Trump quietly hired another attorney to beef up his defense teams on the case. And sources are telling CNN that the former president's lawyers have been scrambling to find out if the special counsel has more witnesses, more evidence, that they don't know about.

You need all 12 to convict. In a grand jury, you'll only need a bare majority of 12. And the biggest difference is at trial, the proof burden that prosecutors have to prove is beyond a reasonable doubt, that's the highest legal standard in our system. At grand jury, it's just probable cause. A much lower standard. The other thing of course at a trial jury, there is a defense lawyer. Grand jury is just prosecutors, witnesses and grand jurors.

So, you would not move the case into federal court.And he went beyond that though because he pointed to some of the defenses that Trump wants to one. One is that, even though this is a case where he's charged with falsifying business records, it -- you know, the theory is that he was doing this to commit or conceal another crime. And one of those crimes could be influence in the election, the 2016 election. And the judge is saying, there's no federal preemption here by the federal election law because this is a narrow -- you know, you have -- there's a narrow exception there if you're going to try to do that. In this case, all that they have to prove to convict Trump is that he falsified these records with the intent to commit or steal another crime. They don't have to prove what that other crime is.

Jean Carroll had alleged that Trump raped her in a department store in the mid-19190s. And on the jury form, they were given a choice of rape or sexual abuse and the jury checked sexual abuse. So, Trump was saying, well, they didn't find I raped her. I should get a new trial. So, Judge Lewis Kaplan, in his filing he wrote, the finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was raped within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump raped her as many people commonly understand the word rape. Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that. So, really endorsing Carroll's argument here.
