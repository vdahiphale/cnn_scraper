Well, pushing forward, gaining ground, and hoping to change the dynamics of a deadlocked war. Ukrainian troops are advancing further inside Russia, more than a week after a brazen cross-border incursion took the Kremlin by surprise. Overnight, a security source says Kyiv conducted its biggest attack on Russian airfields since Moscow's full-scale invasion. And while the intent of the operation is still unclear, one Ukrainian official says the objective is to protect the country's border region and create a security zone on Russian soil. Meanwhile, a military commander tells CNN that Russia is now pulling soldiers from the Ukrainian frontlines to try and halt Kyiv's advanced in southwestern Kursk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, that a large number of Russian servicemen there have already surrendered. CNN cannot independently verify those claims. We'll get back to Ukraine in just a moment for more coverage. Well, ceasefire hostage talks will resume Thursday, but a key stakeholder will not be there. A diplomatic source tells CNN that Hamas will not take part in the talks. However, the source adds that the group is willing to speak to mediators if there are developments or a serious response from Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denies that he has added extra conditions to a May proposal that Hamas had supported. A key goal of a ceasefire hostage deal is to stop a wider war in the Middle East that could reduce tensions with Israel's neighbor, Lebanon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMOS HOCHSTEIN, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY: The deal would also help enable a diplomatic resolution here in Lebanon, and that would prevent an outbreak of a wider war and create the conditions for the displaced Lebanese people to return to their homes in the South and the displaced Israeli residents who return to their homes in their North.

First of all, North Carolina has been seen as a state that should be somewhat safe for Trump. The fact that he is going there, perhaps is a sign of how the race has tightened within the last few weeks. Perhaps more importantly, however, his campaign is billing this speech as major address on the economy. Republicans have been urging Trump to focus more on the economy and less on personal attacks and grievances. He followed that advice in a conversation with Spanish language network, Univision, on Tuesday.

Thank you. Well, Trump's economic speech comes in the wake of some very good economic news today. The consumer price index, a widely watched indicator of U.S. inflation, has cooled to less than three percent over the past year. Now, that is important because it is the lowest inflation rate since March of 2021. Economists say that should give the U.S. Federal Reserve room to lower interest rates at its next meeting in September. To help us understand the latest economic numbers and also look at their impact on the presidential race, we're joined by Justin Wolfers. He is a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. Another reason for you to smile this morning, Justin, is this positive report, for the first time inflation edging below three percent in several years, three years now. Looking through this report, specifically, the only problem spot, perhaps, if you're looking for one, is the cost of housing rose faster in July than it did in June. Other than that, nothing but positive numbers here. In terms of what we're expecting to hear from Donald Trump tomorrow about how bad the economy is, do you see any of that in this latest report?",

We entered the pandemic with inflation at about two point something percent. It's now round about two point something percent and it's continuing to decrease. And in terms of the stuff that really bites for many of our viewers, grocery store prices. Grocery store prices have been not moving, no inflation at all, neither up nor down over the past six months. It's giving a chance for people's wages and incomes to catch up. And people are starting to feel like they're getting ahead. And so if I were a political candidate who'd run a campaign on economic mismanagement, who hoped that fear of inflation would sustain me through to November, I'd realized that story is pretty much run out of puff.

We're expected to hear a little bit of that on Friday. And I'm just wondering from your perspective, you're not a political expert. But given the trajectory things are on, the \"Financial Times\" over the weekend actually had a poll suggesting more Americans trust Kamala Harris in handling the economy now.

She wants it, she knows how to call me.But I think what we're seeing is unprecedented, which is people are now saying that they trust Kamala Harris on the economy more than Donald Trump. Historically, people tend to say they would trust Republicans more than Democrats. I know a lot of Democrats were very frustrated by that who'd say that they do a pretty good job on the economy, but I guess people tend to think of Republicans as being the party of business, and maybe that's got something to do with the economy. But this time, Kamala, as a head, and one question is why? And given how that she's not currently in power, she is, after all, only vice president. And that she hasn't said that much. I think what's really happening is that people are listening to Donald Trump. Trump's economic policies, almost every single one of them, would boost inflation, adding tariffs, which are another form of tax to everything we buy. Reducing the competition on local retailers from China is going to lead them to jack up their margins. And that's going to hurt all of us. Or undermining the independence of the Fed and saying that President Trump, from the White House, should be setting interest rates. That gives no one confidence. And I think what's happening is all that Vice President Harris has to do is explain to the broader public what it is that Trump is saying inside his rallies.

Obviously, that has always been an independent body, and that is something that Kamala Harris has reiterated. Do you think there's any concern within the Fed now, perhaps, in terms of how they weigh in next month and if they decide on 25 basis points or half a percentage point in terms of rate cuts?
