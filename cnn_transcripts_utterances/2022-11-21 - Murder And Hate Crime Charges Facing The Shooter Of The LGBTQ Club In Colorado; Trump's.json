He served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he says that his training kicked in, his instincts kicked in. According to what he told \"The New York Times,\" he says that he charged towards the gunman, tackled him to the ground, and then beat him. I'm going to read you some quotes directly from Mr. Fierro, saying, quote, \"I don't know exactly what I did. I just went into combat mode. I just know I have to kill this guy before he kills us.\" Then they ask him, \"Was he shooting at the time? Was he about to shoot?\" Fierro responds, \"I don't know. I just knew I had to take him down.\" An act that now officials here say most likely saved countless lives. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

His actions definitely saved lives. For us, we got the response at about 12:01, is when we were dispatched and arrived on scene about six minutes later. Again, a good thing that fell into place was the police officer that was only three minutes away, that then was able to go in and handcuff the shooter, which opened the door for our units. As soon as they arrived on scene, which was at 12:09, they were able to immediately go in. So, that's something we're -- if the suspect isn't contained yet then we have to stage for a while until we get at least a cover of police officers to go in. So, that situation happening the way it did really helped us out. We were able to move in quickly.

You know, this actually brings into the conversation recasting the whole notion of run, hide, fight, right? People think of this as a continuum where, you know, you have to run first, then hide, then fight. But when you have nowhere else to go and you're in that moment, it is a fight for survival, and we saw individuals stand up and take these heroic acts, which did cause, you know, the suspect to stop engaging in the active killing and allowed the police to come in very rapidly, within six minutes. And as we just heard the chief say before, that act, those two individuals, by subduing that suspect, allowing law enforcement to come in, make the scene safe, they were able to actively get to those victims and save more lives.

And even if Trump is defeated for the nomination, that will be way past the point where Biden could decide not to run. So, while there were warning signs for Biden in the midterm election, two-thirds of voters in the exit polls said they hope he did not run again, that rose almost three-quarters of independents, he is on a track to do so. And by and large, as Jeremy noted, the results in the key states that decided the 2020 race, the five states that flipped from Trump in '16 to Biden in '20, were encouraging for Democrats, particularly against Trump, but also potentially against other Republicans, especially if they support restrictions on abortion.",

The one thing to take away here, though, is that as Ron just said, it's not clear what will happen in the nomination process. We're hearing from so many Republicans who are saying they want somebody different from former President Trump, but they're still very concerned that he could end up the nominee, particularly looking back at 2016 when there was such a large slate of candidates, which is what we are expecting this time around, that they essentially split the GOP electorate and pave the way for Donald Trump.

You know, the Republican rules for picking their presidential nominee are very different than the Democratic rules. The Republican rules are much more winner take all oriented and that benefits whoever has the biggest block of support in the party, even if that is less than a majority.You know, Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee in 2016 before he reached 50 percent of the vote in any state. And there is a real risk to the other candidates that given the solidity of his support particularly among non-college Republicans, that they will divvy up the college-educated Republicans who've always been much more resistant to him and get themselves into a situation like 2016 again. The other point I would make is I think Republicans are dismissing the evidence if they assume that the only problem, they have in 2024 is if Trump is on the ballot. What we saw in key swing states like Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, even Wisconsin and Georgia, was the Democratic support maintaining its 2020 and 2018 levels in those big populous white-collar suburbs of the big metros of Phoenix, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Detroit, even with a 9 percent inflation, with 401(k)s being hammered for many of the voters in those areas. The vision of America that they associate with the Trump-era Republican Party was simply(inaudible) for them.

      "sentences": "Thank you everybody for being here to cover this incredibly important event, just a horrific and sad and tragic event. Today, I just want to talk a little bit about some of the victims in this incident. You know, too often, society loses track of the victims of the sad and tragic events in all the talk about the suspect. We strive to give the victims the dignity and respect that they deserve as well as shine the light of public attention on the victims. Therefore, we are identifying them now.Please know that while all of the victims' families have been notified, they are suffering a horrific loss. So, I asked everyone who is listening to keep them in your thoughts and show them the care and heartfelt compassion that they deserve. None of the families want to do media interviews at this time and I ask everyone to respect their request. We respect all of our community members including our LGBTQ community. Therefore, we will be identifying the victims by how they identify themselves and how their families have loved and identified them. The first person I'll identify is Kelly Loving, Kelly's pronouns are she, her. Daniel Aston, Daniel's pronoun pronouns are he, him. Derrick Rump, Derrick's pronouns are he, him. Ashley Paugh, that's P-A-U-G-H, Ashley's pronouns are she, her. Raymund Green Vance, Raymond's pronouns are he, him. I wanted to ensure that every victim, family member and friends of victims and all of our community members know that our officers and detectives will continue to be diligent and thorough in our work to hold the suspects accountable for these horrendous acts. I also want to reiterate that the Colorado Springs Police Department and that I am standing beside you as we move through and come to a conclusion in the investigation and seek justice for all of our victims. As I end, I ask that everyone in our community and around the world, honor each victim lived. I want to take a moment of silence to honor those community members who lost a loved one. Please join me in a moment of silence. Thank you. I also want to identify the two heroes who intervened inside of Club Q. Their exact actions are part of the investigation, so we can't discuss the specifics out of respect for the judicial process. But with their permission, we want to acknowledge their heroic actions. They are Thomas James and Richard Fierro. Again, thank you for being here and covering this incredibly important event. And with that, I'd like to introduce Mayor John Suthers.",

Thank you for being here.As mayor of Colorado Springs, and frankly, on behalf of all the citizens of Colorado Springs, I want to again express our heartfelt condolences and unwavering support to the victims, their families, the LGBTQ plus community and everyone affected by this tragedy. I had the opportunity before I came here today to talk to Richard Fierro, identified as one of the two heroes that subdued the suspect in this case, and in my opinion I think the opinion of everyone involved saved a lot of lives. [17:45:06] I won't talk about, you know, the nature of what he told me about the incident. I will just simply talk about, I have never encountered a person who had engaged in such heroic actions that was so humble about it. He simply said to me, I was trying to protect my family. I would also like to thank our community, the whole Colorado Springs community and the whole Pikes Peak region for the outpouring of support they've shown, I can't tell you how many people have reached out from the city, our region and frankly, from across the country expressing their love and support for Colorado Springs, and the Club Q community. And speaking of the club Q community, we are joined here today by two co-owners of the club, Matthew Haynes, and Nick Gaysika (ph). Thank you for being here and thank you for the support you've shown and the cooperation you've shown in making sure that you help us reach out to the community and help us serve the ends of justice in this case. A lot of people are wanting to know how they can help. We know that the victims and their families need our immediate and long term support. And I want to talk -- tell you about the Colorado Healing Fund. That's a fund that's been in existence for some time. Actually, it was utilized during the Boulder tragedy where several people were killed in Boulder some time ago. It's set up to provide a secure way to donate to victims and family members in incidents such as this, and they are ready and able and they've already talked about appropriating money existing in the fund to the Club Q shooting victims. And what I want to emphasize the public is that if you choose to donate through the Colorado Healing Fund at coloradohealingfund.com, you can be absolutely assured the public -- your donations are going to the right place. Now for people needing support during this emotional time, the Colorado Springs Police Department is hosting a community resource expo to provide our community members with the help they need and navigating the variety of emotions they may be experiencing surrounding this event. That expo is being held at the University of Colorado Springs, Kevin O'Neill Cybersecurity and Research Center at 36050 North Nevada Avenue. It's open today until 7:00 p.m. and Tuesday and Wednesday from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. The expo is providing mental health resources, spiritual support, emotional support, animal support, child care, emergency financial resources, LGBTQ plus support, meals and other services. Basically, whatever any person adversely impacted by this incident, whatever their needs are, they can help in supporting their needs. The event is designed to be an inclusive and safe space for all community members to gather, grieve and obtain the support they need to cope during this difficult time. If you need this, and I'm speaking to the public, please take advantage of this resource. You can find details about both the Colorado Healing Fund and the community resource expo along with the other resources at coloradosprings.gov/clubq. I repeat that, coloradosprings.gov/clubq. Again, on behalf of the City of Colorado Springs, I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support. We all want to ensure that our community is not defined by this tragedy, but by our response to it. Thank you very much. Now I'll introduce Michael Allen, the District Attorney in the Fourth Judicial District.",

The red flag question is something that I think none of us up here are in a position to answer. But as it relates to the first part of your question, I want to talk about this in a way that hopefully makes sense to everybody.Colorado has very restrictive sealing laws. What that means is that if a case is filed in a courtroom in the state of Colorado and is dismissed for any reason, whether that is because the prosecution dismisses it or the court dismisses it, it is automatically sealed. That is a change in the law that occurred back in 2019. So only three years ago. That same statute requires us to give very specific answers to questions about cases that may or may not be under a seal order 4nder the scenario that I just gave you. That statute requires us to say, in response to questions about it, that no such record exists. So when you ask questions about specific prior instances, that will be our specific answer. But I wanted to give you a reason why that's the answer that we're giving. I acknowledged that it is very unsatisfying at this point. Hopefully, at some point in the near future, we can share more about that. But at this stage, that's the best we can give you. And that's going to be the same answer for everybody up here. It's really -- the design behind that is to protect persons that have been accused of crime and been charged, and then are -- the case is dismissed. The idea behind it is that that person shouldn't have to carry that charge around with them for the rest of their lives if there's no way to convict them of that charge. That's the design behind it. I know that's an unsatisfying answer, but that's the status of the law as it exists right now. If it changes to that specific thing that you're asking about, I'll be passing that information out. So, the mayor just brought up a good point and it relates to the Red Flag Law. The DA's office doesn't play a part in the Red Flag Law. That would be up to a law enforcement agency. And that's why I say nobody in this group can really answer that specific question. It has to be initiated by law enforcement or a member of the public, not by the DA's office.",
