Just seeing that plane, the light come through the darkness of the sky, landing the stairs, coming down, and then seeing finally those three Americans come out. I know that we are going to spend a lot of time talking aboutPresident Biden's role in all of this, as we already have been, and sort of the diplomatic push and the efforts that have gone into what culminated in what we saw tonight. But I really do think the story tonight is about Paul. It is about Evan. It is about Alsu, seeing them being able to greet their families that were standing on the tarmac was an incredibly emotional and powerful moment. Paul Whelan coming off the plane and hugging his sister, Elizabeth (ph), who has been waiting for some six years for this moment. Seeing Evan coming off that plane and hugging and lifting up his mom, actually, in a bear hug, and greeting his family and all of the Wall Street Journal journalists and employees who were here to greet him. And then of course, seeing Alsu, the family members that greeted her, her two daughters and her husband, really just let out a collective scream. And I know you were talking about this before, but I couldn't help but really keep a close eye on her daughter, Miriam (ph), who, just minutes ago, turned 13. So, now, as the president was saying at the White House earlier today, he had said now she gets to celebrate with her mom. And that's what this is all about. That is certainly now the case, now that Alsu has been united with members of her family, her two daughters especially. You cannot imagine the experience that they have been going through. Not to mention, of course, her husband. Now, just to reset for a second. I know we talked about this during the day, but where these three Americans are now headed soon is on another airplane to head to San Antonio, where they will go to a medical center to make sure that they can be properly examined and get all of the care that they are going to need in the coming days and weeks for what we certainly expect is going to be a long process of recovery, of rehabilitation, of processing everything that they had gone through. We do not know the full story, of course, of each of these three Americans and their stories and everything that they had been through. And that is certainly something that is just important to keep in mind. Just the process that is ahead for each of them. As joyous as this moment and this night was, the road ahead for them could be challenging again, as they sort of sort through and get the help that they need, given the sort of harsh and tough conditions we expect that they very much faced while they were in Russian detention, Laura, but I really will tell you, this is one of the most sort of joyous moments I have had the honor of covering as a reporter. Being able to see those Americans freed and stepping on U.S. soil. That was just an incredibly emotional moment. And we were so glad to have been able to witness it tonight.",

And we got to watch this historic moment, as they each stepped off the plane to see the president and the vice president.And then just those incredible moments with their families as they're reunited. In Paul Whelan's case, see him there coming down. He hasn't seen his sister in more than five and a half years. Our Samantha Waldenberg, our colleague, was actually in that press scrum as Evan Gershkovich walked over. And he simply said to his colleagues, I'm home, according to our producer there.

Trevor Reed said upon his release that he felt bad that Paul Whelan was still in captivity, and that he would continue to work for his release. So, we're so happy for all of these prisoners who were released today. But I'm thinking specifically of Paul Whelan, who's had such an arduous and horrific ordeal over the past almost six years. COATES: There were names being shouted out from some of the press about some who have been left behind as well. And there's been criticism of, or at least concern for those who still remain.",

And there was a pretty swift reaction from his family. I've got the statement here in front of me. And they said that for the second time in three years, Marc Fogle's detention in Russia, we are completely heartbroken and outraged that Marc has been left behind while the U.S. government brought other Americans home. So, they also expressed their well wishes to the Gershkovich and Whelan families.

They bring different skills and different strengths to an alliance, and that allows them to get things done that they couldn't do individually. We couldn't have done this. The United States couldn't have done this alone. President Biden recognized that the chancellor, the German chancellor,had a big decision to make, and he made that because of respect for the United States. He made that out of determination, that it was good for his country in the end to get those German citizens back. So, that was a difficult thing, but it drove the alliance.

Thank goodness, you know, couldn't have done it without Chancellor Scholz. So, in this big, messy, joyous moment on the tarmac, all disorganized, you didn't get a sense of ego there. I think that's the other thing that's going to be, it's going to temper what we hear from those released. There's going to be a certain amount of survivor's guilt that there are others like Marc Fogel still left behind, and they won't want to say too much for fear of hurting the cases of other folks still being detained. And I think you also saw that, that was the other bit of message control we saw from President Biden. He was given the opportunity to bash Vladimir Putin, and he did not, saying stop is something he said publicly before, but he didn't go any further, because there are still people they'd like to get out before the end of this presidency.",

And he said simply that my job is to first make sure that these kinds of detentions don't happen, but that second that when they do, he has to get them home.

And he gets back some people that might be of value to him, might not be, but that he definitely wants to make the point that we are the same because we're doing these swaps. And we're not the same.

I think we shouldn't get too obsessed about our own politics and think that everything in the world revolves around our election schedule or around American political conventions. This deal took a couple of years, and all deals like this, these kinds of swaps, they're incredibly intricate.This one especially so, because it wasn't just between the United States and Russia. It involved other countries. And you know, they operate on their own schedule, and they do things when they want to do things. And you know, I think the president made a good point that this is really about the value of alliances and convincing other countries to do things when you need them to come through. But the idea that somehow the Russians or anybody else kind of timed this to be where it was, I suspect this deal was going to happen sometime around now, no matter who was running for what because it made sense to the Russians. They got the pound of flesh they wanted, they got their people back, and at that point, it just made sense to get on with it and finish the deal.

And it's not necessarily obvious, I think, for a lot of Americans how this works. Certainly, the Central Intelligence Agency deploys case officers and people overseas to collect intelligence.But the other very important thing that CIA people do overseas is they do precisely this. They have liaison relationships, even with countries like Russia that we're essentially enemies with or adversaries with. And it's so that these types of arrangements can be done. The Russians always insist that it happen in intelligence channels when situations like this occurred, because they feel that it's the most secure and the most, basically, they're just most comfortable with doing it that way.
