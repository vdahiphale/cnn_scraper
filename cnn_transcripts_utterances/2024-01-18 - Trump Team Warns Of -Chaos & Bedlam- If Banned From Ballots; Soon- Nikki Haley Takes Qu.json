The man who told his supporters to fight on January 6 says if he doesn't get his way, all hell will break loose. Plus, our voters OUTFRONT series tonight, the voters Nikki Haley is depending on to carry her to victory, it is actually not who you think. Wait until you see this one. And as Prince William visits his wife in a hospital, we are learning more about Princess Kate's health, diet. So, why is the 42-year-old mother of three sidelined for months over a mysterious surgery? Let's go OUTFRONT And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: the breaking news, chaos, and bedlam. President Trump warning tonight that if the Supreme Court does not get him back on the ballot in Colorado, there will be -- and this is from the filing -- chaos and bedlam. That warning from Trump comes in a formal legal brief submitted to the Supreme Court just moments ago. Now, keep in mind this is the same Trump that lit the fire leading to the insurrection on January 6. And now, it's a message he's sending to his millions of supporters -- chaos and bedlam -- warning that efforts to keep him off state ballots, quote, promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado's lead and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots. Now, putting aside what you think about names coming off the ballot, the way that this is written is a chilling warning. And remember, it is not the first time Trump has said this. Here he is just last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Max Foster is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MAX FOSTER, CNN ROYAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Loved and admired, a royal health scare has caught the nation by surprise, when on Wednesday, Kensington palace shared that Catherine, the princess of Wales, needed medical treatment. It circulated questions about the condition of one of the most senior royals' health, who aside from having morning sickness during pregnancy, has never had any known health problems while she's been a royal. Now, she's forced to stay out of the public eye its up to three months until doctors give her the all clear. Last seen over Christmas with her family at Sandringham, the princess of Wales lives an active lifestyle, but having a regular royal schedule of engagements, some 120 last year and by being a hands-on mom, looking after her three children. She still finds time to enjoy the outdoors and keeping up her favorite hobbies like skiing and working out, all to keep the princess fit and healthy. Her relatability to the public has made her a role model amongst adoring fans, who might try to catch a glimpse of her at Wimbledon, but she's regularly seen every summer watching the games. A patron of the all-England lawn tennis club, the princess's interest in the sport extends beyond the annual championships. Known to enjoy cooking for the prince of Wales and her children, Catherine, has even been spotted stocking up at a British supermarket, showing that she doesn't like to rely on staff for shopping and trying to maintain a normal lifestyle. But now, all the appearances slow down, as Catherine recovers and with Prince William juggling child care at home. The couple have canceled all travel plans for the foreseeable future. With King Charles and two other senior royals taking a backseat, heads turn to Queen Camilla and other members of the family to step up as the public faces of the royal household, to reassure Britons that all is fine and it is business as usual.
