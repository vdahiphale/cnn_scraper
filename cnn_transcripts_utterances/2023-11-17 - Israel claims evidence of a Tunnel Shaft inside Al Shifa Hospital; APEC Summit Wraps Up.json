Now CNN can't immediately confirm the claims made in the video. Israel Defense Forces have faced mounting pressure to justify their raid on the hospital, which Israel says concealed the terror headquarters and tunnel network used by Hamas.But the IDF insists more evidence is coming and that it's carrying out a full -- careful operation that could take weeks. The army also released images of these weapons, it says, were found at the hospital complex. Hamas has repeatedly denied using Al Shifa as a command-and- control center, calling the claims from Israel and the U.S. fabricated narratives. Meanwhile, the Israeli army says troops recovered the body of 65-year- old Israeli grandmother near the hospital. She had been kidnapped during the Hamas rampage last month. No details were released on how she died. Prime Minister told CBS it's possible other hostages were also killed at Al Shifa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That requires, though, the U.N. to get some guarantees, and he says he is still waiting for those guarantees. He also says that nothing will happen quickly when it comes to an investigation because he's not going to put his people on the ground to investigate while the bombs are still falling.He has said that his staff are doing what they can to document what they can at this stage of the game, but obviously getting on the ground at some stage will be required if in fact they can get access. And he says that there is this need for an investigation because there are competing narratives. Narratives not only about why Israel, or how Israel is justifying its decision to go inside of Al Shifa hospital, but also even on the basic humanitarian situation. Case in point, the hospital director did an interview with Al Jazeera Arabic by phone and he says that there are still 5,000 people taking shelter in the hospital. There are hundreds of people who are wounded. There are dozens of premature babies, dialysis patients. The list goes on and he says that children are starving because of the lack of access to water to make milk or baby formula. It sounds like he meant. And the IDF though paints a very different picture. They say that they are supplying water, they are supplying food to people and they are also securing corridors so that people can actually leave. And when it comes to the military situation, you've had the Israelis on Wednesday releasing a video showing what they say is evidence that there are weapons stored inside of the hospital. Another video came out yesterday, they say that shows a tunnel shaft underneath, that leads underneath of the hospital as well. Hamas, though, has said that this is a ridiculous scenario that Israel is using to justify its war. It has plainly denied that there is any kind of command-and-control center underneath the hospital. The Israelis say that there is a sophisticated multi-level tunnel system underneath of the hospital, but they have yet to prove those allegations. And Hamas says that look, international organizations should come and investigate. And that is precisely what the U.N. Human Rights Chief, Volker Turk, is calling for as well. Listen.

You are already seeing countries in the Middle East strongly condemning this. One of the most outspoken has been the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who has cut off any communication with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He referred to Israel as a terrorist state and you've seen other countries follow suit. And regardless of what Israel actually does find at the Al Shifa hospital complex and whatever they claim to find, the Jordanians have described it quite well in saying that, look, you're going to be hard pressed to find anyone in this part of the world who is keen to believe the Israeli narrative.

MAO NING, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): This is extremely erroneous. It is an irresponsible political maneuver, which China firmly opposes. RIPLEY (voice-over): Beijing had a similar reply back in June when Biden called his Chinese counterpart a dictator at a California fundraiser. On the streets of Beijing this man seems to agree with Biden's description. UNKNOWN (through translator): One party system to be honest and open that is a dictatorship. RIPLEY (voice-over): Something he says keeps China stable putting a positive spin on Biden's definition of the word. Beijing's communist rulers have long argued stability makes their system superior to Western democracies. They never, ever use the word dictator. Neither does Chinese state media, ignoring Biden's controversial comment even as it made headlines around the world, instead focusing on President Xi's personal diplomacy with the U.S. president, like the moment they compared armored limousines. On China's heavily-censored social media, not a single mention of the outrage over Biden using the D word for the second time in six months.

RIPLEY: We know that China's Communist Party is obsessed with controlling the message and that is why every time that CNN reports this story, they've been going to color bars, cutting off CNN signal inside China. This is a video from one of my live reports earlier today. This is unsurprising considering how diplomats meticulously pored over every detail of this summit, not just the items on the agenda, but the small details like where Xi Jinping was sitting, what the flowers would look like, what the food would be for lunch, even the venue, a historic estate, as opposed to a drab meeting room. It seems that optics are everything, and that is why we need to watch very closely whether President Xi follows through on one more promise that he made to resume Panda diplomacy with the United States, new Panda loans after a 20-year pause.
