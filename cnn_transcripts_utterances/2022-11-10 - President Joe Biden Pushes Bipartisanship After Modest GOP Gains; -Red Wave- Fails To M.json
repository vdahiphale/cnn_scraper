Counting is still underway in a number of close races for both the Senate and lower House, which means we still do not know which party will control the next U.S. Congress. Republicans were expecting a huge red wave of support, easily taking control of the Senate and in the lower House picking up 30 or more seats. While the GOP is on track to win the House, the majority will be razor thin, and results from Senate races in three states are yet to be called, leaving Democrats holding 48 seats in the upper chamber Republicans 49. In Arizona, the incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly is leading Republican Blake Masters with hundreds of thousands of votes still to be counted. In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt is leading incumbent Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. State officials say final results may not come until next Thursday. And in Georgia, the race between incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker will not be known until next month. State rules require a runoff if no candidate gets at least 50 percent of the vote. Once again, Georgia will be the center of the political universe for the next four weeks and Republicans pulling out all the stops for Herschel Walker. Texas Senator Ted Cruz campaigning in Georgia in the day ahead. Votes can -- voters rather can already be cast, absentee ballots and early voting must begin by November 28th. Senator Warnock says the journey is not over. And there's still much more to do. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): Whether it's later tonight, or tomorrow, or four weeks from now, we will hear from the people of Georgia. HERSCHEL WALKER (R), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE FOR GEORGIA: If you can hang in, hang in there a little bit longer, just hang in there a little bit longer. Because something good, it takes a while for it to get better, and it's going to get better. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The president spoke laying out in detail in kind of calibrated approach or recognition. The Washington is about to be reshaped. Republicans are very likely to take the majority in the House and then voters are still largely not happy. There's still real problems, obviously with inflation that remains sky high and just a general discontent in the wake of the worst pandemic in more than a century.

There's a lot of pessimism and anger in the country.But independent voters behaved unexpectedly. Normally, you'd expect them to break against the party in power. And they sort of split and in some of the key Senate races actually backed the Democrats. And I think it's because Republicans have a Donald Trump problem. I think as long as key Republicans are associated with his brand, independents were willing to stick with Democrats because they liked Joe Biden just a little bit better than they liked Donald Trump, whose favorability ratings in our exit polls were quite low. The Republican candidates who did well are the ones who developed their own brand, Ron DeSantis. And Florida Governor Kemp in Georgia, Mike DeWine in Ohio, they were fine. But if your brand was really linked with Donald Trump, you got punished by independent voters and we got to deal with it now or face another rough go in 2024.",

And I think Scott may agree with some of these. One is the polling was off. And I think the polling was off because we begin to see posters oversample the number of Republicans that will participate in the process so that they could catch up to the wave of 2016, that's first. I think that the President of the United States actually knew something that we didn't pay attention to, which is that his closing message, the democracy was on the ballot was a very, very, very important message. And it actually hit the tenor and tone of many of the independent voters out there. The last thing is candidate quality really matters.

Right out of the gate in January, the United States is going to have to deal with raising its debt limit. And I suspect that group you reference is going to have some things they want in that.

They've had enough and so, if you were like Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who's really the Republican that had the best night, this is the time to strike. You've never been hotter and Trump's never been weaker. Trump was weak on January the sixth, and no Republican or group of Republicans had the courage to take advantage of the weakness in that moment. And he was able to refortify himself and fill that void.

The runoff here in Georgia will look different than it has in years past because of a 2021 law that cut the length of the runoff from nine weeks to four weeks. That's significant because anyone that wants to register that didn't vote in the midterm election that wants to vote in this runoff has already missed the deadline. There's no telling how that will impact the final outcome of this race, but it will no doubt have an impact. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the Secretary of State's office held a press conference during which they said by Wednesday afternoon there was about 10,000 ballots remaining but that number not significant enough to get either candidate over the threshold to avoid the runoff. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did say that the office is already making preparations for that runoff election on December 6th, prepping ballots to be sent out to counties for them to get signed off on by November 14th. Additionally, the absentee portal for anyone that wants to vote that way has been opened. Early voting could begin as early as November 26th.

And what we are seeing on the ground, according to Ukrainian officials, is that's already taking place. Ukrainian officials saying that Russian forces are pulling back from some of these villages that they are preparing to pull back even further to the East side of the Dnieper River, that they're blowing up the bridges all along that river to make it more difficult, of course, if Ukrainian -- when Ukrainian forces enter for them to cross. But this is going to be something that's going to take time, John. This tactical withdrawal probably involves thousands of Russian soldiers. It will be a complex operation to pull them back. You can expect that they might leave mines behind, so that means Ukrainian forces can't move in immediately. That would take time. So don't expect that they'll enter the city right away. But yes, you are hearing also from the Ukrainian president that we are taking this a little bit with a grain of salt. We're not going to move too quickly on this. But again, a major setback, a major blow to President Putin's war. We'll see what's happening on the ground and keep you updated, John.",

And when Nicole arrives, it will make history, the first hurricane to make a November landfall in the United States in nearly 40 years. Let's get more on this.

You know, it ends on November 30th, and just when you think it's quieting down, coming to an end, John, this is what we see, a hurricane.That we haven't really seen one in the month of November, as you noted, since Hurricane Kate back in 1985. It's the second largest hurricane on record, too, to make landfall across the U.S. Kate in 1985, the only one to do it, was back on the 21st of November. Of course, we're pushing into on the 10th of November this morning across the East Coast. But about 30 miles away from the center -- from the East coast of Florida there, with 75-mile-per-hour winds. So it is a low grade Category 1 hurricane. But you look at this, and the presentation's certainly not impressive. The eye wall itself not very tight. We do have about a 60-mile spread between the eye wall. So very large large, broad feature there within at the center of this storm system. And you notice the hurricane warnings. They've been prompted across the Southern tier of Florida, while off towards North, as far North as coastal Carolina there into Charleston, we have tropical storm watches in effect. And the reason for that is, although this is only a Category 1, compared to a storm that made landfall 42 days ago -- that was Hurricane Ian, Category 4. The wind field of that particular storm as far as tropical-storm-force winds, John, extended 300 miles from the center. When it comes to Ian [SIC], tropical-storm-force winds indicated in yellow here extend 500 miles away from the center. So the impacts, even though it's a weaker storm, are going to be wide- reaching here. So portions of Georgia and even the Carolinas will feel tropical-storm-force winds from a landfall that's happening in South Florida. Pretty impressive storm here for any time of year.",

And the point -- fact of the matter is the reason that America went from voting in person to voting early or absentee has everything to do with the fact that, in the 2020 election, we were in the middle of a pandemic. And people didn't want to go stand in a school auditorium in line with other people and catch COVID. So, that -- that was the -- that was the genesis of this.
