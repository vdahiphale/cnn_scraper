He's also going to go to Battleground, Pennsylvania tomorrow. And then, of course, there's the NATO summit next week. This is an area that the President talks about a lot, his foreign policy chops.

On one hand, Biden seems more comfortable, more relaxed, and stumbled less in this interview than on the debate stage. But on the other hand, he seemed to dismiss many of the claims that Democrats have been worried about. You know, on one hand, he had openly dismissed the fact that he has a low approval rate, that he trails Trump significantly in major polling, and he also pushed back on the fact that he's not as physically fit as he was before he took office. And so nothing in this interview seems to quell any concerns among Democrats who are worried about what would happen if he should stay in this race. And all this is to say is that it seems like Democrats will need more than just this 20-minute interview to move on past the debate fallout.",

So it has been incredibly strong, that heat extreme, and it's lasting a long time.We're also watching Beryl very closely, and it's actually being steered by some of that heat. You've got a tropical storm right now that's sitting in the Gulf of Mexico. It's sitting about 540 miles south and east of Corpus Christi with 60 mile per hour winds. And we'll continue to kind of regain strength here because we're still talking about water temperatures that are incredibly hot, much hotter than they usually are for this time of year. So that's going to let it re-intensify into a hurricane and start to hit the Texas coastline, probably going late Sunday into Monday is when we're looking at that landfall. Hurricane watches are in effect from Brownsville up into Corpus Christi as this thing continues to make a turn, kind of hugging Texas, impacts from Austin to Houston as we go into the week here. We're looking at the -- again, the likelihood of tropical storm force winds increasing for places from Corpus Christi to Victoria, Texas and over into Houston. Storm surge up to three feet possible kind of coming into the coastline here from Galveston down towards Corpus Christi. That could be a problem with some flooding as well. And then on top of that, we're looking at some 5 to 10 inches of rain possible. Look at that swath of heavy rain kind of hugging probably just east to the track. So even some places, you know, like Austin and Houston could get in on some of those heavy downpours as well, depending on the exact where the exact center of the storm winds up lining up. And we also have this kind of spinning storm making landfall. So we often can get a risk for tornadoes. So already finding a slight level two out of five severe risk for tornadoes as we go into Sunday, even Monday, because you've got this spinning storm system. As I mentioned, we have these two huge heat domes, areas of high pressure. That's what's steering barrel kind of right in between them into the heart of Texas. The heat dome to the west has all these excessive heat warnings that will go well into next week. We're talking about multiple days of excessive heat warnings. That's the problem with this is you get no relief day to day and no relief at night. Temperatures in the triple digits, you know, Las Vegas up towards 118 degrees, which would break all-time records. 112 in Bakersfield, even Sacramento, still up near 100 degrees by next Wednesday. This extreme heat causes heat sickness. It can be lethal and deadly.

He has vowed a more pragmatic foreign policy, but, analysts say he is unlikely to bring major changes because most key decisions are made by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is in Berlin for us. So, Fred, what can you tell us about Iran's incoming President? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTfirst of all, Veronica, it was a really interesting election that happened. They had a second round in Iran because the voter turnout was a lot higher actually than in the first round. The election was around 50 percent, still quite low though by Iranian standards, however, normally, it is the case so that if the voter- turnout is low, that then the conservatives usually have a better showing and their candidates usually do well. Well, in this case, the moderate managed to take the lead and win the election. Masoud Pezeshkian now the President-elect of Iran. Now, you're absolutely right to point out that Pezeshkian has said during the campaigning that he wants better relations with the countries in the greater Middle East, of course, a lot of turmoil there right now, also with the countries of the West as well, and that could also include the United States. Of course, there is that caveat that you were just pointing out that the Iranian President, of course, doesn't have the kind of power that for instance, the U.S. President has, that in the end, all decisions that are made need to be signed off by the supreme leader. However, the Iranian President does have the power to try and shape policies with some of those other institutions, and in conjunction with them, not only supreme leader, but also the Iranian military as well. So, Pezeshkian says that he wants to go into that direction, of course, all that is quite difficult. However, by the way, that the Iranians voted, they do seem to have told their elected officials that they want their country to work towards trying to get some of those sanctions lifted, and also want it to work towards getting better relations with countries around the world, including western countries as well. It's going to be very interesting to see how that plays out. But it certainly is on Pezeshkian's agenda to try and lead to some sort of detente, not just with the countries in the Middle East, but also with western countries as well, guys.",

David, good morning. The world is closely watching President-elect Masoud Pezeshkian to see if he will bring Iran out of increasing international isolation. Fred was just talking about this. Do you think this is even possible or likely?DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Well, it's possible, but I think it's going to be difficult. Mr. Pezeshkian, when he ran, was supported interestingly enough by some of the former government officials who had negotiated the Iran nuclear deal, in 2015, including the foreign minister -- former Foreign Minister of Iran who was sort of the author of it. And so, what you've seen now is sort of a movement by the voters to say we want to end the isolation. It's not clear, as Fred pointed out that the President of Iran has the power to go do that. But the very fact that a government that constricts the vote, it doesn't decide the vote, but it limits who can run -- allowed him to basically take the lead here tells you that there's a recognition they've got to let off some of the anger that has been built up inside Iran towards the existing government. And the opponent, Mr. Jalili who had been an earlier nuclear negotiator was a true hard-liner.",

You're going to have a completely new British Prime Minister, a Labor Minister who's gone against the populist move, but whose election reflects a sort of inner anger against the ruling establishment. It was the biggest defeat for the Conservatives. And then the whole thing will be presided over by President Biden who will be examined for his every move. And I thought it was really interesting that in the -- at the very end of the interview last night with George Stephanopoulos, he said, watch me, watch me at NATO. That's sort of the best test to see. And of course, what he was saying was, this is my proudest accomplishment, standing up against Russia, and watch me continue that role.

He's gone back and forth on this. But one can hope that this is on the way to getting the hostages released, and at least, enough of the ceasefire, that we stop seeing the horrific killing we've seen on both sides there.
