With these types of things, they say it's kind of like a bank robbery. You got to get in and get out. The same is true for redirect. You don't want to go on too long. You don't want to be too defensive. And you don't want to bore the jury.So here, the prosecution is want -- you don't want to go in and they're going to want to have this explained a little bit better. Because the impression they've been left with is that Michael Cohen is a thief, and that the D.A.'s office for whatever reason, let him get away with larceny. So, again, I don't want to speculate on how the D.A.'s office plans to spin this. You would hope with years of investigation. They have kind of a line or a theory kind of ready to go. But we could expect to see them get in, have him tell his story. And then stop because the more he talks, the more it opens up to the jury not believing him, right? So, I think it's going to be -- I think it's going to be surgical, surgical precision is what they should do. But we have to say.",

What exactly were you paying Red Finch for?Trump notes that he was -- I'm sorry, Cohen notes that Trump was polling low in an online CNBC poll. Online polls are complete nonsense and utterly without any worth whatsoever. And I don't even know why any organization does them. But in any case, Cohen testifies it upset him. And so, you know, he come to my office and provided me a sheet of paper that showed this online poll where he was not doing well. And basically, I know what's coming here, which is that they then hired this firm Red Finch to goose the polls, just like they -- according to Lanny Davis, Red Finch also provided crowds at Trump's announcement.

Trump felt he didn't get his money's worth for the poll. So, Trump didn't pay Red Finch. And so, he didn't feel he had gotten the benefit that for the services they provide.So, ask why he took $50,000 back pay for Weisselberg. For Red Finch, even though he only paid Red Finch 20 grand. Cohen said, quote, for a long time, I had been telling him about the $50,000 so that I could collect it for the president of Red Finch. I was angered because of the reduction in the bonus. And so, I just felt it was almost like self-help. I wasn't going to let him have the benefit this way as well. I wasn't going to correct the conversation I was having with Allen Weisselberg about it. I had not only protected him to the best that I could. But it also laid out money to Red Finch in a year and a half earlier. And again, $130,000 to have my bonus cut by two thirds was very upsetting, to say the least. You know, none of these are sufficient justifications for larceny.

They talked a lot about his taxi medallion business, about other things he had going on at the time that could have fed into his decision to engage in unethical and deceptive business practices, setting up these shell companies, for instance. Saying that he's in a state of need, he doesn't really do much except reinforce that.But again, I would go back to the central point here, I think, which is some of this back and forth about Michael Cohen's other interests in the world and his financial duress and so on, doesn't really go to the heart of the matter. It's something of a sideshow. I think that the idea that Michael Cohen is at times a person with checkered honesty in the public domain, it's something that jurors are going to know by now.

Whether it comes from a person with a great track record of honesty who's very sympathetic. Or it comes from a frankly terrible person with a -- with a really checkered track record.The important thing is how do the facts stand up to scrutiny? Now, that doesn't mean that character evidence isn't relevant when considering trustworthiness. Sometimes that's part of a constellation of factors that you need to give to readers to allow them to judge how truthful facts that a sorcerer is putting on the table might be. Now, you're exactly right that here in the courtroom, the defense is trying to impeach him on character grounds and in terms of the other motives you might have. And a journalist might greet that situation and say, hey, that's something that the jurors should know up front. In this case, they're doing a more traditional set of courtroom tactics.

I mean, this redirect is going point, point, point, point moving very quickly through it. One reason may be the Susan Hoffinger doesn't want to telegraph.

It clearly wasn't excessive. And noted that in his own email signature, he said, I'm the attorney for President Donald J. Trump. So, Todd Blanche did what he needed to do.

Now it looks like the objection here from the defense was sustained.So, she's asking to go back up again. I mean, this is -- this is a lot of back and forth. We haven't seen this much halting, starting, stopping. And this is a change in approach to. The defense largely let the prosecution ask whatever they wanted to on direct, but here they've made their points, and they want to hold their ground. So, this is taking a little bit longer. And also throwing Hoffinger pacing off a little bit. She was moving, as John said, really rapid fire. But this forces her to stop. Hold on, everything up to the judge, and then come back.",

They're basically using Cohen's own admission that he broke the law several times to muddy up and make Donald Trump look bad here.I think one of the strategies might be here, everyone knows Michael Cohen, you know, is a flawed character, but he's so flawed and he was doing it for Donald Trump. And they're introducing some kind of theories about campaign finance law here in the process, where they're saying, did you do this, you know, for a personal thing over said the campaign. And Michael Cohen said it was the campaign and that's getting out there now in this redirect. COLLINS: And just to -- for what's happening inside the room. This is John, to your point earlier. Susan Hoffinger asks Michael Cohen. I know, it may feel like you're on trial here or after your cross- examination. But are you actually on trial, Hoffinger asks. Michael Cohen says, no, ma'am. Obviously, Michael Cohen is not on trial. But she's just reminding the jury of the point you were just making that this isn't the defendant here that he is seated over there at the defense table.",

And Jamie Gangel, let me go to you because one of the things that is going to be an issue for the jury to decide has to do with Michael Cohen's testimony about this call that took place at the end of October.That was 93 seconds long in which supposedly he complained to Keith Schiller, Donald Trump's bodyguard about some 14-year-old that was prank calling him. And also, Keith Schiller handed the phone to Trump. And Michael Cohen told Trump that the Stormy Daniels matter was settled. Why is that significant?",
