Plus, just in to CNN: E. Jean Carroll now seeking even more in damages from Trump after the former president insulted the writer again at CNN's town hall. And it's just one day after she won her sexual abuse and defamation case against him. And he's the son of a single mother, rose from poverty and become the only Black Republican in the Senate. But does Tim Scott's amazing life story translate into a path to victory? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, another Putin critic dead, this time, it's Russia's deputy science minister, Pyotr Kucherenko. He was just 46 years old. Well, according to the ministry of science and higher education, Pyotr Kucherenko was feeling ill while on a plane with the Russian delegation that was returning from a business trip to Cuba. That's their quote. The flight on Saturday reportedly made an emergency landing in southern Russia, but it was too late. Doctors apparently could not save him. Well, OUTFRONT spoke to Russian journalist Roman Super, who, of course, shed light on Kucherenko's suspicious death. Super says that he has spoken to Kucherenko who's claimed last year that his passport had been seized, and it was impossible for him to leave Russia unless with a government endorsed and sanctioned trip like the one to Cuba, that was his last. But Kucherenko urged Super in this conversation to get out and get his family out of Russia. He told Super, quote: You can't imagine the degree a badge and the degree of brutalization of our country. You won't recognize Russia in a year. Super night tells OUTFRONT: Everything I knew I wrote. Pyotr Kucherenko was a normal person and like all normal people, he condemned the very idea of war, especially a fraternal one. Now, Kucherenko's shocking death, you know, remember, Alexey Navalny, right, he survived poisoning on a plane. We don't know what happened here, but of course, he's only 46 years old, and he is far from the only Russian to suffer untimely demise. Since the start of the war, more than a dozen high-profile Russians have mysteriously died. Most recently, a senior military official died. She fell out of a 16th floor window. And some of the others who have died, one full out of the windows hotel, another one fell out of a hospital window, another fell down a flight of stairs, another fell off a boat -- well, it goes on and on. And it all comes tonight as we are witnessing what seems to be a remarkable show of any kind of resistance inside Moscow itself. What you are looking at here on the screen is the flag of free Russia. It's flying over Moscow State University. The group who posted this video is known as the Freedom for Russia Legion. It's a group made up of a few hundred Russians who are currently fighting on behalf of Ukraine. And tonight, we have new video into OUTFRONT showing two of these fighters commandeering a Russian military vehicle. Take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN NATIONAL (through translator):  My father told me, go and be a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) tractor driver. But no, I decided to join the military. RUSSIAN NATIONAL (through translator):  Trophy. A BTR 82A from the Russian Federation's FSB. Ukraine, that's it. The Russian volunteer corps at work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But Wagner says their forces will withdraw on May 25th, after months of ferocious fighting and countless dead. The city will be placed under Russian military control, with commanders have done withdrawing then advancing recently. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  And, Erin, tonight, despite those claims by Yevgeny Prigozhin and also, by the way, by the Kremlin as well, the Ukrainians are saying that some of the most intense fighting going on in Ukraine is happening right around the Bakhmut area, as the Russians continue to hit that area, the Ukrainians fight back and they say they are not going to give up an inch of their territory without a fight, Erin.",

Fred, thank you very much, from Kyiv tonight.I want to go now to retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, he was, of course, the former commanding general of Europe and the Seventh Army, and Alexander Rodnyansky, adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. So, thanks very much to both of you. General, since Fred was just talking about Bakhmut, this is fascinating what we are seeing happening. Russia is now saying it's captured Bakhmut. You see the champagne showers, et cetera, that the Wagner mercenaries are doing. Ukraine says, no, that the fighting for Bakhmut continues. They will fight for every single inch. What is exactly happening there? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  It's tough to explain, Erin, because we are looking at literally a PowerPoint maps, often, and we are seeing red areas and yellow areas and it doesn't give the situation in terms of the terrain. The Ukrainian forces, as I've watched them, have pulled out of Bakhmut. They have done a very good withdrawal, and they are now in the high ground in the areas of Yahidne, Khromonov, and Ivanivske, three areas to the northwest, and southwest. They can control the city via the high ground. So Russia is basically commanding rubble right now. A town that they have destroyed, they are now in the middle of it. There is no tactical value for that right now, and Ukrainian forces who have pulled back can now have a greater capability of conducting operations against that, so even they did before. And I would suggest, soon, we may see Ukrainian forces surround the Wagner forces or whatever is left in the city of Bakhmut.",

And they threaten a smaller objective, they kill or capture people, they cause movements of the enemy to protect the object of the raid. So in other words, this is an area where there are very few Russian soldiers, and now, unfortunately, because of this incursion into Russian territory at Belgorod, Russia has to move defense forces there, as well as some other places like Kursk. And what we have seen in Moscow itself, with the flag that you showed flying over Moscow university, all of this is to accomplish the intent of an objective of pulling Russian forces away from the areas which they are defending. This is shaping operations, and the Ukrainians are doing it very well, along with the legion of Russian -- the Liberty of Russian Legion or whatever they want to call themselves --",

Now, the other comment he made after he left, that has already gone to trial.
