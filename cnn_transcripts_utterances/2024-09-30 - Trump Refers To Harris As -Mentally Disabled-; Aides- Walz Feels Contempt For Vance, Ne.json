This is going to be how Donald Trump either wins or loses this race because it's core to who he is.Donald Trump is a bully. He -- the form of politics he knows how to do is to demean, is to kind of draw the opponent into the mud with him. And, frankly, if you go to those rallies, that is what those folks are there to do. But having seen it over a couple of years, I think we're seeing a version of Donald Trump that it's not like I would call more unhinged. But I would say is less focused on the type of issues that the folks around him want him to be focused on. And so as we're getting more of these personal attacks, you are hearing, you're Nikki Haleys of the world, your other kind of forms of Republicans saying the version of Donald Trump that focuses more on Kamala Harris's personality rather than the issues is the one that loses. Now, he is trying to create a coalition, though, that is really based around that type of motivation. When we see him doing better with men, for example, we should not discount with fact that part of it is because he has employed a style of politics that is a bully form of politics, right? And so he's taking a road less traveled electorally, but there's one that is authentic to who he is because Donald Trump, as we know, is not going to switch up. AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, \"WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": I do think, though, that we really need to be very clear on what he's doing. I mean, he is dehumanizing Kamala Harris, he is talking about her in a way that is beyond degrading. He's degrading people who are mentally disabled. He's degrading migrants in a way that, I mean, that smacks of racism, saying that they're more violent than others. I mean, so we have to call it what it is and whether it's successful or not. It is changing the shape of American politics, and it is bringing a nastiness into American politics, and that will be Donald Trump's legacy forever.",

So let's say that. First of all, the thing that I've discerned that I think is, you know, represents something, you know, escalatory potentially, is his -- the specificity of his threats against both the legitimacy of this upcoming election and against his opponents. He has now, over the weekend, repeatedly said that Kamala Harris should be both impeached and prosecuted, for what it's not clear. He did this before the 2020 election when he said that Joe Biden should be prosecuted. He openly tweeted at his attorney general at the time, he should do so. He now says that election workers a very broad category should be prosecuted and will be aggressively gone after by a future Trump administration.",

And we haven't seen that reverse his favorability, right? We still know that he's underwater. Things like the childless cat lady comment are going to be held over his head.

Now you're seeing a shift. Democrats are hoping for some surprises. They're trying to move money into foreign Florida and into Texas. There's some ratings changes. You can see from our ratings experts thinking that Texas, yes, still likely Republican, but maybe a little less so. But there's a Nebraska independent who's running there.
