So, the Gallup conduct the survey for more than 150 countries all over the world every year and they ask the happiness survey question for their several respondents. And this requirement (ph) is like imagine the life as a ladder, zero is at the bottom which represents the worst possible life and ten means the best possible of your life. And so, at which step you stand these days.So, each respondent will give a number between zero and 10. Then we just calculate the (inaudible) the average for each nation. Therefore, we use that average number to -- as the national happy score to make the ranking.",

It's like whether there can be some cultural issues in shaping the answer. Well, we cannot ignore that potential differences across countries but studies showing that there are actual factors which may account for the differences across countries in terms of their happiness score. In our research, in particular, chapter two, every year's world happy report, we propose a model with six factors to explain the international variations of the happiness levels.While the six factors include income level, which means GD per capita and the (inaudible) life expectancy which represent the house. And in addition to these two objective measures, we also have four subjective measures, including the perceived corruption, social support, these -- also like generosity and freedom to make life choices. So, if you compare U.S. with those nations, we can see that U.S. is doing very well in terms of its GD per capita. However, in terms of house and some other aspects, U.S. is not doing that good. That may partially explain the differences.",
