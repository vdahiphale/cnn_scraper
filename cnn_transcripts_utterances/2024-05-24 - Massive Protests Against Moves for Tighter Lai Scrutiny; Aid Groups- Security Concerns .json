Thanks.Ukraine is reeling from the latest barrage of Russian missile strikes on its second largest city. Regional officials say seven people were killed, at least 23 others wounded in attacks on Kharkiv on Thursday. The targets included a major printing company that publishes newspapers and about a third of books released in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says his country still lacks enough air defenses to fight back, and he's urging some Western allies to allow Ukraine to use weapons provided by them to strike across the Russian border to defend itself. Kharkiv came under fire as Russia is trying to push ahead with its new cross-border offensive North of that city. As his troops attacked Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is propping up his relationship with a country that helped his invasion. He arrived in Belarus on Thursday for talks with his counterpart there, Alexander Lukashenko. The Kremlin says the discussions will include their strategic partnership and alliance. Belarus allowed Moscow to use its territory as a launchpad to invade Ukraine in 2022. Last year, Russia transferred some of its non- strategic nuclear weapons to Belarus. A U.S. official telling CNN, CIA Director Bill Burns will head to Europe in the coming days to try to get hostage and ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas back on track.

It's a monopolization case.And Michael, just so you know, to be a monopolist is not illegal. It's if you willfully maintain it in an illegal fashion, it becomes illegal. And what the Department of Justice is alleging here, is that they act life, Live Nation acted illegally. What they did was they had exclusive dealing contracts that were illegal. They had tying arrangements. They used their market power. They were excluding competitors, and it's a very lengthy complaint. And 30 states joined in the complaint.",

The government will have (AUDIO GAP) alleging that they have significant market power. Live Nation will hire an expert who will testify that they do not.

He rattled off a list, a long list of fees, Ticketmaster charges. I mean, there were ticketing fees, and service fees, and convenience fees. There was something called platinum phase, whatever that is, and on and on.I mean, how do those sorts of fees hit the bottom line for consumers, and -- and is that part of the complaint here?",

It hits their bottom line, because it increases the price for consumers to purchase tickets.And -- and by the way, the DOJ is alleging control over artists, as well, and influencing artists. But what it does is it influences the bottom line. And that, I think, is one of the reasons why we have a jury here. You know, we have the state attorney generals who joined in, and they have claims. And they were entitled to a jury. And the jury, because the jury in New York, which is where the case is located, probably is very well aware of playing -- paying extra fees on tickets and what the DOJ is hoping is that they will not accept it.",
