Donald Trump notches another victory in New Hampshire, making his nomination appear increasingly inevitable. But his last remaining Republican rival is vowing she'll stay in the race. Israel expands its operations in southern Gaza surrounding the enclave's second largest city, enforcing thousands of displaced Palestinians to once again flee. Plus, as winter bites, Russian missiles pummel infrastructure across Ukraine, including a school and a gas pipeline. Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire Republican primary, tightening his grip on the Republican Party and moving him closer to a rematch with President Joe Biden come November. This marks the first time in the modern era that a non-incumbent Republican candidate was victorious in both of the first two nominating contests. With the majority of the votes in New Hampshire counted, the former U.S. President beat his last challenger standing, Nikki Haley, by just over 10 percentage points. During his long and rambling, some might say, victory speech, he appeared agitated over Haley's refusal to drop out of the race and encouraged two former Republican rivals, turned supporters, to attack her while on stage. Haley got in some swipes as well, suggesting that Trump is too old and is a loser. She's vowing to carry her campaign to her home state of South Carolina, which holds its primary in one month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now you've all heard the chatter among the political class. They're falling all over themselves, saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them. New Hampshire is first in the nation. It is not the last in the nation. This race is far from over. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Kristen Holmes reports from the site of Trump campaign's watch party.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump lashing out at Nikki Haley during an angry victory speech here in New Hampshire. The speech sounded almost nothing like what we heard in Iowa when he called for uniting the Republican Party, uniting the country. Instead, focused almost solely on Nikki Haley staying in the race. I was told by an advisor that he was watching at least part of her speech backstage, speech in which she sounded defiant. Listen to some of what Trump had to say. DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can go up and I can say to everybody, oh, thank you for the victory, it's wonderful. Or I can go up and say, who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and like claimed a victory? She did very poorly, actually. She had to win. The governor said, she's gonna win, she's gonna win, she's gonna win. Then she failed badly. And just a little note to Nikki, she's not gonna win. She's not gonna win. But if she did, She would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes. And I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about. But she will be under investigation within minutes. And so would Ron have been. But he decided to get out. He decided to get out. Now, Vivek, I don't think, would be at all, because he's perfect, right? And Tim Scott, I know would never, that's no chance.",

She can demonstrate that she's done very well against a candidate whose effectively an incumbent, who should be able to just sweep clear in a set of primaries where really only those who are very committed to voting turnout, certainly amongst a Republican base.He hasn't done as well amongst college-educated voters as Nikki Haley did. He hasn't done as well amongst independent voters. She can make the very clear case that if the Republicans want to win in a general election, they need more than that very narrow base. They need independent voters. They need college-educated voters. They need people to turn out beyond the base that Trump speaks to. And so, you know, right now Trump looks very strong in a primary season, in a Republican Party. When you start to look at a general election, that's a much harder sell. And so the Haley campaign will try to make that case. I think the problem right now is that Nikki Haley's voters are really many of them voting against Donald Trump as opposed to for Nikki Haley. Her platform, her message so far has not managed to really galvanize voters in the way that she will need to do in what looks like a very difficult race ahead.",

So it's important to bear in mind that one of the few things that perhaps the Israeli government and Hamas do agree on is that they both rejected two-state solution, which is a pretty, I suppose, which may not be a particularly optimistic state of affairs if that is where the world thinks that things should go. But that is the situation. As far as the negotiations go, I should note that even John Kirby from the U.S. National Security Council says we're not at the stage where we can actually call them negotiations. What we're seeing is a number of proposals and the Qataris say that they are working around the clock, that they're constantly getting replies from both sides. And I suppose the fact that we're talking about this yesterday, we're talking about this today, and every day seems to bring forth more word of proposals being made by either side suggests that at least there is a willingness to do some kind of deal from both sides. Where we are exactly, we've seen reports about perhaps Israel offering like a two-month pause in fighting that would see the more than 100 hostages that are still being held by Hamas and others in the Gaza Strip freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners and more aid. We've also seen the head of Mossad, we were talking about yesterday, David Barnea, proposing potentially the exile of senior Hamas leaders as a way that perhaps could lead to an end to the war. Though I can tell you that a senior Israeli government official has told me that the exile of Sinwar, Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, is not Israel's position and has not been offered by Israel. One of the latest suggestions or reports from Reuters talking about an agreement on the broad framework of a month-long ceasefire during which there would be the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But one of the sticking points for Hamas is that it wants a package deal, in the words of this Reuters report. In other words, they want to agree on the terms of a permanent ceasefire before they and as part of that agreement have the terms of a temporary truce. Israel for its part, its sticking point is that unless Hamas is dismantled, it is no longer in control of the Gaza Strip. There isn't any deal to be done. Of course, talks are happening, and I suppose at least as long as they are talking with the Qataris as the mediators, as the go-betweens, then at least we can be optimistic that perhaps we are getting closer to some position where there could be a deal.",

And about a third said that it was for the benefit of Israel.We also heard from Gadi Eisenkot, who's no friend of Netanyahu, he's in the war cabinet saying that if he felt that was the case, then he wouldn't remain in the war cabinet. As far as that deadliest day for the IDF since this war began on October the 7th, I've got a couple more details that in fact it was two rocket-propelled grenades fired by presumably Hamas. One hit a tank in which two Israeli soldiers were killed. The other hit this building where Israeli soldiers were laying down mines with a view to destroying these buildings and infrastructure of Hamas to try to create this kind of buffer zone that would enable communities on the other side of the wall inside of Israel to return to their homes. And many of those soldiers, all of them reservists, by the way, so they're not professional soldiers, they were just called up as a result of this war, all of them reservists, many of those funerals have now already been held. And I suppose overall, in a broader sense, Israelis all would like to see Hamas destroyed, they would like to see all of the hostages returned home, and perhaps that is more of a priority for many Israelis than the destruction of Hamas. But, you know, there is perhaps a sense, and we've seen these in opinion polls, that there is a sense among many that these two objectives cannot be reached. And we heard this again from Gadi Eisenkot in this interview, saying that the only way to get all of these hostages home is to do some kind of deal. And I suppose that is what we are now waiting for.",
