And so the Republican Party is really split on this. And she holds a ton of power, not just because she's got a big microphone and people are listening to her and, frankly, because she might not stop until she becomes the next speaker of the House, but also because there's just no margin here for Mike Johnson. He's got two choices. He's got to play ball with the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene, or he's got to work with Democrats. And neither of them are good choices whatsoever.",

      "sentences": "All right, the gremlins have been fixed for now.Let's pick back up with our political conversation with Maria Cardona and Sarah Longwell. What we were talking about is this inter party fight of Republicans, Marjorie Taylor Greene taking on the Republican House speaker potentially for this speakership. A lot of the centering around Ukraine aid. But Sarah was making the point, Maria, that this is also about the old guard of the Republican Party versus the new guard. Add this to the conversation for your take. Greg Meeks was just on, a leading Democrat, was just on with me and he told me, if Hakeem Jeffries would reach out to him and say, I need your vote to support to keep Speaker Johnson in the seat, he would do it. His reasoning is, Ukraine aid is so important to get done now and not later. Should Democrats help save Johnson? MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think that - I think it's certainly true that there are Democrats that are leaning towards that because the majority of Democrats also understand how important Ukraine aid is, not just to the national security of the country, by to the democracy of the world, if you will. And I think that moving forward, if that happens, there will be conditions on it, right? I mean Speaker Johnson is in a conundrum. And Sarah's right, this is more about what the fissures are between - within the Republican Party. It's always what Democrats have said, what a speaker within that conference is going to face, their MAGA extremis versus the common sense Republicans. Right now the MAGA extremists have won battle after battle after battle, and that's why you're seeing Marjorie Taylor Greene now going after Speaker Johnson. But he understands that in order to get anything done, he does need Democrats' help. And what I think this - this portrays for the election is that this gives Democrats the ability to message really what a dumpster fire the Republican leadership has been within the Republican Congress. And that because of those fissures, because of that tension between the MAGA extremists who really do have a lot of power, they're not able to govern. And more so, Marjorie Taylor Greene has no interest in governing, has no interest in solving the problems. She wants purity, plain and simple. And that's why she has filed those papers to try to get rid of Speaker Johnson. And so Democrats are saying, this is not what Americans voted for. This is a Republican dumpster fire. They do not deserve to be leading. They have no interest in doing so. Don't know how to. Give Democrats the power and we will solve the problems that the country is facing.",

Donald Trump's position that he announced is that he wants it to be up to the states. Conservative Republicans are not happy with that. We hear that from anti-abortion activists. Mike Pence called his position that he announced a slap in the face. Lindsey Graham says he respectfully disagrees with Trump, saying that Trump should have come out to support federal ban. What Donald Trump, though, says, Sarah, is that by allowing the states to make their decision, we have taken the abortion issue largely out of play. Has it?",

And I asked her in Wisconsin if she wants Joe Biden to come and help her campaign. Let me play for you what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTIN LYERTY (D), WISCONSIN CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: I'm really focused on my campaign and I'm really focused on getting out and talking with the people, hearing what the people want to see. The issues that I'm hearing are, they don't have enough resources to put food on the table. They can't put gas in their car. They're having a hard time paying their our health care bills.

And what Donald Trump did absolutely did not take this out of play. In fact, what Democrats are now saying, which is true given his words, he is now supporting the most egregious and dangerous bans in the 20 plus states that have them right now, where one out of three women of reproductive age live. That puts women in danger, their reproductive futures in danger. That's a hugely motivating message for Democrats.",

This is meant to remedy some of that. The $600 million settlement still has to be approved by a court. But if it is approved, it would resolve all class action claims within a 20-mile radius.And for residents who participate, it would resolve all personal injury claims within a ten-mile radius. So, they could use this money for their health care needs, you know, for medical monitoring, to deal with net business losses and the like. This is something that the plaintiffs say they're going to file a petition to put - before a judge to have this approved within the next ten days. And if it is approved, once it is approved, this money could start being paid out by the end of this year. And this is important because, number one, this is one of several class action lawsuits. But as I mentioned, a 20 mile radius will settle many of those claims. But this is something that really traumatized the community. They had to be evacuated. There was a controversial controlled burn of these toxic substances that had this plume of smoke in the air for three days. So, these are people who have been traumatized by this event and are seeking compensation. This is one of, as I've said, several cases. And it's in addition to the more than $100 million the company he has already spent to try to help the community with direct payments to residents, to businesses, and the like. John.",
