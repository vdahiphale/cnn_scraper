Both of these two co-defendants remain.And they risk seriously complicated what has been really relatively smooth process for all these other co-defendants who have turned themselves in ahead of the deadline. Of course, there is one defendant who we believe is still in custody. He did not work out a bond agreement, so he's still, we understand, inside in custody inside the Fulton County Jail. But these other co-defendants who are ticking against the clock here with just hours remaining to turn themselves in, are running a serious risk of stretching out being in custody for days. Earlier, I spoke to local defense attorney Suri Chadha Jimenez who talked to me about what could happen to these co-defendants if they miss this noon deadline. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's also the author of \"Filthy Rich Politicians, the Swamp Creatures Latte Liberals and Ruling Class Elites Cashing in on America.Matt, at the top of the show I read some of the analysis in the papers and whatnot about this mug shot in the roll it now plays in American society. You know the New York Times called a \"dramatically unprecedented,\" MSNBC call it \"a sinister apparition,\" Business Insider called it a masterclass. I think we have a picture of this, \"A masterclass in capitalizing on one's supervillain era,\" Reuters said \"Yet another extraordinary moment for Trump.\" You're so good at explaining things.

The lawsuit cites how successful powering down lines has been to prevent wildfires like here in California, Oregon, Nevada.But here is a soundbite from the president and CEO of Hawaiian Electric Company on August 14 talking about that issue.
