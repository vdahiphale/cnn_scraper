The balloons are now deflated, the confetti swept away.Democrats, of course, are hoping the energy and excitement of last night will carry them into November. The reality is the next 73 days are going to be a dog fight. The race will likely come down to a small number of voters in just a handful of states. A top Democrat tells CNN that Kamala Harris remains, quote, clear-eyed about what comes next. And she's all too aware that momentum Democrats are feeling could easily wane. But for now, her party is basking in the magnitude of this moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey, on behalf of Americans, like the people I grew up with, people who work hard, chase their dreams and look out for one another, on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth. I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Since we're so awake, and you obviously got a very good night's sleep, and you've had a chance to digest last night. Your thoughts?AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: My thoughts are that after this long week of kind of a party, kind of a revival of energy and even expectations for Democrats. It was fascinating to see Kamala Harris come out and give a kind of sober, steely, let's get down to business kind of speech. She did her biography, and I think that she did it effectively. But by the end of the night, I felt like, oh, we also have a lawyer in chief, you know? And she wanted to look like commander in chief. And the images you would see of her today on the front of your local paper is of one looking presidential and really sending the message that, OK, now the actual work of winning this is about to begin.",

But from kind of an older version of the party to reintroducing the country to a different version of Democrats, one that has a more diverse bench, one that has a new roster of elected that have come up in the post Trump era and look and talk differently.

I think that's something that folks around the vice president recognizes that she's not maybe the best speech giver, but they were incredibly impressed with the speech that she gave. They felt it was both meticulously planned, that it struck all the right notes.I think following her for so long, one thing that you always hear is how difficult it is to get her to talk about herself, get her to reveal personal anecdotes. And even though I've covered her since 2018, there were some things that she said on stage that even I hadn't heard before, really trying to get these personal anecdotes that not just explain who she is, but also stands in contrast to the former president. And so, I think that that was a major, major part of it that shouldn't be understated, but people around her are excited. They feel that she did a good job. But going forward, I think, to Audie's point, they recognize that that is when the real work begins, and she wants to stay focused on winning in November.",

So that is just a facet of her being, and it's really never going to change, no matter how much people want her to embrace that talk, those kind of talking points. Secondly, though, I think that black women really do see the through line between folks like Fannie Lou Hamer, who gave that first testimony at the Democratic convention in the 1950s to Shirley Chisholm, who was the first black elected woman of Congress, and then the first black woman to run for the Democratic nomination. They see those struggles that black women have really clogged through to make a pathway that the vice president is now enjoying and trying to create her own pathway. The vice president is somebody who -- even though she doesn't talk about her blackness, and even though she doesn't talk about her womanness or her asianness, in that way, really understands the responsibility and the pressure that it means to come first. This is something that her aides and people closer have talked to me a lot about. She recognizes it and feels it on her shoulders.",

And there are high level conversations going on between Donald Trump's team and RFK's team that have been for a number of weeks over Donald Trump securing that endorsement. Of course, there might be some questions as to why it is so important for Trump to secure that endorsement, particularly given we've seen RFK's campaign has been plagued with a number of controversial issues, including sitting down for a variety, our Vanity Fair article and avoiding questions on allegations of sexual assault from a nanny and putting a dead bear cub in the middle of Central Park.But it's all about those margins. We believe us, media, Harris's campaign, Donald Trump's campaign. Everyone believes that this election is going to be divided -- decided by a razor thin margin, and any votes can be helpful. I just want to go over one quick thing. Here in Arizona, RFK was pulling at 6 percent in recent polling. Does Donald Trump's team think that if, RFK drops out and endorses Trump, he's going to get all that 6 percent, no. They understand that's probably not likely. However, they believe that if they can siphon off any of that, it will be helpful, particularly in a battleground state like this.

Joe Biden allowed him a kind of get out of jail free card, because so much of that unpopularity was driven by something that Biden could never change, right?Now that they have a different person in the race, it has exposed the fact that this is not a Trump campaign that has grown its margins, that has expanded its portion of the electorate. And I think even the J. D. Vance pick is reflective of a moment they were a month ago, where they were doubling down rather than expanding out. And so, I think, you know, there was that rally earlier this week where Donald Trump was asking his own audience. Should I go personal, or should I stick with the substance? The audiences is encouraging him to go personal. I think that spells kind of the negative tone that we might see this campaign take over the next month or so, and you have Republicans basically begging him on television and media to not do this. But this is who Donald Trump is. And so, it's going to be very difficult for him to reposition this race. And I think this debate has now grown in terms of importance, because you now have the very opposite of what was going to be happening in the first debate, where the Democrat is now in the ascendancy, and it's Donald Trump who needs to change the tides of momentum here.",
