That strike was in retaliation for Saturday's missile strike on the Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan Heights that left 12 children dead. It was thought that was, sort of, Israel's basic response to that attack. There was expectations of -- and it still may come -- Hezbollah's response to that.But the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran certainly changes the equation completely. Now there is real concern. We're hearing condemnation from governments across the region that this is an escalation that could lead to something very much worse. Now keep in mind, on the first of April, the Israelis struck a diplomatic -- an Iranian diplomatic complex in Damascus, killing a senior Islamic Revolutionary guard commander. But for Iran, that was a violation of its national sovereignty. Now for Israel to strike in the capital, Tehran, the head of the Hamas Political Bureau is, in a sense, far worse than that because it's not a diplomatic mission in another country. It is the capital of Iran itself. And the concern is that just as we saw in the aftermath of that strike on the diplomatic complex in Damascus, Iran launched more than 300 projectiles toward Israel. And it was a very sort of orchestrated event where the Iranians telegraphed well beforehand that it would be a limited counterstrike, so to speak. But in this case, it's in many senses a far more serious violation for the Iranians of their national sovereignty. And, of course, all of their allies in the region -- Hezbollah, the Houthis, the militias in Iraq and Syria are going to be looking at Iran to respond in-kind or to respond at least in a way that sends a forceful message to the Israelis -- Kate.",

The pair will be going on a swing state blitz starting Tuesday. That's according to the campaign. Harris got a head start in Georgia yesterday with a big campaign rally. And the Harris campaign has made clear in a memo that was out just this week that with Harris at the top of the ticket they say -- they see renewed electoral hope in winning Georgia. Part of the strategy to pull that off is winning over disenfranchised Georgia Republicans. Republicans like the former lieutenant governor of Georgia, Geoff Duncan, who joins us now. It's good to see you again, Lieutenant Governor. Thank you. You were at the rally last night. You also just wrote a piece for the AJC announcing your endorsement of Kamala Harris. I want to read for our viewers just a bit of what you said, and it's worth -- it's really worth the read because you write not only about your endorsement but how she can win. You write, \"I'm a lifelong Republican whose current north star is ridding Trump from the GOP, but endorsing Harris wasn't easy. Through my conservative lens I see very few policy areas where we agree. Though my support for Harris didn't come easily, it did come naturally. She's the best vehicle toward preventing another stained Trump presidency.\" Tell me why. GEOFF DUNCAN, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR:  Well look, we've got to do better than Donald Trump. As a lifelong conservative, I got to watch a fake Republican sit in the White House for four years and then almost destroy this country. And so we've just got to do better. I -- if you're a common-sense Republican you've already lost, right? Donald Trump is not the vehicle to success with conservative values. And certainly, the Democrat don't align with us on policies verbatim. So let's go take the next four years and heal and rebuild our party. Let's pick somebody that's not going to wreck the car like Donald Trump is, and let's work with the Harris administration. Let's work to try to find ways to bring them back towards the middle on key issues. And really, there's been some receptive intakes already. I mean, watching things like fracking. Watching her walk away from some of these big ideas that were launched -- big liberal ideas in 2020. There's no way to ignore this momentum that's going on. Yesterday was unbelievable, right? It almost felt like a national championship inside that arena with the energy. And you just think, in 10 short days they've --",

Just thirsty.And I think the hard part for me is if Republicans would have done something similar, other than Donald Trump, we would have had that same type of energy -- that authenticness to it. But we didn't. And so, you know, I believe if Kamala Harris is able to take rooms like that and not have try to win a primary each and every night with her -- with just catering to the far left, then I think she's going to be able to win the hearts and minds of the 10 percent which, by the way, are still going to determine who wins this election.
