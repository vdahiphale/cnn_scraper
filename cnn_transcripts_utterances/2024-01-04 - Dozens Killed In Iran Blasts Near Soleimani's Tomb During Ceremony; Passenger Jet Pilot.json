So far, no claim of responsibility but the U.S. has denied involvement and says there's no reason to believe Israel is responsible. Still, Iran's President was quick to blame the Israelis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANINA PRESIDENT (through translator): These gatherings that you will see held in the country, this flood of people that pour towards the grave of Qasem Soleimani these days, you come to scare the people with your criminal act. You're not strong enough to face the resistance. Your power has lost its effectiveness against the forces of resistance.

They say they have no independent information about it and have no reason to believe that Israel was involved.No one has claimed responsibility. A number of different groups could have been behind it. ISIS could be one of them. And Iranian opposition resistance group could have been another potential culprit for this particular attack. The details that we do have however, two bombs the first one detonating 700 meters from where people had gathered around Qasem Soleimani's grave, that was in a suitcase and it was detonated remotely Iranian officials say. But it was the second explosion about a kilometer from the grave side that killed and injured the most people according to Iranian officials. And it appears it was that second device that was timed and positioned to catch people that were coming in to help with the rescue and recovery effort after the first explosion. This really does ramp up tensions in the region at the moment when they are already extremely high. But to have Iran openly saying that Israel was behind this not presenting any evidence for it and saying they will pay Israel will pay a high price certainly does give the government here in Israel.

There's a bit of a belief inside the system, that Iran has not responded forcefully enough. And as a result, its deterrence has weakened.On the other side are those within the regime that are arguing that this is a trap, the Israelis want to advance and respond in order for it to be able to enlarge the war, and that it is in the strategic benefit of Iran to conduct an indirect war with Israel, rather than to do so directly. In all of this, however, one of the measures that would be most effective in really deescalating the situation would be to have a ceasefire in Gaza. We saw, for instance, that the attacks by Iraqi militias that are close to you are against U.S. troops completely stop, during the six days that there was a ceasefire in Gaza, the day before the ceasefire were six attacks by Iraqi militias against U.S. troops. So if we truly want to deescalate this, instead of sending more troops, et cetera, I think we really have to think more closely about the effectiveness of actually having a ceasefire that has proven to be more effective than any other measures that has been done so far.",

However, the transcript does not show clear takeoff approval for the Coast Guard plane instead telling it to taxi to a holding point less than two minutes later.

Those of collision lights that you're talking about the runway lights, the runway lights were working, it's important to clarify what it is. These are runway status lights. What that means is they automatically turn red if the runway is not safe to enter.So they can be told for in this, if they were working, then the cargo or the excuse me, the Coast Guard plane that was told to hold short would have come up to that runway and seen a row of red lights that says stop, do not get onto the runway, because there's something dangerous going to happen on that runway. And that's what those lights do. So I don't want to underpin this. I can't emphasize this enough. That is a critical piece of the pie. This is something that was put into place a few years back, it was a lot of studies that went on to try to prevent this exact thing from happening. That's the whole purpose of this runway indicator lights. And they were not operational. They didn't work. I suspect to that. Remember, a few years ago, John, we talked about the NOTAM system and the entire system, the entire aircraft and airspace was shut down because the NOTAM system was not available for the first time. Do you remember that? That was just over maybe three or four years ago. So, this is how important that NOTAM system is. So I'm curious to think that perhaps because this was a military operation, that the NOTAM which they have their own warning systems as well, in addition to NOTAMs, I wonder if that was just too much or too many things going on for them to understand that that NOTAM was super critical to look at and understand that that wasn't going on.

But they need to know when are the parts going to be there, when will it be available.And I know for a fact that every airport that has this runway indicator system has backup lights, they have backup systems, they have backup generators for what needs to happen in these lights. It's that important that it's there. So the fact that this went for that many days without being addressed. Perhaps it was the holiday, maybe the guy that does this was off duty or something.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUJSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Donald Trump formally asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn an extraordinary ruling from the state Supreme Court in Colorado that ordered his name removed from the primary election ballot because he's an extra insurrectionists based on his actions around January 6 2021. Trump's lawyers say that the former president did not engage in insurrection, that the 14th Amendment of the Constitution doesn't actually mention the Office of the President and doesn't apply to Trump and that Congress, not the states should determine eligibility for the presidency. They argue, in our system of government of the people by the people and for the people, Colorado's ruling is not and cannot be correct. The Colorado ruling came in a number of lawsuits tied to the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution in the state of Maine. The Secretary of State's similarly ordered Trump's name removed for similar reasons, a decision that Trump is challenging. A number of other states have reached the opposite conclusion, and that increases the chances that the Supreme Court will take up the issue and try to settle once and for all for the first time whether the 14th Amendment applies to candidate for president. For now, Trump remains on the Colorado ballot while he continues this legal fight. We don't know how quickly this issue will be resolved. Colorado votes in March, Evan Perez, CNN, Washington.

MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: America is at a breaking point with record levels of illegal immigration. And today, we got a firsthand look at the damage and the chaos the border catastrophe has caused in all of our community. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We have a broken and migration system, that is the one single fact about which everyone agrees.",

It thrives in hospitals and nursing homes and it's responsible for 20 percent of all infections in intensive care units worldwide.CNN's Meg Tirrell has details on this new type of antibiotic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Antibiotic resistance is a huge problem. The researchers here actually refer to it as a silent pandemic. There are almost 3 million infections every year in the United States with microbes, either bacteria or other bugs that are resistant to drugs to treat them causing more than 35,000 deaths. And worldwide the numbers are even bigger an estimated 5 million deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance and that's expected to double by 2050. And so there are desperate needs for new medicine to treat these drug-resistant microbes. Now, this one particular bacteria is especially problematic. It's known as Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii. There is an acronym for that and it's CRAB. This is one that can affect patients in the hospital causing an estimated 8,500 cases per year in the U.S. and 700 deaths. And this is on the top of the list from the WHO and the CDC. A priority to try to find better drugs to treat it because as you can see there in the name it's resistant to an important class of medicines. Now, this very early research just published in the journal \"Nature\", these researchers from both the drug company Rosche and Harvard, has shown that they've come up with a potential new class of antibiotics that essentially gums up the mechanism of how this bacteria works, so that it causes the cell death essentially. And so it can overcome the problems with the resistance in this bacteria. So this is really early-stage research. It still needs to be borne out through many more years of clinical trials. But so far promising news, and we really need a lot more of it for this antibiotic resistance problem. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
