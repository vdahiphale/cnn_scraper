The local sheriff there, the Henry County sheriff identifying the suspect that they're trying to track down as Andre Longmore, a Hampton resident.This is a photo that investigators released just earlier this afternoon. A man believed to be in his early 40s and believed to be responsible for the deaths of at least four Hampton residents. Detectives believe that he opened fire shortly after about 10:45 this morning shooting and killing those people, three men and one woman and then fled, so investigators are trying to track him down. Now, first question, a possible motive. The local police chief says that it's still too early to say. However, he was also asked if there is a possible connection between the suspect and any of the four victims and the chief saying at this point, he does not believe that to be the case. Though it's still extremely preliminary. They're currently looking for him. He was last seen aboard a 2017 black GMC Acadia with a Georgia plates DHF 756. I want you to hear directly from the Henry County sheriff as he shared a message tonight with the community, but also aimed directly at the suspect that they're trying to find right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF REGINALD SCANDRETT, HENRY COUNTY, GEORGIA: This is an all hands on deck movement to make sure that we place Mr. Andre Longmore in custody. The Henry County sheriff's office is also offering a $10,000.00 reward for any information leading to the arrest and apprehension and prosecution of Mr. Longmore. If you see Mr. Longmore, please call 911. Do not approach him because he is known to be armed and dangerous. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A 59-year-old Manhattan architect, Rex Heuermann, he is now in custody charged in connection with three of the four murders. I guess, what was your reaction to this arrest when you heard about it, because it is -- it is always something remarkable, something to note when a cold case of this magnitude, potentially has been solved. O'TOOLE: Yes, when I saw it starting to appear on the news yesterday, law enforcement seemed to be very confident about what was happening, and that usually suggests that they've got some powerful evidence. And when you use the term powerful evidence, you're talking about DNA evidence, circumstantial evidence, to effect an arrest like this would not be happening. So I knew at that point, they had strong physical evidence, and that could only come by using current technology, current forensic technology applied to old evidence, and that suggests that they had been working on this very aggressively for quite some time, and in fact, that's the case.",

Authorities say he also compulsively searched for pictures of the victims and their relatives in order to locate them.From your experience, how unusual is the suspect's profile? I mean, those are some details that are very disturbing. O'TOOLE: Yes. I know it may appear to be unusual, but when you're talking about a serial sexual killer, someone that murders other people for sexual gratification, these are the cases where the offender follows their case in the media, no matter how old it is. So the word of compulsion is actually a very accurate word, so he wanted to monitor the investigation, that's number one. But number two, he also wanted to more than likely relive the case and relive the experiences, and I think that's what was behind the follow-up phone calls to one of the members of the victim's families in order to hear the fear and the sense of being distraught on the other end of the telephone. Those all gave him a sense of excitement and sometimes even sexual excitement, so he was reliving these cases, despite how old they were.",

We had heard from the Belarusian Ministry of Defense that had also said that Wagner fighters were in their country and training some of their soldiers.But the Pentagon says that the majority of the Wagner mercenaries who took part in that failed insurrection on June 24, that they're back in Russian occupied Ukraine, but not really do anything, not taking part in the fighting against Ukrainian forces. Meanwhile, it does appear that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to weaken Wagner and weaken its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, splitting him from his men. He said in a remarkable interview to a Russian newspaper, Kommersant, that Wagner simply doesn't exist. He appeared to be trying to make two points. One that legally speaking mercenary groups are not allowed in Russia, but also that Wagner as we've known it as a fighting force in Ukraine no longer exists. This is the quote in the newspaper: \"We do not have a law for private military organizations. It simply does not exist.\" The group exists, but legally it does not exist, which of course Jim is rather confusing. Putin then goes on to detail a remarkable meeting that took place five days after the insurrection at the Kremlin, which Yevgeny Prigozhin is getting a promotion attended along with around three dozen of his commanders. Putin told the men that they could keep fighting in the Russian military under their current commander if they wanted to. And when they started nodding, according to Putin, that's when Prigozhin piped up saying no, the guys do not agree with this decision. So apparently an open disagreement by Prigozhin to Putin. Meanwhile, here in Ukraine, the counteroffensive is continuing making some progress according to Ukrainian officials, but moving very slowly. We have spoken with soldiers at the front, a general who is in charge of much of this southern front and we've also heard from a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today. All of them expressing optimism and saying that they do expect to do well, but at the same time in the face of fierce Russian resistance and massive minefields that the fight is going very slowly and progress is extremely modest according to the senior advisor, Andrii Yermak.

Screen Actors Guild president, Fran Drescher, said this. We quoteCNN's Jon Sarlin joins us now. He's a host of CNN's Business' Nightcap. Jon, great to see you. Drescher also called AI an existential threat to creative professions. A lot of folks are wondering about the implications, the far reaching implications of this technology. I had never thought about the possibility that this could affect writers and actors, but I guess it very well could.",

Well, we haven't really seen that emerge.But what we have seen in the last few years is this incredible technological advancements when it comes to generative AI in the sense that now white collar workers and creative workers like actors and writers are fighting to protect themselves from companies who could be looking to replace flesh and blood workers with AI. Now, shortly after the actor strike was announced the SAG negotiators came out and rejected the studio's AI proposal saying that with that proposal, for example, a background actor could be hired for a day's work, have their face scan and then that likeness will be used in perpetuity. Now, the studios push back on that characterization. They said it was false. They said their proposal would only permit a company to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed. But as you mentioned, Fran Drescher is saying or at least framing this argument not just about the actors, but that the actors are on the front line for all labor to ensure protections. And it's interesting that right now this backlash that we're seeing against AI, we really haven't seen before. Go back to 2016, right? There was widespread criticism of Facebook and digital platforms for allowing disinformation to spread on their platforms during the 2016 election. But we didn't see boots on the streets there like we're seeing now with Sag and WGA. So just as this technology is unprecedented, this growing backlash against it is also unprecedented.",

I can understand the danger there.Switching gears, Jon, new information tonight about Twitter's financials. What did Elon Musk say on Twitter? Was this just an attempt to gin up traffic on his site, because it does sound serious.",
