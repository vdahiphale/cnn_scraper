      "sentences": "All right. Coming to you live from New York, I am Zain Asher.We do, of course, begin with some major breaking news. We are waiting any moment now. U.S. President Joe Biden is going to speak. He's going to deliver mark -- remarks about the major prison exchange that is taking place right now that has freed four Americans who have been held in Russia. Among those who are now coming home, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, he's coming home also. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter, Evan Gershkovich as well. Remember, both of these men had been accused of spying, something that both of them have long denied. Also set free were two Russian-Americans who have been critical of Vladimir Putin. All of them now in the U.S. custody after being flown from Moscow to Ankara. The families, specifically of Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, are at the White House right now. They're meeting with President Biden. President Biden, as I mentioned, is about to speak any moment now. This is the largest prisoner swap between Washington and Moscow since the end of the Cold War. It includes 26, 26 different individuals from seven different countries. I want to get more now in terms of reaction from Washington. Joining us live now is Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, this is a major feat of U.S. diplomacy. We're learning new details here, particularly that President Biden was actually working the phones to secure this release in the hours before he abandoned his reelection bid. Just really shows you just how much of a priority this was for him, both personally and also for his legacy as well. What more do we know at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, we know that they were engaged in intense diplomatic negotiations, certainly in the last few weeks anddays, but also over the last few years. As you mentioned there, only an hour before he put out a letter saying he was withdrawing from the presidential race, just a couple of weeks ago, is also when he was working the phones to try to secure a deal. Again, what we could anticipate hearing from the president today is just how important his own relationships with world leaders have been in trying to secure the release of Americans wrongfully detained in Russia. But before I get to that, of course, if you recall in December of 2022, with the release of Brittney Griner, the president at the time acknowledged that not included in that deal was Paul Whelan. And he said at the time that the family likely had mixed emotions that day. And ever since then, administration officials have been trying to include him in a deal because they had hoped that would be the case with Griner and it wasn't. And so that is what we are seeing come to fruition today. Now, in a statement that the president released before we hear him speak directly, he said, quote, the deal that, excuse me, that secured their freedom was a feat of diplomacy. All told, we've negotiated the release of 16 people from Russia, including five Germans and seven Russian citizens who are political prisoners in their own country. Some of these women and men have been unjustly held for years, all have endured unimaginable suffering and uncertainty. And, importantly, here the president says, today, their agony is over. Of course, the president has been meeting with family members of the Americans released at the White House this morning. And we will hear from him directly in only moments. This is an approach that he also took with the release of Brittney Griner, where he, excuse me, also met with her family.",

And just him and his family talking about feeling abandoned during those moments. The Biden administration has come out and said multiple times, this isn't about favoritism. This isn't about sort of choosing one American over the other. They talked about the fact that the Russians were treating Paul Whelan's case very differently from Brittney Griner's case. Just explain to us what changed in terms of that dynamic.",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly what changed is this became a much bigger deal beyond just Russia and theUnited States. I think there was an acceptance early on here in the U.S. that the U.S. simply didn't have enough to get its big -- to get the prisoners it wanted out of Russia. So it had to go elsewhere and look around the world. This is literally what happened by State Department officials, intelligence officials. They started talking to allies and partners around the world about Russians who they had in their -- in their custody so that they could create this multilateral deal. You're absolutely right. It must have been absolutely crushing. We know it was for Paul Whelan. I mean, Paul called our colleague, Jennifer Hansler, multiple times from that Russian penal colony, and he really said two things, you know, I do feel like I'm being left behind and he was obviously horribly torn up about that. But at the same time, happy to see his fellow citizens being released and didn't begrudge them that. I think there was a lot of debate when the Griner-Bout trade happened, you know, debate whether or not there shouldn't have been more American prisoners released alongside Brittney Griner because Viktor Bout was such a valuable prisoner for the Russians, at least. And so after Viktor Bout was released, then the Russian goal was to get Krasikov released by the Germans. And that was a really hard task for the Americans. They really had to apply a lot of pressure on German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to release Krasikov. And then when he finally relented, that was just one part of this huge deal. But Paul Whelan was very much at the top of the list alongside Evan Gershkovich, you know, because he had been in prison for so long. He was arrested back in 2018. He's been in custody for the past five and a half years, convicted in 2020 to 16 years. And he's been serving in a really, really tough penal colony and suffering all kinds of health issues. And so it's obviously a tremendously happy day to see him and Evan Gershkovich on their way back to the United States alongside many others. And I should just note, finally, you know, this is not a one-for-one deal. It's a little bit lopsided. Of the 24 prisoners, you have 16 who are coming out of Russia and eight who are going to Russia.

      "sentences": "So that's unclear, though I'm sure we will hear more from them when they are back state side.But I do want to take you behind the scenes a little bit in terms of what diplomatic sort of flexors had to be made here for President Biden to secure the release of these Americans. He took it to the highest level. He took it directly to Chancellor Scholz. What we're learning is that in January, he had a phone call with the Chancellor discussing this trade with Russia. Then later, when the two met in the Oval Office in February, this was brought up again. This was something that was essentially worked on at the very highest level between these two world leaders. And what senior administration officials have stressed is that it was because of the relationship that the president has with world leaders, like Chancellor Scholz, that this was able to get done at all. And so this again is when we hear from the president something he himself may note and, of course, commend those world leaders for working with the U.S. and his -- and the alliances for having this come to fruition. Of course, this also comes during an election year. And so it's inevitable that there is a bit of a political backdrop to all of this. Former President Donald Trump had said earlier this year claimed that if he was elected again, that he would be the one responsible for bringing Evan Gershkovich back home. Of course, that's not the case. It's President Biden who did so. But in the moments to come, this could also extend to become a political discussion, especially because the administration has previously come under scrutiny over who it decides to hand over to the Russians to release Americans. So as we get more details, perhaps that becomes part of the dialogue, but there is no doubt that today the administration is certainly celebrating this. The vice president also just released a statement where she said, it gives me great comfort to know that their horrible ordeal is over and that they will soon be reunited with their families. Of course, the vice president is in Houston today. That's where she has been for political events and today to deliver eulogy for the late Sheila Jackson Lee. The last time when Brittney Griner was released, she was at the White House flanking President Biden when he delivered remarks.",

Ravi Agrawal is the editor-in-chief of \"Foreign Policy\" Magazine. He joins us live now from New York. Ravi, thank you so much for being with us. So about, I want to say three months or so ago, I spoke to a man named Jeremy Berke who was the former, remade and really good friend of Evan Gershkovich. And one of the things he said to me in that interview that I thought was really interesting, is that oftentimes, Evan would often joke about the possibility that one day he could be detained in Russia. And it was just a joke. You know, it was this sort of joke that friends make in jest. Normally, and I was saying to him, normally when you joke about the worst possible thing happening, normally, it never actually happens. And this is one of those rare occasions where these two jokes about the worst possible thing happening and it actually happened. Evan certainly was not naive to the possibility and to the risks as a Western journalist in Russia. He also wrote on social media back in 2022, reporting on Russia is now also a regular practice of watching people you know get locked away for years. None of us are naive. We certainly went before. We are certainly not anymore. But what do Western journalists risk by reporting in Russia, Ravi? RAVI AGRAWAL, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FOREIGN POLICY: Oh, so much.

The sham trials and sham courts have become so clear for the rest of the world to see. Those are the risks you take on. I want to add one more point here as we wait for President Biden to make his remarks here. This is, in many ways, a triumph of multilateralism. The fact that so many other countries were involved, Germany, we heard earlier, where a personal connection between President Biden and Chancellor Olaf Scholz led to Germany making what must have been for them a very difficult decision to give up someone they spent a hard time capturing, a hardened Russian colonel who killed someone in open daylight. To release someone like that, it takes political capital, it takes diplomatic capital. The involvement of other countries, Slovenia, Norway, Turkey, which has been front and center in the negotiations, all of that is a triumph of multilateralism for the United States to be able to call in favors, to be able to speak to allies and friends and say, look, these are pretty much unprecedented circumstances. These are the only chips we could potentially use to release people who have done no wrong. And for those countries to then step up and help is a big thing. You can imagine in the coming days, the Harris campaign and the Biden administration will make this point very clear because this is an election year, the contrast between what they are offering in terms of an American vision of a multilateral order, an order that is based on rules. That will be contrasted. I think they will try to make this contrast with a potential Trump administration, which often likes to see the world in more transactional terms, more business terms. And you would imagine in such a world, it is harder to make these kinds of treaty chess deals that involve friends and allies that have to make tough choices.",

He was doing that on the campaign trail before withdrawing from thepresidential race, but it's also been a big theme of his presidency and the way that he has been able to reassure allies and also reassert leadership on the world stage. And so it was notable that in celebrating the release of these Americans, he was also talking about how important it is to have friends around the world. He said, quote, our alliances make people safer. And it's notable because former President Donald Trump and Republicans have sort of moved toward a more isolationist policy. And so this is the president essentially reasserting the position that the U.S. needs to have strong alliances and work with its partners to have moments like this, remarkable moments like this, that lead to this historic prisoner swap. So aside from that, however, the president was reflecting on what a day this has been, that the Americans were out of Russia, they were flown to Turkey, and that they would soon be wheels up to greet their families here in the United States. He described, quote, incredible relief among families. Remember earlier this morning, he was with those family members, meeting with them at the White House. They flanked him there as he spoke. And he said that the allies stepped up, talking about Norway, Slovenia, and Poland, and Germany. And we know that this was something that the president took all the way up himself to Chancellor Scholz in January in a phone call, then later in a meeting. So this was something that was worked on at the highest levels. It was also something that was kept close to the vest as they tried to secure the release of these Americans, two high-profile ones, Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. He walked through the ordeal that they all went through and said, quote, their brutal ordeal is over. Now toward the end there, he was asked by reporters whether this improves their relationship with Russia at all, whether it indicates any type of breakthrough. He didn't answer that directly. And he also said that he doesn't need to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But essentially looking at this from the 30,000-foot view and from the president's legacy, again, he has always cited his foreign policy chops during the course of his presidency. This is a moment, a historic one, where the president was leaning on that and his relationships with world leaders to bring this deal to fruition. But he's also making note of the fact that the allies stepped up to also have it come together. So the president, the vice president, all celebrating this moment today as they look to welcome the Americans when they arrive here to the United States.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. I think that personal relationship does make a difference behind the scenes. You have to imagine that there is a give andtake. I mean, to put in context what you're saying, when any country spends so much time and energy and resources to try and capture someone who has committed a crime on your soil or nearby, it is very hard to then undo all of that work. And so for America to go to Germany and say, I know how hard it was to capture this person. I know what he means to you. And we still want you to give this person up for a higher cause to release Americans, but also Germans and also other people, including Russians. And that is the contrast of this moment that makes it so telling, so historic. The parallels with the Cold War are very clear here. And it also, I think, is something that the Biden administration, which is a lame duck presidency at this point, is going to point to as a real achievement for their diplomacy, which is not over one day or one week or months, but much longer, especially with Germany, where there is a lot of give and take in the US-German relationship. For all the people in the United States who call into question whether the United States should help Ukraine more rather than less, whether America should focus on China instead of Europe. This, in some senses, is one part of that puzzle as well, where appearing to be a solid ally to Germany and to Europe, pays dividends in ways that we sometimes can't see in a pure zero-sum transactional way, which of course, the Biden administration and the Harris campaign now will try to contrast with the Trump campaign. I alluded to this earlier before we heard President Biden speak, and lo and behold, that is exactly the line that he was trying to put forward. And you can imagine now the Trump campaign, this is an election year after all, will be at pains to try and explain their side of this. But really, in this moment, a triumph of diplomacy. And I should also point out, as all of us are trying to figure out Vice President Kamala Harris's involvement in the Biden administration's foreign policy, it is worth pointing out she has been to the Munich Security Conference for the last few years. This is a small security conclave that many defense ministers and spy chiefs from around the world attend, also world leaders, and a small selection of journalists. I too have attended over the last few years. And I can imagine that Vice President Kamala Harris will point to her relationship with the Germans as well. And with this network of European spy chiefs, European diplomats, all of whom have likely played some role behind the scenes in the negotiations, in the tough choices that needed to have been made for this moment to arrive.",

      "sentences": "All right. It is an extraordinary moment in history, years in the making. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter Evan Gershkovich, former AmericanMarine, Paul Whelan, and Russian-American journalist, Alsu Kurmasheva, are now back to the -- on their way back to the U.S. They were part of a massive prisoner exchange between the United States and Russia, the largest since the end of the Cold War. Their families are at the White House right now along with President Biden. They spoke to their loved ones on the phone just a short time ago. Turkey which played a mediator role, says the swap involved 26 people from seven countries including two children. I want to bring in Jennifer Hansler. She's been in touch with Paul Whelan several times during his time in prison. I mean, this is a remarkable moment for Paul, for his family, especially given the fact that he's been left behind multiple times. Brittney Griner released a memoir earlier this year where she talked about what it was like. And it is so hard to fathom what the experience of being held in a Russian prison is actually like. Brittney Griner said that she had suicidal thoughts. Obviously has the PTSD. She was given toothbrush, a toothpaste, toilet paper. That was it. She said that in terms of being sentenced to hard labor on a penal colony, that was the first time that she actually understood what it was like to be a slave. That is what people, these Americans are being held in Russia are dealing with. Those are the sorts of experiences they're dealing with. Just talk to us about what Paul Whelan said to you about his own experiences.",

He's not part of the swap at all. I'm sure his family members are really disheartened by that. All right. Jennifer Hansler, live for us there. Thank you so much. We'll be right back with more.

And you're right, you know, it's psychological counseling. It's evaluating them physically. Because especially with Paul Whelan. That's an issue. He actually was sick. I believe he had some surgery, which he said was not adequate. So definitely, you know, officials are going to want to know, are they OK? And then there's that period. And Brittney Griner, you related -- you recounted what happened to her. She spent some time there and said that it was very important for her to get grounded and back. And, you know, on some type of even plateau before going home. There is going to be enormous interest in both of them. And then Alsu Kurmasheva, who was released as well. But there would be enormous interest. A lot of, you know, interest in having interviews with them. And it's going to be a very, very different life then, I think. And then I don't think, saying that we can forget, that there are -- you know, there's at least one other American, and that is Marc Fogel, the teacher who taught in Moscow. He was not released. And so there's another side to this. You know, there obviously is a lot of joy. But they're -- they -- Russia is still holding at least another American. And we'll have to see. The State Department may try to go and get him out or, you know, have negotiations, but that didn't work this time. And I'm sure it's very difficult for the family.",

Nic, my producer just got into my ear to tell me that we do have a photograph, actually, to share with our audience of Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich, just as they were freed. There they are, of course, holding the American flag. This is a photograph that was released on Twitter by a colleague of Evan Gershkovich at the \"Wall Street Journal.\" We don't have details yet in terms of when exactly this photo was taken or where it was taken. But obviously, these two men have been through so much, Nick. I mean, yes, obviously Evan Gershkovich, but Paul Whalen, especially, because of the sheer length of time that he's been held in Russia. Talk to us about that.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And the way that he in particular has been manipulated, CNN's Jen Hansler, who was able totake calls from Paul Whelan in jail, often at times after, for example, when Brittney Griner was released after when Alexei Navalny was killed. And it was clearly a manipulation by the Russian authorities, by Vladimir Putin, to, you know, to have the voice of the person who got left behind criticizing. He wasn't criticizing his own government, of course, but talking about the plight that he was still being held, that he wasn't released, and the fears and concerns around that. Of course, you know, he -- in those interviews, he said he was very pleased for the people who were released. He has been manipulated. So when we talk about Brittney Griner going through that process, of going through this sort of de-imprisonment process, if you will, this obviously is something that can potentially be of huge value for him because the psychological stress is, as everyone knows, they're accumulative. These things accumulate on you. And the times that he has feared for his life, the times that he hasn't got the right food, the times that his health has been suffering and hasn't been adequately dealt with. All of that is going to add up. But obviously for his family, you know, they're with President Biden when President Biden was speaking earlier. A huge moment. So I think there are going to be a lot more moments like the pair of them there Evan and Paul spending there holding the flag together. But I think everyone will understand that they're going to need to have quiet moments to go along with that as well, to decompress and feel at ease with their new environment. And for Paul who was there for so long, that's perhaps going to be the hardest, not to be in a prison, to be able to control your own life, to be able to have access to what you want, to be able to talk to whom you want and when you want. And these are going to be alien entirely to him at the moment.",

And let's just think about where these jails are and what happens in Russian jails. I mean, how do you know about the, you know, the sanitary processes that have gone on in preparing your food, for example, or anything about your care and custody? None of it is inside of your control. The prison that Paul Whelan was kept in was in the absolute sort of wilderness. And miles, hundreds of miles from anywhere. You are mentally isolated. You are physically isolated. You are physically worn down, you know, by the work that you have to do. That's been described by Brittney Griner. This is extreme. It's not -- we can be pretty sure the prisoners that are going back to Russia, these spies and cryptocurrency manipulators and other people, they will not have been treated that way. They will have had a humane treatment within the prison systems of the countries that they've been detained in, whether it's Norway or Slovenia or the United States or wherever. Entirely different.",
