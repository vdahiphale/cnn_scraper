      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, the U.S. says North Korea's leader KimJong-un may meet Russian President Vladimir Putin soon to discuss a possible arms deal. How worrying would an agreement be? And hours after Spain's women's national team head coach Jorge Vilda was fired, the country's local federation announces a woman will now lead the World Cup winning team for the first time. Plus, former White House  Chief of Staff Mark Meadows pleads not guilty in the election interference case in Georgia as he tries to move his case out of state and into federal court. We have all the very latest for you. Well, as soon as next week, Vladimir Putin could host face-to-face talks with a leader who rarely ever leaves his own country in hopes of gaining more firepower for the war in Ukraine. U.S. officials say North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may travel to Russia to discuss a potential arms deal. They warned that negotiations have been actively advancing since Russia's defense minister visited Pyongyang, if you remember, back in July. For the U.S. and its allies, this news is troubling while on multiple fronts, not only are they worried that Russia could fuel its war machine with fresh artillery and other weaponry, but they're also worried about what North Korea, I should say, could get in exchange. Well, the Kremlin isn't commenting on these reports, but it's no secret that North Korea wants technology that could advance its own military capabilities, including the ability, of course, to produce nuclear-powered submarines. CNN's Paula Hancocks begins our coverage in Seoul tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The first and last meeting between the current leaders of Russia and North Korea was more than four years ago. Since then, Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and his military efforts are faltering. So, for Kim Jong-un, the power dynamics have changed.",

And in essence, Putin has been in a position whereby he is not aspowerful as he used to be, and therefore needs to take what he can from neighbors and friends, and give what they need. We've seen that with Iran, we've seen it with China buying cheaper gas and electricity. Specifically now, he is in a war of attrition with Ukraine, which means both sides using massive amounts of ammunition, and we know Putin has got his armaments factories up working 24 hours a day, some of them to produce more weapons and more ammunition. North Korea has the same type of weapons 152 millimeter-artillery, 122-millimeter artillery that Putin's troops are firing in masses in Ukraine. He needs more of them. North Korea borders Russia. There is a train line that links North Korea effectively through the -- all the way across Russia to Ukraine. So the ammunition is there that Putin desperately needs in a war of attrition. He cannot let his sort of fire rates fall because that gives the Ukrainians an advantage when they're pushing. And the North Koreans also want technology that Russia has. Satellite technology, nuclear-powered submarine technology. And we know Kim Jong-un is willing to spend massively on his armaments, and he has an opportunity now to take advantage of a weaker Putin --",

I know that Jake Sullivan just beenspeaking, give us a sense of what he's been saying. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they actually have used that exact word. They've called this desperation on behalf of Russia. The fact that they're going back to North Korea to get additional ammunition that they need on the battlefield is significant here. It demonstrates that Russia, you know, doesn't really have many other options. And so, they have over the course of the last few months carried out a number of engagements that appear to be, you know, building towards this end, which U.S. officials say it's a new deal, a new agreement between the two countries that would provide a significant amount of ammunition to Russia, that could be used in multiple different kinds of Russia's weapon systems. So, that's significant and the other aspect that U.S. officials say would likely be involved in this deal would be raw materials for Russia's defense sector. And as you said, the National Security Council -- the National Security adviser -- excuse me, Jake Sullivan, was just speaking to reporters at the White House, and he said that, the fact that Russia is going to North Korea at this time, you know, seeking out the support is demonstrative of how effective the sanctions have actually been. That they would need these raw materials for their defense sector and the like. So we continue to watch, you know, when this potential meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Putin could actually happen. \"The New York Times\" has reported that it could happen as soon as, you know, the coming weeks in Vladivostok, and we should note that Kim Jong-un has actually traveled there in the past, and he's traveled by train as -- they said it's actually, you know, a pretty close location to North Korea, all things considered.",

What this tells us is that the war is not ending this Summer. The war is going to go on through the Winter. This war will be -- being fought next year. This is what Putin is making sure that he's capable of doing. His leadership and perhaps more is at stake here for this. If he fails in Ukraine, failure of his leadership, and you know, best guess of what could happen to him has been pretty tough and mean all round.

One that has only been made closer by the war in Ukraine. And Cuba support up until now, of Russia essentially, parodying Russian propaganda line, saying that the war is the fault of the West, of NATO and the U.S. for essentially pushing Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine. But the statement also laying out that Cuba does not allow its citizens to serve in the armed forces of other countries to essentially work as mercenaries, and then they will not allow people either working from Russia or here with in Cuba, to try and recruit its citizens. This is not that much of a surprise because Russian outlets had been putting out the pictures of Cubans that had been recruited now four months, saying that they pay them up to $2,000 a month, and will give them Russian citizenship. You know, put that in context, $2,000 is more than a doctor makes in Cuba, and here, so it's very tempting in the midst of a severe economic crisis if you're going to try to recruit soldiers. And so, is this a question of deniability? Is this a question of Cuba trying to distance itself from what -- something its ally is doing, or is it just that Cuba does not want its citizens to become cannon fodder? And that, certainly, when you have some young Cubans who don't even appear to have any kind of military experience, are trapped in the middle of a war zone and saying that they're being mistreated and they've been lied to, and that they've been forced to go to the frontline.

But the Cuban government says they simply don't allow this to happen, that they don't allow their citizens to fight for other countries.

And we've seen really increase not in justthe number in their regularity and their reach actually, over the course of the last few days and weeks. But also in the openness with which Kyiv would acknowledge that they are behind them, Isa, and I think that's interesting. It shows certainly that Russia feels that as far as their infrastructure, some of those drones are getting through, enough of them that they feel they have to take measures, however makeshift, shoving some tires onto their equipment, it is nonetheless a protective measure. And as to the point you made earlier about what Sergei Shoigu has been saying about the counteroffensive. I think there is some truth in the fact that the fog of war, the fact that neither side is particularly transparent on what is going on in the counteroffensive does make it very difficult to see what is going on still. What we are hearing from sources both on the Ukrainian side and the Russian side is news of extremely intense battles, a very fluid situation. Positions being -- going from one side to the other very quickly, fierce fighting to the east of Robotyne towards Verbove, fierce fighting as well to the south. And what we have been able to do is speak to some of those men who have been responsible for the liberation of Robotyne, and that is at least one village, that is now certainly in Ukrainian hands.

For the last 24 hours, torrential rains have caused flash flooding affecting homes as well as roads, according to the fire brigade, one man died after a wall collapsed. The storm has officially been named Daniel by weather service in southeast Europe. The center of the storm is moving into the Mediterranean Sea. But more rain and flooding is expected over the next 24 to 48 hours. Meanwhile, in Spain, three people have been confirmed dead in the province of Toledo after heavy rains from another storm flooded the area. Let's get more on this dangerous weather that we're seeing in Europe. Let's go to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers in Atlanta. And Chad, our viewers remember this, it was only what?

Some of the defendants want a speedy trial as soon as next month. Others like former president Trump, arguing the trial should be years in the future.
