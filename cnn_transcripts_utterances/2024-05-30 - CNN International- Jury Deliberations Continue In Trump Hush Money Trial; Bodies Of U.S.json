This morning, at the jury's request, key testimony from \"National Enquirer\" publisher David Pecker, and Trump's former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen was re-read in the courtroom. The judge in the case, Juan Merchan, also read back parts of his instructions to the jury, ever since the jury sounded the buzzer this time yesterday as they do when they have questions or requests, their request to re-hear testimony, jury instructions have been heavily scrutinized. Why do they want in particular, that testimony from Pecker and Cohen again is as good or bad for the prosecution just when, of course, will they deliver a verdict? We don't know the answers to those questions. We do know what the questions are and what the answers were to at least their requests for particular testimony and instructions. Jessica Schneider joins me now. So, Jessica, a section of the jury instructions focusing on what in particular?",

What they could infer from that. Michael Cohen pleading guilty, what they could infer from that. I mean, I think what this read back this initial -- these two initialnotes from the jury and the read back that happened this morning. I think it just shows you how complicated of a taste this is. This was a lot of information over the course of five weeks given to this jury and the way they have to break it down based on these jury instructions is they have to find that, there was this falsification of business records, whether or not Donald Trump directed it or was at least a part of it. That's the first part. And then they have to say but he did that in part with the intent to commit another crime --",

Now for some legal analysis, criminal defense attorney, former prosecutor Joey Jackson, and attorney jury consultant Linda Moreno. Good to have you both on. So I want to read first the sections of testimony that was re-read back to the jurors today. A piece of testimony from David Pecker and a piece of testimony from Michael Cohen first, and we can put this up on the screen. This from David Pecker, asked, why did you reach out to Michael Cohen when you learn that Stormy Daniels had a story involving sexual fidelity with Mr. Trump? The answer: Based on our mutual agreement back in August 2015, any stories concerning Mr. Trump? There would be very embarrassing. They immediately then heard testimony on the same topic from Michael Cohen. Question, was there anything else that Mr. Pecker said he could also do for Mr. Trump's candidacy? Yeah was the answer. What, in substance, did he say? What he said was that he could keep an eye out for anything negative about Mr. Trump and that he would be able to help us to know in advance what was coming out and try to stop it from coming out. Notably when the witnesses delivered that testimony, Joey Jackson, they were days apart now, the jurors are hearing them together and both tell a similar story of an agreement during the campaign to catch and kill stories. And I wonder the significance in your view of the jury focusing on those two pieces of testimony?",

Good point.So, Linda Moreno, I want to get back to another piece that the jury had re-read to them by the judge today, and that relates to this rain metaphor. I want to get to the significance of it, but, but first, let me read this section that they had read back to them. For example, suppose you go to bed one night when it is not raining and when you wake up in the morning, you look out your window. You do not see rain, but you see that the street and sidewalk are wet and that people are wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas. Under those circumstances, it may be reasonable to infer, that is conclude, that it rain during the night? In other words, the fact of having of it having rained while you were asleep is an inference that might be drawn from the proven facts or the presence of the water on the street and the sidewalk, people in raincoats carrying umbrellas, et cetera. Tell us the legal significance of this because, of course, the judge and jury, they don't care about a rainstorm. They care about whether a crime was committed. Is the judge communicating to the jury here? In effect, and to borrow another bad metaphor if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck, right? That if, if you have a lot of things around it that maybe there was a crime committed. Is that how you read that?",

You want to kill it. You don't want to hurt your chances in election. It's the law, right, particularly for non-lawyers like myself. That's a little bit complicated. So seeing as I got to lawyers on television right now, Linda Moreno, let's go back to another piece of the law that the jury asked to be read to them today. And this is the part of the law that would ray -- that raises the charges to a felony. Quote, for the crime of falsifying business records in the first degree, the intent to defraud must include an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof. Under our law, although the people must prove an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof, they need not prove that the other crime was in fact committed, aided, or concealed.

If you've find that because Mr. Trump caused the falsifications of the records and had an intent to do so that there was this overriding goal here, which was to capture the presidency then the jury doesn't have do actually decide which means that they used in order to do that.And I think they're going to talk a lot about that particular jury instruction, but it is a gift to the prosecution that the jury does not have to be unanimous on the particular means that that are involved but I want to say one thing about, about notes. I think that notes tell you what yours are talking about, but they don't necessarily tell you what they're actually thinking. And I predict that they're going to be more questions and more notes, probably not a reread a jury instructions but perhaps more of the cross-examination of some of the other witnesses. So I think we have to be careful and not engage in fortune-telling hour based on -- based on the notes because as I said, it doesn't tell you what they're thinking, but it does tell you what's going on in the room, what they're discussing.",

Some 80 percent of the city is thought to be controlled by gangs, and it's impossible -- it's highly dangerous to move large parts of the city and move around large parts of the city. And it's impossible to move through some roads that are gang-controlled and where you run the risk of kidnap or extortion or worse. So what we understand is that to bring Davy and Nathalie's bodies and to get them on this plane safely home, U.S. officials had to work with Haitian authorities to secure special permissions to be able to move the bodies without complete embalming because there aren't those facilities in Haiti now, that has been under attack by gangs for so long. There are also special permissions they needed to be able to get to remove the bodies from the crime scene begin with and a lot of that kind of bureaucracy. Beyond that, we know that there was a lot of concern about whether they would even be able to remove Davy and Nathalie's remains from the crime scene because of a fear that gangs would either take the bodies hostage and hold them for a ransom from the families or that they would desecrate them. And so, to do that, they had to -- they had to get on the phone or they had to have intermediaries get on the phone.

It all dates back to over three years ago, January of 2021 when 47 pro-democracy figures were arrested in a dawn raid. They were charge of conspiracy to commit subversion, which is a serious crime here in Hong Kong under the national security law, is punishable by up to life in prison. They are accused of staging and unofficial primary vote, which was deemed illegal by authorities here. Now, the national security law was imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong in 2020, in the wake of the massive anti-government protests of 2019.

And in one case, like you said, he alleges that Donald Trump used the N-word when discussing a runner up in 2004, Kwame Jackson. He used the N-word according to this producer to describe that person saying that he wasn't sure America has ready for a Black person to win that show. And obviously, Kwame Jackson ended up being the runner up. This is not a new allegation by any means. The Trump campaign is denying it, of course, saying it's outrageous and B.S. But Omarosa, who is a contestant also on \"The Apprentice\" back in the day has made the allegation before and she said that she even watched a tape and saw a tape of this. And so, this is something that Trump campaign has had to grapple with, and they've, you know, throughout the years denied it. The other allegation, Jim, that is in this is that Donald Trump's a treatment of female employees. In one case, Bill Pruitt, the producer, says that he witnessed Trump reject working with a female camera woman because he said she was too heavy -- too heavy, was in quotes there, and that he found another camera woman that he thought was, quote, a beautiful woman, and said, quote, that's all I want to look at and insistent on working with her. And so, these allegations of sexism and racism behind the scenes on \"The Apprentice\" are coming out today after this producer is no longer bound by this non-disclosure agreement.

It was probably thrown away or it was probably burned because no one wanted to have people who are trying to protect Donald Trump at the time and probably forever more burned it.But this underscores, Jim, something that we all know about this man. The reason that I think it will be impactful is because we've all talked about how there is some voter forgetfulness, if you will, right? Some, some kind of PTSD where voters kind of have forgotten just how much of a racist and the misogynist Donald Trump is, just how much of crazy chaos, confusion, and corruption he brought the first four years in office.

I think President Biden, if I were advising him as Republicans advice here, I would say you need to speak a little more concretely to Black men and maybe Black men only on economics.You need to sort of take away the message that Trump has been able to say two Black men, but you're not doing as well as you could be doing under Biden and of the Biden administration. And I've had advised, I actually had a conversation with someone that's on the campaign today. I said this is what I would do. I said I would spend a couple of weeks doing some rallies with Black men only, send the president to the barbershop, do some focus groups with some Black men and actually hear them out. I think that will move the needle, but I think this is a start. But again, to my point that I made earlier, this is disqualifying to me and I think if President Biden can talk about this and also make the connection to the economic issues. But I think that's the winning message.",

U.S. policy currently does not allow Ukraine to use U.S. weapons inside Russia. But there are some signs that position could be softening. CNN's Melissa Bell joins me now from Paris.

But that are on Russian soil.And what Secretary Blinken had to say was that, look, so far, the United States has followed and adjusted and adapted to changes on the battlefield. And he believed that that would continue to be the case. And whilst that doesn't signal a change of policy, it certainly signals that a change of policy might be possible.
