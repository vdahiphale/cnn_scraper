England scored six goals last game of five of different players none of which were Harry Kane. So, I'm a little concerned about that. But there is a silver lining, I will say. They did give up two goals against Iran. And so that backline of England is a little suspect at times.

These are people who -- they didn't break the law necessarily. Those are the people that he's going to allow back on, people who haven't broken the law but who have violated platform policies. And those are policies governing things, like spreading misinformation, the use of hate speech, and these people repeatedly broke those policies. I think that is important to highlight. This wasn't a one-time thing. For Twitter to permanently suspend an account, the person would have had to repeatedly break those policies. And it sounds like those are the people that Elon Musk is going to allow back on. Of course, it is unclear exactly like how many of these accounts will be permitted to come back on Twitter. Earlier last week or this week, it is hard to keep track these days with him, he said that right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, for instance, would not be allowed back on the platform. So, kind of unclear which accounts he's really referring to here. And that is sort of speaks to how he's been governing over at Twitter, not much transparency into what is going on, just really him ruling by tweet. I should also say, Jim, that next week as well, he says he's going to roll out the verification plan where you pay $8 for a blue badge. This comes after a few delays in that plan because people last time he rolled this out, in-person, in government accounts and others, I'll read you part of what he said. He said that -- he apologized for the delay and he said, we're tentatively launching verified on Friday next week. Hey says gold checks for companies, gray for government accounts, blue for individuals, celebrity or not, and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates, painful but necessary. That manual authentication obviously important after all those impersonation issues. Jim?",

Because you've seen some not so subtle indications from some western leaders, Americans, et cetera, about just how far Ukraine should set its ambitions at this point. Should it be happy with the lines as they existed in February of this year as opposed to where they existed in 2014?

That is not assured. Now, clearly, Ukraine has achieved some incredible tactical successes but Russia has this amazing and not surprising staying power. They refuse to engage the Ukrainians in direct tactical combat because they get kicked. They get kicked around.So, what they do is they offset and they use artillery to their great advantage and this has now become a test of wills. Russia is going after the infrastructure (INAUDIBLE) the power, they're going after the water, they have the ability. They've weaponized fuel and they've weaponized food. They're now weaponizing power. So, it now becomes who has got the staying power in order to accept what really is, I think, the instinct, I think we're seeing the conditions are being set and the Ukrainians are now creating the narrative for a very good negotiating position, whether it is a full negotiation or a ceasefire, which is, okay, we've Russians in about 15 percent of Ukraine.
