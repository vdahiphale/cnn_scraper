TIM WALZ (D-MN), DEMOCRATIC VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  He lost the election. This is not a debate. It's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world. Because look, when Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage. What I'm concerned about is, where is the firewall with Donald Trump? Where is the firewall if he knows he could do anything, including taking an election and his vice president's not going to stand to it? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I know where Trump is on this issue. So, if I were Vance, I would have said, look, we're going to utilize whatever legal mechanisms we have if we think there are questions.
