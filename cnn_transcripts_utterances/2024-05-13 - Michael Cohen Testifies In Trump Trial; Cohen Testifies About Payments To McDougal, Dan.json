      "sentences": "And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.And we continue to follow the breaking news out of Manhattan and where the man at the center of the hush money payments scandal is testifying right now in Donald Trump's criminal trial. Michael Cohen is detailing exactly how he came to pay $130,000 to adult film star and director Stormy Daniels, who came forward about an alleged episode with Donald Trump in the days before the 2016 election. Cohen testified not only did Trump know about the $130,000 payment, but Trump directly approved it and said that he would pay Cohen back. And the prosecution is using Cohen's testimony to present both an offensive and defensive case, offensively by establishing the Cohen was the man behind the payments, not just to Stormy Daniels, but also to 1998 playmate of the year, Karen McDougal, and defensively by trying to establish that Cohen frequently lie on behalf of Donald Trump, getting that out there ahead of time before the defense has their say, and by trying to corroborate nearly everything they can that Cohen says with actual factual evidence, text messages, emails, phone records. Let's get straight to CNN's Paula Reid. Paula what have been your biggest takeaways from Michael Cohen's testimony so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, this highly anticipated appearance by Michael Cohen on the stand has paid dividends for prosecutors so far. He told the jury that at long before Trump announced his candidacy for the White House, he was worried about stories from women and how they could come out and potentially impact his candidacy. Cohen testified that Trump told him, quote, you know, that when this comes out, meeting the announcement about his run for the White House, just be prepared. There's going to be a lot of women coming forward.Cohen then testified to how involved he was and suppressing negative stories about Trump in the lead up to the election. And that in the wake of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, how he personally similarly facilitated that payment to Stormy Daniels. But what was new -- what we haven't already heard so far in this trial is how involved Trump was. He testified that he constantly kept Trump updated on this ever to pay Stormy Daniels this hush money testified that he needed Trump's approval, is certainly wanted credit for getting the story suppress, but he described Trump as a micro-manager, testified to how in the loop he was. Now, he also testified that Trump promised he would get reimbursed. He said Allen Weisselberg, the former CFO of the Trump Organization, and I spoke to Mr. Trump. We expressed to him that I was going to front the money for the hush money to which he was appreciative. Any stated to me, don't worry, you'll get the money back. Now, in the timeline the testimony, we are in late 2016 right now, Cohen is expected to wrap up the next half hour or so. So we haven't quite gotten to 2017, which is, of course, when these documents at the heart of this case were allegedly falsified.",

He has been exclusively focused on this cross-examination.We can expect that this will go as long if not longer than the direct examination and it will be a multimedia presentation. Many of the things Cohen has said about Trump can and will be used against him. Really, Jake, the greatest challenge for prosecutors or excuse me, for defense attorneys is just calling down all of the statements, all of the attacks that Cohen has launched against the defendant in the past several years. Really, most of his identity is attacking Trump. So, defense attorneys are going to seize on that and try to paint him as a liar. Sure.

TAPPERIf they gave me the $180,000 and they didn't gross it up after taxes onto it, it would be $90,000, Cohen says. But, Bill, I suspect that you have a different take on how credible Mr. Cohen is seeming? WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I do, Jake, is surprisingly enough. I mean, this guy is a polluted source. He could be the dictionary photograph for polluted source. He's a narcissistic sycophant that put his star on Trump's wagon. And when he didn't get what he wanted, which was a D.C. job, he turned on him and now he's got an ax to grind. And, Jake, those jurors don't leave their common sense of the door. What they see a witness like Hope Hicks who apparently has no ax to grind, they take her testimony, has the ring of truth. This guy wrote a book called \"Revenge\". This guy, Michael Cohen is about Michael Cohen. He said earlier, I think in today's testimony from what we saw on the screen, he was hoping to monetize his role as the president's attorney.

But Trump told them he's not going to be attorney general and told them he's not even go into the White House.So an early December, this angers building and you get to crescendo with the bonus, but to go to the invoices, I call them the souffle invoices. They go from 130 to 420. I think that if the prosecutors explain this rationally and we common sense because I did a lot of tax cases and Cohen does reasonably well, I think they're going to get over that hurdle of connecting the invoices to the election interference.

Michael Cohen is testifying in Donald Trump's hush money cover-up trial in New York.Right now, Cohen is discussing how he was allegedly reimbursed for the $130,000 he paid Stormy Daniels in the days, right before the 2016 election. My panel's back with me. So one of the things going on right now, they have this intense examination, direct examination, not the difficult cross, but Cohen, when asked about the accounting being used, that I didn't really think about it. I just wanted to get my money back. At the time, Cohen says he thought he would get the $420,000 back in one lump sum. This $420,000 -- if you're wondering how 130,000 became 420, I think this is what it is. Okay? You start up with the $130,000 that they pay Stormy Daniels and there's some group called Red Finch (ph) Consulting that Michael Cohen hired to rig online polls at Donald Trump's the has again, nothing legal about that either. So that's 130 plus 50. That's $180,000. Then if they just give that money to Michael Cohen, he would have to basically pay taxes on tens of thousands of dollars of it. So they doubled it. So he gets back in net. If you remove the taxes, what he originally spent and then an additional 60, that gets you up to 380, and then additional thousand dollars because Allen Weisselberg felt bad that Michael Cohen got stiff that of a decent Christmas bonus.

We are told by people close to the former president that he was really upset that more people were not coming out to show their support for him. And also, that there weren't more protesters on his behalf in this courtyard across from the court house. Remember they have a special little area because siphoned off for these Trump protesters. There's only been about a handful, someday is one or two. Today we saw up to five of the sorry and flag, but not the kind of resounding support that he'd like to see out here, which is, of course, led to him continually saying they're not allowed close to the courthouse, even though we are doing directly across the street from the courthouse. So that led to his team creating a kind of situation within New York where he would go to locations, campaign events, in areas that because likely to get a very welcome crowd, including construction site. He met with a bunch of union workers, as well as laborers there. He went to a Harlem bodega, places he would get a good reception. That was in part a reaction to Donald Trump being upset about the lack of support here at the courthouse.

      "sentences": "Well, thank you for inviting me on Jake first, I have to tell you, I chuckle when I hear various pundits weighing in about how various witnesses like Michael Cohen are likely to be perceived by the jurors, and I presided over many criminal jury trials, some of them high-profile, and I stopped trying to second-guessed jurors. It -- you just -- just can't do it.So Michael Cohen testified today and this is one half of the case, meaning it's the prosecution side. We don't know how he will hold up in cross-examination. My guess is that he will be well-prepared. He's no dummy. He knows the questions that are likely to be asked to him. And that's why the prosecution went to some extent, maybe they should have done a little bit more talking about the bad stuff about Michael Cohen that he was the fixer and he considered himself in Trump's thug, those kinds of things, so that it won't hit the jurors brand new when the defense steps up. But so far, you know, we haven't -- we mustn't lose sight of and particularly as a judge, presiding, I'd hear all these various witnesses. You can't lose sight of why people are there in the courtroom and they're there in a courtroom because a crime or crimes are being alleged. And in this case is about the intent. So, if they've established and they will that documents were falsified, I think they will do that. Then the issue is and part of the crime is did Trump with knowledge of these falsified documents do it with the intent to commit amid another crime or to aid or conceal the commission of the crime. And so that's the issue here, the intent. And, you know, how do you prove intent, Jake? You can't unless you get inside somebody's head at the time. So we can't do it that way, then it's proved by circumstantial evidence. And in a trial court, circumstantial evidence is given the same weight as direct evidence. So that's really what this case is about. And Michael Cohen now is kind of pulling all the pieces together. So it is a fascinating story. It's very sad that these kinds of things were going on. But we've only heard part of it. The other part is going to come from the cross-examination of Mr. Cohen and whether or not any defense is put on at all.",

He is a loose cannon. And another point about that rant, he said, and I hope people listen very carefully, that there was no crime. He did not deny anything. He didn't deny the payment. He didn't deny the affair. He just said what I did was not a crime. So, it's very, very interesting. So I think its just proved that he is definitely not going to be testifying because he can't be controlled once he starts talking.",

So the witness testimony is really jurors or fact fighters.So they're gathering facts. They have documents, and now they're listening to the witnesses. So what the defense is going to do with Michael Cohen has tried to shake that testimony one, yes, credibility. But also, their position, and I think it's an unfortunate one is Donald Trump's position is none of this happened, nothing. He's just denying everything. So it's really going to be hard for them given the documentary evidence that's already in to show that Michael Cohen is a liar. I just think they want the jury to dislike him so much that they just don't want them to give me the time to him, in which case the case will fall apart.

And when Michael Cohen was talking about his bonus, he said that he was angry, even for myself, unusually angry about having his bonus cut by two-thirds. Trump had kind of laughed to himself and smiled and reacted to that, clearly suggesting he had some kind of memory of that. But throughout, Michael Cohen himself was very measured even when talking about some of these conversations, he spoke slowly. He was very deliberate in the words that he chose when he's answering these questions and we did not see any kind of reaction from him or him losing any cool while he was on the stand, Jake.",
