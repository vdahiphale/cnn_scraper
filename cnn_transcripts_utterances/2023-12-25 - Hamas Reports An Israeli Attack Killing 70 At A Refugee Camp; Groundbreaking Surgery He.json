But the Israeli military has said it is intensifying its operations inside Gaza, even as a humanitarian situation gets more dire by the day.Joining us now is senior international correspondent, Will Ripley. Will, what does it look like for those who are living there in Gaza right now? And knowing that, I know you went to the West Bank as well, just the reaction from people, and how they are trying to live through this?",

      "sentences": "Well, even though, you know, the global pressure is mounting on Israel to try and negotiate a cease-fire with Hamas, just yesterday, that attack that you just described could be one of our deadliest days in recent memory in this conflict because the death toll is being reported widely here is being even higher than the at least 70 that we have been able to officially confirm.So the situation is very dire. There is desperation that is evident everywhere. Who can forget this video that we saw come in from the Rafah crossing on Sunday, where these aid trucks, a convoy of aid trucks were essentially ambushed by a crowd of people, so desperate to get their hands on anything, because they are short on everything. They are short on food, they are short on water. They are short on medical supplies. They're short on supplies to build temporary tents to house their families, up until today, on this Christmas Day, the weather is nice. But, Sara, the last several days, it was a cold, whipping wind, thunderstorms, very heavy rain, enough to drench you to the bone if you stayed outside just for a few minutes, never mind if you are a family living out in the elements, exhausted, and starving, and having been told enough to pack up and move everything to a place that you don't know where it will be safe. And, yes, that is what happened when Israel announced it was expanding its military operation from the north into central Gaza, and into the south, telling people have already had to move two times, three times, they have to move yet again. But perhaps one of the biggest most pressing and urgent situations right now is the food situation, and a health care situation, according to the World Health Organization. Just listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN CASEY, W.H.O. EMERGENCY MEDICAL TERMS COORDINATOR:  Everybody who we speak to his hungry. There is the risk of a famine here in Gaza actually. And even here in the hospital, everyone says that they only have rice, they have very often only one meal a day. And they are hungry. I came into Gaza today, there was a challenge with the food we brought 41 hospital, it was taken along the road because people are so desperate for food. (EEND VIDEO CLIP)",

That's a really tough thing to do, given the way in which they've deployed themselves throughout different buildings that are there, even those that are standing in a complete fashion.You also look at the different tunnels that they have used, and you know, we're talking somewhere around 1500 different tunnel entrances that the Israelis have discovered. So this is the idea, of operationally controlled northern casa, something that they won't be able to achieve hundreds and certainty. And if they move to the south, the central parts, it's going to be even more difficult for Israelis to exercise complete control what any territory they've gained. They will exercise localized control, but complete 100 percent in total control will be impossible for them to achieve.",
