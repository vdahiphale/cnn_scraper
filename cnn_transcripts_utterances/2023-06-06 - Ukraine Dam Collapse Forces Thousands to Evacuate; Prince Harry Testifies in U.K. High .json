      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a major dam collapses in southernUkraine, forcing more than a 1,000 people to evacuate. We are on the ground in Kherson with the very latest for you. Then, a grueling first day on the witness stand for Prince Harry as he alleges a major U.K. newspaper group hacked his phone for years. Plus, a shock announcement in the world of sport as the U.S.-based PGA tour announces a partnership with Saudi-backed breakaway LIV Golf. We'll have the reaction to that and much more coming up. But first this evening, Moscow and Kyiv are trading blame after the breach of a critical frontline dam in southern Ukraine. Video posted earlier shows water surging through the remains of the Nova Kakhovka Dam on the Dnipro River. Ukraine's military says the Russians blew up the dam in a panic, and Russia's defense minister says Ukraine was responsible blowing up the dam to hold back the Russian army. But whether this is sabotage or unplanned structural failure, neither side is providing hard evidence to back up their claims. Well, the dam sits inside the Russian-occupied part of Kherson region, an up river from the Ukrainian-controlled Kherson city. What happened will be devastating for lives as well as livelihoods. And Ukrainian officials say around 1,500 people have already fled and some 80 settlements have been ordered to evacuate. Here's our residents who survived Russia's occupation are now describing the situation. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): You people sympathize with us. We were under occupation for nine months, now we have been flooded by these occupiers. We are now without electricity, without gas, without water. Our gardens were flooded, everything in the world, all our fences, the water is reaching up our houses, we are forced to evacuate.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): After the Nova Kakhovka Dam burst, water has been inundating villages around this area. We're in the south of Ukraine in the area around Kherson. And in fact, right now, I am in the city of Kherson. So as you can see, the water here is not only putting villages in the surrounding area underwater, but it's actually also inside the city itself. One of the things to be aware of is, in the very short time that we've been on the ground here, we could see this water already rise considerably. So what's going on right now is that the water level continues to go up as water is gushing from the Dnipro River here towards this city and towards other cities in the region as well. Now, we've been in touch with a local security service here, and they're telling us that everybody who works in this city, anybody who has any sort of role is helping to evacuate people from areas like over there. There are still hundreds of people who are trapped on their houses, some of them inside their houses, and everything is being mobilized right now. From boats to large trucks to try and get these people out. Again, hundreds of people have already been brought out, but at the same time, this is very much an ongoing operation. The folks here tell us that operation is going to continue to go on. Now, of course, all of this is a huge issue, and also a huge risk, not just as far as the environment is concerned, as far as this area is concerned. But of course, also, as far as the safety and security of the population here on the ground is concerned. The Ukrainians are extremely angry about this, they blame it squarely on the Russians, we've heard that the Russians for their part say that it was the Ukrainians. In any case, there are a lot of people here in this city and in the surrounding areas, who are suffering a great deal. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kherson, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He became known as the conscience of his sport because he was the most principled, the most outspoken. And just last month, he came into a press conference, and for the first time he said, I just don't want to talk about it anymore. It had started really weighing him down, and had started taking a toll on his game, the way he was playing. He wasn't getting the results he wanted. He said I'm done with talking about LIV. And perhaps, he knew what was coming. Maybe now we can understand that behind the scenes, he got word of this, and I can only imagine how he must feel for the stand he took, and to find out where we've all ended up anyway. I mean, some golfers, they were offered $75 million, $300 million, and they turned it down to remain loyal to the PGA Tour. And now, they're going to see guys who did take that kind of money coming back and rejoining the tour within a couple of years anyway. So I mean, what's interesting is the relationships between these players, well, some of them clearly did fall out and there were some pretty angry words spoken and barbs traded within the media. A lot of them, I think remained pretty cordial or even friendly. And a lot of them all live in the same part of Florida.

It would be the latest move by Washington to mend its relationship with the kingdom.

Remember, President Biden himself, he visited Saudi Arabia last year. He had that famous fist-bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and then, right after that, the Saudis turned around and cut oil prices -- cut oil production, rather, which led to a rise in gas prices. And that was just before the midterm elections. And the Biden administration was not pleased about that. So, the relationship has been suffering. I would say one of the biggest items on the agenda, Isa, is the normalization efforts to get the relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia normalized. One of the biggest successes of the previous administration that this administration gives them credit for, are these so-called Abraham Accords, where Israel normalized the relationship with four Arab countries, including Morocco, UAE, Bahrain and Sudan. And the U.S. would very much like Saudi Arabia to be added to that list, not just so that Israel is more a part of the Middle East and get along better with its neighbors, but in the words of the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, there are U.S. national security interests.

Of course, the U.S. has criticized Saudi Arabia for all kinds of human rights issues, not least of which is the murder and the dismemberment of \"Washington Post\" journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who the U.S. has point blank blamed the crowned prince for carrying out.

Individuals approached the migrants, speaking in quote, broken Spanish, asking them to sign forms to take them to Sacramento, but not all understood where they were going or sign the forms. The migrants were initially approached in El Paso, then were transported 100 miles away to an airport in New Mexico and flown to California.
