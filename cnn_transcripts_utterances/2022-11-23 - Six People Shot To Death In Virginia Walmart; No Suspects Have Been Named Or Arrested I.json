They saw him -- he'd work for Walmart since 2010, so was a longtime employee.Look, they talked about him being difficult to work with. Some of them described him as having odd or even threatening interactions. They said that he seemed to relish in the position that he had, that power that he had over them. It was something that he seemed to enjoy kind of throwing around. They called him sometimes mean or condescending. But every person with whom I spoke with said that in no way, shape or form did they ever think that he was the type of person who had come in and do this, did they ever think that it was going to result in a mass shooting. They described him as paranoid, afraid that the government was watching or controlling him. He didn't like to be recorded by cellphones. There is some cellphone footage that a former coworker of his had from back in 2016. She notes that when he realizes that he's being recorded, he tries to move out of the scene there. And so, they described him as strange, difficult to work with, a loner even. But Alisyn, every person, even those who watch this happen, say that they are absolutely shell-shocked that he came in there and did what police say that he did with a handgun and several magazines, they say, that he was armed with. They are still trying to determine a motive here. And look, I can tell you that people here in Chesapeake are still trying to gather their thoughts and figure out what they're going to do. This is, of course, Thanksgiving eve. It's usually a very busy day at places like Walmart. It has been closed. These employees don't know what to do. These survivors don't know what to do.

We're so sorry about what's happening in Virginia and in your district and what everybody there has had to endure. What's the answer? What's the answer to stopping things like what happened at Walmart? L. LOUISE LUCAS, PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE OF VIRGINIA: Well, you know, I've said several times over the last 24 hours, the only thing that's going to stop gun violence is legislators coming up with common sense, gun violence prevention program that's going to bring all of this to a stop. But the first thing that I thought needed to happen is for us to develop a critical mass of people around this issue so that they can start impressing upon the legislators the need to do this because people are just so tired of these mass shootings. As a matter of fact, I took it upon myself to go out to three different shopping malls today just to kind of get a sense of what people were feeling and what they were thinking. First, they were in shock because they just, first of all, couldn't believe that it had hit this close to home. And then the next thing is, now, today, people are feeling grief and afraid and wondering, who's next mass shooter? Is it someone near them? Is it someone they know? And so, now, people are just afraid to even be out in public places because they never know where the next mass shooting is going to occur. I say again and again and again, the only thing that's going to bring us to a point that we're going to bring an end to this mass shooting is to do like other countries are doing and get these guns out of the hands of people who do not need to have them.",

I think there is no way that we will ever address the gun problem without addressing the ways in which the filibuster combined with the two senators per state rule basically undermines majority rule.Alisyn, if you look at the 20 states that have the most -- the highest gun ownership per capita, they send 32 Republican senators to Washington out of those 20 states. If you go to the 20 states that have the smallest gun ownership per capita, they send 32 Democratic senators. So equal in the 2020. The difference is the 20 states with the fewest -- the smallest gun ownership per capita have about 125 million more people than the 20 states with the most gun ownership. And so, basically what we're seeing on guns is that it is perhaps the premiere example of how the rules empower a small number of sparsely populated, predominantly white rural states that have an outsized influence on national politics (ph). There is majority support in the country about the ties (ph) you can get in a democracy for most of the steps that people want to take, either red flag laws, universal background checks, ban on assault weapons, ban on high-capacity magazines. Even a majority of Republicans who don't own guns say they support those ideas, but they simply cannot advance through the Senate, so long as Republicans in the Senate believe they cannot cross the republican -- one constituency, the Republicans who own guns.",

Dallas, Texas is not in Georgia, I've learned.And I'm just wondering if we think that that will affect the carpet, if a carpetbagger claim will affect him, because I think that people do think that that affected Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania.

This was talked about before. And, you know, to equate him to Dr. Oz, I mean, Dr. Oz was not a favorite son of Pennsylvania. Herschel Walker is a favorite son of Georgia. And everybody knew he had lived out of state and then come back to run for the Senate. This is a -- to me, it's a non-issue. The bigger issue is what Ron raised earlier. Can you get Republicans back out one more time and can Brian Kemp convince a few more Republicans who voted for him to pull the lever this time? The reason to vote matters, by the way, is because of the filibuster. It doesn't mean control of the Senate. But if you get Democrats closer to changing the filibuster rules, that might matter to a lot of Republican voters. CAMEROTA:  Okay, got it. Ron, last word, quickly?",

They know what kinds of things we like to buy. And in some ways, we're not even thinking for ourselves anymore. These devices, these algorithms, are controlling our behaviors and controlling our thoughts. When you see how far -- people are being pushed to extremes because the information they are receiving is, essentially, served on a silver platter, based on the data that has been collected on all of our habits.
