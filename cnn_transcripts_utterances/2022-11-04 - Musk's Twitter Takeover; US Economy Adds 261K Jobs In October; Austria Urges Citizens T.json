It's been a tremendous up and then down and then even a bit of a loss, and now we're back up again. Sort of roller coaster day, all on the back of the jobs numbers, which we will get to. But the market has now closed. The day is over. The markets and the main events: Widespread layoffs at Twitter. Elon Musk is complaining of a massive drop in revenue on the same day employees find out their fate via e-mail. America's hot jobs market shows gradual signs that it is cooling down. And tonight, the CEO of Hertz, a company that was bankrupt just a few years ago now making loads of money, and we will discuss the travel rebound and the plans to buy hundreds of thousands of EVs. We are live in New York, it's Friday, November the 4th. You managed to make it to the end of the week. I am Richard Quest and on Friday, I mean business. Good evening. It has only taken seven days, but now Elon Musk is slashing jobs at Twitter after a report that he cut his seven and a half thousand workforce in half. And the method that has been used, brutal. The doors were locked at the company's offices, access to internal systems were cut, and staff members were informed via e-mail. If you got an e-mail to your work e-mail, you kept your job, and if you got an e-mail to your personal e-mail, you are out of a job. The mass layoffs have already been hit with a class action. A small group of workers are alleging the company has violated labor laws by not giving notice in the correct way, as Musk -- as he shakes up Twitter. Now, of course, the problem is how it makes money. He has tweeted: \"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups, pressuring advertisers.\" Donie O'Sullivan is with me. He has been covering this in all its manifestations. Let's do the firing first. This is -- I mean, first of all, the lottery of where you got your e-mail told you whether you had been fired. DONIE O' SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:   Yes, it was absolutely brutal. I think this e-mail went out at about eight o'clock or so on the East Coast here in the US last night. The e-mail not signed by anyone, not signed by Elon Musk, going to all staff saying in the morning, if you get an e-mail to your personal e-mail, you're gone. If you get an e-mail to work e-mail, you're still at the company. I've been speaking all day to lots of workers who have been left -- look, some of them are kind of relieved, they're seeing the direction this company is going and they're happy to get out. But obviously, many more devastated, and you know, we've been hearing a lot, too, how people are on visas, particularly foreign workers who are here in the US who may now have to leave the country and whatnot. So just devastation there -- Richard.",

The tech guru, Shelly Palmer has described today's firing method by Twitter as twisted, where you got your e-mail and told you if you've been fired. I call it grotesque. Firstly, because firing by e-mail is callous and destructive in its own right. Secondly, because Musk is only on Twitter for a week. His people can't know who is good, who is not, who should be kept, who should be let go. I can hardly imagine the previous management preparing the necessary dossiers aim to execute. And what about the banks and the investors who funded this purchase? Would they like their sons and their daughters to be fired in this way? It was in 1973 when the then British Prime Minister Edward Heath, described the mining company Lonrho and its CEO Sir Tiny Roland as the unacceptable face of capitalism. Having seen how Twitter's new owner carried out today's job cuts, is it not justified to ask whether we have a new example of capitalism's unacceptable behavior?

This is essentially companies finding that there is new demand for their goods and services. So, I think that was really interesting.

We've seen it in the real estate industry, which of course, is a pretty clear connection with what's happening with interest rates in terms of the tech industry and real estate. But that's still on the fringes, Richard. I mean, for the most part, it appears that employers are really holding on to their workers, perhaps pulling back a bit on new jobs or sort of hiring plans.

The economy added 261,000 jobs. That is unequivocal good news win American workers get jobs across the economy. Those gains were widespread. They were across a variety of industries, and in fact, we have seen this very sharp uptick during the Biden administration in manufacturing jobs. So, the end of the President's watch, we've added over 700,000 manufacturing jobs. We are about 137,000 jobs above where we were pre pandemic in terms of manufacturing.

The Inflation Reduction Act dealt with high cost of prescription drugs, high cost of access to healthcare, and of course, the transition to clean energy, you know, smoothing those costs for families helping to lower those costs over time. And that is, of course, one of the reasons that we've seen so much new investment announced over the past few months in new manufacturing in the United States to produce electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels and the like. So there is a connection there that the President has focused on the things that he can control. And again, the Inflation Reduction Act, which unfortunately was passed on a partisan basis, was a core part of his agenda alongside doing things to make sure that supply chains could get opened up and doing what he could in the face of businesses that have had a hard time recovering from the pandemic, and doing what he could to address high gas prices facing families through releasing barrels of oil through the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.",

Perhaps the most significant is we're giving our customers a broader choice of vehicle, including electric vehicles. And we aim to have our fleet at about 25 percent electric by the end of 2024. That's a very distinguishing characteristic. We are now offering more than anyone the choice to take up in an electric vehicle. And that kind of choice matters. Secondly, we have broadened out the customer base. It is of course classically leisure customers that still do the lion's share of business with us, as do corporate customers. But we're now renting cars and principally electric vehicles to Uber and Lyft drivers who are finding it a profitable venture to rent a car from Hertz, as opposed to own it.

But can you imagine going further into the to the consumer sector? Or is that simply -- because you do leasing on fleets but -- for corporate fleets. But is that just not worth it?

You know, I can look across the rental car space. And obviously there are the majors, including ourselves. But equally, there are smaller players, some of which you refer to that have different twists, different turns on the model. You know, some that are renting other people's cars. Some that have cars that are being picked up on the street. I think for a company like Hertz. And given our size, we could pursue any one of those in the context of, you know, an offset, if you will or an element of our overall business. The model needs to play itself out. We're obviously company of great scale. We can offer to a customer more than any one of the smaller players the opportunity for one way rental or the opportunity to choose between an electric vehicle or a combustion engine car. We can offer people opportunities to rent in many, many locations around the world. And we do that with reliability. That's a distinguishing characteristic relative to some of the smaller players. But that's not to say that they are not engaged in business models that could well be of interest to us and that we could pursue it.",
