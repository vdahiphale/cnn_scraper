      "sentences": "Welcome. I'm Christina Macfarlane live in London, and this is One World. And we begin our show with a focus on threestories that cause us to reflect on the hot button issue of race and ethnicity in the world today. Paris is on edge after a 17-year-old boy of North African descent was fatally shot by a police officer at a traffic stop. While in Britain, an appeals court has ruled that a government plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful, saying the African country is not a safe third country for would-be refugees. And in the U.S., the Supreme Court, in a landmark decision, ruled that colleges and universities cannot take race into consideration for admissions. Well, let's begin because it is just after 6 PM in Paris. And as nightfall approaches, France is bracing for more anger in the streets. Some 40,000 police and paramilitary officers have been mobilized in anticipation of more riots and protests this evening. It comes after 150 people were arrested Wednesday, the second night of widespread protests over the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old boy at a traffic stop at the hands of a police officer. His death has sparked racial tensions in the country. BFMTV reports the accused officer has been charged with voluntary homicide and placed in custody. And there have already been large protests on this day, as the boy's mother led thousands of people on a march through the streets of the Paris suburbs on Thursday. So let's get straight to our CNN's Melissa Bell, who's live for Paris today. And Melissa, just bring us up to date on what those charges are that have been brought against the police officer involved in this shooting.",

      "sentences": "Well, the charges initially that were being considered, what he was being questioned on suspicion of,Christina, was culpable homicide, but also forgery was one of the possible charges of -- regarding his statement. Essentially, what he was being investigated for is having lied about the precise circumstances, Christina, of how this traffic stop unfolded. Now, what we understand is that the charges that he is to be charged under is now culpable homicide. But there's a great deal of anger on the part of the lawyers of the family of the young man because that is such a huge part of this story. And it is also why it's touched such a huge nerve in the country, not just because, unbeknownst to the police officers, the events were being filmed. And this is something that we've seen in several cases over the years here in France, an official version of events and what actually transpires, and the real world can then see for itself. What he had claimed, we understand now, was that the driver had been coming towards him and that therefore he'd had no choice but to shoot. In fact, when you look at the video, it is clear that the vehicle was stopped. You can hear someone audibly saying, I'm going to shoot you in the head. Seconds later, the boy was shot. That is what has sparked so much of the anger, the fact of the case and the fact that this is something that has happened so many times before. A young French boy of Arab descent who was stopped and treated in a particularly brutal way, that is what is at the heart of the anger that you saw spill out earlier in Nanterre and elsewhere in France. And I think what has helped fuel it, that resentment that goes back years and that spills out periodically every time you have one of these outrageous incidents, Christina, is that there is a feeling among so many of the colored communities of France that the systemic racism that they face day in, day out, is simply cannot be heard because of the particular nature of France's secular laws. French institutions, for instance, cannot quantify, cannot name race or ethnicity. And therefore, whenever there have been these examples, these allegations of police brutality, it is impossible to tie them to allegations of that systemic racism that is so keenly felt in the communities that we're talking about, Christina.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. Very important to point that out, Christina. I mean, the judges there you saw in that ruling essentiallysaying that Rwanda cannot be considered a safe third country, because they save deficiencies in the country's asylum system. So when you send migrants and refugees, people who are seeking asylum, they say to Rwanda, they could end up being sent back to their home countries where they could face persecution and other inhumane treatment. And so, this was the main reasoning by these judges. They say that the U.K. would be in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights by doing that. But again, as you mentioned, this is not about the entire government plan to send asylum seekers to a third country. It is very specific to Rwanda. And what we have heard today, the Rwandan government responding to this, saying that this is, of course, ultimately the decision of the judicial system in the U.K. But they take serious issue, they say, with this decision saying that Rwanda is a safe country, that it has been recognized as a safe country by UNHCR, by other international organizations, they say for their exemplary treatment of refugees. The government here, this is of course a big blow for the conservative government. We had the statement coming from the prime minister earlier today confirming that they will be appealing this decision. It will be going to -- they will want to take this to the Supreme Court and vowing to continue on this path. This has been obviously at the heart of the government's strategy in dealing, they say with illegal migration into the country, the numbers that have really soared over the past year or so this has been a key strategy for them. They've spent a lot of money on this. And so, they will be taking it to the Supreme Court and defending this thing that Rwanda is a safe country that. They have the assurances that no one will be sent back unlawfully to their home countries. You can imagine the kind of reaction, Christina, coming from human rights groups that have been very critical of this plan by the government from the U.K. here and beyond, seeing this as a big win for now. But you also have groups like Amnesty International slamming the British government for this saying that while this is a good decision for now, you can just imagine the kind of pain and the kind of suffering and the expense that this has caused. And they say rather than spending the money and effort on a plan like this, what is being described as a reckless plan, that the government should be focusing on trying to fix what they say is a broken migration and asylum system.

      "sentences": "Well, the justices here just said that UNC and Harvard in particular violated equal protection by takingrace into account in their admissions decision. So what this ruling does is the Supreme Court is now prohibiting colleges and universities from relying on race, from specifically considering race in the admissions process. You know, the conservative majority, though, though they made this ruling, they insist that they're not specifically overruling the more than 40 years of precedent that did allow schools to use race as a factor. Instead, this court is saying that they are effectively barring applicants from checking a box that indicates race and stopping schools from looking specifically at the race of an applicant. And as a result, this really marks a major change in how colleges and universities will conduct their admissions practices moving forward. So in sum, the majority saying, look, we're prohibiting checking a box, but we're not prohibiting applicants from discussing their race, whether it be in essays or otherwise, and discussing how race has impacted and affected their lives. The colleges and universities will be taking all this into account. It's unclear exactly how they'll change their admissions policies and when they will do so. But this decision elicited a fiery -- actually, fiery dissents from Justice Jackson, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan, the three liberals here. They essentially said, look, all of these distinctions you're trying to make are without a difference. They said it was like putting lipstick on a pig. They said that in particular, race needs to be taken into account to sufficiently diversify student bodies. And that's something we've actually heard from colleges in states that already have banned affirmative action. In particular, Michigan and California have banned affirmative action for years. They wrote amicus briefs to the court saying that even as we've tried to diversify our student bodies, the only way we've been sufficiently able to do that was when applicants tell us their race and then we take that into account. But, Christina, that will no longer be the case for the universities and colleges here in the United States. The Supreme Court saying you cannot rely on race. You cannot specifically take race into account as a factor in your admissions. Students, you can still talk about your race, but overall, these colleges and universities need to take a somewhat race-neutral approach in their admissions. So it is going to be a big change for the way that these schools run their admissions programs. And I'm sure right now they're just trying to figure out where they even begin. Christina.",

I mean, at this stage, these planes, it's unclear if they are indeed carryinghim, but they continue on a journey that's causing many to indeed question exactly where Yevgeny Prigozhin is. As you said, Alexander Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, said he was in Belarus, but that is now two days ago. And the fact that Prigozhin, who is never shy of using his Telegram channel, posting multiple audio messages, you heard some of them there, hasn't actually come forward to specify indeed where he is, is continuing to add indeed to that speculation. And so, this is one of a number of unanswered questions that we simply need obviously to have more clarity over, if it begins to be the case that Vladimir Putin can think he can draw a line under this episode. The most pressing one perhaps is the whereabouts of Sergey Surovikin. Now, as you said, there were suggestions in the New York Times that perhaps he had advanced knowledge, a European intelligence official I spoke to said that they believed there were hints that some in the Russian security establishment may have had prior knowledge. But really what we're seeing here, there are differing accounts from those military bloggers, former MPs suggesting he may have been detained, he may in fact be OK, and have been released. His absence from public view since a video put out on Friday in which he, looking significantly under pressure with what looked like a firearm under his right hand told the Wagner rebels to essentially go back to their bases. He's not been seen in public since then. And so, the questions will now begin to mount about quite what that means. We also haven't seen the Chief of Staff of Russia Valery Gerasimov, who's running the Ukrainian war at the moment. It doesn't necessarily mean that he's been detained. These military figures aren't always putting themselves on public parade. But it adds to this climate of suspicion, which I'm sure those in Kyiv fighting the war on Ukraine's behalf, their tacticians will be delighting at. continued not witch hunt or purge quite yet, but really avid scrutiny as to exactly who knew what, when in Russia's top brass, who remains loyal, who may have stepped back and allowed Wagner forces to advance to see how this would play out. As this continues to occur, Putin's weak grip on power is increasingly manifested. And of course, Russia's top brass's decision- making capability is significantly compromised, Christina.",

I think on the one side, I think it's avictory for those who advocate for the people of the country, or as far as I can see, because they're warned up. On the other hand, however, what it does do is it frames Rwanda and other African countries as not being able to provide or being able to be seen as part of the solution to deal with this migration issue, largely because of the way in which the court has given us the information, because it says that Rwanda is deemed unsafe. And I think that in itself demonizes, but also brings Rwanda back to a framework of this being seen as a country that is unsafe, unruly, and the other stigmatizations that happen in Africa. I think here what we do have is a ruling which again, on one side, It's clear that it's a big thing, but for the African community, it diminishes Rwanda's role, particularly around peace and security.",

According to a new report from the Global Energy Monitor, China's solar capacity has reached 228 gigawatts, more than the rest of the world combined. But with the recent heat waves, there's still definitely a need for coal power. So I want to bring in our Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Wier to talk a bit more about this. And, Bill, it strikes me that China is a bit of a climate paradox, the world's largest carbon emitter on the one side. And yet, it is one of the main drivers, as we're hearing now, of the clean energy revolution, which is a surprise to many. So, how is it that China have been able to be so progressive on this?",

But in this particular case, what's staggering is they have to do this with sort of local provincial regulations and do carrotsand sticks, both incentives and regulations for power providers and for local governments. But when you look at this, the projections here, 1200 gigawatts by 2025, that's enough to power over a billion people between one and a half and two billion homes right there, depending on how it's used. That's five years ahead of schedule, more than the rest of the world combined. But here's the paradox, Christina, that you talked about. At the same time, they approved more coal-fired projects in the first three months of this year than in all of 2021. So they're putting everything online as fast as they can. And eventually you hope that they wind down the dirtier fuels that are causing the biggest problems when it comes to global warming. But this also has implications for the rest of the world's solar manufacturing. China's gotten so good at this. Most of the panels in the United States and Europe, a lot of them, come from there. And so when trade wars tighten down and they just have a much bigger advantage when it comes to manufacturing and installation in their country, they still have creaky old grids that they have to work around. A lot of it is super inefficient. And again, there's that dirty fuel that's attached to all these new projects there. But they are just in terms of scale leading the world.",

And then once people understand how to workwith it and improve on what the standard is, it can just take off. So if you just look at a couple of their big desert projects based, you know, in the north and the south would have twice as much, maybe three times as much power as all of the United States combined. These are big chunks of land, there's a big debate in Europe and the United States about how much land, where you put solar farms, if you should put them on rooftops only, that wouldn't be enough in the United States. You need acreage, big chunks of land to do this. And then, just in times of innovation and affordability, driving the costs down, hopefully for the rest of the world, learning from them, drafting a little bit, but those who are in this space now and innovators will be the energy titans of the next generation.

There are now about 36 hours left until Hollywood's actors could join the screenwriters in going on strike.Hundreds of prominent members of the Screen Actors Guild sent a letter to negotiators on Wednesday urging them to take a hard line in talks with the studios. Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Ben Stiller and Joaquin Phoenix are among the actors who signed the letter. Movie and TV writers went on strike six weeks ago. Well, let's bring in CNN Senior Media And Entertainment Writer Brian Lowry with more. And, Brian, I was interested to read in this letter that the language used by these actors is very definitive. It's kind of deliver or we're out. And we know that if these demands aren't met, it will lead to the first actors walk out in 23 years. So what is going to be the impact if this goes ahead?",

The Directors Guild has already reached a deal with the producers, which historically is the way it goes. The writers tend to take a harder line, the directors tend to be a bit more pliable, and the wildcard are the actors. So this was a case of some of the highest profile actors saying look, we see this as an inflection point in the industry, streaming has dramatically changed the business and the economics of the business.
