      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we are monitoring two live events andthen break the story. First, a big night of protests in France, it is the last time French people will have to really have their voices heard before a decision comes down on whether the much-hated pension reform is even constitutional. Then Joe Biden has just finished addressing Ireland's parliament any time now. He's on to a banquet at Dublin Castle. And a law enforcement official tells CNN, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard is expected to be arrested soon in connection with the leaking of those classified documents. We will monitor Pentagon press briefing schedule for this hour. But first, we begin tonight in France, where hundreds of thousands of people have turned out for a 12th round of nationwide strikes and protests against the pension -- government's, I should say, pension reforms. Many march peacefully on the eve of an important announcement. The French Constitutional Council is set to rule on the legality of these reforms on Friday. But at times the demonstrations turned violent. One crowd forced their way into LVMH Luxury headquarters, the owners, of course of Louis Vuitton. A union leader at that protest, saying President Macron can find money to pay  the pension there. We're also seeing some clashes break out with riot police firing tear gas as protesters as well -- you can see the protesters hurling rocks. Our senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen, has been on the ground in Paris with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Outbursts of anger ripped across France. (on camera):  I just got a full load of tear gas. (voice-over):  Police in Paris, charging a crowd of demonstrators. Flares and sirens taking over the headquarters of luxury giant LVMH, which owns the likes of Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany's. Chant from rail workers echo through the halls of the metro. Trash bins blocking off schools and streets with garbage set ablaze. These are the sights and sounds of rage by some protesters stirring tensions in what was largely a peaceful day of protests across the country. French citizens, young and old, coming together for the 12th day of nationwide outrage against President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pensions bill, which would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. FABIEN VILLEDIEU, SUD RAIL UNION REPRESENTATIVE (through translator):  I would lie if I was telling you that there is no fatigue, we are tired by the mobilization, it's like a marathon. It's the last kilometers at the end that are the hardest.",

This will be the end for them if that legislation is green-lit by the Constitutional Council. And it is widely anticipated that legislation will get the green light, although, some aspects may require another look by the constitutional accounts. And of course, the message that we're hearing from the unions as well as -- this isn't the end if that legislation gets the green light, they will continue to protest in some form or other. And of course, this has been to some extent the final opportunity for many of these unions and other protesters to have their voices heard before the Constitutional Council comes to its decision tomorrow evening. And we have seen a huge turnout, but it has to be said that over the last 12 rounds of protests, we have seen that figure, the number of protesters taking to the streets, dwindling somewhat across France according to the Interior Ministry. At least, 380,000 protesters took to the streets in Paris, 42,000, that's the estimate from the Interior Ministry. And that is far less -- excuse me. That is far less than we have seen in the past, those record-breaking figures that we saw earlier in the year. And as Fred mentioned, now, we are still seeing some people on the streets, but I am in the square just across the way from Fred, and while, the police here, which are heavily-mobilized, have been trying to disperse the crowds. They've used tear gas to disperse the crowds in earlier hours. We are seeing those figures really dropping now. And while there are still some pockets as you can see behind me, the presence here is overwhelmed by that of the riot police here, according to the authorities --",

On your first question, again, it's important to understand that this is not just about DOD. This is about the U.S. government. This is about how we protect and safeguard classified information. And as I highlighted, we do have strict protocols in place. So any time, there is an incident, any time there's an opportunity to review that and refine it, or of course, going to take advantage of that. Within the Department of Defense, as you've heard us say, Secretary Austin has been convening daily meetings with his senior leaders to include the chairman, to talk about reviewing the scope and the impact of this, and also to look at mitigation measures and what we need to do across the Department of Defense, to ensure that we're doing our utmost to reinforce existing policies, procedures and rules.

Now the \"New York Times\" was reporting that the law enforcement was approaching for the arrest of a Massachusetts National guardsman, a 21-year-old who they identified as Jack Teixeira. Now, Jack Teixeira is a name and somebody who that you heard General Ryder was not willing to confirm the identity of Jack Teixeira as the leaker. But our understanding is that this 21-year-old Massachusetts National Guardsman was who law enforcement were planning to arrest. And as you said, it's one of the biggest leaks of classified information, U.S. Intelligence information that we have seen in a long time. Now look, I want to rewind because President Joe Biden suggested earlier today that, you know, the U.S. government was very close to identifying who leaked these government secrets. And it's an investigation -- it's really picked up pace just in the last 24 hours as General Ryder has mentioned. The Department of Justice and the Department of Defense have been investigating, trying to figure out the identity of the person who leaked these classified documents onto an online chat that was really focused around a mutual interest in gaming, right? And then most of these people in this group were teenagers, and most of them really discussed gaming and then also, all of a sudden these classified documents appeared on this online group chat. And you know, these documents included secrets like status updates about the war in Ukraine, U.S. Intelligence assessments about Russians' military capabilities, so it's going to be interesting to see now that an arrest has been made in this case, what charges potentially are brought. You heard General Ryder say unequivocally that, this was a deliberate criminal act. We're going to have to wait and see what the Justice Department does now that an arrest is -- has been made.",

So the real question is, does the 21-year-old airman, you know, from Massachusetts need to know this information? Now there's scenarios working there, they all might have needed to have known, but you really have to scrub your books as an organization that consumes and collects Intelligence to determine that because the more sensitive information that is released or that's leaked, the more of course, that damages sources and methods and the ability to collect in the future. In this case, that's critical. So you really have to be very hard on your organization when you scrub those lists of who really needs to know.",
