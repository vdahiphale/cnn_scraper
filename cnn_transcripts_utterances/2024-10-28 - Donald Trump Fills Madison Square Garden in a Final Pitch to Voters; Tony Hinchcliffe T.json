And so, if you're hemorrhaging support there from comments like this through a culture that is very proud of their culture, that often has the Puerto Rican flag displayed on their cars, on their homes, that's going to become a difficulty, for them.

CNN's Max Foster joins us live now from London. Max, good morning, always wonderful to see you. How big a deal is this? I mean, how badly does it weaken Iran? And it does seem as though the way that people have reacted to this is bringing down tensions a little bit. What's your read? MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we have been talking, haven't we? About how America has been leaning on Israel not to attack that vital infrastructure, their nuclear plants and the oil infrastructure, which they felt would escalate tensions too much. So, I think this is an example of how actually Israel did listen to United States. Some would say at last, it was a very targeted attack of these mixers that you described, which you know, if successful, if we're -- if we're right to believe what we've been told by Israel, it would certainly slow down Iran's ability to, you know, work, you know, have these long-range missiles, make them go effectively. And so, it does disable them to some extent, but not completely. And we don't know what other weaponry they have. Of course, now we're waiting, Kasie, on how -- or if Iran decides to respond, although it has made very clear, it doesn't want a war, which is a positive.",

You also have Egypt involved in mediation, but this is the Qataris really ramping up their efforts and their influence into this process.And they do in theory have a lot of influence over Hamas. So, momentum and the extent that Qatar seems to have renewed energy going into this, separately, the Egyptians are also working on their own plan and they've suggested, I think releasing about four Israeli hostages in return for a two-week ceasefire. So, alternate plans here, but certainly, Israel after the death of Sinwar does seem to be more hopeful that there can be some sort of deal here.
