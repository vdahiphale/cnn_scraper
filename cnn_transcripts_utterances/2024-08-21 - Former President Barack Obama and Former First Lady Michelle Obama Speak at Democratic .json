And so this wasn't -- this to me was not a call for unity, let's all get together. This was a contrast piece in his argument last night that was trying to remind the country that there is a lot of shared value. There's a shared value system, whether it is you coach little league or you're going to feed the needy through your church or synagogue. That so many Americans can identify with that, far more so than the number of Americans that would like to live in a constant state of division, which our politics has become over time.And I just think that what Barack Obama was doing there was trying to elevate beyond the hourly to and fro of our political battles and the soundbite of the day and the back-and-forth on that, to some larger calling in this race.",

And so I think Michelle Obama took a different approach. I thought it was interesting that both Obamas made the Trump piece of this, the Trump take down, the Trump contrast so central to both of their arguments, her in the more sort of, I thought she was like a soul cycle instructor for this convention, he more in his professorial ways.

Perhaps, a, that was one reason why Michelle Obama didn't feel it was necessary. She knew it was in her husband's speech. But also, we know that Michelle Obama saw her role here as far different.

So far, nothing is working because she's focused on actually bringing the country together and moving the country forward. And I think this message, which is right, which is they're looking at going backward. And I think that is a big contrast. Common sense versus their extremism. And so I think they're going to keep trying to do anything they can to stop her. But right now, there's so much positive energy, and people want change in the positive. They don't want to go back, right? They want someone who is going to move forward and build on the 16 million new jobs this last administration, a ton of accomplishment on the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, Pact act for veterans, right, common sense gun safety legislation. That's all stuff they want. They certainly don't want somebody who is going to rip down choice and reproductive freedom. And there are differences here.

And we were meeting Republicans on the 50-yard line here, we were meeting them on the ten- yard line on their side of the field. Much of the stuff in there, I supported and wanted to see. But Donald Trump, this is the most hypocritical thing I've ever seen in politics. A guy who talks about this issue all the time when we finally had a chance to address it through a strong legislation. He told Republicans in the Senate that they were not allowed to vote for it. So, they didn't walk away from this bill. They ran away from it because he wanted this for the election.  He made it very clear he needed this issue to win an election.
