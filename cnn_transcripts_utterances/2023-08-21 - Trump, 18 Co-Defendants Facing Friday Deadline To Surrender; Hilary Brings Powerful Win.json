But one thing's really clear, the former president's legal troubles and political campaign are colliding.We know that Donald Trump will not show up on the GOP debate stage in Milwaukee this Wednesday when his 2024 challengers do. Trump has confirmed that. But will he show up in an Atlanta area jail today? He and his 18 accused conspirators have until Friday at noon to be booked on criminal charges there. At this point, all 19 are expected to be fingerprinted and have a mug shot taken inside that jail. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is live outside the courthouse in Atlanta. What are you learning today?",

And we've already seen some of the prosecutors on the team for this case working under DA Fannie Willis to prosecute Donald Trump and these others gathering here because they have work to do before these defendants are arrested and brought into the jail, potentially fingerprinted, to have their mugshots taken, searched even. All of that is very likely, at least for Donald Trump, to happen at the end of the week.But before that, there's a negotiation taking place, and we're waiting to see exactly how that plays out today and in the coming days. A negotiation that will allow some of these people, these defendants, to have their defense lawyers, work with the DA's Office to make sure that arrest and processing at the jail goes very smoothly, to have bail terms set before anyone turns themselves in at the jail. But there's 19 defendants here, hard to keep track of. We have a large team here around the courthouse as well as over at the jail watching. We haven't seen any defendants or their lawyers yet, but it's very likely that we see a couple of steps in this process, potentially as soon as today and in the coming days of this bail determination process, as well as people being booked at the Fulton County Jail.",

Other very infamous lawyers who worked with Donald Trump after the election Ken Chesebro, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark, Sidney Powell, they are all some of the additional defendants.And then there's Mark Meadows, the Chief of Staff to Trump in the White House. He already is told a federal court he wants his case moved out of state court into federal court. He wants his charges dismissed. And he's already beginning to make an argument to very aggressively attack his case in court. Whether or not Donald Trump is going along with him, he says he was working just at the behest of the president after the 2020 election. So we have to see what happens in that court as well. Sara?",

Let's stick on that point, the moves being made by Mark Meadows and his legal team right now. Let's take it in pieces because it is pretty fascinating.Part of the filing, they write this. \"Stripped of the state's gloss, the underlying facts entail duties with the core functions of a Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, arranging or attending office meetings, contacting state officials on the President's behalf, visiting a government building and setting up a phone call for the President with a state official. Only by virtue of his Chief of staff role was Mr. Meadows involved in the conduct charge. Put another way, his federal position was a but-for cause of his alleged involvement.\" What do you think of that? Strong point?",

I mean -- but for the fact that I was working for a drug kingpin, I never would have been selling drugs on the street, right? So the fact that was his job takes him some way down the road to saying it's excusable, but there are still was a point, as prosecutors are arguing, that they crossed the line between the challenges that are normal and legal, and part of the process, and plotting to do things like send in fake slates of electors to the National Archives in Congress that are not part of normal challenging of elections.So the trick here that the judge is going to have to kind of walk that line of figuring out, did they cross the line, was that part of his job, which of course, it was not.

You can say, did they -- did you act outside the bounds of federal law. So it does carry some weight.But again, it's going to be an issue about how far they went and whether it was too far. And it's an interesting point that he wasn't named federal indictment. I think that tells us 100% if were still skeptical before, that he is not cooperating with any authorities, including federal authorities at this point, but it also doesn't get him so far. The federal authorities obviously made a strategic decision to just charge Donald Trump and not to expand beyond that in the interest of time.

But what it really tells us more than anything else is that Meadows is out for himself, that he's making aggressive moves. He has very capable lawyers. They want to get him out from under these charges, and he's not caring so much about what happens to anyone else at this point, which is honestly how any criminal defendant should behave.If everyone else in this case behaves the same way, that's when you'll see a lot of cooperators coming in and the case getting stronger.",

This case, that is not what's happening.Mark Meadows is moving quickly. And to move to dismiss at this stage before the removal has even been decided shows again that he's very anxious to get out in front of this. He wants to be the lead on his own case.
