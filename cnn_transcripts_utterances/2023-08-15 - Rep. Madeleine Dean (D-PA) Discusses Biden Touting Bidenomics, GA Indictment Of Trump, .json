He is in the battleground state of Wisconsin talking up the high-paying clean energy jobs created during his administration.The White House says President Biden's policies are helping America to, quote, \"grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not top down.\" The president clearly trying to put his economic agenda at the forefront of his re-election campaign. But, Jessica, of course, the former president's fourth indictment dominating headlines for now. We'll see, what are the deciding factors as we get into the 2024 election cycle.",

      "sentences": "And I want to talk just a little bit more before we move on to the next subject about 2024 and the president's re-election campaign.Because the special counsel was just named in the Hunter Biden case. His advisers are accepting the fact that that's probably going to hang around as a talking point as we head into 2024. And so many of your Republican colleagues had called for that. Now that they have it, it doesn't seem to be enough for them. What do you make of the attorney general naming the special counsel? Do you think it was the right move? And how do you hope that Biden and his campaign address this moving into the election? M. DEAN: I can't judge whether it was the right move because, certainly, we don't have the evidence. But I will judge the fact that this is not at all equivalent to what we're talking about with Donald Trump. Take a look at this indictment. I remember, Jessica, I stood on the floor of the Senate when we were involved in the trial for impeachment number two. And I remember part of my presentation was around that now famous phone call that the president made with Mark Meadows to Brad Raffensperger in Georgia saying he just wanted to find 11,780 votes. At the time that I said that, and we played the audio from that exchange, that phone call the president called the perfect phone call, I heard a gasp from the Republican side of the Senate. Someone whispered, \"Oh, my gosh. He will be held to account for that.\" It struck me in two ways. Number one, that some of these Senators did not know the evidence against the president, maybe hadn't even heard of that phone call. And number two, they recognized the grievousness of that kind of a phone call. The corruption and criminality that it reveals. So I think we did what we could with the evidence we had with our impeachment. And a lot of that evidence was then flushed out even greater by the January 6th committee. And I remember the phone call, to me, felt like the tip of the iceberg. And now as I read this indictment, this 98-page indictment, we see what was underneath that tip of the iceberg. More than 40, 50 people working day and night hour after hour day after day flying across the country to lie and to try to steal the election.",

That is almost one in 10 adults in the United States.And opioids, in particular, were a major concern. About 32 percent of people in this poll said that they were worried someone in their family will overdose on opioids. And 39 percent said they're specifically worried someone in their family will unintentionally consume fentanyl. That was particularly strong finding in rural areas. The poll also looked at alcohol use. We know that use of alcohol surged during the Covid pandemic. It found that 54 percent of people in this poll reported that a family member had ever been addicted to alcohol. And 13 percent, almost one in eight, said they had experienced alcohol addiction. One of the concerning things about this, even as staggering as these numbers are, less than half of the people who said they experienced some addiction or their family members have said they got treatment for it. This really backs up other findings we found that treatment for addiction in the U.S. is really not reaching the people who need it the most. Back over to you.",
