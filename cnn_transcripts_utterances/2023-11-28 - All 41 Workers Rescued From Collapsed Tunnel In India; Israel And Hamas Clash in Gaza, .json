We have breaking news now out of Northern India where all 41 workers who had been trapped in a collapse tunnel under the Himalayas have now been rescued. They were trapped more than two weeks ago. Rescuers had to bore a hole in a mountain in order to provide an escape route, drilling through the last two meters of rock by hand. CNN's Vedika Sud is following the developments for us. Vedika, what's the latest?",

Today is the 17th day that they were inside the tunnel. But, it's nothing short of a miracle to see them out there, being whisked away in those ambulances that you see on your screen to a hospital where they will be checked for physical and mental trauma, in fact, and it will take some time before we can ascertain what the condition really is. But, there is a lot of celebration that we've seen both inside the tunnel and outside. It's taken 17 days of hard work really of disappointments, of the breakdown of heavy machinery that the rescue teams were depending on to bring these men out. But, today is a day of celebration for those on the ground, for family members, for the rescue teams who worked around the clock, for the government officials there, and for those men who themselves are heroes really for having stayed inside that tunnel trapped in about a two kilometer space for over 17 days in the dark. They were being given and supplied water, food, medicine, mobile chargers, Vitamin D, through pipelines. And now, they're out because of this tunnel, rather this pipe that was built through the debris over the last few days. You were right in mentioning that the last two meters were a huge challenge, and the last two meters were drilled manually because the machines had broken down. And these men on the ground drilled through, inserted that pipe in, extracting those men out on stretchers. They were put on wheels and they used the pulley system using ropes to gently pull them out of that pipe. That pipe was about 50 meters long, three meters in diameter. That's still narrow given that you're pulling human beings out of the pipe really. But, now all is done. They've wrapped up this first huge leg of the ops. The focus now is to understand how these men are doing mentally and physically, and of course emotionally. Back to you.",

But, there is a total of 90 women and children. So, we probably have enough time to get rid -- get out the rest of the women and children under the framework of the deal despite this. But, it already shows it's fraying. And it's as if each side is preparing to get back to fighting because the expectation is that Hamas will ask for more to turn over the male hostages, at least the male hostages who are either serving IDF soldiers or of military age.

And if the next phase -- the President himself has expressed a desire for the pause to continue to be extended and for hostages to continue to be released. We've seen the Israeli public in large part calling for that as well. But, I think there is an expectation that this could fall apart when further demands are made by either side, particularly if Hamas wants to up the ante in terms of what it's asking for in exchange for male hostages being released. And that could lead the whole thing to fall apart. And I don't think anybody expects that Israel will forego its planned offensive in southern Gaza. I think everyone expects that that will eventually take place. And the question also then will be, what has Hamas been doing all this time?

And it's also ideal for reconnaissance operations. So, Hamas is doing that. Israel is doing the same thing. They're going through and trying to figure out where are the remaining hostages being held. What other things can they do in terms of targeting? That's going to be a principal concern, because Israel is under a lot of pressure to be more precise in its targeting.

That's yet another pressure point on an aid package that already faces multiple controversies. You have Republicans who don't want to approve the Ukraine aid. You have these separate border talks that are now being attached as a condition to passing the full package that the administration wants of aid of both Israel and Ukraine. So, it's going to be a tremendously difficult needle to thread for all of the congressional leaders, Republican and Democrat who in bipartisan manner broadly want to see this passed. But, it's just going to be incredibly tricky to get all the votes.

There is some coordination obviously there.

CNN Congressional Correspondent Jessica Dean joins us now. Jessica, always good to have you. I'm going back and forth, because on the one hand, this is a lot of money and a lot of organization. On the other hand, we've seen a lot of outside groups spend hundreds of millions of dollars, and have absolutely no effect on who won the race.

Of course, Donald Trump continues to be the frontrunner in national polling and early state polling. And what we're seeing is this dynamic playing out between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and South Carolina -- former South Carolina Governor and Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, to be the Trump alternative. So, that is what makes today's endorsement by Americans for Prosperity so key, because as we're seeing those to really jockey to be the Trump alternative, this is a big boost potentially for Haley. Why? Because this affiliate -- this group has millions and millions and millions of dollars that they are going to pour into ads in early states, Super Tuesday states, for Nikki Haley. They have data, direct contact information for the voters that she is going to want to reach. They also have an army of conservative activists that can go out and talk about this. The question, though, to your point is, will it make a difference? Will it actually make a difference? We have seen this time and time again where groups try to come in and really throw a lot of money at a candidate, at a situation to influence the outcome of the race, and especially against a former President Donald Trump. That has not proven to work. But, we see so many people within the Republican Party, even independents, you can call them the establishment. But, there are also some, as you all know, who supported Trump, even maybe worked for Trump in the -- when he was in the White House, and then when he ran in 2020, who would like to see somebody new. And so, the question is, who are they going to coalesce around? And can it happen in time for January 15 when the Iowa caucuses are and when voting starts in this primary to actually make a difference? And that's the question. Of course, Haley saying that she is honored by this. Her campaign delighted to hear this news. The DeSantis campaign calling this an in-kind donation to Donald Trump, essentially making the case that DeSantis remains the only person that can beat him and win in general election. Of course, Haley and her team have been trying to convince voters, but also donors, that she is the person that can do this.

The motorcade carrying her remains, the remains of the former First Lady, have just started to depart towardsEmory University where her tribute service will be held between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. There are crowds here, were set back about a few 100 yards from where this activity is happening. There are crowds lining the area where her Hurst is now moving. And it's a very somber atmosphere here. It is a gorgeous and Christ day, a sunny day here for another day to remember the legacy of just a phenomenal and remarkable woman of the State of Georgia and beyond, a tireless advocate for mental health, for caregiving, and really kind of a President in her own right. She was inextricably linked in the life of her husband of 77 and a half years, and he referred to her often as the boss. And this day here is going to be, Kasie, really all about her. We've spoken to a lot of people who know her, and some have said that she would think that this is a bit of a fuss, all the attention on her. But, her grandson, Jason Carter, said that this was designed by her, that she envisioned this and they're carrying out to the last details of her liking exactly how she wanted this day to go about. It is going to be a remarkable cast of guests here. It's an invitation-only service, including all former First Ladies as well as former President Bill Clinton, and most importantly, the former President, President Carter himself will be here. There is a lot of concerns on whether or not he would be well enough to attend. As we all know, he has been in hospice care since earlier this year. But, he was so determined, in fact, to attend the service of his high school sweetheart, that he had a new suit reportedly tailor-made because all of his old suits just simply don't fit anymore. The grandson of Jason Carter has been speaking to CNN. They say Mr. Carter is not expected to make any remarks, verbal remarks. They say they won't hold it against him really if he can't stay for the whole entire service. He is in declining health. And Jason Carter says he is likely in the final days of his life, of his very distinguished and storied legacy himself. But, this day, make no mistake about it, it is all about the former First Lady. There is going to be a performance by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, as well as country music star Garth Brooks. And there is going to be a medley of hymns to really underscore the importance of faith and her devotion to Christ in her life. A lot of people in Georgia and throughout have been coming here to pay their final respects and say their final goodbyes to the former First Lady. She was lying in repose since yesterday, about 3 p.m. She arrived here yesterday, and the members of the public came by here between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Then I was talking to some of those people that were leaving, and I ran into a 10 year-old-boy yesterday who said he really didn't know much about Rosalynn Carter but understood that his parents really looked up to her, that they were inspired by her. So, they decided to come and say their final goodbyes. So many people just can't say enough good things about Rosalynn Carter. She was just such a dynamic person. And in fact, I had the pleasure of meeting her a few years ago, her husband, the former President and herself were trick or treating in Candler Park, one of the beautiful in-town neighborhoods here locally. We didn't know what was happening. I was at my friend Matt Schofield's house, and all of a sudden the Secret Service black car pulled up in front of the house and out popped the former President, and Rosalynn Carter was right there. They were just such a lovely couple. They start to take pictures with every single person. I am so grateful to have that anecdote in my life here, and that memory of my life, just a great day for all of us. And today, it's just another great day to celebrate this wonderful, wonderful woman. Kasie.",

There are a lot of voters out there who strongly dislike and will come out to vote against Donald Trump, no matter what. That segment doesn't exist for Nikki Haley. She is someone that the electorate would have to get to know.
