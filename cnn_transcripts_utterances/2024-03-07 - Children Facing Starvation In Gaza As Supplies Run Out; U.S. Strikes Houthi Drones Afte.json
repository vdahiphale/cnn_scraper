We're learning the two of them were Filipino. According to U.S. officials, these are the first death since the Iran backed Houthis began their missile attacks in response to Israel's war in Gaza.

And then of course, you have the Galaxy Leader, the very first container ship to be targeted, and its 25 crew members are still being held hostage in Yemen. Many ships are turning off their publicly available GPS trackers to try to make themselves more inconspicuous as they pass through this area. Others are writing on publicly available tracking platforms like MarineTraffic.com that they have no crew ties to Israel or the U.S. or the U.K. or that all of their crew is Chinese, for instance, or Russian or Indian or what have you. And oftentimes, they're also mentioning that they have armed guards aboard. We are told by that head of security for that industry association, I mentioned that prior to the war, about 20-25 percent of ships passing through that area would have armed guards aboard. Those numbers, though, are only rising since the war began. But of course, it is very difficult to prevent this kind of a thing. There is new industry guidance that suggests that ships should install physical barriers like barbed wire to prevent attackers from getting on. But of course, this is a very risky part of the world, you cannot prevent without the help of a military attacks like this. And so, it is risky. But there is a financial interest in for not only the companies to take this risk, given the supply and demand and the fact that so many ships are taking the long way around. But also there's an incentive for the crew members as well who typically are paid double for going in dangerous areas, Rosemary.",

President Joe Biden is set to deliver his State of the Union Addressin the coming hours before a highly polarized U.S. Congress. He will make his case to American voters on why he is the best choice heading into the November election, especially since it's said to be a rematch with Donald Trump. Both men are turning up the heat on each other in the wake of the Super Tuesday primaries. Biden says Americans have a choice to move forward or allow Trump to, \"Drag us backwards into the chaos.\" Meantime, Donald Trump claimed, \"If we lose this election, we're not going to have a country.\" He's expected to wrap up the Republican nomination next week. Now that's an easier task with rival Nikki Haley formally suspending her presidential bid on Wednesday. She told supporters she has no regrets about the campaign. Well, now the big question is where do her supporters go now? CNN's Jessica Dean takes a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA DEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): As she announced the suspension of her presidential campaign on Wednesday, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley had a clear message for her rival. NIKKI HALEY, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it, who did not support him. And I hope he does that. DEAN (voice over): Where will Haley support go now that she's exited the race?

This is late for a State of the Union Address as well. They used to be given always in January, occasionally, early February. But this is helpful to Biden because it is closer to the election.Stylistically, he's got to show energy, he has got to dispel some of the -- what he would say as false impression about age. And he can do that, he's certainly done a good job before as he did last year. He's really shown in that State of the Union Address, partly by responding spontaneously to Republican catcalls. He's been around politics a long time. And he knows how to do that, as do British politicians. So, the style is important to him. And he certainly has to focus on issues that really matter to people in their lives. That's the substance of it. He certainly doesn't want to get into attacks on Donald Trump, he can make contrast with the Republican Party. That's easy enough to do. I'm sure he will focus on immigration, reminding the audience which is quite large, the largest he'll have until he's inaugurated again, if he gets that second inauguration. But he needs to remind people that he did have a solution, a bipartisan solution to much of the immigration problem. And one person who happens to be his opponent now and was his opponent in 2020, he made the telephone call to Republicans in Congress, and instantly, the solution died. So, that's important to point out to people, I suspect he will do it once or twice.",

If she has a political future in the Republican Party, she'll probably have to, and I must say all of the Republicans who many of whom should know better, end up caving, some of them even grovel before Trump.

It happened while Mr. Zelenskyy was showing his counterpart around the port city of Odesa. The Greek leader says they were getting into their cars when they heard a big explosion.According to a source, the convoy felt the impact of the strike just 500 meters away and saw a huge mushroom cloud of smoke. Ukrainian officials say at least five people were killed, and several more were injured in the attack. Fred Pleitgen tells us more about the deadly attack on Odesa. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's not clear whether the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was the target of this attack, but it certainly appears to have been a pretty close call. Source with knowledge of the situation tells CNN that the impact of this missile appears to have been about 500 meters away from the Greek prime minister, which is essentially also the same area that the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was as well. The Greeks are saying that the prime minister of Greece was in Odesa on a surprise visit, that he had been getting a tour of the port of Odesa from Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Greek prime minister of the importance of that port for Ukraine, of course, for goods that the Ukrainians continue to want to import and export. And the Greek side said that as the leaders were getting back into their car, that at that point, they heard a very loud explosion. The Ukrainian president, for his part, is going a step further even than that. He said that they saw the missile, and they even felt the impact because the impact was so close. Originally, Volodymyr Zelenskyy had said that he knew that there had been killed and wounded in the attack. But he said at that point, he didn't have more information than that. Well, the Ukrainian Navy has since then come out and said that five people were killed and that there were people wounded even though they have not given specifics as to how many people exactly were wounded in all this. Of course, Odesa, that port town in the south of Ukraine, has been taking a lot of hits from Russian drones and Russian missiles for the past couple of months. And just on March 2nd, there was a big drone attack that killed several people in that town. The Russians for their part have acknowledged that they did strike Odesa and the port area. They claim that they hit a warehouse which -- in which were unmanned sea drones. Now all this comes not very long after the Ukrainian said that they had sunk a Russian warship using sea drones, so it's unclear whether or not this was retaliation by the Russians. But it certainly does appear as though this was a very concerning situation for the Ukrainians. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
