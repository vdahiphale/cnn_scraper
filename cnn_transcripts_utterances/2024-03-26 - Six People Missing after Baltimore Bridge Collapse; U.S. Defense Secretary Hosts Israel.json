Now, rescuers search for six people still unaccounted for after a bridge collapses in the Baltimore area. It was hit by a container ship. We have the latest. U.S. Supreme Court justices heard arguments about the rights and wrongs of an abortion drug with most sounding skeptical of moves to limit it. And the truth hits Wall Street, why Donald Trump's media platform has an eye-popping valuation of around $11 billion. But first, at least six people are missing after a cargo ship collided with a bridge in the Baltimore area and the ship, which was headed to Sri Lanka, reportedly lost power before crashing into the Francis Scott Key Bridge early on Tuesday morning. A construction crew was on the bridge when it collapsed. Two people were initially rescued from the water below. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're going to send all the federal resources they need as we respond to this emergency. I mean, all the federal resources. And we're going to rebuild that port together. Everything so far indicates that this was a terrible accident. At this time, we have no other indication, no other reason to believe there's any intentional act here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You can only imagine what it would be like in these very frigid waters for that extended period of time. But as of now, not a whole lot of information on the ship itself, except for the fact that, you know, the crew saying -- and you could see those lights flickering on this ship shortly before impact. We know that mayday call came sometimes shortly after that saying that there was some kind of power issue. So, the flickering lights certainly would indicate that there were some kinds of power issue. But again, the NTSB says they can't just take the crew's word for it, they've got to investigate that. And hopefully, that's what they will be able to discern from those -- the Voyage Data Recorder or the black boxes once they are able to finally board this vessel behind me. Oh, and Kristie, one more thing I should actually point out. We've been watching over the last few minutes a crane on a barge that has made its way up along the river and up towards where the container ship is. So, we don't know exactly what that specific crane is going to be used for, but you can imagine it might be use to pull out cars that are submerged in the water or perhaps even start moving the pieces of the bridge, the steel itself, that are now covering the top front of this container ship.

This war very much still ongoing as 81 people were killed over the past 24 hours, 18 of those were in Israeli strikes in Rafah, according to Palestinian health officials. The Israel military, for its part, says that it is continue to operate in Khan Younis and that it carried out strikes on about 60 targets over the past day. Palestinian health officials also say that the Israeli military is now surrounding the Al Amal Hospital in western Khan Younis, putting it out of service. And the Israel military also acknowledging that is continuing to carry out a significant military operation at Al-Shifa Hospital, which it says has been used by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic jihad militants. Hundreds of those, the Israeli military says, they have since detained as this operation now stretches more than a week. Amid all of this, the Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, was in Washington where his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, urged him to dramatically and urgently ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, saying that far too many civilians have been dying in Gaza and not enough humanitarian aid has been getting in. But at the same time, one U.S. defense official says that more aid does appear to be getting in, 200 trucks per day now getting into Gaza, a significant increase from the month of February when the number of trucks really, really dramatically decreased. But of course, much more aid is still needed to avert a famine in Northern Gaza where, once again, we have seen scenes of utter desperation. On Monday, as humanitarian aid shipments fell into the sea, Gazans rushing in to go after it. Some of those found themselves washed up on the shore. People tried to perform CPR, but 12 Gazan's drowned, according to paramedics. Kristie.",

Sir, thank you so much for joining us here on \"First Move.\" This was a tragic accident. Many, many families are waiting for answers. How could something like this happen? OSCAR BARTON JR., DEAN, MITCHELL SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY:  Well, thank you for having me. And let me first say that in such a tragic event, our minds first turned to those most impacted and we share prayers and best wishes for their recovery and understanding what happened. Well, we've got a massive vehicle weighing hundreds of tons moving at roughly eight miles per hour and we have a stationary item, and that energy has to go somewhere. And so, the momentum transferred from the cargo ship to the bridge is what caused the energy to be dissipated in the bridge. Design criteria back in '77 or '72, when the Key Bridge was designed, have changed. And so, more futuristically, we would probably have a better design bridge to impact risk and stronger loads or higher loads.",

There are side impact with vessels, there are bow to stern impacts, there are rear impacts. And this is what we looked at today, what's called a lesion, where a vessel impacts a fixed object or a bridge, or could be a pier. The causes of which, I think, might be documented well in some of the video clips that we've seen, that we see lights flickering on and off. So, the loss of power could come from one or two sources, either there's a loss of power generation on the vessel or loss of power distribution. Despite either one, there should have been backup systems to kick in to provide backup power to a supply the needed and critical infrastructure of the ship so it can remain maneuverable.",

And should cargo ships have an emergency power source or an emergency generator on board? BARTON JR.:  I think there is a requirement for an emergency backup generator. And so, the power typically is generated via diesel engines and that those engines power generators, those generators tied to the patchwork of an electrical network, which distributes the power throughout the system and throughout the vessel. So, if the main power generator or diesel generator goes out, the backup system should kick in supplying needed power to the critical elements of the ship, mostly steering, mostly communication, so that we can avoid a potential catastrophe that -- which happened today.",

I think we will likely want to embed the best in the latest technology, the best in the latest in terms of materials, so that the bridge structure itself will be able to withstand higher lows and crushing forces. Honestly, it's a tall order because we can't design for any situation that is -- that's -- we cannot design for anything that can happen in that sense. So, probabilistically, something may happen in the future. We could probably design for a one in a lifetime kind of event in the life of the bridge. But I think one thing that will be advantageous to us is as we start to gain more technology, the advent of A.I., quantum computing, we will be -- we will start looking at digital twins of our infrastructure. And the failure of the bridge -- the failure of the cargo ship power system, if it comes out to be that and direct of either generation or distribution, the digital twin of the ship would have predicted that and said to the operator, you should ensure that these elements are replaced before your next venture.

But the government and the drug manufacturer, they've argued that this type of injury is just far too removed, far too hypothetical to prove the basis of a lawsuit. Now, the lower courts disagreed. They let the lawsuit move forward. They even ruled in favor of the doctors. The lower court's blocking certain aspects of the pill, making it harder to obtain.

And it's a particularly fraught subject, obviously, because more than half of abortions are administered medically with the use of this abortion pill, mifepristone. And this pill has been available to women all over the country, but particularly those who live in states that have outlawed abortions. And it's still available because right now this pill can be shipped by mail. So, if the Supreme Court were to rule that it can't be as easy to obtain, it would really reverberate around the country.

Now, in a way the Supreme Court was hearing the case, it probably wouldn't remove the drug from the market completely because of the Appellate Court decision. What it might do, if it agreed with that lower Appellate Court, would be to roll back the regulations around how this can be used to where they essentially stood before 2016, when the FDA started to expand how the drug could be use. Through 2016 and 2021, they essentially made the drugs available through telehealth. So, in 2021 they said it could be delivered by mail, and they sort of solidified that through 2023. So, the concern is that if the Supreme Court does agree with the Appellate Court, that it could be much more difficult for people to access this form of abortion, which is, as you see from the numbers, an increasingly important way that patients access this kind of abortion.",
