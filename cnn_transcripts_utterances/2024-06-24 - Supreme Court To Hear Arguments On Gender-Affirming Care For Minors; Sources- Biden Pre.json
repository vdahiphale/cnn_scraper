      "sentences": "Well, Manu, this is the first time the court is really going to delve into the complicated and politically fraught issue of gender affirming care. And, of course, we're still waiting to wrap up this Supreme Court season, but here the justices, they have selected a blockbuster case with nationwide implications to be heard next term.Now this case specifically focuses on a transgender care ban in Tennessee. The state law enacted last year bans hormone therapy and puberty blockers for minors and also imposes civil penalties on doctors who violate the law. Now a number of states have put in place similar bans. Right now, nearly half of all states have bans on transgender care for minors. Republican lawmakers who support the ban say decisions about care should be made after an individual becomes an adult. But opponents argue that in addition to violating the civil rights of trans youth, the law also conflicts with parents rights to make decisions about their child's medical care. The Biden administration, along with families of transgender minors, challenged the Tennessee law and a similar law in Kentucky. But the Supreme Court specifically agreed to hear the challenge out of Tennessee. And Manu, the case will be heard in the fall.",

Thank you both for coming in. How much you guys have obviously dealt with various aspects of post debates, post spin and all the rest? And how much of the debate is when you prepare for it as a candidate is about creating those positive viral moments or just simply just avoiding harmful ones or I guess both, especially in this time where memes and social media and these quick 10-second videos can drive the perception after the debate?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, yes, a lot of debate prep is about driving toward the things that you hope you're going to make the overarching narrative coming out of the debate focus on, right? But there's also a risk of over preparing.I think for a lot of cantina (ph), Ronald Reagan famously had that moment. I'm going to bring he was also an actor and a terrific performer. And so, you know, sometimes over cranking on trying to create or fabricate a moment that feels real can be a mistake, can kind of be a trap. Really the goal of prep is for your candidate to zero in on the three or four arguments that they really want to drive throughout the night. And then you work through different situations. How do you pivot back? How do you really, you know, go in with the knife when necessary? But it's more about prep. It's more about internalizing those arguments, being ready to make them. And then also working through how you engage with the camera. I mean, I think that's one thing that's going to be interesting and sort of unique about this debate this week. You know, no audience essentially solely playing to the camera, solely playing to the TV audience at home. That's something that Biden historically has been good at. If you go back and look at the 2020 debates, he had a lot of moments where he really, you know, went straight to camera and talked about how what he, you know, what he was proposing to do was going to impact you at home. So a lot of prep is working through how to work the camera and I would expect you'll see some of that on display this week too.",

I think what the Biden campaign has to do, and then what Joe Biden has to do, obviously, is go at the substantive weaknesses that Donald Trump has. Regardless of stylistically how he's presenting himself, Donald Trump can present himself as the suavest debater of all time. He still has to defend January 6th and the things he said about January 6th. Abortion, the fall of Roe, the fact that he's bragged about the -- putting justices on the Supreme Court who brought Roe down. I mean, these are substantively issues where he is out of touch with most of America, but certainly with the moderate swing voters, we're going to decide this election.
