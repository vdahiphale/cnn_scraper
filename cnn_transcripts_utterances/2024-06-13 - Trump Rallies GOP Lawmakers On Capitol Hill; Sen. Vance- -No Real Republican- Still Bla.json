Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to keep the abortion drug mifepristone on the market, there was a major vote in the Senate where Republicans blocked a bill that would guarantee access to IVF, in vitro fertilization, and OB GYN watching the impact of all of this in her own hospital is going to join us ahead.Plus, new comments today from Fani Willis, the Georgia prosecutor with a criminal case against Donald Trump that seems to be on hold. One day after a CNN interview with Nathan Wade, her former staffer and romantic partner was interrupted, just as Kaitlan Collins started asking about the timing of the romantic relationship with District Attorney Willis. And leading this hour what House and Senate Republicans are saying about their back to back meetings today with former President Donald Trump and that handshake with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Let's get straight to CNN's Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. And Manu, what are you hearing from the Republican lawmakers after their closed door meetings?",

You are seeing the agenda 45 coming out or agenda 47. President Trump's putting out a number of different policy issues, whether it's about how he's going to reform the bureaucracy, what he's going to do on tax code. You actually saw him just announced the other day in Nevada that he's going to actually eliminate a tax on tips, which is a direct appeal to wage workers in the blue collar class here in the United States.And so, it's clearly shows that he's actually looking forward and maybe he's listening to Tim Burchett a little bit.",

What happens on January 6 disqualifies Donald Trump in his judgment from being president of United States. Obviously, I agree with that, as do many Republicans.

And so that was the confusion. And then obviously, you saw after that moment, he had a very different answer. And it was really just talking about how it wasn't relevant to the heart of this. Now, I will say two things. One, it was a pretty obvious question about the timeline, because that is really the central part of all of this. They testified about it when they were both on the stand. And secondly, Jake, obviously, this is a matter that is not resolved yet. This is still going before the Court of Appeals in Georgia.It's why this case is entirely frozen right now. Judge McAfee can't do anything. And we likely won't hear anything on it until the spring at the earliest. And so, that case is not happening before the 2024 election. And so, it actually is quite important. He made the point that what his relationship with was with Fani Willis isn't relevant to what's in the heart of the indictment. That's obviously true.
