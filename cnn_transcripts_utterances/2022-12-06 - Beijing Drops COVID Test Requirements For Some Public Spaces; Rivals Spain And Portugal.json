Even though he's without a club at the moment, he wants to carry on playing at the top level of his game. Perhaps no surprise that because of his status.He has been dominating the talk and the buildup to the last 16 encounters once again. Not only speculation about whether or not he's signed a deal for a team in Saudi Arabia. Also, talk of unrest with his manager Fernando Santos after his reaction to being substituted often in their last game against South Korea. Some sources giving it all pretty short shrift, you have to say. He says we are here and talking, and focused on winning this World Cup. And they need to be focused because they've got a tough match ahead of them today against the Swiss side to actually beat them the last time they met back in June. Now, in terms of the earlier game, the crowd here, without doubt, majority behind Morocco, the last side flying the flag for the Arab nations here in this tournament. There has been an incredible last- minute demand for tickets. We can hear the fans in the suite behind us already ahead of their encounter against Spain -- a match that their boss Walid Regragui has described as the biggest in their country's history back at this stage of the tournament for the first time since 1986. And it really would be an upset that they are very keen to cause, but it would be a big one beating the 2010 champion, Spain. But I have to say, Christine, you wonder whether or not these four sides watched on last night as Brazil did their thing. If hope and expectation around them lifting a record-extending six trophies was high ahead of their last 16 encounter, it is now absolutely through the roof after what really was a magical performance. It sounds cliche but it really was like a PlayStation game that we saw play out at times, with the team's spirit, the dancing on the touchline after the goal. Sixty-one-year-old coach Tite getting involved in his suit, looking a little bit incongruous dancing with the players. But they certainly put on a show. They had the well-wishes of Pele ahead of the game and it worked.",

Goldman Sachs warns to raise the debt limit next year, bipartisan support will be necessary but hard to achieve. The fight could rock markets and threaten the economy on the brink of recession with a very real possibility of a catastrophic default. Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets are mixed.

And a survey from the Business Roundtable shows CEOs more cautious amid persistent domestic and global economic headwinds, including high inflation and rate hikes. On inflation watch, gas prices fell another two pennies overnight, now sitting at $3.38 a gallon. Let's bring in Harvard economics professor Ken Rogoff. Ken, so nice to see you this morning. You know, we've been seeing these hopeful signs that inflation may be peaking, but I'm wondering what you think about wages. Strong wage growth and a strong jobs market -- is that where we should be looking here? Those fatter paychecks, while welcomed for workers, might be a problem in the overall economy? KEN ROGOFF, ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY (via Skype): Well, exactly, Christine. Prices are slowing a bit, though we're still on a rollercoaster, but wages have been coming out stronger than any expected. That's good news except that the Federal Reserve worries that's going to feed back into prices, and so they look determined to keep raising interest rates.",
