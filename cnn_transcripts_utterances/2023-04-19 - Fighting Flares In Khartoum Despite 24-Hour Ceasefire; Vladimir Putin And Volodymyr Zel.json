The boats were destroyed last week by tropical cyclone Ilsa, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority.And they went up stuck on the small island of Bedwell of Australia's northwestern coast. The fishermen were luckily spotted by an Australian Border Force aircraft during a planned surveillance mission. Authorities say at least eight other people from another fishing boat are still unaccounted for. At least 21 people have died at a hospital fire in Beijing Tuesday, one of the deadliest in the city in years. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout live for us in Hong Kong. This was sort of in the heart of Beijing, a black smoke could be seen rising above the city. You know, government centers have been removing online posts about the fire. So, what do we know about that as well as these dramatic sort of rescue attempts or escapes if you like? [00:20:01] KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, very dramatic and frightening video of that has been released and widely circulating on social media for people across China and around the world to see. What we know is this, at least 21 people are dead after a fire erupted in a hospital in Beijing on Tuesday. According to state run news media, we know that the fire broke out at around 1:00 p.m. local time on Tuesday, was extinguished about half an hour later. 71 patients were evacuated but tragically many did not make it. Now, this video that we're sharing with you right now, it shows you one person was able to exit the hospital through window using a bed sheet, this person climbed down the window, lands on a roof like structure, scrambles across to the rooftop of a neighboring building for relative safety. But later in this clip, which was widely circulated on social media in China, we see others attempting to exit. You could see them there perching perilously on these air conditioning units outside waiting for help. And CNN we were not able to confirm, we do not know whether these people were rescued or not. This hospital fire was one of the most deadliest to strike Beijing in recent years. That death toll surpasses the fire that broke out in the Daxing district of Beijing in 2017, which took the lives of about 19 people that happen in a crowded and cramped building housing migrant workers and it prompted authorities to crack down and demolish these illegal structures. Now, according to state run news media, they say that top officials were able to visit the site of the latest fire, the fire took place at this hospital in Beijing on Tuesday, including the Communist Party chief of Beijing, and he issued this statement, let's bring it up for you. Yin Li saying this, \"The fire is heartbreaking. The lesson is extremely profound. It sounded the alarm for us, reminding us that the string of safe production cannot be loosened even for a moment. And the elimination of fire hazards cannot be stopped for a moment.\" But official Chinese media did not report on this incident until many, many hours after the fire broke out and was extinguished. And that has prompted a really angry outcry and much criticism on social media in China, including this from a user on Weibo who points out \"The incident happened after 12:00 p.m. afternoon local time, not a single media outlet reported on the breaking news at the time, nearly 10 hours later, after 9:00 p.m., state media start to release standardized press releases\". Goes on to say \"The media has now basically become copy machines for standardized press releases\". A hospital fires are rare in China, the investigation as to how this one took place.

So the National Association of Marine Laboratories laid out its objections based on scientific grounds in a position paper last December, and here's part of it.\"The supporting data provided by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and the Japanese government are insufficient and, in some cases, incorrect, with flaws in sampling protocols, statistical design, sample analysis and assumptions, which in turn lead to flaws in the conclusion of safety and prevent a more thorough evaluation of better alternative approaches to disposal.\" Apart from that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln? So when someone says, Trust me, I'm from Tokyo Electric, or says something like this, what you're about to hear, in the days after the nuclear meltdown -- here it is.

And so it's not unusual to -- to release it into the ocean once it's been treated and try to dilute it.But you have to do it right. And one of the challenges I think we face is that there are these longstanding questions about whether TEPCO does things right. So, you know, this is really one of those situations where I think you want to measure twice and cut once and really proceed very, very carefully.",

This could go well on for a century here.

But ultimately, there is this fundamental issue that you can't put too much of the water out too quickly. You have to really make sure it's properly treated, and you have to release it relatively slowly.So you know, I think at a -- at a fundamental level, it all comes back to do you have faith in the regulatory processes that -- that are in place? And I completely understand why people have real cautions and want to make sure that this is being done right. Because you know, in the past, things have not always been done right.",

And so again, I -- I know I'm reassured by the science when I look at it, but there is this human element.
