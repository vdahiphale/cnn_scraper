But they reiterated to me today that they have strong leads that they have been working around the clock and they have information, they just cannot reveal it to the public right now, so that they don't ruin the integrity of the investigation.They know they sound like a broken record. I feel like I sound like a broken record at this point repeating that same information. But this is what they're telling me and they also understand the sensitivity around this because family are desperate for answers. Kaylee Goncalves's father said over the weekend in an interview that he wants to create some kind of reward system so that, you know, they can get more information, more tips.

But it's curious because he was convicted of one murder in court. This just happened. And he admitted to four others and so they did not take that to trial. And that sort of is a sign right there that they negotiated something for closure for the families.Now, this is a man that is a convicted serial killer. He has committed multiple murders in New York and New Jersey, but this is brand-new because he now has been convicted of another young woman that was in 1968. Her name was Diane Cusick, she was a dance instructor. And she told her parents that she was going to the mall in February of 1968 to buy some new dance shoes. And so, she didn't come back home. They didn't know what had happened to her. So, they got in their car that night and they went to the mall. They found her car and then they found her in the backseat. She was deceased. She had tape over her mouth and her hands were tied. So, at that point it was unsolved. It's been unsolved since 1968. It was manual asphyxiation. They also determined that, in fact, they were able to take these samples but DNA had not progressed to the ability to test them. And so, they got the lead, 2021 they did the DNA testing. Last year it was confirmed to a known sample of Richard Cottingham. Now there were others that as I said he admitted in court that he murdered. We want to show you some of their pictures because these victims are important too. Very important. First of all, in 1973, Sheila Heiman was bludgeoned to death in her home. Her husband had gone to the department store for a minute. Then Mary Beth Heinze in 1972. She was only 21 years old. She was found face down in a stream. Now, the same modus operandi, the method of operation, 1972, Laverne Moye, same area. And then Rosado Nieves was 18 when she was strangled to death. Now, there was a press conference yesterday after the courtroom procedure and, of course, there were victim impact statements. I want you to listen to one of the relatives of Laverne Moye.

This time it's from a Taiwanese company, TSMC, which is announcing another $28 billion of investments bringing its total investments here in Arizona to $40 billion. And it's just one of several companies that is looking to get a piece of the pie as it were of these $52 billion in subsidies for chips manufacturing that are part of this CHIPS and Science Act that was passed this summer.You can see there's TSMC, you have Intel investments, IBM, Micron, all of these are investments that President Biden has been traveling across the country to highlight over these last several months. Now the president will also be highlighting some of the ripple effects of these investments that go beyond those dollar figures. A cleaning company, for example, that is contracted by TSMC. Talking about the fact that these kinds of investments create opportunities beyond the industry in which they are based. And of course, this isn't just about economic benefits. It's also about national security, those supply chain concerns that we saw over the COVID pandemic. We all learned how essential these semiconductor manufacturing chips actually are to the U.S. economy and on the national security front, so many of these chips are made in Taiwan and, of course, with China ramping up its threats of potential invasion against the island, that is certainly weighing heavily. And that's why you see some of the companies that buy the chips from TSMC represented here today including Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. He's here talking about the importance of bringing semiconductor manufacturing production here to the United States. And just finally on the political front of all this. This is President Biden's first visit to the state since he became president. He won this state, of course, in 2020, Democrats carried the races for the Senate and the governorship here and President Biden as he mulls a potential 2024 run, there's no question that these investments, his presence in the state will be crucial to those ambitions -- Alisyn, Victor.",

What's the difference between processed and ultra-processed foods? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well let's talk about unprocessed is, so that's the healthiest. That's things like vegetables, fruits, legumes, beans, meat that's not been processed, milk and eggs. Ultra-processed, we're talking about all the things that we love, that our kids love, things that are high in saturated fat, sugar, additives and salt. So, Pizza, ice cream, candy, processed meats like sausage or baloney, all of the savory and sweet snacks. So, as you mentioned, a large proportion of the American diet is ultra-processed foods. And we know there is a link there to cardiovascular disease, obesity and cancer. But what hasn't really been looked at before extensively is the link to cognitive decline.

Which is, if their diet had greater than 20 percent of daily consumption of these ultra-processed foods that they were at risk of faster decline in terms of their cognitive function, both global cognitive function and what we call executive function. Which is your ability to process information and make decisions. And it doesn't take a lot to reach the 20 percent mark. If you think about a 2,000 calories a day diet, that's about 400 calories, cheeseburger and fries, soda and a bag of chips. So, it's really important to be mindful about how were eating.",

They charged these two Trump Corporation entities and Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer.Remember, this was in the scope of this long investigation. They were hoping to get Allen Weisselberg to flip, to cooperate and help them on their broader investigation into the accuracy of the Trump Organization's financial statements. So, they charged Allen Weisselberg on this. He pled guilty earlier this year in August to 15 felonies. He agreed to part of the plea deal to testify in this case as a state witness in exchange for a lenient prison sentence. Now when Allen Weisselberg was on the stand, he walked this tight rope both giving the prosecutors what they want, telling the truth that he had engaged in this fraudulent scheme, but he walked a very fine line saying -- telling the jury that he did not conspire or scheme with any members of the Trump family. You know, that was a prosecutorial decision. Why they decided just to charge Weisselberg and not other people. But a number of other individuals who were implicated in this, testified before the state grand jury. And in New York state if you testify before the grand jury, you get immunity. So, they needed to get some of these insiders of the Trump Organization, a place where people worked for decades. That's one thing that became quite apparent during this trial. How many people have worked there for more than 20 years. So, they had some insiders cooperating under an immunity deal. Weisselberg was obviously the big fish as the chief financial officer. And he personally benefited from this. His tax returns were fraudulent and he received these falsified documents that enabled him to pull off this scheme -- Alisyn, Victor.

It's also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan District Attorney. Their theory now that part of the income for employees including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability. That theory has been vindicated. A jury found that that conduct was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.But I think, Alisyn, is that asking the exact right questions here. Which is, why did we end up with this sort of half measure where the corporation has now been found guilty? Which will result in financial penalties but no individual was ever charge beyond Allen Weisselberg. And no individual will be going to prison beyond Allen Weisselberg. And I think there's a fair criticism there of the district attorney for the way they've sort of charged this case in half measure and they've not gone all the way.",

Instead, they gave Allen Weisselberg this sort of halfway cooperation deal with a said, you can testify about what you did. How you committed tax fraud and then we're going to have you testify against the Trump Organization but not against any individual. And Weisselberg's testimony at trial was sort of cut both ways. Bothprosecution and defense saw Weisselberg as a good witness for them in some respects and a bad witness for them in some respects. Weisselberg said, yes, there was a tax fraud. Yes, I benefited. That's good for the prosecution but then Weisselberg tried to say, but it was really something that I did without the knowledge or the acquiesce of the people who ran the Trump Organization, including Donald Trump himself -- which was good for the defense. Now the jury obviously found that Weisselberg conduct was attributable to the company as a whole which is why we ended up with this guilty verdict. But again, the really frankly unsatisfying result where the only human being who's going to go to prison at all for this is going to be Allen Weisselberg and nobody else.",
