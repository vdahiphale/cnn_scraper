We are so glad you're with us on this Monday. Right now, we are in the final hours of a four-day truce between Israel and Hamas. A source tells CNN, a slight issue, though, has come up that could delay today's hostage release. The White House tells us it is unknown if anyone Americans will be in the group released today. Both sides are talking about extending the truce, which would allow for more hostages to be released in the coming days. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESMAN:  We are taking the necessary steps in order to be prepared for a new mobilization, a renewed attack against Hamas and its strongholds, wherever they are holding out. They are still holding over 100 -- around 200 hostages. Ten people a day, that could be 20 days. So we need to keep that in mind. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Biden says that Abigail is getting the care she needs in Israel after 50 days in captivity and witnessing Hamas murder both of her parents during the October 7th terror attack.Look at this, we also saw nine-year-old Emily Hand, released and reunited with her family. Her father says that he was originally told that Emily had been killed on October 7th, but there she is. She was at a sleepover at a friend's house when Hamas attacked. Let's start our coverage this hour with Kaitlan Collins. She is live in Tel Aviv. Those images, Kaitlan, of those little kids getting to come home is everything. What about today, the slight delay that may happen? Do you have any reporting on that?",

      "sentences": "Yes, we actually do have new reporting on what's going on. Obviously, this is day four of a four-day truce. The big question is whether or not it's going to be extended. But part of the issue is still just getting through this day in and of itself and this fourth list of hostages that are set to be released.And my colleagues, Alex Marquardt, M.J. Lee and I are hearing that right now there are basically these ongoing negotiations between the U.S., Israel, and Hamas that is being negotiated -- or mediated, I should say, by Qatar. And it's an issue with what today's list looks like. And one of those main issues I'm told, and what's part of these ongoing negotiations is that there are no mothers on this list. That is what I'm hearing from an Israeli official. And of course, part of this agreement, Israel says, is that any children who are in captivity with their mothers must be released with those mothers. You've seen a number of children who have been released by Hamas in the last three days come out with their moms, if their moms were in captivity. There was one moment on Saturday, on day two, when there was a major delay in the release of the hostages where one of the hostages was released without her mother. Hamas claimed that they could not find her, they could not locate her. Her uncle later came out and said that she told them it was just two days before that she had been with her mother and they were separated. So that's still an outstanding issue. And it appears to be an issue that has resurrected itself with today's list. We are hearing that there are no mothers on this list, though there are still several moms, we believe, being held by Hamas. Now, whether that's an issue if Hamas is playing games, if they don't want to turn them over, if they genuinely do not know where those mothers are, that remains to be seen at this point. But this is appearing to be what is a sticking point in these talks today, in this issue. And obviously, it's a major one, because it's typically in about an hour or so from now that we would start to see the exchange of those hostages get underway. That, so far, it's still a major question whether or not that's going to happen today.",

Chen Goldstein Almog along with her daughter Agam and two sons Gal and Tal, they are waking up this morning in Israel at a hospital after a 51-day nightmare. Here they are in the hospital, finally, together with their family. Chen and her three children are also returning to a shattered family. Her husband, Nadav, and their 21-year-old daughter Yam were murdered during Hamas's attack on October 7th. They used to be a family of six, look at them there, and now they are four.This morning, Chen's brother said his sister knew that her husband and her daughter was murdered while she was being held hostage by Hamas. Their home is one of the Israeli communities right near Gaza where so many were murdered and abducted. That horrific day, Hamas terrorists entered their safe room, murdering Nadav and Yam and abducting Chen and three of her children. And joining us now is Nadav's cousin, Galia Mizrahi she was born in Israel. She did also serve in the IDF. And thank you so much for joining us this morning. I am deeply sorry for your loss, but also so happy for you that those members of your family are finally safe. GALIA MIZRAHI, FAMILY MEMBERS RELEASED BY HAMAS, TWO KILLED ON OCTOBER 7TH:  Thank you. Yes, we are very relieved. We feel like a ton of bricks has been lifted over our hearts. It's been very difficult for me to witness this from far away. I was in Israel for Nadav's funeral and his daughter's funeral, for Yam. It was a devastating double funeral. And I've been here for the past two weeks, holding my breath, and yesterday was finally able to get that big sigh of relief out when I saw them on the screen.",

Family photos show them very pale, very, very pale and frail, but outwardly in good condition. There are no wounds, they weren't shot. There's no visible physical wounds.In terms of emotional healing and what that will look like, we'll know in the coming days, and potentially even coming years. There's really no playbook addressing kidnapped children at such a tender age. And so, the word's out on that. But we are so very grateful that we were reunited with them yesterday and that, unlike potentially other families, Chen, the mom, and the three kids were able to get out of there as a family unit.",
