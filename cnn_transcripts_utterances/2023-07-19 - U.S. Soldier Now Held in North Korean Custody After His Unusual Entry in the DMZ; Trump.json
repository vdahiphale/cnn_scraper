That's how the Pentagon explained an American soldier's highly unusual entry into North Korea. And now the question officials are trying to answer is why? Zeroing in on Donald Trump, the former president likely facing new criminal charges over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. We'll discuss Trump's mounting legal troubles just ahead. And no relief from the heat, Europe's scorching temperatures are only getting worse, triggering an E.U. red alert for several countries.

Well, the U.S. is facing a new diplomatic headache after an American soldier crossed into North Korea and is believed to be detained there.The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command says he, quote, \"made a run across the demilitarized zone in the Joint Security Area, was picked up by the North Koreans and we've had no contact at this point.\" Now Kristie Lu Stout is live in Hong Kong, and joins us now. Good to see you, Kristie. So what more are you learning about this U.S. soldier and how he crossed into North Korea and of course, what efforts are underway now to resolve this?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, the U.S. soldier, he broke away from a tour group and crossed into North Korea willfully and without authorization. The U.N. command says it's working with the North Korean military to resolve this incident. And earlier today, North Korea fired two ballistic missiles, so attention is certainly high in the Korean Peninsula.Now, we have learned more about the U.S. soldier. He is Army Private Travis King. He was not in uniform when he crossed over into North Korea. He spent some 50 days in a detention facility in South Korea for assault involving at least one South Korean national. And he was facing disciplinary action by the U.S. military. He was set to be separated from the U.S. Army. A U.S. official told CNN that King was being escorted to the airport to go back to the U.S. But because the escorts couldn't go through customs, he was able to leave the airport. And then King later showed up crossing into North Korea during a tour of the Joint Security Area, or JSA. Let's bring up footage of this area. The JSA is located inside the DMZ. That's the highly fortified border separating the two Koreas. Now, the JSA tour is organized by the U.N. command. It's open to the public. And while there are checkpoints to get to the JSA, when you're there, the actual border between North and South Korea is only this small raised line on the ground. Now let's show you this photograph. You may remember when former U.S. President Donald Trump met with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, at the JSA in June of 2019, and there you see it. He stepped across that very line. Now during a JSA tour, participants are kept about 20 yards away from the line. Now, this border crossing incident, it comes at a time of high tension. This year, North Korea has fired about a dozen missiles, including long-range ICBMs. And earlier this morning, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the waters off its eastern coast. So tension certainly rising on the Korean Peninsula, the fate of this U.S. soldier uncertain. Back to you, Rosemary.",

We have known all along since the January 6th congressional hearings where the Congress laid out in pretty compelling details the efforts that Donald Trump made to obstruct an official congressional act, i.e. the act of the peaceful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election. We knew based on the witnesses that testified during that hearing,based on a lot of the documentary evidence that was presented during the congressional hearings, and the referral to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation and charges that were made by that investigatory body, that these charges were likely to come. And once the special counsel, Jack Smith, was appointed by the attorney general, it was only a matter of time before Donald Trump would have to face criminal charges and be held accountable for his actions related to the insurrection and efforts to overturn the legitimate election of Joe Biden as president.",

So there may actually be criminal charges, mail fraud and other kinds of fraudulent charges based on the fundraising that Trump continues to do with respect to the big lie. CHURCH: And Areva, Trump's legal woes don't end there, of course, with additional charges likely relating to other investigations into his actions. Judge Eileen Cannon is signaling that she will side with Trump on the timing of his classified documents trial. Apparently, she's open to delaying that trial, just as his side wants.

Does it want to nominate someone to be its candidate for president that is twice impeached and likely to be thrice, if not thrice times two, indicted, both in federal court and state courts? Particularly, we now know that he's indicted in the state of New York by the New York Manhattan district attorney.And what does that say about the GOP party? The party that is supposed to be the law and order party, if it puts forth a candidate facing the kind of legal jeopardy that Donald Trump is facing? And as you've indicated, this won't end with a potential indictment over January 6. There is the indictment in Georgia, the potential indictment by that district attorney. That district attorney has indicated that we should expect something early August. He still has a civil case pending with E. Jean Carroll. We know the woman has already won $5 million against him in a civil suit. There's a Letitia James civil lawsuit going forward in New York. So. Literally, Donald Trump could be facing five or six criminal and civil trials by the time we get to the election next year. And I'm just not convinced that despite the way the MAGA base is supporting him today, that base is going to stick with him as more and more evidence becomes available with respect to the multiple criminal enterprises that he is likely to be charged with.",

Some from the activities of air defense, falling fragments, shards of glass, residential areas being affected by that. There's also a report from the head of the regional administration in Odessa saying that some of the missiles did get through, hit a grain and oil terminal at Odessa port. Don't forget, this comes just two days after Russia pulled out of that Black Sea grain initiative. So a really serious night in Odessa. More details still coming to light on the damage there.
