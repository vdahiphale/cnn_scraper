One, they were trying to show that Pecker's memory isn't perfect, that he forgot small details, for example, that Hope Hicks was not at a 2015 meeting.Anderson, I understand were talking about things that happened nearly a decade ago. I think you were I could potentially forget who was at a meeting. We were at probably ten years ago. But the other thing they were trying to drive home for their questions to Pecker so the judge notes that a hearing on this gag order that you are were just talking about actually happened next Thursday at 9:30. This will be the second time the judges had a hearing related to an alleged gag order violations since this trial started. And again, we're still waiting for his decision on the first one. But the other point defense attorneys made was that this arrangement that Trump had with \"The National Enquirer\" was not unusual and this is keeping the defense attorneys because they're trying to show that this was not something that they did special just for Trump ahead of the election. And Pecker talked about how they also suppress negative stories for other high-profile men like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Wahlberg, they didn't get too deep into their questioning.",

And if you read lots of profiles of Pecker, I will stop for one second to get outdated inside the court, saying for now, the judge says the Trump team should continue to object to text messages as the prosecutors tried to admit them to evidence, so they're having a little dispute, the prosecutors and the defense attorneys about which text messages in this case can come in as evidence. So the judge said he's going to take those on a case-by-case basis. But it seems if you read the history of their relationship Pecker and Trump, Pecker really admire of Trump. He admired his success, his fame his wealth. The women who are around him now the judge says he agrees with Trump's lawyers generally that at some point the text messages could become sort of cumulative -- cumulatively prejudicial to Trump so what the judge is saying here is that at some point, all of these text messages together could become too prejudicial to come in to the case.
