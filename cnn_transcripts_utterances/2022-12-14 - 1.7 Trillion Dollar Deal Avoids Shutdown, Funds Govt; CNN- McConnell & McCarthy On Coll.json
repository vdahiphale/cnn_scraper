      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. Let's make a deal. The top negotiators in Congress announced an agreement to avoid a government shutdown. So far, we know only some of the details, but there is heavy behind the scenes drama. House Republicans were excluded from this dealmaking.Plus, fighting hate, survivors of the horrific Club Q shooting testify up on Capitol Hill. They're highlighting a rise in extremism and violence targeting the LGBTQ community. And many of you well, you're in the mood for someone new, when it comes to picking a president. We'll share with you in just a few moments brand new CNN polling on Donald Trump and Joe Biden, as we look ahead to the 2024 presidential cycle. But we begin with where the top negotiators in Congress have a plan, not only to avoid a holiday season government shutdown, but to fund everything for a full year. And news today, House Republicans are angry about this $1.7 trillion spending framework. Detail still hard to come by. But we are told the agreement is expected to include billions in additional aid for Ukraine, and a rewrite of the Electoral Count Act that measure designed to prevent another January 6. Out it's an extension of the Child Tax Credit championed by many progressives, as well as measures to help the cannabis industry, use the banking system. Noticeably missing from the deal announcement, any mention of House Republicans. Democrats run the House until the end of the year. So, House Republicans at least publicly say any big decision should be punted until they take the gavel. The House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy telling members in a private meeting, quote, he's a hell no, on a full year spending bill. And because of that, we have new details about tensions between McCarthy and the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. Let's get straight up to Capitol Hill and our chief correspondent, Manu Raju. Manu, a deal and some drama?",

Even the Republican senators who are probably going to vote for this and feel that they are being jammed here.This has been a very regular process on Capitol Hill that they cut a deal among the leadership and the key appropriators and then they unveil the details and try to jam it through Congress in just a couple of days. Even though they had an initial deadline of September 30 to get this done, they couldn't get a deal there. They punted it until this Friday's deadline, and now they are going to extend that Friday's deadline for another week to get it done and we are still awaiting the details. Now this has caused a rift among top Republicans, including Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell. McConnell wants a deal. He in fact, came out yesterday and said that this deal will be brought - will be a broad agreement and was praised the deal on the Senate floor this morning. There was a belief and understanding if you will, that Kevin McCarthy wanted to get this agreement, wanted a big spending package. But in recent days, he has gone on the offensive, criticizing this plan, just as he's trying to court the right wing of his conference to get the votes to become speaker. Last week on Fox News, McCarthy called out Mitch McConnell for supporting this proposal, negotiating this with Democrats. He McConnell, I'm told was blindsided by those remarks. And this all comes, John, amid a key moment when Republicans will take power in the House next year. McCarthy of course, wants to be the next speaker of the House. A new power dynamic will occur between the two men who have split on a whole wide range of issues from gun violence to infrastructure to de- raising the debt limit, another major issue that we'll deal with next year. But here on the spending package in the final days of the new Congress, real tension between Republicans in the House, Republicans in the Senate as they tried to come to a messy conclusion to this Congress.

Shalanda Young is actually the OMB Director, management and budget who has been leading for the White House on this as well as their alleged team, which is a large reason. The White House perspective, why they're on the cusp of a second major bipartisan deal to have full year spending bills locked into place.And the reason why that matters more than anything else, is because there's a very real possibility. This is the last one for the next two years. And the White House officials are keenly aware of those dynamics. What it means agency by agency to have full year spending levels is obviously extraordinarily important. We've seen the letters from Merrick Garland and from the Department of Defense across the board as to why continuing resolutions are bad. But let's think more broadly, if you talk to White House officials, they're looking at what else is on this. You mentioned the Ukraine funding, which is critical. They've been having classified briefings to tell lawmakers why it's so critical, but also the Electoral Count Act don't minimize that being added on to this and having a very clear pathway to being signed into law. That is a huge moment, a bipartisan effort. The White House wasn't deeply involved in, that now has a pathway and that is a big end of year when given everything that's been in place over the course of last year.",

We still don't know exactly what's in it. And that's important to me, because anytime you see, Senator is quiet about a deal that has been made, not really celebrating it too much. That tells me that there's still a lot of negotiating to do. And I know even from what I've heard so far, even later with this day, we might see a press conference from some Republican lawmakers who may stand in the way or at least put some stalling tactics in front of any sort of deal. Rand Paul has announced he's having a press release today.

Let's start with your view of the cycle if you will, hate, prejudice fear are nothing new. But your take is in the studies show that in this digital age, the social media age, where hate can just be spread and spread and spread. Just I noticed these statistics that you have, just since Elon Musk took over Twitter, for example, and said he's for quote, free speech. Racist tweets up to 202 percent, transphobic tweets 62 percent, homophobic tweets 58 percent, misogynist tweets up 33 percent.

That's the pool in which hate actors are able to spread, spread their disinformation and often underlying hate allies.One of the things that we've looked at going back was even before Elon Musk took over Twitter is the rise in people saying that gay people are grooming children, that trans people are grooming children, which really spiked. We saw a 400 percent increase after the passing of the don't say gay bill in Florida. And that's been sustained over time. So where do people spread these lies, these rumors that lead people to think, to think the most awful things that that lead directly to real life harm, like Club Q, is on social media platforms. And they have failed singularly to meet that task, even though they claim that these are outside their community standards. We actually did a short study a couple of months ago, 99 out of 100 times, when you reported tweets that broke Twitter's own rules on eliding being gay with being a groomer, with being a pedophile, they failed to take any action on those tweets whatsoever.",

Well, most of you think not. We asked this question on a new poll. This is just Republicans and those who say they are Republican leaning voters. 62 percent said they would prefer a different candidate. 38 percent, of nearly four in 10 Republicans say, Donald Trump's fine by me. But look at that. More than six in 10 Republicans and Republican leaders say, please give us someone else. But if Trump is the nominee, two thirds of Republican and Republican leading voters say yes, they would support him. That's significant, though a third at least at this early moment say, no they would not. So, what about the incumbent president? Well, he also has a - we want something new mood in his party. 40 percent say renominate Joe Biden and that would be our preference. This is Democrats and Democratic leaders. But nearly six in 10 say, I would like a different candidate next year. Again, though, and the president is even stronger on this one. If he is the nominee, eight in 10 Democratic or Democratic leaning voters. 78 percent say yes, of course, we would vote for the Democratic candidate. No, 22 percent say. But Phil Mattingly, here is the question I want to ask you, as our chief White House correspondent. 59 percent of Democrats, a Democratic leader say, we would like somebody different.
