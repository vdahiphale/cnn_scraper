This hour as Ukraine presses ahead with its offensive on Russian territory, Vladimir Putin calls on his military to squeeze out the invaders. Plus evacuation orders issued in Athens, Greece as wildfires broke closer to the city. And in the United States, new polling shows Kamala Harris pulling ahead of Donald Trump in critical swing states. Well, President Vladimir Putin is ordering his forces to drive Ukrainian military out of Russian territories, telling them to quote \"squeeze out the invaders\". It's his first major public remarks since Kyiv's surprise, cross-border attack in Russia -- or on Russia, a week ago. Russian officials are also evacuating thousands of civilians from more areas along the Ukrainian border as Ukraine pushes further into Russia. Meantime, Russia and Ukraine blaming each other for this, starting a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy shared this video showing smoke coming out of one of the towers on Sunday. He blamed Russia for using the nuclear plant to, quote, \"blackmail Ukraine, Europe and the world. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen has covered this war extensively for CNN. He joins us now today from berlin. Firstly, what do we know about what is going on on the other side of the Ukrainian border in Russia? And just how is Ukraine at this point trying to change the narrative here?",

We always need to remind our viewers, that is the largest nuclear power plant in all of Europe with that cooling tower smoke billowing from it. The Ukrainians are saying that the Russians were responsible for that fire, possibly setting tires on fire or something else. The Russians giving pretty much the opposing point of view on all that. They claim that it was a Ukrainian drone attack that hit that area. This coming from the Russian government. The International Atomic Energy Agency has for a very long time, had observers inside that facility. They only say that workers from that facility say that there was an explosion after some sort of drone strike. But of course these are also people that are from the Russian Nuclear Power Enterprise. So very difficult to ascertain what exactly happened. The important, or most probably most important thing in all of this is that both sides are saying that no increased radiation levels have been detected. However in this war, as its been ongoing, of course, that very power plant, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been one that's consistently almost been on the front line and we've really seen one dangerous situation after the next evolve there, which of course, is also the reason why the IAEA has deployed people to try and monitor the situation, Becky.",

Thank you.To the war in Gaza with ceasefire talks scheduled to resume this week as Israeli -- one Israeli source tell Hamas -- tells us that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar wants a deal. Hamas says a ceasefire should be based on the framework of what was the plan proposed by U.S. President Joe Biden back in July. It's unclear at the moment if Israel's prime minister will go along with that, or if the talks will even happen. And this uncertainty comes amid new signs that both Israel and the U.S. are making preparations for a wider regional conflict. CNN political and foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid reports that according to two sources, the Israeli intelligence assesses Iran could be planning an attack within days. Well, as a possible sign of deterrence, U.S. Defense Secretary ordered nuclear powered submarine armed with cruise missiles into Mideast waters.

Andafter that call is when we saw a readout of all of these new force posture changes that the U.S. is going to be making in the region which is perhaps telling. Yoav Gallant informed Secretary Austin about the Israeli fears, of course, that Iran is going to attack Israel. And in return, Austin said that the U.S. is prepared, of course, to defend Israel in the face of such an attack. And as proof of that, the U.S. is now signaling publicly that it is going to be sending the USS Georgia, which is a nuclear-powered, guided-missile submarine into the region. Something that is very rarely publicly announced by the Pentagon. Usually these submarines operate in complete secrecy. So clearly a message to Tehran and its proxies, including Hezbollah, that the U.S. is going to have a very robust presence in the region on top of, of course, all of the assets that have already been positioned there, including several destroyers, which of course are capable of shooting down missiles and drones, as well as a marine expeditionary unit in the eastern Mediterranean, which is capable of conducting special operations including evacuation operations. And importantly, the secretary said that he has ordered the USS Lincoln carrier strike group to speed up its transit to the region, so that it gets there faster than previously anticipated, going to replace the USS Roosevelt, which has been operating in the Gulf of Oman. So all of this in anticipation of something possibly quite big, but it is unclear at this point what exactly that's going to look like. Iran has been signaling, of course, for the last two weeks that it is going to potentially retaliate against the Israelis. But the U.S. now apparently taking that warning even more seriously, flexing its muscles and sending all of this additional hardware into the region, Becky.",

The ground is covered with blood and bodies but it is the wailing that is perhaps most harrowing. Gaza's civil defense says that around 6,000 people were sheltering at the Al-Tabi'in Islamic School compound in Gaza City. Many had recently arrived from the north after the IDF issued new evacuation orders there. Um-Mohammed (ph) comforts her son, sobbing over the loss of his father. \"They were all in pieces and dismembered,\" she says. \"I went to look for my husband and I couldn't identify anybody. They were all dismembered.\" Israel Defense Forces claimed the strike targeted Hamas and Islamic jihad fighters and says approximately 20 to 25 militants were killed. CNN cannot verify the number of casualties or if any combatants were among the dead. But video from the scene shows the remnants of one munition used -- a U.S. manufactured GBU-39, small diameter bomb. The strike comes just a day after the U.S. agreed to release $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel. \"What did the people do to deserve this,\" this man says. \"Where is the entire world? The whole world is seeing these massacres and staying silent.\" It is a stinging reminder of the international community's collective failure to protect innocent Palestinian civilians. At the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital families gathered to claim their dead and to say a final goodbye. Diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement have intensified in the past week.

Stage two would see Palestinian prisoners exchanged for the remaining hostages. And the last phase would see a potential for reconstruction of Gaza. Look, I know you're not a party to these -- to these talks. But as an agency, do you believe that the parties can reach a deal at this stage? S. ANDERSON: I very much hope so. I mean as I said, that's what's most desperately needed here in Gaza now is a ceasefire. I think it's very important that they are going to begin speaking. No, obviously agreement can be reached if talks aren't being held. And from our perspective, you know, we see the situation on the ground getting much worse. Polio has been detected, hepatitis A. We've seen a lot of skin disease in people. There's mountains of garbage that needs picked up. And for us to begin addressing any of those challenges we need a ceasefire to be in place. We can bring aid in at scale so people can start returning to their homes. So the hostages can go back to their families. And we can begin what's going to be a very long task of rebuilding Gaza.

Now the poll was taken over the same period that Harris picked Tim Walz as her running mate and began campaigning with him. So new momentum for the Democrats, but a lot can happen between now and November, of course. CNN chief U.S. national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny joining us now from Washington. We often and for all the right reasons, talk about these incredibly critical swing states. Those would give Harris a pretty clear path to the White House -- call out Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin for the example. What are these polls telling us about where she stands in those key states, Jeff? What are you taking from these polls. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well Becky, quite simply Democrats now have a chance to win and a month ago, those chances looked like they were diminishing to say the least, with President Biden on top of the ticket. Those polls that you just showed there underscore the exact reason why so many Democrats were really at their wit's end, trying to urge President Biden to reconsider his race. They believed this race was winnable, but they did not know if he -- if it was winnable with him. Now look, there is no question, this is still an incredibly close contest. There's no clear leader in those given the margin of error. However, looking at Vice President Harris at 50 percent, that is something that Joe Biden did not enjoy at all during the presidential campaign. So it shows that Democrats are back in the ballgame. It shows that they have consolidated their base of supporters and are reaching out and winning over some of those voters who are really not interested in this rematch with Trump or Biden. Becky, if you think of every election as a change election, we've seen it time and time again. Vice President Harris now is that change. Yes, she still represents the ideals and the ideology and the record of this Biden administration. But she is change and that is what's really driving these poll numbers.

And there is a good record on the infrastructure law and building other things, bringing down inflation. But simply we voters were not hearing it. They were not having it. So just the fact that she is now on the top of the ticket without really saying any of her economic policy proposals has changed the game. That says a lot. But there's no question that she will need to fill in some of the blanks here on her economic policy proposals. I'm told she will do it by talking about lowering costs of housing, of goods. She'll talk about the Biden administration' s record on lowering cost of insulin for example. They've done that to about $35 for some Americans, depending on your income level from an astronomically high number. So she will -- she can't really divorce herself from the Biden administrations record on this, but she can put some distance and talk about what she will do. So I'm told we're going to hear that later this week some more proposals, but Becky, just the simple fact that she is on top of the ticket has given a lot of voters a chance to sort of relook at this race and many do not like what they see with former president Donald Trump. And voters are giving her a look, there's no doubt. But I expect this to go up and down.

Behind a wall of shields obstructing the view of security cameras, the soldiers allegedly sodomize the detainee. Their victim was taken to a hospital in life threatening condition with injuries to his rectum and upper body, according to physicians for human rights Israel. Weeks after the early July incident, military police detained nine soldiers on suspicion of aggravated sodomy, abuse and other misconduct.

Barbie Nadeau with this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE NADEAU, CNN COMMENTATOR (voice-over): Roaming under hot temperatures, these goats search for food in fields turned brown by the heat in central Sicily. Shortage of water and little food make it hard for these Girgentana goats to survive, and the prospects for their survival leave goat breeder Luca Cammarata in despair. LUCA CAMMARATA, GOAT BREEDER (through translation): The grazing land is zero. As we can see, nothing has grown on the land this year. The animals take a walk, eat what they find, and then we try to supplement their diet with water and fodder. NADEAU (voice-over): Earlier this year, Sicily enforced water restrictions when the region declared a state of emergency. Italy's Environmental Protection and Research Institute says while other parts of the country are experiencing drought, only Sicily's is considered extreme. CAMMARATA (through translation): The land is dry. The lakes we have placed in the pastures are completely dry. It is difficult to satisfy the animals with the drinking water we had, and we are forced to plug the problem with water tankers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): We arrive wherever there is an emergency. The water doesn't arrive, so farmers are forced to take the animals to the slaughterhouse. They don't have water and can't quench their animals' thirst, so it's a big problem. NADEAU (voice-over): The cheese and dairy products made from these goats' milk has been prized for thousands of years, but that may soon come to an end. Deprived of water, these animals may be sent to slaughter. CAMMARATA (through translation): If we cannot at least satisfy the animals demand for water, they run the risk of being sent to slaughter. There is no other way, no other solution. There is no market for live animals. Nor can we give them to a fellow farmer in other regions, because there is currently no market for live animals. They are destined to go to the slaughterhouse, and this would be a considerable loss of livestock and a loss of production models.

And a stunning finish as the U.S. and China, sorry, tied for the most golds with 40 each. That's the first tie ever for total gold medals at the Summer Games. Team USA scored the most medals overall with 126. I'll call you why. I spoke with a sprinter who brought home five of those medals for the U.S. Gabby Thomas told Coy, it was a dream come true.

Well, LA's Olympic Committee is saying that no new permanent venues will be built for the games. They'll be using the world class venues instead. They already have in that part of the world. LA now charged with welcoming the world and putting its best foot forward. And let's hear now from the city's mayor, because the city's mayor has been saying they are hoping to stage a car free Olympics. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR KAREN BASS, (D-LOS ANGELES, CA): It means that if you are going to attend any of the sports venue, you're going to have to take public transportation. We've been building out our system, but we're also going to need a lot of buses, thousands of buses from neighboring cities and states to help us deliver that. Los Angeles is such a sprawling area, and so that's why it's going to be important to have festivals and activities in areas and neighborhoods and communities where games do not take place so that we can build an entire city spirit of the Olympics, exactly as they've done in Paris (END VIDEO CLIP)",
