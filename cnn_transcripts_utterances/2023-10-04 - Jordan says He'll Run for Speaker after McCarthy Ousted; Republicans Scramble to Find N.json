We're going to take a look at McCarthy's rocky rise to Republican leadership. And where do we go from here? I'll ask him McCarthy supporter, Representative Kelly Armstrong ahead. Hello, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching here in the United States and around the world. It's 11 am in Washington, Wednesday, October 4, 397 days until Election Day. This is today's \"State of the Race\". And because it's another one of these kinds of days, we are going to start with breaking news on Capitol Hill where Ohio Republican Jim Jordan says he's running for Speaker of the House. The House Judiciary Chair says he has strong support as Republicans look to choose their next leader. In the past, Jordan had consistently ruled out running for the top job. This all comes after Republicans, rebelled against their own and of course it has meant that for the first time in history, there is no current Speaker of the House. This is not politics as usual. And of course, the entire House leadership team is in limbo. In addition to Jordan, Louisiana Steve Scalise is calling colleagues to gauge support for a bid. One of those colleagues told CNN, \"He's getting good support already\". For the latest on all of this there's no one better than CNN, Manu Raju, who is live on Capitol Hill. Manu, this is big news that Jordan is going to do this. How does this play out behind the scenes especially it mean it's a headlong confrontation with Steve Scalise now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is going to be a week long battle behind the scenes will probably not see a lot of publiccampaigning, the effort to win over his colleagues will be about securing commitments telling them what he would do as Speaker and trying to convince the divide very bitterly divided House Republican Conference to all get behind them. But it's going to be a complicated task. And there's no sure bet to win this race because of the fact that this will be a contested race. Almost certainly we do expect Steve Scalise, the number two currently and the House Republican hierarchy to run for the seat in for the Speakership as well. There could also be some other candidates who might yet emerge. There's another key Congressman Kevin Hern, who is a member of the Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, which is the biggest conservative group in the House. He is gauging support as well. There are others who could also come along, but the challenge for all these candidates is going to be the votes. Do they have the votes? They could run into the same issue that Kevin McCarthy did back in January where it took him 15 bowels to become a Speaker, why? Because even after the Republican Conference chooses nominee, which were expected to be next week, a majority of the conference we have to vote to pick his nominee for Speaker than the full House has to vote. The House is narrowly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats will vote for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Republicans will vote for their nominee, but just for Republicans is all the Republican nominee can afford to lose if he or she were to lose five or more. That could be enough to undercut their bid to become Speaker, as we saw with Kevin McCarthy, and one reason why he is no longer Speaker. He lost just eight Republicans on that historic vote to oust him from the Speakership. So that means that the new Speaker will have to make a number of promises Kasie, to try to get members on board kidding. But those promises may conflict with other ideological groups within the House GOP. So, so many questions ahead as the Republican Party try to pick up his pieces here, Kasie.",

He is much more conservative than Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy aligned himself with those far right members of his own conference. So perhaps it wouldn't be a whole lot of difference. But we'll see if that actually comes to put to take shape. Because as the Speaker of the House, that is, of course, the most important position in all of Congress. And certainly in the House, they make the decision on what to bring to the floor of the agenda, all the rest, and depending on who the Speaker is, will affect what policy is will can actually become law affecting lives of Americans and people around the world. So Kasie here, we'll see if that actually happens. Jordan is the Speaker, but a long ways to go, Casey.",

So someone who is viewed as a McCarthy ally, like a Scalise, who was occasionally seen as a threat to McCarthy, but was mostly on the same page, and I think, is viewed if anything is as more policy focused than McCarthy but with a similar strength in the relationship department. Someone like Jordan, who's much more, as you said, on the sort of MAGA page, you have people talking about a Speaker Donald Trump say what you will about Donald Trump, he is the only unifying figure in the Republican Party. He is the figure who all of them agree on. There are no never Trump errs left in the House Republican conference, certainly not vocal ones. And so that doesn't even seem that crazy. But you know someone could have the support of 200 Republican members and still fall short of the Speakership. And that's what we saw McCarthy go through in January. And that's what's going to be the problem for all of these candidates is it's not enough to be a factional candidate. It's not enough even to represent the vast majority of House Republicans.

Her strength was always her ability to keep her caucus together, keep that caucus, which was ideologically and geographically and demographically diverse, and to have the Democrats be able to act as a unit. That was her leverage against the Republicans. So when she needed Republican votes, and she could always count exactly how many votes she needed. She knew where to go and get them. But McCarthy on the other hand did not have the unity of his conference behind him.
