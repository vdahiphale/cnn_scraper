Breaking this morning, Hurricane Milton unleashing on Florida officials eagerly awaiting daylight to see what Milton has done to their state. The storm making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Florida's Gulf Coast last night. Millions now without power as damaging winds and severe rain pummeled the state. The powerful storm dumping more than 18 inches of rain on St. Petersburg, a more than one in 1,000-year rainfall in that area, and ripping the roof off of the Tampa Bay Rays baseball stadium. And in Punta Gorda, Florida, a storm surge flooding the city. Storm chaser Aaron Jayjack standing in the downtown area as water poured in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

So, I'm here with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. They're responding to this call of people that have been trapped inside of the hotel. We can see their amphibious vehicle right here and some of the people that they have just gotten out of this hotel and they're going to bring them to dry land.Come with me this way, Wes. Here is the hotel full of water here on the front first floor. There's still some customer and staff members here awaiting their turn to get out of here. But the damage from the flood waters is extensive. And let me tell you, I lived in the Tampa Bay area for many years. This is extremely unusual, to see this sort of water, inland, in Plant City, on the eastern part of Hillsborough County. This is something I have never seen. This is something some of the folks that I spoke with here have never seen. They were taken by surprise once the water started rushing into the hotel and suddenly, they found themselves trapped. So, HCSO is working a lot of these water rescues as we speak. We know that they suspended services just past 11:00 last night because the conditions were too dangerous. Well, now it's a full flurry of activity to get people in dicey situations like this back into safety. And I've got the sheriff right here. Sheriff, is it OK to talk with you?",

Those winds, they're pretty circular as when they hit us, up to 74 miles per hour recorded at Orlando's airport. Because they were so strong, first responders, police officers had to be pulled from the roads for their own safety at some point. I'm not sure if you can see these trees that are here behind me. At some point this morning, at different points, they look like they're about to snap. That's how strong these winds are. But the real concern now is this flash flooding because of the rainfall, the multiple days in a row that this area has experienced rain. It hasn't stopped yet. Still coming down. There is a flash flood warning in this area.I did talk with the Emergency Management Division. They tell me that the first responders here, they're really waiting until the sun comes up to assess the damage of this area. So, right now, it's kind of just a sit and wait and see what happens. But we have seen some trees come and go. We've seen what appeared to be electrical outlets and transformers blow. You see, the power is still here behind me downtown right now. Obviously, not the case for some 3 million plus customers at this point. Kasie.",

The City of Punta Gorda tends to go underwater during a heavy rainstorm. So, we knew that was going to be flooded. And it took on a tremendous amount of water when Helene came through. So, we knew that was going to be one of our areas of concentration.But also, my understanding from reports back from my deputies is that our West County area out in Englewood took it pretty hard, that we have a lot of flooding out there and our Barrier Islands and the beach down there have all taken on a lot of flooding. We've seen a lot of buildings that have been damaged. But overall, the surge wasn't as great as it was predicted to be. So, I'm very happy on that.",

We don't have an entire assessment of the situation and the damage. So, we don't need you to get in the way of our first responders, and we don't need you to put yourself in danger.

So, we knew those areas that were affected by Helene were going to be at least two-fold affected by Milton. So, we have -- we planned accordingly.And also based on the surge predictions, we had our maps all laid out. So, we knew where we were going to send our SAR teams and what our plan of attack was. We also know that that has to be a fluid plan. So, as our air unit reports back to us as to what areas were hardest hit, we may have to adjust and go in there first.",

I can't promise that's what it's going to look like by the end of this live shot because that's how quickly that combination of the wind and rain changes here. We just checked in with power outages, that number continuing to grow, now nearing 90,000 here in Orange County. Several tens of thousands in Osceola County, where Kissimmee is, straight south of us.And our hotel, where we are, and we're in a hotel zone here, right near Disney, there's an interesting combination of the people who have come here. You've got some people who are -- were hoping to evacuate before the storm. I spoke with a family from the U.K. that they came here to the parks, but unfortunately, because of Milton, they shut down the parks early Wednesday afternoon. And then, you have people who have evacuated to this hotel. The lights are starting to come on in the rooms as they wake up. They can't use the televisions here. Last check the signal was out. But they're going to try to go through social media and check back on their homes and their businesses on the southwest coast. We are waiting for an update from the Orange County and Orlando authorities. They're back on the roads now. As you can see at this moment, the winds have calmed down. So, they are responding to some of those calls. Likely, they'll be checking the Greenwood neighborhood first, which is likely to -- when there's a lot of rain, to flood. We got an update from the Orlando International Airport on rainfall here. They've had about four and a third inches of rain since this started with more than three and a quarter yesterday, which is a single day record for that meter there at the airport. Still, two to three inches of rain to come today. So, they could get close to that record on the second day of Milton's impact here. So, again, as you're probably hearing from our correspondence all over this part of Florida and certainly, on the southwest portion, that they're waiting for the sun to come up. They're waiting to get that first look for themselves at some of the damage. We're certainly doing that here in Central Florida as well.",
