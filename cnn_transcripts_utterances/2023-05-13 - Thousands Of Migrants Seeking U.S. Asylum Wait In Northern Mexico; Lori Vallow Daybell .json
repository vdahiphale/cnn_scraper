That area from Del Rio down to Laredo, in areas of South Texas, already 2 to 4 inches has fallen. Now we're going to add more rain on top of it. Today, that's why you have the flash flood watches. And in fact, in a lot of these last through the entire day today, some of them even crossing into tomorrow. And then several flash flood warnings where you've already had a very significant amount of rain that has fallen in just the last few hours. In addition to flooding, you also have the potential for damaging winds and some hail and a lot of lightning with a lot of these storms not only in Texas but also areas of Oklahoma and the western portions of Arkansas as well as Louisiana.

And so when we get FDA approvals, it's unclear whether these devices or drugs are relevant to all populations.Suddenly, during the pandemic, we saw these companies actually pursuing populations and developing relationships. The other thing that we see in the middle of the public health emergency is that there were more touch points for populations of color with the health care system, especially with regard to access.

I mean, they just began these talks in earnest this past week. And a deal like this normally takes months to come together. And really, the reality is Congress doesn't have months, they have less than 20 days until June 1. That is the date that the Treasury Department said the government could default on its debt. And the Congressional Budget Office also released a report yesterday backing up the Treasury Department on this saying a default is likely within the first two weeks. And so really, there's a lot of anxiety and anxiousness of among a lot of these leaders and people on Capitol Hill about how they're going to do this. But I will say from my talks with some of the staffers involved in the negotiations, they have made some modest progress. Yes, they are talking finally for the first time they're sitting down in the same room. And some of these topics are centering around permitting reform, rescinding unspent COVID relief funds, as well as looking at I said permanent unspent cover relief funds and as well as some spending cuts. And that's something that the White House and Democrats are increasingly recognizing they might have to cave on and start to really to find some sort of deal here. Now, the President just moments ago, this morning, released a tweet warning of the economic calamity of not reaching a deal. He said that default would erase millions of jobs, trigger over session, his retirement accounts and increase borrowing costs and really saying it is not an option. And now, again, I think we're going to see these talks continue over the weekend and through next week. But really a deal needs to be in hand in the coming days in order to see this pass through Congress. Congress moves very slowly, they still need to draft a bill, sell it to both chambers and find a way to pass it before early June. And so we're going to see how these talks continue over the next few days.",

I think they're -- in order to satisfy a lot of those strong right wing, so to speak up members in the House, we do need to hold firm on some of the spending cuts. I think, getting back some of the COVID money is one but also one that is a very popular within the GOP is in instilling work requirements for safety net and that is a way that we can save money and also make a change with how government operates. Look, the question is going to be who blinks first and I have confidence in the two leaders as they're sitting at the table. I trust that Joe Biden is going to be the president that he has said he would be one that talks across the table and gets things done. I am concerned about there has been talk about Article 14, which is the President was able to unilaterally step in and solve the debt ceiling crisis. And I think that would be very problematic, because it avoids what needs to be done is having these legislative conversations and bipartisan compromise on both sides. That way everyone gets what we need. We don't go into the fear of defaulting on our debt. And we have some meaningful, important cost savings in the federal government.",

CNN's Danny Freeman takes a closer look at the case.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): There have been a lot of developments on this story that we first brought to you at the beginning of the week. Two prisoners escaped at the beginning of the week. Now there have been two arrests, but still one inmate is on the loose according to police. But first let me tell you about the inmate who was rearrested last night. 24-year-old Nasir Grant, he was arrested on Thursday evening at 10:30 p.m. and a U.S. Marshal spokesperson said that they were surveilling an area where they believe grant may have been hiding out in Philadelphia and then they saw a man walk out of a home in what they call full female Muslim garb with a head covering. Well, the U.S. Marshals they followed that man to an empty parking lot. And that's where they confronted him and ultimately arrested him. Now they said that Grant was visibly surprised when they approached him but he was -- rather he didn't surrender without incident to the U.S. Marshals. Meanwhile, there was also a second arrest earlier this week, in this case, a 21-year-old woman, Xianni Stalling. She's accused of actually helping these two men break out of prison back on Sunday, but at this point, we still don't have a lot of details as to how she potentially helped these men escape. At this point, she's facing four felonies including the felony of escape, but her defense attorney was not giving any comment earlier this week to CNN when we asked. Meanwhile, the last suspect, Ameen Hurst, that's the 18-year-old he's one of the gentlemen who's accused of escaping that prison also on Sunday. He's still out of the lucent. He was in prison initially suspected of four homicides. The U.S. Marshal says he is still considered to be armed and dangerous. But I should say the marshal said that earlier this week, they were splitting up their time devoting energy to funding to escaped inmates. Now they said that while it's been a long week, they can focus all of their energy on bringing back this one potentially escaped inmate. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
