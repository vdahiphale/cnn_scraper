We have witnessed in the pandemic, pandemic era, if you will, we've seen demonstrations.We've seen demonstrations regarding Black Lives Matter, in support of Black Lives Matter after George Floyd's murder. For another generation, there's a memory of the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations. So it's not simply a matter of high tensions and political controversy on our campuses. There have been a lot of demonstrations. And so what we have to come to terms with now is that part of our political culture, at the moment, is expressing oneself in dramatic terms. And students are reflecting, they are maybe at the front line of this. But they're not the only ones who are expressing themselves strongly. So we're seeing it now on campuses. And what is -- what is healthy about this, of course, is the ability in our country, as opposed to Iran and other countries, to express oneself and express one's disappointment and moral outrage. The challenge, however, is that the expression, the expression of these ideas can create unsafe spaces. And on college campuses, administrators are having a difficult time balancing free speech and security and the right to go to class and the right to take exams. And today is a tough day, because the administration of Columbia drew a red line, and the students, as I noticed when I was walking around the campus, they voted to cross that red line. And I think the university faces now a very difficult decision. Perhaps the university even regrets the fact that it drew a red line when it should have anticipated that the students and the protesters would cross it.",

If they are going to suspend all of those students, we can just see from these pictures that were looking at here from Columbia University, how many students potentially we're talking about that could be suspended because of this.I also -- Tim, there's this balancing that these campus communities are doing between free speech and between campus safety. Specifically, we've heard from so many Jewish students who do not feel safe. Then on the flip side, we have to look back in history. So let's do that as well, because, as we've heard -- and specifically, it's really some Republicans calling potentially or actually for the National Guard to get involved, for this to even be more than outside law enforcement, but to really escalate this. There are some comparisons or concerns that require us to look back at the Kent State University massacre in 1970, which was a huge moment when it came to the Vietnam war and opinion about it. Four students killed after the Ohio National Guard came in there. How are you reflecting on that amid this debate?",

And we see the state troopers have come in an encircled -- encircled the encampment. So what happens next is not clear. (INAUDIBLE) the protesters. (INAUDIBLE) The officers who say from troopers to get off the campus. But it is clear here in the last 30 minutes or so that law enforcement has been trying to figure out the plan to disperse this crowd from the situation. Obviously, this hearkens back to what took place here on the University of Texas campus last Wednesday when more than 60 people were arrested in a very intense and very violent situation. So this is the situation unfolding. We state troopers, and then local police circling the state troopers with their bicycles here at the scene. We're looking, trying to move our way around as much as we can. So here you see from anywhere around on either side of the circle or any of the troopers or the officers are making their way to make any arrests at this point. But right now, is just another standoff. The troopers have moved from about 20 to 30 yards away and encircled this encampment. You see the protesters inside. They're actually using the tables that were set up here on the South Mall for much of the morning as they were making memes, posters and that sort of thing. They're having poetry readings. And then, all of a sudden, these tables were picked up and used as a barricade to keep people from entering this small little area where a number of tents had been set up. Obviously, while the footprint of this is not incredibly significant, but obviously a symbolic situation here, as these protesters and this group has been told for days now that this kind of protest would not be allowed on the University of Texas campus. And that is why University officials say they called in the state troopers and Department of Public Safety last week to prevent any kind of long-term encampment here on the grounds of the university. And obviously, this area of this campus is extremely significant because this is the area where the coming of the university-wide commencement will be held. So this is one of the most prominent spots on this university campus. But right now, as we continue to see the standoff, you see police officers encircling the state troopers with the bicycles to keep the crowd that is not inside this encampment away from these protesters. Protesters chanting at the troopers to get off our campus. Obviously, they're not going anywhere. And this is the situation that we will have to see how it unfolds. It became very tense, often violent last week, with the number of a lot of shoving and pushing and more than 60 people arrested last week for disorderly conduct. Those misdemeanor criminal charges have been dropped by the county attorney. But the -- and the group that had originally organized all of this, Brianna, has been temporarily suspended on an Aaron basis (ph). So obviously, that is a situation that also angered many of the people who were in these student organizations as well. But obviously, that is going to -- I would imagine that -- that the interim status could -- could be changed here in the coming weeks and days. So almost beside the point at this moment, as we continue here, Brianna, to watch this standoff kind of unfold here as we wait to see exactly how state troopers are going to handle and clear out this group from the South Mall in the University of Texas.",

But slowly, the local police department, the university police, as well as Austin police breaking away the -- these tables that the protesters had been using to essentially serve as a wall around this encampment. So we've seen that kind of initial penetration by law enforcement here on the ground as some on-lookers are continuing to gather. The state troopers that are allowing that.

The officers will put on equipment that is consistent with what the threat is that they're facing.So sometimes you can go to these things with no equipment at all on and have a very soft approach in moving in on a crowd. When you get a crowd as raucous as we're seeing here, then you have to step up the protection for the officers. Because remember, this is about everybody going home safely at the end of the day. And -- and when you have a group of officers that you send in to dismantle an organizational event like this, the possibility of things being thrown from the crowd is very high. We've had that happen in Boston. Sometimes they throw water bottles, sometimes it's rocks and bottles, and the potential for injury to people on both sides is significant.

And we are watching some pictures here as they're clearing some protesters out -- or maybe -- is this for moments ago or is this live? Marty, is this from moments ago or is this live that we're seeing on the right side of our screen at U.T. Austin? All right, we're trying to get an answer there as we look at these pictures. These are live pictures that you're seeing as you see law enforcement engage with protesters. But, Ed, just to ask you -- and you see arrest there with zip ties of law enforcement there of protesters -- to ask you, it seems the main concern is trespassing. Not that these protesters were doing anything violent. That's not what the charges reflected. Eventually, the county attorney dismissed all of the charges. So it'll be curious to see what happens today here. How does law enforcement factor in their response when you have that consideration they may be gathering in a place where the university does not want them. They're clearly setting up an encampment, which the university does not want. This is an area where commencement is going to be happening here just in a matter of a couple of weeks.
