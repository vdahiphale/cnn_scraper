Now, immediately after the 11th failed vote, he came out. I had a chance to speak with him, along with some other reporters. And we asked him about all these issues. He defended the concessions he's made. He said he will not become a weaker Speaker. And when we asked him about whether this will be done, by tomorrow, he indicated it probably wouldn't.

So, that's why they're not just they're not rushing to the doors, here.SCOTT JENNINGS, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Just texting with a member, who has been communicating with McCarthy, since he came out of that meeting, with the 20. I guess they're producing a document, tonight. They're quite confident that a large chunk of that 20 is going to come home. But there's not really a plan, for these intransigents, for these people, who say they're never-evers. The hope would be that if a Scott Perry, and a Chip Roy, comes out, swinging it, and says \"We got everything we could have ever possibly wanted,\" that it really puts that holdout group on an island. Now, the trouble is, they're already on the Island of Misfit Toys! I'm not sure, what putting them on a different island is going to mean to them. But that's where we are, is there's a plan, for some of the holdouts. But there is no plan for the five to eight.",

Holding his normal schedule, trying to really demonstrate an almost unintentional contrast, on some level, that the White House is working on the implementation, of the major laws, they passed, in their first two years. Talking about policy issues, laying out in detail, kind of a roadmap, for what the President is going to be doing, in the months ahead, as House Republicans can't seem to get their act together, on the first issue that they need to deal with. But behind-the-scenes, officials make clear, they are watching this very closely. It's on every single television, inside the White House, throughout the course of the day. And, to some degree, you've seen the President go through an evolution of emotions, as he's watched this play out. I think there's certainly been a level of confusion, definitely a level of frustration very much so, a level of concern, particularly in how foreign countries, or others, may be viewing the United States, and the ability of the U.S., to actually govern itself, given what we've seen on the House floor. But today, there was also a sense of just general befuddlement, I think, when he was asked by our colleague Jeremy Diamond, how he was watching things, play out. Take a listen.

Until members are sworn in, they do not have access to the secure facilities, they need to read classified documents, to receive classified briefings, at the highest level. Some meetings, with top Military officials, and Intelligence officials, with House Republicans have been canceled, up to this point.

It's pretty deft, and appropriate, as well, to be out, tomorrow, commemorating January 6th, and because it obviously was a hugely important date. But the contrast is going to be clear, and particularly, because some of the players, in this drama, in the House, were the very people, who were involved in, in some way, in the activities, surrounding the Insurrection.

We mentioned in the intro, to Gary's report, about what the suspect was allegedly doing, in his family's home in Pennsylvania. It involves garbage bags. What have you learned on that? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: So, just to give that some context, Anderson, you've got the Pennsylvania State Police, and FBI surveillance team, in a rural area, where it's very hard to do surveillance, because strange cars would stand out. So, they're watching the house, from a distance. And what I'm told by the law enforcement sources, that Kohberger comes out a number of times. He cleans the car, extensively, almost as if you were going to clean it, to sell it as a new car, inside, outside, every inch of it. And during much of these trips, in and outside of the house, the source says, he's wearing surgical gloves. This is what they're observing in the surveillance. The other thing is there's a period, where he comes out at 4 o'clock, in the morning, with two bags of garbage, walks by their own garbage, and puts it in the neighbors bins. So, when they did the trash cover, to recover his garbage, they took that as well. And, of course, that is the search that led to the recovery of DNA, which then matched to the sheath, and the knife, according to the affidavit.",

And the first thing is that we've all been commenting on the fact that here's a PhD, studying in criminology, and he left behind a very significant piece of evidence, from which they were able to extract DNA. Then, you have the information from cameras. And then you have the information from the cell towers that pinged on his phone. These were mistakes that are not consistent with somebody that is smarter than everybody else, and knows more than anybody else.

I'm joined now by criminal defense attorney, and CNN Legal Analyst, Joey Jackson; and CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney. So, Elie, I mean, there's certainly a lot of evidence, pointing to the suspect. They have this familial DNA, tied to the crime scene, phone records, indicating he traveled to the area, the night of the murders, a vehicle matching the make and the model that the suspect drives, seen near the crime scene. What do you make of this, as a case, for the prosecution? ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, Anderson, there is more than enough evidence, to justify this arrest. And I believe there's enough evidence to convict here. This is a really powerful document. The star witness here is the DNA. The cops have already been able to establish by a 99.9998 percent that the DNA they found, at the crime scene, on that knife sheath, is this suspect's DNA. They did that connection through the DNA of the father, which they recovered in the trash. And, as John Miller said, they now have the suspect's DNA, and they'll test that. And if that's a hit, and it's at least 99.9998 percent, likely, then they'll have essentially a 100 percent match. On top of that there's all the other corroborating information, relating to the car, the cell phone, the bizarre movements, of this person, throwing out his trash, in someone else's cans, at 4, in the morning? I think it's a strong case. I'd be confident as a prosecutor.",

The first is the affidavit speaks to the issue of a shoe print that is in the direction of his movement, that apparently a person, an occupant of the premises saw him, right, in the mask, et cetera, the bushy eyebrows, in addition. So, they're going to test that shoe print. In addition to that, apparently he reregistered his car or switched the registration, from Pennsylvania to Washington, only days after. So, what is that about? Is that consciousness of guilt? And then, you have, from a defense perspective, there's going to be an attack on the DNA. How did the DNA get there? When did it get there? Was it contaminated in any way? Could it be that what is not his DNA? Defense will certainly be looking to that. There'll be experts with respect to the cell tower and whether or not the pings are appropriate, or whether or not they can be scientifically proven, not to be his. So, there's no question, to Elie's point, this is a very powerful case.

Are there -- is there other information that'll come out? Why was he surveilling them, apparently, and why was his car noted around the locations, where they were, for the timeframe in which it was? And so, we don't know everything? But I can tell you that certainly, an affidavit is a bare bones document. And what I mean by that is you simply need to establish probable cause. I think the affidavit -- what does that mean, right, probable cause? Reason to believe that a crime was committed and he committed it. And so, it clearly does that. And to your question, Anderson, which was a very good one, the reality is, is that there is much, much more -- just like the Police were not forthcoming, with the public, for good reason? You want to protect the integrity of the investigation. I'm sure there's a bevy of other information that I think may connect him to this case, establishes guilt, and again, cut out a lot of work, for the defense, to do, in demonstrating that he is not guilty.",

So, there was a lot going on with him, to be able to, the next day, be so communicative, to be, and have the wherewithal, not have -- not be amnestic, have amnesia to the event, to know that it was a football game, and even ask in writing, \"Did we win?\" He still got a breathing tube in, so he can't talk.
