The top stories for you tonight, lawmakers are demanding action days after five Memphis police officers are charged in the beating death of Tyre Nichols. Can the federal government do anything to change the culture inside many of these departments? Plus the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman is hailed a hero and honored by one town. This as California sees four mass shootings in one week. And it's a fight over books in Florida. Teachers say they have to keep students away from the books already in their libraries until state- approved groups decide if they're appropriate. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. And we begin this hour with the brutal beating of Tyre Nichols. Today the attorney for his family told CNN that he hopes the video that outraged a nation will become a watershed moment in the push for police reform. Hours after the public viewed that horrific beating, Memphis answered the outcry by shutting down the specialized Scorpion Unit. All five officers who were fired and charged with Nichols' death were members of that controversial unit, but many view that as just a small step for larges changes that are desperately needed.

So there's at least one parent in particular told me that their child will be staying home.But as you mentioned, the principal, Brianna Foster Newton, she has been reassigned to a position at the district, though the district did not say exactly where. She is now the third school system employee that has either been removed from their post or stepped down after that 6-year-old back on January 6th opened fire in a classroom, wounding his teacher. You'll recall the school board voted to sever ties with their superintendent, then the assistant principal also resigned. And the attorney that's representing these injured teacher maintains that school administration officials were warned at least three times that this child had possession of a firearm but that they failed to act. In fact his attorney saying that she plans to file a lawsuit against the district. The district not commenting, given that ongoing investigation. But look, as we mentioned, parents right now, they have to make that decision as to whether or not they send kid back to school tomorrow, back to Richneck Elementary. One in particular, Michelle Brown, telling us that she will not send her child back, who's in the third grade, until she knows that those who she believes to be responsible for this are being held accountable and also that the school is taking the right steps to guarantee the safety of her child. Now, the school system saying that they do plan to set up metal detectors in all of their elementary schools, and they're also considering requiring only transparent backpacks on campus.

And this attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband created new questions around what is this level of threat assessment, and can that be extended to lawmakers' families?

And the training -- the reason that I said that is because I looked at these five officers, and it took five officers to subdue a 144-pound man.And that told me that they are lacking in defensive tactics training. And part of the training across nations in progressive police departments also include de-escalation. So it's just a fact that there are going to be people who are placed under arrest, a probable cause arrest. They may resist.

You know, as a member of units like these, I learned how to conduct investigations.I learned how to conduct interviews. I learned how to conduct, cultivate, and form it, gather and interpret intelligence, and to develop and execute a tactical plan. If we remove these types of units from our law enforcement agencies, we create this void. You know, we did it in 2015 in Washington, D.C. We removed vice units, our specialized units, and the void is still felt in the department today. You know, these are pipelines for your investigative units, for your detectives, for your homicide detectives, district-wide detectives. And I mean, quite frankly, what we're dealing with right now, at least in my old department, is a lot of detectives that didn't have this experience coming up because these units weren't there, and they're garbage. So, I think that that -- you know, we need to think about that before we start making these knee-jerk reactions to what really is -- and I understand the emotion behind all of this.

And as of just last -- in the last school year ending in 2022 there are over 150 groups that we attract challenging books, over 4,000 challenges, and so there are many groups that are working in concert. They're sharing the same spreadsheets of books to challenge right down to the spelling errors, you know, in the titles and the mistakes.And so they're working together behind the scenes here using private Facebook groups, et cetera, to challenge these books, but the books really aren't the issue. Again, you know, and again, Americans by overwhelming majorities understand this and don't support the banning of these books. The tactics they have been using have been to show up at school board meetings. I mean, it's really good local organizing that they're doing. If they can turn out 10 or 20 people at a local school board meeting or at a state level, a committee hearing, you know, they can win the day right there. They've also been running and occasionally winning school board seats. So I think, you know, we're playing a little bit of catchup on that. It's very effective and we have some work to do in activating people, again most Americans who care about this to pay attention and then show up and speak up. Show up at your local meetings, show up at your state level committee hearings and speak up, you know, let your legislators, let your school board members know that you oppose censorship, that you trust teachers and librarians to choose age appropriate materials over politicians who have, you know, some perhaps short-term political gains in mind.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Pamela. Novak Djokovic really has continued his love affair with the Australian Open, winning the singles title for a record extending 10th time. Now having arrived in Melbourne nursing a hamstring injury a couple of weeks ago, the Serbian star just gained in strength and confidence throughout the tournament and then of course he won Sunday's final against Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.This, by the way, was a rematch of the 2021 French Open final but this one played out very differently. Back then Djokovic had to fight back from two sets down. Here, he was pretty much always in control. Djokovic had to work for it at times, though. The second and third sets were tied, decided only by tie breaks, but he dominated the third set breaker racing into a five love lead and then closing it out on match point when he hit a thumping forehand down the line that Tsitsipas just found too hot to handle. Of course, Djokovic loves playing here but his victory this year was really different. It was a tale of redemption. Remember it came just 12 months after he was in Australia without a vaccination for the COVID-19 virus. He spent a week in a detention center before he was unceremoniously deported before the start of the tournament. But now he's a 10-time champion in Melbourne and he's up to 22 grand slam single titles in total tying him for the record with Rafael Nadal. He also regained the world number one ranking because of this, and on reflection afterwards, he said that this had been actually one of the hardest trophies to win.
