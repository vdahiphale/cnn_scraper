We know some of them might come as early as these week that these are just some of the names being floated around.For Secretary of State, one big one is Senator Marco Rubio. This has been floating around since he did not get vice president. One thing to note, Don, Jr., top adviser to Donald Trump, his father, lashed out at Marco Rubio, had some nasty things to say when he was up for vice president so we will see how that plays out. Next, attorney general, which is going to be one of the most important positions in Donald Trump's administration because Donald Trump wants to control the Justice Department. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general is on that list. Mike Lee, also on that list. I also want to add one name we don't have on this one, but it is John Ratcliffe, the former director of National Intelligence. These are names floating around. Elon Musk, he is up for some kind of government efficiency adviser. One thing to note about that, Donald Trump has joked about the fact that Elon Musk will not join the government. He doesn't want to get rid of any of his properties or any of his companies. He does not have to divest. We are told this is likely to be a workaround for Elon Musk, in kind of some kind of form of a committee or adviser role. Now, obviously Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., someone, we're very interested in that, a public health adviser likely. We will see how this all plays out. We know the RFK has been talking about how he wants to be to be potentially a secretary. Elise Stefanik for UN Ambassador, that's one that I'm told, she's already met with the heads of the transition team and potentially Karoline Leavitt for press secretary. So, this is moving fast as he names Susie Wiles today. We will see what the next position he puts forward is.",

How are you going to execute that? You need people that are going to be able to do it and do it well. What is that going to look like? Who are you choosing?

There are a lot of moving parts, what I am being told by sources is that even before Election Day, Trump allies and some in the private sector were preparing for detaining and deporting migrants on a large scale and I mentioned the private sector because the federal government largely leans on contractors to manage facilities, so they need them to do this type of work mostly because there are very few federally- owned facilities and that is the key element of all of this, detention.You cannot mass-deport without mass detention. If you arrest someone they need to be detained somewhere before they are repatriated to their home country. So, that is a key element of this and that requires money. Now, earlier, Donald Trump said there is no price tag to mass deportation. There is, however. In fact, for one undocumented immigrant to be apprehended, detained, processed and removed is nearly $11,000.00. That is just for one individual. Add that up, we are looking at millions, if not billions of dollars. Now, the Department of Homeland Security has previously moved money around to try to shore up funds for more detention space, but I have spoken to officials who say it would have to be so much more than what they can do right now with the money that they have, so that is part of it. They also need more personnel and of course, Anderson, there is an element of diplomacy here. There needs to be agreements with countries if you're going to send people back. So certainly a lot at work here, but what I am being told by sources is that this is being discussed and there are operations on going to try to execute on this as soon as Donald Trump takes office.",
