      "sentences": "I've been here a long time. I've never seen anything like this. It's outrageous and must stop. Their promotions, their careers, their families, and their future held hostage by the political agenda of one senator, and the silence of the other 47 of them to drag on our force. It impacts everything from readiness to morale to retention. That's an insult, an insult to the officers. Years of dedicated service.Our troops deserve so much better. And the House fails to fulfill its most basic function and fails to find government by tomorrow. We'll have failed all our troops. Our service members will keep upholding their oath, showing up for work, standing central around the world, keeping our countries secure, but they won't get paid. It's a disgrace. Thousands of Defense Department civilians and civilian servants will be sent home. And the longer the shutdown lasts, the harder it will be to become -- the harder it will become for military families to pay their bills. We can't be playing politics while our troops stand in the breach. It's an absolute dereliction of duty. As leaders, we must never lose sight of the direct impacts of the decisions we make and the impact they have on the lives and families around the world. General Milley, General Brown, Secretary Austin, and all the many great leaders across every branch of our military, you got to where you are by demonstrating extraordinary care and concern for the troops you command. It's a live leadership of being in the field alongside your troops sharing their hardships, holding each other together when times are hard, never forgetting the humanity beneath the uniform. It's an enormous credit to each of them personally, an enormous asset for our country. Secretary Austin told a story about how he and General Milley got blown up together by an IED in Iraq. But the part of the story that stands out to me is the reason they were on Route Irish that night, to begin with. The reason they were there. They're going to see one of Milley's soldiers who had been wounded. In fact, during that tour in Iraq, you'll often find then-Colonel Milley down at that hospital sitting with a wounded so they wouldn't be alone, rounding up his troops for an impromptu blood drive when docs let him know, they're running low on units. Putting an arm around his team, gathering them together, seeing to their injuries, both physical and mental when war extracts the greatest of tolls. That's leadership. That's patriotism. That's strength. That's Mark Milley. Mark, you know how strongly I feel about you. You've given remarkable service to our country. You've done honor to the uniform of our nation. You upheld your oath. Thank you. Thank you, my friend. Thank you for being my friend. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
