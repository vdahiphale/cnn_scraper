      "sentences": "The Greek Prime Minister is blaming tragic human error for Tuesday's head on train collision which killed at least 38 people. Authorities confirm a passenger train and freight train were on the same track speeding towards each other before crashing into the city of Larissa.Dozens of passengers were hurt. The search continues through the wreckage, hoping to find signs of life. Many on the passenger train were university students. Many have described moments after the crash as a nightmarish scramble to escape or fire race through the twisted wreckage of the train. Many are now demanding answers about what led to this tragedy while sorrow has quickly grown -- quickly given way, I should say, to anger. Scuffles broke out in Athens where the passenger's ill fated journey began with police firing tear gas at protesters gathered outside the Hellenic Train headquarters. Demonstrations too at the train station in Thessaloniki where the journey was meant to end. The Greek transportation minister has resigned partly over an aging rail network he described as failing or falling way short of current international standards. The head of the Hellenic Railways Organization also resigned. Authorities have arrested the Larissa train station manager and the government has declared three days of national mourning. Meantime, an anxious heartbreaking wait only grows longer for those who are missing loved ones. The Greek prime minister visited a number of hospitals treating those who are badly hurt. And while meeting with the families of some of those killed, they've all had one consistent question, why? He says they deserve an honest answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, GREEK PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Justice will do its own work, responsibilities will be assigned. Meanwhile, the state will stand by the families of the victims. We will mourn our children, our siblings, our friends, we will remain united in this tragedy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's pretty crucial because the signalling system is pretty much like traffic control lights, which give you clearance to run your train in the next block which is a virtual block, x number of miles or two blocks. And if those signals are out, you have only the word from the station master as to whether your train can proceed or not. And it's very difficult for the station master to direct the trains if this train signalling system, or in many countries, both in Europe and the United States, the smart tracks which is a what's called positive train control, is not -- is not functioning and it would make it very difficult to maintain safety. VAUSE: And making this accident seemingly a lot worse was a fire which was caused by the collision that led to temperatures inside one train car which was engulfed in flames apparently reaching 1300 degrees Celsius. Firstly, how do they know that? And secondly, how did this accident lead to a fire which was that intense?",

A rail union in Greece are also calling out a lack of staff, as well as poorly trained staff, and particular the safety equipment that you mentioned, that they say just doesn't work.These problems are not entirely unique to Greece. Here in the U.S. the failure to sort of you know, spot an overheating wheel bearing led to the train derailment in Ohio, that toxic spill of chemicals, it seems more often than not these accidents are sort of caused by a combination of both, human error but born of faulty equipment.",

But, you know, not all countries do that. And in the U.S., it took acouple of tragedies for the U.S. rail system to finish off positive train control. And that just happened literally was finished up in the 2020s. And it took decades to get that done. So, often tragedy does lead to change. But for what people are reporting, which allegedly being reported in Greece, even the signalling system wasn't working, which is hard to believe because if you don't have the basic traffic basically go slow or stop, signals on the train lines -- it's really impossible to run a train -- to run a train or train system.",

Hiding his identity for fear of repercussions, he's applying for asylum in South Korea, having fled a mandatory call-up in Russia last October to fight in the war in Ukraine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): When I heard about the mobilization, I felt terrible, because I'd been at rallies protesting against the war. I knew, based on the information they have on me, anyone who opposes the war would be first to be sent to the frontlines. That was my biggest fear. HANCOCKS (voice-over): President Vladimir Putin's mass call-up sparked an exodus from the country. Hundreds of thousands of men are believed to have fled to avoid being sent to Ukraine. Leaving his wife and 7-year-old son, he boarded a flight to South Korea, saying he believed he would be accepted, as it is a democratic country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I miss my boy really badly. I can't talk about it. It's too emotional. I really miss my family. HANCOCKS (voice-over): He would wash his laundry in an interim airport bathroom, saying there was no hot water for showers for the past months, despite Seoul immigration saying there should be. He was given a hot bun and juice for lunch, chicken and rice for dinner. While he feels powerless to control his future, he says the alternative would be far worse.",

In 2019, almost 15 and a half thousand applicants, just 79 were granted refugee status. That's half of 1 percent, with just 230 receiving a permit to stay on humanitarian grounds.

He has hot food, hot water, and also a washing machine that he can use. He's able to seek approval to leave the facility in advance if he seeks that approval of curfew, though, of 6 p.m.But the problem he has now, he says, is the timeline. Because this week the Justice Ministry decided to appeal a court's decision that he was allowed to apply for asylum. So he now has to appeal that again. He has another six months, potentially, before he even has the right to apply. Then the application for refugee status itself could take one or two years, according to his lawyer. And his lawyer says, given the precedence, it is not likely to be an easy process. He also mentioned to us that he was considering asking his lawyer to contact the U.S., the Canadian embassies to see if they could help, because, as he said, it doesn't appear as though Korea wants to -- John. VAUSE: That is a good question. Because if Korea does not want to help them, why -- I guess why would the United States or the Canadians want to help, as well? The other question I have, too, is where does this legal counsel come from? You know, who's footing the bill for the legal representation?",
