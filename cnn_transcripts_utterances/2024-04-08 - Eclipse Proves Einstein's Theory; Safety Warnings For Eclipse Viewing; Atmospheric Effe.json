And that's part of the reason that NASA and scientists all over the spectrum have tried to take advantage of the moment to try to gain some research, some special insight into what's happening on the sun. Can you connect the dots for us on the research that's being done today, specifically in this moment, and what kind of answers it may provide scientists?",

An eclipse was used to prove Einstein's theory of relativity, because, you know, normally you can't see stars near the sun. And so in 1918, it was an eclipse that actually allowed us to see stars near the sun. And so in 1918, it was an eclipse that actually allowed us to see that relativity was true. And previous to that, you know, going early on, one of the first estimates of the size of the moon and the distance of the moon, way back in the Greek time, was used eclipses. Now, we can sort of create eclipses if we want, or we can study these things often without having an actual eclipse occur. But we're still using these eclipses as ways of seeing into or seeing the outer layers of the sun and studying sort of the crazy dynamics, the explosive properties of that solar atmosphere.",

But if they don't, there is sort of an at-home way they can do with a pinpoint for projector if they go online and Google.

It would just basically fry the optic nerve. So you can do permanent damage to your optic nerve by staring at the sun. So, you know, there's, you can go online, right, if you can Google, there's a bunch of different ways to make your own homemade eclipse viewer. But absolutely do not look at the sun with your naked eye, because you could really do damage for, that would last a long time after this. So it's just not worth it.",

I heard people yelling in Spanish, look at the eerie horizon because the horizon is still lit up. And these are now the rare special minutes of totality. Where you get about four minutes of this sight that you won't see anywhere else. And that doesn't just happen.

But also to put into perspective for folks, one of the reasons that this total solar eclipse is so fantastic and that we're making such a big deal out of it, is that even the shortest totality is longer than the longest totality in 2017. People will just get an amazing chance to see this because of the positioning of the moon in its orbit at this particular time.

The question right now is going to be once we reach to totality in a couple of minutes, if we're going to be able to see the full ring, let's hope that the clouds do not interfere with that experience with these tens of thousands of people who are waiting like everybody else to see this event. Like we've been saying, there are people here from all over the world. They are experiencing this. The scientists, you know, the images that you have on screen are from NASA. They got lucky, all the scientists got lucky that Torreon happens to have a telescope that is pointing to the sun all the time.So they're able to cover this event and for everybody else to see. And now let's try to take a look. And I think now the lighting is completely changed. Pablo, show the people because now the light is a different color. It's actually very clear. The way, I don't know how to explain it, but it's basically as if somebody in darkness turned on a light and let's listen in because now people are starting to cheer more. I'm changing here my glasses so I can experience with everybody else. And yes, it's almost, it's almost there. Like I said, the cloud cover here might prevent us from seeing the ring, but we are seconds away. If you want to just remain quiet as we reach the peak and you can hear the crowd.",
