The governor of Mississippi issuing a state of emergency after a devastating tornado outbreak ripped through the south. At least 23 people are confirmed dead in Mississippi. Another person was killed in Alabama. Dozens more injured, and at least four others are still missing at this hour. In a statement, President Biden said he has spoken to local and federal officials and is praying for the people who have lost loved ones. In the town of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, neighborhoods are simply decimated. Many residents are just thankful to be alive.

The whole trailer park behind the building is gone, and we don't know where everybody is. We don't know it's alive and who's gone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, not all resulted in a tornado, but if you look at some of these lines here, this one going straight from Rolling Fork all the way up just south of Huntsville. Weather service is doing storm surveys as we speak, trying to determine was this, in fact, one single tornado that just made it an extended prolonged period on the ground, or was it multiple tornadoes that ended up causing some of that damage?One thing to note is that the storms are still ongoing. You've got to two separate areas here of concern. The first is still down to the southeast. You've got a tornado warning here, a severe thunderstorm warning behind it. This is that severe thunderstorm watch that you can see in yellow, so still active severe thunderstorms across the southeast as we speak. And then to the north, you also have some severe thunderstorm warnings just to the southeast of Cleveland. So this is that secondary area in Ohio and Pennsylvania where we're also looking at the potential for severe storms. And that's for today. These two clusters that you see here where we have the potential for isolated tornadoes and also damaging winds. One thing to note, by tonight most of those storms begin to push out, but a stationary front develops along the southeast. So you have yet another round of severe weather, Fred, that will develop tomorrow. And unfortunately, in some of these areas, it's the exact same locations that were hit in the last 24 hours by the previous round of thunderstorms.",

And what did people see? DR. REED TIMMER, EXTREME METEOROLOGIST AND STORM CHASER:  Well, it was a classic tornado outbreak for this time -- storms, fast moving tornados. And I'm standing on the river delta, and as soon -- thought it was -- -- and just off to on, it became a tornado producing machine. Very large tornado at that. And the storm was electrified, too. It had strobe lightning, just incredible lightning as it began to become a tornadic as these storms often do, and you can see the whole structure of the supercell as well. A very large wall cloud, and then when one lightning strike happened on the backside it was suddenly a large wedge of about half mile in size. And you could tell it was very fast moving. You could tell it was violent, had horizontal vortices -- people in the path of it in Rolling Fork because it was moving so fast and also the tornado sirens were not yet sounding there in town.",

There are a lot of first responders out here sifting through the rubble, sifting through the debris of this chocolate factory that exploded just yesterday. And I just want to say, you saw that video that you've been playing all throughout the afternoon. That's actually taken from a traffic camera that's on a nearby building, and it just got a perfect view of that horrific explosion.Let me step out the way you can see what the scene is at this particular moment right now. You can see crews down there. They're taking debris out of the now vacant lot, basically, where that building used to be, that chocolate factor used to be, and they're trying to clear debris out of that spot so they can find, hopefully, survivors. So here are things we do and don't know at this moment. We still don't know what caused yesterday's explosion to happen around 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon, but we do know two people have been confirmed dead, five are still missing, and of course, eight were taken to the hospital. So I want to take you to just an idea of what we've been dealing with. The governor actually came to this site today, come back to me on camera, and he announced that there is a specialized taskforce on the ground right now called Pennsylvania Taskforce One. It's an urban search and rescue. The state basically has been giving resources like canines, like structural engineers and other search and rescue specialists.

Wall Street experienced yet more volatility on Friday as investors, they just wait for the next shoe to drop in this banking crisis. Investors are essentially going from the weakest link to the weakest link in the financial system.Remember, first it was Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, then First Republic and Credit Suisse, and now all eyes are on Deutsche Bank. And Deutsche Bank shares, they tumbled almost nine percent in Germany with concerns about a spike in the cost to ensure the bank's debt against default. Of course, that is never a good sign. I would note, though, that much like Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank's been in turmoil for literally years. But the bank failures in the United States earlier this month, they really cause investors to take a tougher look at banks everywhere. Officials in Europe, they were quick to come out on Friday and say, look, there's nothing to see here. Everything's fine. The chancellor of Germany said there's, quote, no reason to be concerned about Deutsche Bank. U.S. officials, they've also been keeping very close tabs on all of this banking turmoil. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held a closed- door meeting with America's top financial regulators on Friday, and you've got to believe that Deutsche Bank came up. All of this comes after the Fed pushed ahead with its war on inflation despite calls from some experts to pause and avoid adding to the stress in the banking system. On Friday, I asked Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin about why the Fed raised rates in the face of all this turmoil. And he basically said the focus right now is squarely on fighting inflation.

So what happens is large institutions saw a deposit increase to $67 billion. So when you see that, people start to get worried. Small banks' money, can they cover all that? Can they hold and stay in the community? And so when you have the Fed and you have Janet Yellen coming out and saying they will do everything I think humanly possible to ensure that security, that trust, we're going to see that. I think the other thing too, Fred, we've seen steady decline in the last year of deposits in general, about $582 billion. It's February, 2022. Where is the money going? Money is going to mutual fund, money market ratio funds. So how people manage their money, this is where we're talking about it right now.",

The state should eat it. But they have no use to me or anybody else anymore. So if you want to have little banks with $250,000 max in them, they'll never make money.

I think there is a place for the U.S. bank, local regional banks for the community. Do I think his statement of like, well, some will fail. Sure, there's always banks that will fail. But the regional banks are very meaningful to small business owners in certain places. You look in Oklahoma. You look in Texas. Go look at it. They can and serve the consumer and customer much better in that community than bigger banks. Now, bigger banks right now, Fred, they had an increase of that flow. They have no choice but to take the money, not to say that they want the money either, because they have to deploy it as well. So I kind of have that balance to which the other side we should be talking to, Jamie Dimon and Jane Fraser who are great leaders in their own CEOs, but they're trying to manage.
