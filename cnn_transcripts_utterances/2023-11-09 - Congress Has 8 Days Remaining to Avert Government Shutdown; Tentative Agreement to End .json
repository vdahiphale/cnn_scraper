I do want to talk to you about what we heard from Senator Chris Coons. This morning, we had a conversation about a bill proposed by Democrats which has funding for Israel, funding for Ukraine, funding for trying to deal with the issues at the southern border. And he says, look, you just need to pass this, we're not going to break things out. We're not going to remove, for example, Ukraine funding from our bill. Do you think that is going to fly here?",

His willingness to work bad times with Democrats if he needed to get things done, particularly when you're talking about the debt ceiling, it's one of the reasons he is no longer the speaker of the House. Ukraine is a hardline for a lot of the Republicans. And the Republican Party, you're seeing -- it's a port drop. They're looking at their constituents and saying, why are we doing this?So, he already tried to force the Senate to pass something. The Israel funding with all -- paid for by defunding the IRS. That is dead on arrival. What his next move is, we will have to wait and see, Sara. It -- that is sort of where we are at right now in Washington, D.C.",

And what they advertised were sexual services with primarily Asian women. And if you were interested, you would receive a text message, giving you a list of women to choose from, sexual services available, and hourly rates and they range from $300-some-odd all the way to $600-some-odd. Now, if you wanted to avail yourselves of these services, you would then have to share quite a bit of personally identifying information. Including photos, your driver's license, information about your employer, and your credit card information, and you would then be charged a monthly fee.Now, I can understand why some organizations of this type might want that information to protect the women and the people working there, but it also makes these clients quite vulnerable, particularly if they have -- oh, I don't know, a security clearance, or a very public job, or a high-ranking position in the military. Now, they repeatedly referred to this brothel as high-end. And I wondered, well, why is that? What makes it high-end? And according to these investigators, they're pointing to the fact that the rooms, the apartments that were rented to conduct this activity, the monthly rents on these was up to $5,000 a month. They also point to the types of clients. And let's take a listen to the U.S. attorney describe exactly who was soliciting these services. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSHUA LEVY, ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY FOR MASSACHUSETTS:  They are doctors. They are lawyers. They are accountants. They are elected officials. They are executives at high-tech companies and pharmaceutical companies. They are military officers. Government contractors, professors, scientists. Pick a profession, they're probably represented in this case. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say they still have search warrants that are going to be executed. They've interviewed about 20 of these clients so far, but they believe there could be hundreds more. But if you look at where exactly these operations were conducted, Tysons Corner, Virginia, right outside the beltway here in Washington, D.C. A lot of aerospace and defense, a lot of biotech companies not too far from our nation's capital. Also, Cambridge, Massachusetts, again, lots of biotech.I think there are some questions about whether there might be more to this case, and that perhaps this could have been, the officials have not said this but I think it's a fair question, could have been more to this. Perhaps some sort of espionage or intelligence gathering going on here which could make it more difficult to identify some of these clients depending on who they are.",
