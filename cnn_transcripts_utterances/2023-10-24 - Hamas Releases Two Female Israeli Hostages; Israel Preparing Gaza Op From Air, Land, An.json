Both are Israelis, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz, who have now been reunited with family at a medical center in Israel.

And I know that Israel is working on those (INAUDIBLE). In the long run, however, much more substantial processes, the Gaza Strip will need to undergo much fundamental processes in terms of education just like -- I'm sorry to use this metaphor but I just can't think about anything else -- just like Germany for example after the Second World War, namely processes of (INAUDIBLE) that, you know, we're talking about a population that in the past 17 years, mainly two generations almost, were thinking about Jews in a very dehumanizing way.

We will have to deal with the guerilla that will pop up every now and then, like the last story of the Japanese soldier in the force who haven't heard about the end of the war.But that would be the case and I think that the civilian population is going through, of course, not an easy time like we in Israel. I mean, what we suffered is just immense. And I think it quite reflected in that speech that we just heard. However, I'm really positive, in terms of the wider picture of what such a change can do to the relations of Israel in Palestinian as a whole. And to the region, by the way, as a whole. It's not just a local thing, you know. it's really the Iranian axis against the pro-West, pro-American axis. (CROSSTALKING)",

Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNALENA BAERBOCK, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): We need a path for tomorrow. This means thinking about it now, how security in Gaza, peace in the region can be secured together with international actors. For the European Union and for Germany, it is clear that Israelis and Palestinians can only live in peace and security in a long term, free of terrorism and free from human tragedy with a two-state solution.

It was always, always a security question for us Israelis and not anything else.Of course, we have the settlement project. But we need to keep in mind those settlers are just a few hundreds of thousands out of the 10 million population. So if you take out, if you remove the most negative player in this play and you leave it with just two moderate players, as the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and of course, you heal everything that needs to be healed because it's not perfect there as well. By the way by both sides -- not just the Palestinian Authority or in Israel. You know it's been a while. I think it will create a much more positive atmosphere for advancing to the two-state solution which at the end of the day, I don't see any other viable solution.",
