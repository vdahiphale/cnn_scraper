In the real world, if the law said, hey, the drinking age is 18, but you know, it's up to you parents to keep your kids out of bars. The companies that are making money off your kids, they have no responsibility to enforce the age limit. That's what we have on the internet. And as a result, eight, nine, 10-year- old children are all over the internet. They're seeing porn. They're seeing horrible things. So, yes, it has to be done and it can be done. Scott Galloway, here at NYU, he says that the industry could easily do it, but they really don't want to. He says, when you pay an industry not to understand something, it will never figure it out. And there are already more than a dozen methods of age verification. So, the technology is there. It will get better. It's going to get done. It's no coincidence that academic achievement around the country and around the world had began to decline after 2012. It wasn't because of COVID, it began in -- as soon as the kids got smart devices in school, guess what? They stopped paying attention to the teacher and each other. They've started to feel more lonely at school since 2012. Every school that goes phone free says the same thing, we hear laughter in the hallways again. Every school that bans phones loves it.
