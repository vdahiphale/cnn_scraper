A face-to-face meeting between President Biden and Xi is underway at the moment, a pivotal moment for the fractured relationship between the United States and China. Israeli forces are raiding Gaza's biggest hospital, where officials say hundreds of doctors and patients remain inside. And the deal that ended the US auto strike, that deal could be in trouble. We'll explain. Live from London, Wednesday, November the 15th, I am Richard Quest, and I mean business! Good evening. As you and I are meeting, President Biden and Xi are meeting in California. Both leaders say that the US and China cannot turn their backs on each other. This summit, which is being closely watched, is taking place south of San Francisco. It's taking place on the sidelines, if you will, of the gathering of Asian-Pacific leaders. But perhaps this bilateral meeting, this summit, is the main star event. It is the first time in a year they have held a meeting or they've met face-to-face, one-on-one. And easing tensions between Washington and Beijing is the key goal. A short time ago, President Biden acknowledged the disagreements and said the world needed the two leaders to avoid conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And now lockdowns and pandemic aside, they're seeing the crackdown from Beijing and police in Shanghai raiding US corporations. So that's an issue, and that's one that President Xi is here in San Francisco, trying to figure out and navigate. He's even going to have a meeting, Richard, with some of these US business leaders to try to woo them and try to perhaps convince them to come back into China if they left or to expand their reach within China if they're currently there. But the concern from these businesses, is hey, we have seen what can happen. We're also concerned about getting our profits out of China back into the US. So how can we trust you? Nonetheless, these conversations are underway, and this is that setting to do that. And it's interesting. This dinner that they're expected to have for these businesses, welcoming Xi, if you will, to the US has already become really controversial here.

It was a unanimous decision against the government. The judges said Rwanda is not a safe country to send asylum workers and could pose additional risk to refugees, who could be returned to their country of origin. U.K. inflation has eased to its lowest level in two years. Consumer prices rose 4.6 percent a month ago. That is down sharply from 6.7 in September. But that is largely because of a drop in household energy bills. A new study suggests that microplastics might be able to influence the weather.
