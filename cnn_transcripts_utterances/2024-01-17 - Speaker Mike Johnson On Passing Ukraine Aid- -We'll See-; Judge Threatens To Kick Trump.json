Plus, it was a contentious day in court, for Donald Trump, with the judge threatening to evict him from the courtroom, as the ex-President responded, quote, \"I would love\" that. Also, body cam footage that was just released, from a police raid, is now under scrutiny, tonight, new scrutiny, after flash-bangs were used inside a home, where a toddler was on a ventilator. The mother is here with me, tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. President Biden summoned leaders, from both parties, and both sides, of Capitol Hill, to the White House today, hoping to break a stalemate, over immigration and aid to Ukraine. But right now, that looks unlikely, in doubt at best. Both parties say that they agree that something must be done on the border, that Ukraine is in desperate need of critical military assistance, and that Israel needs American help in its war against Hamas. There's a deal potentially in the works, to unlock all of that. Senate leadership appears to be on board. But the holdup tonight is in the House, specifically with House Republicans. The new Speaker of the House is facing growing pressure, from his conference, as a growing number, in his party, on the right, say that his job could be at risk, if they don't like the deal that he makes. And joining me now is the Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. Speaker Johnson, great to have you, on THE SOURCE. Thank you for being here. You called this meeting today a productive one. But my question is where is the common ground, between you, and the Senate, and the White House, on immigration? REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Well, we're about to find out. The Senate has been working on some sort of compromise bill. The House passed our measure, H.R.2, about eight and a half months ago. It's been sitting on Chuck Schumer's desk, for a long time. It has key provisions in it that would actually solve the crisis, which is the open border and the humanitarian catastrophe that comes along with that. So, we would reinstitute the Remain in Mexico policy. We would end catch and release. We would reform the asylum and broken parole processes, and even rebuild parts of the wall. But many of those elements are critical, in order to solve the problem. And I articulated that to the President, again today, as I have been doing since I got the Speaker's gavel.",

But those elements are really important.And I illustrated to the President, and to all of our colleagues that were around that table, that this is not Republican talking points. We went down to the border, about three weeks ago. I brought 64 House Republicans down there, to see what's happening at Eagle Pass, which is kind of the epicenter, right now. And the Border Patrol agents there, the sheriffs on the ground, the people who deal with it every day said that there's simple action that can be taken, right now. You don't even need new federal law. You need executive action to stem the flow. And the Deputy Chief of the Border Patrol, who's a 33-year veteran of the agency, Kaitlan, told us, in his own words. He said, I feel like I'm administering an open fire hydrant. I don't need more buckets. I need to reduce the flow. And so, we talked about in the White House, today, how that can be done.

This is beyond Republican versus Democrat. This is about a serious catastrophe that almost nine out of 10 Americans understand is at an emergency level as something that must be addressed. That's what the polling says. Because they see what's happening. Kaitlan, we have 302,000 people, encountered at the border, in December alone. We've had over 300 suspects, on the terrorist watch list, coming to the country. Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 49, right now, coming right over the border.

She had two witnesses, who ultimately testified for her, at the trial, about how she, in 1996, told them about what had happened, at the Bergdorf Goodman store.
