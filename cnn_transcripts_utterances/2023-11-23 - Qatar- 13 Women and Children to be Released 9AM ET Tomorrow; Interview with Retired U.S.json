That the mission remains to demolish Hamas. And General, in terms of what this truce means and how it holds, so midnight tonight eastern is when the truces are set in. And our Becky Anderson, our colleague over there, she asked Qatari officials what would constitute a breach of this agreement? A break in that truce by either side. And the Qatari official definitely did not answer the question. What do you think would -- is it clear what would constitute a breach and what happens if they do? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Well, I think what would happen is there would be some undisciplined fire from perhaps a individual Hamas soldier that may or may not agree with what is going on. He may be trying to lure the IDF into firing back. That happens so often in these tentative ceasefires around the world. I think that that would not return the situation to a full combat operation. But as they said, in the press conference, they would do everything they could to contain that type of violation. I think at this point, both sides want this pause to stay in place during the duration of the hostage exchange.",

For one, because he believed the mounting international pressure that would start building to at least bring about a slowdown. The IDF and the Prime Minister have assured, though, that they are going to return to operations. The mission continues. What do you think of this?",

But turning the war back on is going to be really hard for the Israeli government because there'll be pressure from the hostage families to keep this going, to keep the exchanges going, because the Hamas militants, they're not going anywhere. They're stuck inside Gaza. So, what's the difference between waiting another 10 or 20 days to prosecute the war versus starting earlier?",

We support what they're doing. But they don't want to be dragged into this. I think they were looking out in the water and seeing a U.S. aircraft carrier out there and discretion is a better part of valor on his part. Now, if they do, that completely changes the dynamic of this war, takes it well outside of this localized event inside of Gaza, and it really turns it into a much larger event.",

Some of the most tough criticism of Israel's actions inside Gaza have come from Qatar's \"Al Jazeera\" news network. So, that message is not so surprising. But the thing is, Hamas is going to be tested right now. Do they have the command and control to actually get to all the hostages and comply with all of the rules as they were set out over the next four days?But you're right, after that, the Israeli government has said it will pursue Hamas. And I think many regional officials expect that, some even desire that Hamas, for instance, is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood which Egypt overthrew in a coup. So, they don't particularly want a strong Hamas after this. They just can't say it publicly. So, I think there's an understanding on all sides. The goal here now is to get the hostages, as many as possible out and then Israel is going to do what it's going to do, but no one's going to say that quickly.",
