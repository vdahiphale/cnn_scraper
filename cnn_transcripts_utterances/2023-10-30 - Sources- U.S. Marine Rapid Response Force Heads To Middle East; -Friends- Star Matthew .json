Israeli forces are pushing into Gaza by land and continuing heavy strikes from the air. The Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday that it struck more than 450 targets over the past 24 hours including command centers and missile launch sites. According to CNN analysis, a video published by Israeli media, IDF forces have advanced about three kilometers inside Gaza. But as the ground invasion expands, there's growing concern about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. That issue sources say, has prompted the United Nations Security Council to hold an emergency meeting in the hours ahead. Sources say the United Arab Emirates is expected to seek a resolution for a quote, immediate humanitarian pause in the fighting in Gaza. All this as the U.N. Secretary General says the situation there is growing more desperate by the hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes. More than 2 million people with nowhere safe to go are being denied the essentials for life, food, water, shelter, and medical care while being subjected to relentless bombardments. I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the reality is that Israeli strikes have already come dangerously close even yesterday.You're seeing some of the video here of the aftermath. The Red Crescent says that the strikes were close enough to actually damage the building. You can see sort of dust in the corridors of that hospital as well. The director of the hospital as well says that the vast majority of the people who are sheltering there and there are some 12,000 of them are women and children. That's in addition, obviously to the injured and the sick and the children who are in incubators in that hospital. He also deny the Israeli accusation that Hamas is taking shelter. They're saying that no one who is armed is even allowed inside the building. The WHO had previously called these Israeli threats or warnings or insistence on the hospitals in northern Gaza, there are 22 of them evacuating. They said that they were tantamount to a death sentence for the sick and injured who are still there because the hospital director in this case says that look, there is simply no way to move these people or to evacuate them safely, Nick.",

But of course the naval troops as well.One carrier strike group with the Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is already in the Eastern Med. Another carrier strike group has to the Strait of Gibraltar a couple days ago and it's on its way in that direction. We've also been watching an amphibious ready group, the USS Bataan, which is an amphibious assault ship and a Marine rapid response force, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, or MEU for short. Over the course of the past several weeks, they've been operating in the waters of the Middle East, but according to two U.S. officials, they're now in the Red Sea on their way to the Eastern Med. First, that's a tremendous show of U.S. power in the waters off the coast of Israel and Lebanon, a clear message to Iran and Iranian proxies not to get involved. And that message we've seen sent explicitly from President Joe Biden on down in the U.S. national security chain essentially. But the MEU, that Marine rapid response force, also serves another purpose. It has special operations capable which is certainly notable and worth remembering. But it's also a critical force in a noncombatant evacuation operation or a NEO. That's one of its mission essential tasks. Now, the U.S. said last week that there was no indication or execution for a NEO an evacuation right now. But John Kirby, the National Security Council's spokesperson said it would be irresponsible and imprudent not to plan for contingency operations, including an evacuation. Since he said that, the U.S. has said the risk of this conflict spreading wider in the region is growing and remains a serious consideration for the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S State Department, the Embassy in Beirut has advised Americans to leave now before a crisis has begun there. There has been some contact between Israel and Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanese border. It has not escalated too much. But any contact, any exchange of fire on that border, which is already volatile as is, is certainly noteworthy. And that's what the U.S. is watching to see if that escalates. If it does, those are the situations in which things can quickly get out of hand and where the conflict in Gaza which the U.S. is trying to keep separate can quickly and violently spread to the rest of the region. So that perhaps one of the reasons, that Marine rapid response force is there in case the U.S. looks at the situation and looks at the possibility of the necessity for an evacuation if the situation deteriorates.

Sunday, Trump posted on his online platform Truth Social, claiming his right to free speech was being infringed and claiming the gag order is quote, not constitutional.Trump also blamed the Biden administration for this latest ruling by the judge. The gag order was first issued earlier this month, Trump appealed the order was paused. Prosecutors had warned that Trump could intimidate witnesses through his public comments and encourage harm to prosecutors. Meantime, the former president was also back on the campaign trail this weekend. Donald Trump hit the stage in an event in Sioux City, Iowa. On Sunday, he praised his attorneys, mocked his rivals and did not mention his former number two Mike Pence dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination for president. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more from Sioux City. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: With a little more than two months before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican nominating contest of 2024, the field is once again entering this week in a reshaped fashion. Over the weekend, former Vice President Mike Pence made the decision to leave the race. He said it clearly was not his time. Of course, he has been among the candidates in the non-Trump lane, if you will. He's been making his argument that Republicans should not return the former president to the Oval Office talking about his criminal indictments. Well as former President Donald Trump campaigned in Iowa on Sunday, he made no mention of his former vice president. He instead spent his time mocking his rivals Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's like a wounded bird falling from the sky. Oh, there he is. It's Ron Desanctimonious. He's falling, falling beautifully from the sky. It's a beautiful thing to watch because I got him elected because anybody know who Bird Brand is. He said it, yes. You can never. I will never run against our president.

And in that phone call with Netanyahu, President Biden did say that there was a need to immediately and significantly increase the flow of humanitarian assistance. Now, we did learn more from the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan about those negotiations to free hostages who are being held in Gaza, among them potentially Americans. He said that the expanded Israeli effort in Gaza had not stooped those negotiations but that so far, Hamas had not been forthcoming in releasing the hostages. And he also addressed his efforts to get Americans who are stuck in Gaza, hundreds of them, out across the border into Egypt. He did say that the Egyptians are willing to accept foreign nationals and that the Israelis are also not putting up resistance to the effort. But that so far Hamas is making its own demands and putting up resistance to opening that border. So President Biden certainly remains focused on the situation in the Middle East. We also learned that he did speak to the Egyptian president. With him, he discussed the humanitarian aid efforts and he also discussed the expanded Gaza offensive. But interestingly the two men also discussed the importance of ensuring that Palestinians in Gaza are not displaced to Egypt or any other nation.

Washington State Senator Jeff Wilson, he appeared at the West Kowloon Magistrate's court today. He wore a black suit in court, he appeared tense. And after deliberations his charge was dismissed and this 24- month, what's is called a bind-over order was given. And conditions for that order include abstaining from possessing firearms and ammunition for two years. His gun was also confiscated. Now it was on October 21st when Wilson was arrested at the Hong Kong International Airport after he arrive on a flight from San Francisco. He was charged with possession of arms without a license, which is a big offense here. It's punishable by up to 40 years in prison, a fine of more than $12,000. Now, the state senator said that he didn't realize that his gun was in his briefcase, while he and his wife were traveling for what was to be a five-week vacation in Asia. And he only discovered the gun, the unloaded gun midflight. Now we did receive a statement from his office, that was released earlier today. Let's bring it up for you. Wilson said this. Quote, \"This was a mistake on my part. And I regret it. I packed quickly, and failed to check the contents of my briefcase. Over the Pacific, I reach into my briefcase for gum and felt my gun instead. My heart sank. I understood immediately what had happened,\" unquote. Now Wilson said as soon as the plane landed in Hong Kong, he immediately alerted customs officials. And now Hong Kong has very strict gun control laws. No one is allowed to possess any arms, ammunition unless they have a police license and licenses are given to only police officers, security guards and shooting range operators. Today in court, the magistrate said that the state senator should've known that Chinese and Hong Kong laws are very strict because Wilson is a trade delegate. And he's traveled frequently to the region. And the magistrate also raised the question repeatedly, how a firearm was able to pass through metal detectors in America. And that remains an open question how this happened. Now the State Senator Wilson says that he's just happy to see this matter resolved and he's looking forward to resuming his vacation with his wife. Back to you, Nick.",

But now, some say the targets are residences.
