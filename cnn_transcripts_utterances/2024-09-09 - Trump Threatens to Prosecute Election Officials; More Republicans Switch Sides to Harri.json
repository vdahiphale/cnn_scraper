Donald Trump, not only continuing to make false claims about the 2020 election, he's now threatening to prosecute election officials if he wins in November. Trump posted this on social media over the weekend, quote, \"The 2024 election, where voters have just -- votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny, and when I win, those people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" Adding, those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels unfortunately never seen before in our country.The former president has long sought to sow distrust in the electoral process. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It's a political attack against me by comrade Kamala Harris and Sleepy Joe and other radical left opponents for the purpose of election interferences. I ran for president. I won, and I won a second time, did much better the second time. This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. We won the election easily. There's no way Joe Biden got 80 million votes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, Dana Bash, I mean, watching that, I have to say, I was thinking back to, as Donald Trump was out there in public saying these things after the 2020 election, the Republicans, who I was on the phone with, who were always arguing to me, just let him get it out of his system.You know, fair enough, they had court challenges. You know, give him the time to do the court challenges. OK. But then the excuses kept coming, kept coming. It results in January 6th. And now, we are seeing him it -- there really was a shift after Biden dropped out of the race. You are now seeing more rhetoric like what we saw Trump post over the weekend. He seems to be laying the groundwork for this again. DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, CO-ANCHOR, CNN STATE OF THE UNION AND ANCHOR, CNN INSIDE POLITICS:  In a big way. I was thinking that when he started talking about the attempted coup and things like that, which have no basis in fact, with regard to Joe Biden getting out of the race, that that was going to be kind of his avenue for rigged election. It doesn't -- it's not fair if Harris wins, that she came in late and they changed the system.",

There's no other way to say this that this is dangerous.

She is somebody who does hope that there is a future for her. She did better than any other opponent of Donald Trump in the Republican primary this year. And she wants to keep her sort of toe in the Trump world to the point that -- well, toe in Trump role is probably the wrong way to say it. She wants to keep her options open, and if she doesn't endorse Donald Trump, then the people who are completely blindly loyal to him, when he's gone and he's exited the stage, they might think twice about supporting her if she wants their vote again.

It's always been very -- she's sometimes even played a little bit too cute. And I keep flashing back to this moment during the Republican Convention where she said, you know, President Trump asked me to speak tonight and then he leans over. And who knows what the real truth is, but he's like, she asked to speak. And so, there's always been this little weird back and forth where she's tried to have it all too cute with Trump.
