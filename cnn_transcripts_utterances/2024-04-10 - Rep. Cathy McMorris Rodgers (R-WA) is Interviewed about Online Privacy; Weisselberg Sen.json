Republican Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell recently teamed up to unveil the American Privacy Rights Act. It's a bipartisan, bicameral plan that, if passed, could create a national standard regulating how companies can use your data for the very first time. Joining me now is one of the architects of that proposal, Congressman Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state. Congresswoman, thank you very much for being here. REP.

That has caused a lot of concerns among small businesses in particular, and what we believe, because of the work that we have done, it limits the amount of data that can be collected to begin with. So, data minimization. And then when your data is transferred, when it's sold, you will be notified that your data is being used and you would have an option to opt out of that. So, it really is establishing the privacy rights of an individual to know what's being collected, how it's being used, if it's being sold, if it's being used in targeted advertising, and you would have more rights over how your data is being used.",

There was Trump, the borrower, who lied about the security of the loan, there was the bank employee who made the loan and collected a bonus for the loan, and there is the bank shareholder, who did not receive the payment that the bank shareholders should have made - should have received for the risk that the bank employee was taking.",

Japan has been central to many of the groupings that the Biden administration has announced, but has also served as a key ally of the U.S. in its support for Ukraine amid Russia's invasion there.Now, this will all be on display in just a few hours when the president welcomes Kishida here for the full pomp and circumstance of a South Lawn arrival ceremony. The two will have bilateral meetings and a joint news conference as well. And they're preparing to announce a host of initiatives. And part of that includes upping the military and security ties between the two countries. Senior administration officials say that will include changes to U.S. force posture in Japan as they're trying to integrate the U.S. and Japanese military in some ways. Officials say that this will take some time to play out and strategize on. It could take a matter of months before there's an actual plan in place. They will also be implementing and creating a military industrial council to talk about ways that they might be able to co-produce defense weapons. There's also expected to be major announcements when it comes to space at a time when Japan has shown keen interest in landing an astronaut on the moon. And then there's efforts to really improve people to people ties at a time when student exchanges have been low. But all of this will be capped off by a lavish state dinner tonight as they are trying to roll out the red carpet, stressing the closeness of this relationship between the two countries.",
