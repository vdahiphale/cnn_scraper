We are never going to stigmatize mental illness, but we have to look at the fact that this was a man who got care, was in a facility for two weeks this summer, and still was able to get and keep his guns.

Now, we have no idea how long he has been dead or what was found around his body. We don't know if he was found in an area that law enforcement had already searched and just missed it or he recently was found there anew. Had he been on the run? Did he have any help evading police for so long? We have a lot of questions. But there will be a press conference again tomorrow that may shed additional light. There was a press conference tonight. We're going talk and unpack that as well with you here on the program. But two days after he went on a deadly shooting rampage at a bowling alley and also a nearby bar and grill, killing people ranging in age from just 14 years old to 76 years old, we still do not know why he went on this murderous rampage, and it's the deadliest mass shooting in this country this year. And that question of why did he do it is going to haunt the people of Lewiston and really the country as they mourn those that they've lost and begin to put their lives back together and unite as a community. Maine's governor, Janet Mills, saying this just moments ago at the press conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. JANET MILLS (D-ME):  Now is the time to heal.

I just want to briefly note the impact that this has had on that community in Lisbon, and I think that's important. The people living there couldn't leave their homes. Everything around them is closed. There is one supermarket in that area where people shop at. And finally, today, the door is open and people were allowed to go in and buy stuff. And the lines in there were just incredible. And I spoke to a woman there. She just started crying, just because of the fear that she has felt. And, you know, we take these things for granted, but the folks there were finally able to go in and buy food for themselves. It was an incredible moment. And I think for so many of the people here and the families here and for the victims' families, how important this moment is, when I walked into City Hall today right before they started this press conference to see the officials here, hugging, sort of shaking hands, and just the relief that they felt knowing that this man was no longer a threat was really incredible to see, Laura.",

Hopefully, tomorrow, they will be.Now, in an earlier press conference, they gave us some information around response times and things like that. Remember, this is a very small town, not very many police officers, nothing really happened. So, I imagine they didn't have very many cops deployed. But they still arrived at the scene, you know, pretty quickly when the calls came in around shots being fired in both the bowling alley as well as the pool hall. So, that part of it, we will learn a little bit more about. But I'm more concerned right now about the search itself. Did they search that area previously? Where exactly was the body? Was it covered? You know, it was a very, you know, heavily forested area. But, you know, where exactly was the body?

I mean, you learn from all these cases.And they'll be profiling him to try to figure out his motive and all these kinds of things because we're starting to see a pattern now with these serial killers, these mass killers, and he'll be a part of that. Unfortunately, that family of folks is growing. But the one thing I do want to tip my hat to the department on and that is the fact that they notified the families before they gave it to the press or anyone else. That was absolutely the right thing to do. They've suffered enough and they should not get this information from the media. They should get it directly from the department. And so, I want to commend them for that. So, there are a lot of questions that we still have but, at least, there's a sense of relief now, at least it should be, from all the residents of Maine, quite frankly, and all of us that watch this, because, I mean, you can kind of feel the tension yourself even though you're not there. You have something like this. So, it's just one more tragedy.

And it's going to take me some time because I go in and out of the emotions and thinking, no, it didn't really happen, it didn't really happen, and then I'm constantly reminded it did.

It's something that so many people, too many people across this country, have said at one point or another in the aftermath of shootings like this.I was talking to one resident earlier today and he stressed to me, he wanted to make sure I understood as we talked about the folks that were killed, but also that were injured and still recovering, that these aren't just numbers, these are people with separate desires, wants, needs, everything in between. And that feeling is what people here in the community are going to be wrestling with much beyond the 48 hours it took to find the suspect, Laura.",

Councilman, thank you so much for joining us this evening. I mean, there must be a sigh of relief that the one, the lockdown is over, that the manhunt is over, but yet, the lives that have been impacted and lost here is still so raw.

The city is organizing fundraising through local bank so that there's -- unfortunately, you have scammers out there that would take advantage of these situations.So, we're setting up a fundraising for the families of those that have been touched by this. We're organizing denominational vigil hopefully for Sunday night. I know that it was said informally, the word was put out to put candles in your window tonight in remembrance. This was organized before we knew that Robert Card had been found and he was dead. So, it runs the gamut of everything. It's tough sometimes for people to reach out because they don't want to intrude on the families that are grieving. So, it's a balancing act. But the city, through all of this, many businesses that were closed to the lockdown opened just to prepare food, to feed the hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement personnel that were here. Poland Spring Water dropped a tractor trailer full of water, bottled water at the command post. And I can see -- Lewiston is a tight-knit community. We are second largest city in Maine, but we are a close- knit city, and everyone loves to help everybody.",

It is the deadliest mass shooting in this country this year, and it has left yet another community grieving. I want to bring back CNN's Shimon Prokupecz who has been on the ground closely following this story. And unfortunately, it's just the latest mass shooting that he has had to report on. And Shimon, I just want to take a step back for a moment. You've covered so many, including the Brooklyn subway shooting, the Pulse nightclub shooting, what happened in Uvalde as well, and the tragedy happening in Maine is affecting families all across this country who now are part of a larger community. What do you feel in these communities when the cameras start to leave?",

You know, I covered Uvalde, as you know and as our viewers know. You certainly saw that there. And also, Uvalde, it was just this desperation for answers and families are looking for answers. That's going to happen here. They're going to want answers. They want to know -- they are going to want to know how did this happen, why did this happen, how is this man allowed to have this weapon, why didn't anyone stop him when they knew that he was having all these issues.
