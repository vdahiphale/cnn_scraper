And the biggest red flag, if you will, that has been hanging over Alex Murdaugh throughout this case is a video that was discovered on Paul's phone in March of 2022. So nobody really knew about this for a while. They weren't able to get into Paul's phone. It was taken at the kennel in the moments before Paul and Maggie Murdaugh were shot and killed. And up until today, Alex Murdaugh would tell anybody who could listen and we've heard testimony after testimony on this that he never went to the kennels. And he did not see Maggie and Paul after dinner, but he did not go to the kennels. Well, we've heard people testify. His voice is heard in that video over and over again.

So the prosecution actually doesn't have a particularly strong case at the moment, maybe there's an argument to be made for putting the defendant on the stand. Now, you got a problem, because he lied to the cops. This is South Carolina, and a defendant who has admitted that he lied to the police. And I think this that's a point that jurors likely are not to take very kindly to. And again, we're seeing his side of the story here, there's going to come a moment when that prosecutor is gonna put him on the stand and walk him through every one of his statements, and it's not going to be good for him.",
