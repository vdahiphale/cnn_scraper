      "sentences": "So very quickly, off the bat, it only lasts about 20 minutes, but Mangione was asked to enter a plea. That was the only time he spoke, and he entered a plea of not guilty to these 11 state charges. You know, then his attorney took the opportunity to raise these concerns that she had about him, as she put it, being a human ping-pong ball, and the issue that there are warring jurisdictions.So she raised this saying she was concerned he wouldn't have the right to a fair trial. The judge, Gregory Carro, telling her that he can only control what happens in his courtroom, but he assured her that Mangione would be able to have a fair trial and that they would have a robust jury selection process to weed out any sort of bias. It was interesting, in the courtroom today, there were four rows of public - reserved for the public, and they were filled. They were mostly women, about two dozen women, out of a group of, say, 30 or so people there. Now, no one spoke, of course, because the decorum in the courtroom is to keep everything locked up. As you could see, even from those images inside the courtroom, Mangione, sitting at the defense table, is surrounded by court officers. They were behind him the entire time, and then walking closely, arm-in-arm with him, in and out of the actual courtroom down the center aisle. Now, another issue that came up, his lawyers asked for expedited discovery, and the prosecutor on the case said, in his 30 years of being a prosecutor, he said he hadn't seen ever this much evidence. He said they have thousands of hours of video of Mangione, because this was a multi-day manhunt. They had been able to piece together the steps that he is the alleged shooter of the UnitedHealthcare CEO by looking at all of this video, at surveillance evidence, both at the alleged crime scene, and then also tracking his travels throughout Manhattan, so that is some of the evidence. He also said they have the evidence from the Pennsylvania case, where he was arrested there in Altoona at that McDonald's, as well as what the federal officials have. [15:05:08] So a lot of evidence that they said they will have to amass and give to them, so the judge is saying the next time they'll be in court will be in late February to kind of have an update of where they are on this investigation as this begins to move forward. But another wrinkle here was, where was Mangione going next and that's because he was charged initially and indicted in the state, but then last Thursday, there were federal charges that came the day that Mangione was expected to be in the court he was in today for this arraignment. So the judge asking who has primary jurisdiction over him, the feds or the state? And the prosecutor in court today saying that it's the state authorities that have jurisdiction of him. They're the primary case. And the judge saying, well, I think you guys need to work this out and figure out where he's going to stay, if it will be in the federal jail in Brooklyn or if he might get shipped to Rikers Island in New York.

And here's why I say that, I know that there's been public pronouncements to the contrary, but the federal government is very well resourced and things in federal court move a lot swifter than they do in state court. It can take much more than a year to have any generalized murder case move forward, even, and especially in Manhattan, my former office, and boroughs around New York City.Whereas in federal court, it's just much more expeditious. There's less litigants, there's the motion practice in terms of the discovery being exchanged and attorneys filing various motions, the defense, usually, Erica, to suppress certain evidence, to make these arguments about unfair trials. And when you're ready to move forward, I'm not sure, as we look there at the federal counts, that a judge is going to say, oh, really, prosecutors, you made an agreement with New York City and Manhattan? No problem, I'll hold it in abeyance. And so my gut would indicate that that would move forward first. And final point, Erica, and that's this, it has a death penalty potential in federal court. And so with the stakes that high, with the consequences that high, it may very well be, despite what the official's saying, that when a federal judge says, hey, discovery's been exchanged, motion's been done, we're ready, let's go, and not stand and wait for whatever state proceeding is upcoming.",

One was paid more than $5,000. There were adult women traveling with him on a trip to the Bahamas. And then there's that allegation about the 17-year-old girl, an allegation that the committee takes a step further to say they believe Matt Gaetz was committing, allegedly, statutory rape, a violation of Florida state law. Now, he has not been charged with any crime. He had previously been investigated by the federal authorities and not charged. They declined to bring any charges there. But the House Ethics Committee details what happened with that woman, who was an underage girl at the time, who spoke to them. They wrote: \"The committee received testimony that Victim A and Representative Gaetz had sex twice during the party,\" that's a party in July of 2017, \"including at least once in the presence of other party attendees. Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Rep. Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex. At the time, she had just completed her junior year of high school. Victim A said that she did not inform Rep. Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age. The Committee did not receive any evidence indicating that Rep. Gaetz was aware that Victim A was a minor when he had sex with her.\" And Gaetz also has said in court filings today, as well as publicly, that he is denying these allegations against him from the House Ethics Committee.

The only other thing he could be subject to is prosecution. He has a right to defend himself. Everybody is presumed innocent. There has been no trial. He's entitled to due process. He's entitled to question these witnesses, to push back forcefully, to say he didn't do it, and maybe he's right. That would be for a jury to make the determination. So he's going to protect his interest, protect his brand, protect himself, and he should, because everyone deserves a defense. But at the end of the day, until these are vetted, this is a committee report. It needs to be vetted. There needs to be a trial. That's our system of justice.

Erin, when we hear this from Donald Trump throwing out the idea of taking over control of the Panama Canal, which, of course, the president of Panama then pushed back on very strongly because it is under Panamanian authority, floating again the idea of Greenland, how is this helpful? Is this a distraction from something else? Erin Perrine: I'm not a hundred percent sure what the strategy is here. But I heard a couple of things in Steve's reporting that kind of piqued my interest here. One, you heard that Steve was saying regarding the Panama Canal that he's hearing from transition folks that this was out of left field. They don't really know where this came from or why Trump has decided to put this in. However, from what I heard of Trump's speech, and I didn't see it, so I'm not a hundred percent sure on this, it sounded like those were almost prepared remarks put into the speech about seizing back the Panama Canal, which means people in Trump's circle do know what's going on here. He has been talking about it, at least enough that somebody typed it up and put it into remarks, potentially. I, again, didn't see the full remarks, but what I heard sounded a bit more prepared than off the cuff like you normally hear from Donald Trump. It does sound, and again, we don't elaborate or explain if you've ever worked for Donald Trump, but it sounds like it's an attempt at a negotiation tactic. I'm not sure on the Greenland front either. But if it's true that Steve's reporting says that people don't know where this came from and people are that much in Donald Trump's ear right now, Susie Wiles needs to be able to step in and say, enough's enough, let's get this back on track and remain focused on what we've promised to deliver for the American people.",
