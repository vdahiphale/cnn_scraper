OF HAWAII MARINE CENTER: Well, as a submersible pilot myself, I've been diving subs for almost 20 years, this is very concerning. But in my opinion, until some type of confirmation is obtained, all rescue efforts must go ahead at full speed. It may still turn out that, sorry, false alarm.

Could they be explained some other way or could possibly these noises be coming, you know, quite deliberately from the Titan? And they were in the middle of that. As far as we understand, Dana, they're still doing that. But John Cabot is still out there, still working on this at this very minute. And they really tried to preposition and then deploy every resource that they possibly could, given what the U.S. Coast Guard said were challenging circumstances and a remote area. I do want to add, no matter what they found down there right now, the weather cooperated. Dana. I've been out in the North Atlantic. It can change on a dime. It didn't. It went from kind of OK with some fog in the early hours to much better weather. And that has certainly helped for them to get all of this data back, even from that remote operated vehicle.",

That was the deepest rescue that had ever been pulled up. As we know, they are at the depth of the Titanic, which is 13,000 feet, 14,000 feet.

So potentially 8,000 feet, 9,000 feet was there -- the fear would be that there was a catastrophic depressurization and that the submarine or the vessel would have effectively collapsed and then they would have been killed instantly.

So if the fact that it is good weather on the surface means that if, God willing, there is still a potential rescue operation, then that can only be in their favor.
