We'll get reaction from Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona. Plus, as Israel and Hezbollah trade new attacks, President Biden insists peace in the region is possible in his farewell speech to the U.N. General Assembly.

I mean, there are vectors here to talk to women voters. I don't think the abortion issue is the one on which to fight, frankly.If you look at the CNN poll that came out today, economy, immigration, those are all great for Trump. Abortion was the best issue for Kamala Harris. Traditionally in a campaign, you want to talk to about issues and give yourself a chance to fight from the best policy ground for you. So, my advice to the former president would be keep it focused on cost of living, food prices, inflation, and immigration, and you are probably going to be able to reel in some women voters who maybe don't like you on some issues but like you better on others.",

And so I think the more that women and I think as we continue to see her throughout these next 40- some days, they will move towards her.I will caution viewers and listening to the polls, right, like polls are indications, they're not going to tell us how voters will vote in the ballot box, you know, sometimes these polls have shown that white women appreciated a certain candidate of another one and then they got into the ballot box and actually did not vote for the Democratic candidate, right? And so we will see what happens on Election Day. But I think as she continues to talk about this issue of abortion and if Donald Trump keeps talking about women the way that he does, knowing that he has this track record of, quite frankly, being someone that women aren't afraid of, I think we can see more women come to her between now and Election Day.",

So, it is very stupid, shortsighted, and offensive for somebody to think that because you reach a certain age, you stop caring, because you no longer can have children, you stop caring. I know this might be a foreign concept to Mr. Moreno and some Republicans, but there are people who care just because they care about their fellow American and their fellow human.

So, I was shocked to learn that Kamala Harris wants Republicans to get rid of the filibuster today and do goodness knows what.Look, the dynamic is this. The Republican Party will defend the filibuster and thank God because we do need it. I think Manchin is exactly right. Trump tried to pressure the Republicans to get rid of it, but they should not because it is one of the last tools in Washington to drive bipartisanship. It is how you get bipartisan outcomes in one of the two chambers of Congress. Now, Harris has been on a journey. She signed a letter saying she supported it in '17. Then she came out against it.

Previously, he was charged with a couple of gun charges, and those counts were intended to essentially keep him in jail while this investigation continued. And, of course, now we have seen in the last couple of days, including at the detention hearing yesterday in Florida where they believe they have enough evidence to bring these charges. So, if he is convicted of these charges, Wolf, he could face life imprisonment, according to the government. Now, one of the things we know in the last few days is that the government says that Ryan Routh spent weeks, essentially, stalking the former president, including b being outside his golf course, tracking his movements, trying to figure out when he would be at that golf course in West Palm Beach. We also know that he left behind a letter that they filed in court right here. You can see a part of it in which he said this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I'm sorry, I failed you. Again, that's according to the government. And according to this letter that they say he left behind. One more thing, Wolf, that is noteworthy is that this case is now in the hands of Judge Aileen Cannon. She's the federal judge who was overseeing Donald Trump's case in the classified documents investigation. Of course, she dismissed those charges and that decision is now on appeal. Wolf?",

South of Beirut, the funerals have begun. The coffins draped with Hezbollah's banner. What was the border war is looking like a full-on war. In like the last war, tens of thousands again, are fleeing for their lives. No easy task for the elderly and infirm, to dozens of schools in the capital turned into shelters for the displaced. Shades of Gaza, most left everything behind, some including their dead. It's true, he left, but material things can be replaced, says Zainab. Lives cannot. Losing someone is incredibly hard, home for Abu Ali and his family of six, now a bare classroom. I asked him if as Israel says, it was only striking Hezbollah targets. Liars, they're liars, he shoots back. Entire families are gone. They're not Hezbollah targets. We live in the south. We don't know where Hezbollah is, and I don't know where the Hezbollah fighters are. Dr. Jihad Saadeh treated the injured in the 2006 war and here at this hospital in Beirut, he's doing it all over again. DR. JIHAD SAADEH, BEIRUT:  All of them are civilians.

A series of strikes, part of this reported Israeli strategy of what they're calling escalate to deescalate.

SAMANTHA POWER, USAID ADMINISTRATOR:  Well, we've already seen over these last weeks of 70,000 Israeli civilians more than 110,000 Lebanese. We see the human toll in some of the images that have come out today and over the last few days. In Lebanon, our focus is USAID, of course, is how do we ramp up the humanitarian response, if people are in fact displaced from their homes, if they're taking flight. But President Biden's message today was crystal clear, which is de- escalation is the only path that can actually we want these consequences of that keep occurring. I mean, we see the conflict in Gaza, the conflict in Sudan, what this human toll is, and it this is why U.S. diplomacy has been so focused on taking down the temperature.

The circumstances particularly heading into winter now, are absolutely desperate.We remember last winter how bad it was for Palestinian civilians in Gaza.

And you see these flimsy tarps on the beach? And imagine when those temperatures go down and the seas come up, its just really human misery. So that has been our posture. We've been pushing the Israelis. We've been, of course deliberating interim only about how best to bring about the most forward-leaning posture. So, as much assistance comes in, as possible. I'm not going to comment on any report from long time ago, but we've been very, very clear and the president, of course, has really focused on these humanitarian issues in all of his engagements with Prime Minister Netanyahu.
