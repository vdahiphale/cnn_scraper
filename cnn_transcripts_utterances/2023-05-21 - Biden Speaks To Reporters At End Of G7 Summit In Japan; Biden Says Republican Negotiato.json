I can't guarantee that. Number four, I'm looking at the 14th Amendment as to whether or not we have the authority -- I think we have the authority. The question is, could it be done and invoked in time that it could not -- would not be appealed and -- as a consequence passed the date in question and still default on the debt? That's a question that I think is unresolved. And so the point is, I think, I'm hoping and I believe that when we stood and we sat in the room with all the leaders from Mitch McConnell on and they said, we will not default. Period. We will not default. That's what all -- including Kevin McCarthy said, we will not default. And so, I'm assuming that we mean what we say and we'll figure out a way to not have to default.

Also, Chicago Sun-Times Washington Bureau Chief Lynn Sweet. And of course, our White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly, who was in the room also asking questions.Phil, let's start with you. I mean, it seems like the big takeaway is both sides on the debt ceiling are digging and we heard Biden using words like the other side, the Republicans, their side, their proposals are unacceptable, they're extreme.

And essentially making the push here that something's going to have to give on the House Republican side that they haven't seen yet. Now, it's interesting, you mentioned the 14th Amendment. He was asked about it and made clear that they were still looking into the issue. And at the very end, that's why I followed up. I wanted to make sure whether or not that was actually considered a tangible option in this moment, given the fact that there are 12 days from a potential default. And the President made clear, this is up to lawmakers. There is no unilateral action, there is no executive action that they think that they can sign off on or move forward on in that short period of time. It's something he's very willing to consider later after this is resolved. But up to now, it's up to lawmakers.",

Does it sound like to you that the President, the White House, is further away from no absolutely than they were when these talks started? Because at the beginning it was, we're not going in that direction. Today, he talked about rationale and he talked about if he can make a case to the courts.",

As you've been there, Phil, what has your sense been in terms of how the G7 leaders are feeling about this? You know, it seems like there's been a little bit of downplaying of, you know, the leaders being more curious about it rather than concerned, even though we know that if the U.S. does default -- it never has before, this would be the first time if it actually happens, but that would cause a global economic catastrophe. Is there much more concern that you sense amongst the G7 leaders that this could possibly happen?",

These are the biggest players certainly amongst developed democracies. And you make a great point, there's kind of a sanguine view -- to some degree, my understanding according to some officials is that leaders would kind of give them a hard time, or their advisors would say, I can't believe you're dealing with this again, type stuff. And I think that reflects the fact that over the course of the last decade, 12, 13 years, this is constantly something that happens, not necessarily just debt ceiling debates, also government shutdowns, just general dysfunction between Capitol Hill and the Executive Branch.And yet there's always a resolution, right? They always pull a rabbit out of the hat in the last minute, and everybody kind of moves on. And I think what has not necessarily sunk in here, and some it's now over, but over the course of the last several days, is that this time could be different. And I don't think White House officials have tried to reflect that to anybody. I think they've made clear, the president said it, his National Security Advisor has said it several times as well. The president was making clear to leaders that they would find a resolution here, they didn't need to worry, this would be something that would get done. But it's always something that gets done until the time it doesn't. And I think that's the issue right now, given the clock and given how far away they are from this, that perhaps some of these leaders in the coming days will be a little bit more nervous than they were here on the ground in Hiroshima.",

The importance of this shift now of the U.S. preparing to hand over those planes sometime down the road and starting to train those pilots.",

We don't know the details of what exactly the allies have agreed to with respect to controls or efforts for van exports and semiconductors and other technical materials to build up the Chinese military.But on the face of it, I thought, again, you had ally G7 unity on Ukraine. Zelenskyy's presence, as it always does, demonstrates the importance of leadership and particularly his leadership at a critically important moment. But I think I'm balanced, frankly, this is a prelude to the even more important event that just come. Because if in fact, the Ukrainian offensive succeeds in taking back hundreds of square kilometers of Ukrainian territory, or perhaps even more, depending on how competent and capable Ukraine's military can be in this current offensive, it'll provide an inflection point for the direction of this conflict. If the Ukraine offensive falters or essentially stalls and does not change the trajectory of the conflict in a fundamental way, I think both allies and adversaries are going to have to rethink exactly how we go forward, and in the administration have to have to think that as well. The other point I would add is will to fight is important, but so is will to fund. And I think with the $375 million commitment, and the addition of the F 16s, which is both symbolic for the moment, but also I think determinative in the longer term, I think that will fund the still quite resilient allies.

And when you talk to White House aides, the proposals that they've put forward include keeping some levels of defense spending, cutting some domestic spending. And I think the problem right now is that the two sides are so far apart.And I do think it was striking when you listen to the President. His tone is so different from what we just heard 24 hours ago here in Hiroshima when he was, you know, quite optimistic about reaching a deal, essentially saying that what was happening was just posturing and bluster and basically what he expected. He came out to this press conference in much sharper fashion. It followed a sharpening of rhetoric by his aides as well. And I think that does tell you that the White House does view this as much of a political situation as a quite a real economic situation as well. And it was interesting something that he said at the very, very end of this press conference. He said, on the merits based on what I've offered, I would be blameless. But on the politics of it, no one will be blameless. And he went on to do something quite extraordinary suggesting that some MAGA Republicans, as he called them, would send the economy into default if it meant damaging him politically. So, clearly, the president seeing a need to sharpen his political spear in these talks. Of course, he is heading back to Washington. He's probably, you know, on his way to Air Force One now. That phone call with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy will be essential. And the way President Biden framed it was interesting. He said he thought that McCarthy just needed to talk to him directly to ensure that he was still engaged. He says he wasn't sure if that's what McCarthy wanted or not, but that is something that he was hoping for in these talks. So, it will remain to be seen if that will break the log jam. But certainly, this has really overshadowed his trip to the summit here. It's been a topic of discussion. And it really hasn't done anything to sort of dissuade particularly European leaders that the American political system is just in a state of dysfunction at the moment. You know, you heard Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, say there was a point of interest in the conversations with the leaders. President Biden said in his talks that he wasn't able to guarantee that the United States wouldn't default. And so. this is an interesting insight into his conversations with the leaders here at this precarious moment. He is departing here with no necessarily reassurances to those leaders who are also leaving here in Hiroshima, watching anxiously what transpires back in Washington.",
