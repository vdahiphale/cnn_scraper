I'm Jake Tapper.This hour, an update to a story that we've been following literally for years here at The Lead and that I wrote about in a cover story for The Atlantic magazine, CJ Rice, a Philadelphia man freed after more than 12 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit. His conviction was overturned as we have covered. He joins me live in studio today. He's going to explain how he's trying to make sure what happened to him does not happen to anyone else. Plus, brand new polls from a handful of states likely to decide the presidential election, what voters in these battlegrounds are saying about Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. And leading this hour, the clock is ticking and failure is almost guaranteed as dysfunction continues to rain on Capitol Hill. The House of Representatives is getting ready to vote on what is said to be a doomed government funding bill. If and when this fails, House Speaker Mike Johnson is not revealing as of now what Plan B is, that is assuming he has a Plan B. Republicans are aware of the timing and are warning about the repercussions of federal government closing for business just weeks ahead of the presidential election. Complicating all of this, Donald Trump this afternoon putting out a social media post pressuring Republicans to shut down the government unless they can also get a controversial bill passed that targets noncitizen voting, which is, of course, already against the law. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill. And Manu, the former President is not making speaker Johnson's job any easier right now.",

Johnson, if it's upon a party line vote, if everyone is voting, can only afford to lose four Republican votes.And Jake, I asked the speaker directly earlier today, do you agree with what Donald Trump is saying that essentially they should be a government shutdown if there is no agreement on this immigration bill. And he didn't exactly say. He simply said that he was in Mar-a-Lago this weekend. He has spoken to Donald Trump about this issue, and he said that they both are fighting to deal with these anti-immigration measures, but did not indicate what Plan B is.

Remarks that received a lot of criticism. Donald Trump dismissed it. He dodged the question, said that he didn't really know anything about it. So, keep that in mind.A lot of people have been looking for answers on whether Republicans agree with the comments she made. And just to give you very briefly, because we're in New York and that off the record stop, or excuse me, that previously undisclosed stop was in New York City. It is very interesting that Donald Trump, with just 48 days now until Election Day, is choosing to rally in in New York. I talked to a number of Donald Trump's advisers about this, and while they acknowledge it is not a battleground, they say the real reason Donald Trump is here is because this visit is steeped in nostalgia. Donald Trump has long wanted to hold a large scale rally like this in New York, particularly in a large arena. Months ago, there had been discussions about maybe doing something at Madison Square Garden, the logistics, of course, which were unfeasible. So he's doing something here today. But at the same time, you know, Donald Trump himself is insisting that he thinks he'll be able to win New York. Of course, most Republicans recognize that's just very unlikely, and that Democrats are expected to secure it again come a couple weeks. Jake.",

But this bill does more than that. It puts forth real hurdles that, in fact, would create challenges for service members, veterans, women who may change their name and marriage and then move states.The way that one would go about proving one's identity, as outlined in this bill, is just -- it's untenable in terms of how this bill is constructed, certainly an effort to affirm that it is the United States' Congress' intent that U.S. citizens vote in our elections, I think is one that would be broadly supported.

I mean, frankly, we should have done appropriations bills over the summer, and we should, in the absence of having been able to fulfill that requirement of us, we have to have the speaker bring forth a bill.The bottom line is, if Hakeem Jeffries as minority leader had the ability to bring a funding bill, a continuing resolution forward, he would have done it last week and avoided the will they, won't they? But time and time again, with this Republican majority, we see the brinksmanship. And failure seems to be a requirement before at the last minute the speaker, whether it's Speaker Johnson or former Speaker McCarthy, does what is kind of demanded of him and the role of the speaker.

While also arguing, mind you, that Mr. Trump was not capable of telling the truth. Now I might have said at the time that that was the most glaring moment of cognitive dissonance in the 2024 race.But then came this last week, former President Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, are criticizing the news media and Democrats for what they call irresponsible rhetoric that they allege was behind the thankfully unsuccessful assassination attempt against Mr. Trump on Sunday.

Those lies are now disrupting life in that town. So let's start with these ongoing lies and the fact that the Wall Street Journal today confirmed that the Trump campaign actually knew or had been told that the Springfield rumors were false back on September 9. The Journal reports that Vance's team contacted the city, Springfield, that morning. And here's how Springfield City Manager Bryan Heck described the call with the Vance staffer, quote, \"He asked point-blank, \"Are the rumors true of pets being taken and eaten?\" I told him no, there was no verifiable evidence or reports to show this was true. I told them, these claims were baseless,\" unquote. Baseless. But Vance's tweet making the allegation stayed up, and the very next day, former President Trump elevated this lie to 67 million viewers during that second presidential debate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Rice was officially exonerated for the wrongful conviction that forced him to endure more than 12 years in prison for a crime he physically could not have committed. And now C.J. Rice is fighting to give back what was taken for him a promising future.I found out about this case first from my father, as you might recall, Dr. Theodore S. Tapper, who was Rice's pediatrician and testified at the trial in 2011 that he did not think Rice would have been physically capable of carrying out the shooting in 2011 given that Rice was recovering from a separate shooting at the time and could barely walk. I looked into Rice's case. I wrote a cover story in \"The Atlantic\" that was published in October 2022 which was also covered here on The Lead and noted the many ways that Rice did not have effective counsel when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania tried him and then sent him to prison for 30 to 60 years for a crime in which no one was even seriously injured. Lawyers argued that same point, and the district attorney's office and two judges since granted C.J. what's called Habeas Relief, meaning that he was freed from prison last December. Now he's a free man, C.J. Rice, with the help of his legal team, are suing the city of Philadelphia and at least seven employees of the Philadelphia Police Department over the wrongful arrest, asking a federal jury to award damages and relief. And C.J. Rice joins us now here in the studio live and Jon Loevy -- Loe -- Loevy, one of C.J.'s attorneys joins us remotely. So C.J., let me just start with you. Why is it important for you to file this lawsuit? C.J. RICE, FREED AFTER 12 YEARS OF WRONGFUL INCARCERATION: So I believe the importance of the lawsuit is to deteriorate from happening again, right, to -- or to set some kind of precedent so that it don't happen again. Because what happened was, like, it was surreal a little bit so something like that, in a way, to have that, be looked at through the lens of this is unacceptable that may come by way of the lawsuit like it's -- it's unacceptable.",

How confident are you that the court will ultimately rule in C.J.s favor?JON LOEVY, ATTORNEY FOR C.J. RICE: Well, it will be a jury, of course, Jake, that will decide what justice is, a jury of his peers. And we're quite confident C.J. is going to get justice. You know, backing up, this was a 17-year-old kid who didn't hurt anybody, who ends up spending 12 years in maximum security prison, convicted of a crime he didn't commit. He didn't have anything to do with the shooting. He couldn't have committed the shooting because the shooters ran away, and as the police knew, C.J. had been shot himself. Had serious pelvis injuries, he couldn't even walk, much less run away from a shooting. So they fabricated these identifications. They got these witnesses who saw nothing in the dark, who knew C.J., knew it wasn't C.J., and they manufactured this case. It's inexcusable and indefensible.
