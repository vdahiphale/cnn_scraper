      "sentences": "Happening now, the Supreme Court extends a temporary block of abortion pills restrictions, the court allowing continued access for now and buying the justices more time to consider an emergency appeal.Also tonight, after Fox's historic settlement with Dominion, the network is now facing another major lawsuit from a voting technology company with an even bigger price tag. And the 84-year-old defendant pleads not guilty in the shooting of a teenager who mistakenly went to his home. I'll be speaking with the lawyer for the teen's family, Ben Crump, about the racial component of this case and whether hate crime charges are warranted. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is on assignment. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in The Situation Room. Tonight, the Supreme Court has set a new Friday night deadline as it considers whether to preserve or limit access to a widely used abortion drug. Let's go straight to CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, what is the thinking behind the Supreme Court's decision to kick this can down the road 48 hours?",

      "sentences": "Well, Alex, as of now, this widely used abortion medication will remain widely available. The Supreme Court is expected to offer another update by Friday afternoon, potentially up until midnight.Now, at the center of this case is a drug, Mifepristone. It is one of the drugs, one of two, that is used in a process called medication abortion, which accounts for over half of all abortions in the United States. Several weeks ago, a Texas judge invalidated the FDA approval of Mifepristone, and now the Supreme Court has to decide what will happen to that decision while this issue plays its way out through the courts. Now, since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion last spring, medication abortion has been a focus not only in conservative state legislatures but also in litigation like this. So, it's unclear right now what will happen to that Texas decision, but we could potentially get an update on Friday.",

But if they do that, they need to decide what happens in the interim. Do they allow that Texas decision to stand which would restrict access to Mifepristone, or do they just keep that on hold while this issue on the merits works its way through the courts?

It's not as if by Friday night, Alex, we're going to have a full resolution as to what exactly what happened in lieu of a full, litigious process.What this essentially says, though, is, hey, we want to decide what the new normal and what the status quo is going to be. Is it going to be that Mifepristone remains as accessible as it's been since at least 2016, or are we going to impose those newer restrictions right now? The Fifth Circuit said to say, look, we're going to have these restrictions that were previously in place, excuse me, in 2016 no longer apply. And so the courts are likely wrestling with this. The interesting part about this, this goes beyond the issue of solely medication abortions. They're looking into a deeper issue as well. And that is what is the power of the FDA to authorize a whole host of medications? What will actually happen in the marketplace in terms of what chaos may ensue, what people have been accustomed to having access to, how the male plays into this. And also, remember, Alex, you've got the almighty dollar that governs a whole lot of considerations in public policy. And so what are the pharmaceutical industry heads to think about the notion that things that could be profitable or things that could interest them and continue investments in research and innovation might just like this be taken away by a judge.",

And so it's the judicial branch usurping the role that even the Supreme Court actually wanted people to look at.But this is likely to be a part of an ongoing and lengthier conversation for a number of reasons. Remember, I have to harken back this very point. The issue in the Dobbs decision was about the constitutional access and right to an abortion. This will likely come down to more of an administrative one. In terms of who's lane is this particular judge or any judge hoping to enter into? Is this a matter of the authority of an agency or the authority of the court and which it actually trump? But you know what, for many people watching this issue, it feels like women's access to abortion and health care and rights are now the newest judicial hot potato.",

It's way safer than Viagra, another very common drug.Now, if the restrictions go through, in other words, the restrictions that aren't on now, if the proposed restrictions, so to speak, go through, it will make it harder for women to access this drug. They won't be able to get it through the mail. They'll have to have an appointment with the doctor, and that's an appointment with the doctor, not with the nurse practitioner and nurse practitioners often do obstetrical care, so it will make it more difficult for women to get this drug.",

So, that's still something that Fox News is going to have to deal with. They actually released a statement yesterday, Smartmatic's lead attorney. And he said -- I'll read to you. He said, Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by Fox's disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest. And so you can see they are very eager to take Fox to task over the lies they spread in the wake of the 2020 election.I should also note, Alex, that Dominion also has ongoing lawsuits in its other right-wing channels. They're suing OAN, Newsmax, as well as pro-Trump figures like Mike Lindell and Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani.

I think particularly because Dominion has other irons in the fire, as Norm says, this puts a lot of wind in the sails.If I can make an unusual analogy to asbestos litigation, where the big plaintiffs firms will go after like 100 different defendants, they'll settle all the ones they can. The ones are left, you go to trial one.

The one thing that the family can control is the civil action. And so that's where we're going forward, demand a full justice for Trye Nichols, and we want policy and legislation to prevent anybody else seeing their child beat up by lynch mob wearing blue uniforms where they look like Emmett Till.",

It's not clear based on what Nancy Mace is saying when based on the fact that some of the provisions that McCarthy is proposing, they're not even conservative enough for a lot of conservatives in his conference. So, when you start from that point, and it's not clear he can get to the votes that he needs to pass that, and then you add into that the fact that he is going to have to get to the negotiating table with Democrats, I don't think this is headed in a particularly positive direction.One other aspect of this whole thing that I think is going to be interesting to see, a lot of Republicans wanting to repeal not just of parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed last year by a Democratic-controlled Congress, but of all of it. And that's something that both, I think, has some real implications for whether or not it might actually increase the deficit and it might be an absolute no- brainer, it might be a complete red line for this White House and for even some moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats in the House and in the Senate.",

They resisted. They fought the Nazis. It was a brutal situation, but a very heroic situation by those Jews who were inside the worst are ghetto.

And so the question now is. How does the world continue to remember? One of the ways is here in Warsaw, as you mentioned Wolf, we're right here inside what was the Warsaw ghetto, that was -- that was leveled. At its height, at its maximum capacity, 450,000 Jews were basically shoved into this area where they didn't have a lot of space. And because of that, that was the number 450,000 of these. They're yellow daffodils, and they represent to the Jews here at the time, but it also represents a flower of hope. So these are on the lapels of people in Warsaw, walking around the streets, obviously mostly non-Jews, because they're only a little more than 3,000 Jews left in all of Poland.",
