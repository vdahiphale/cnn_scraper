The first time Iran has directly struck Israel from its own soil. One of two highly significant and potentially history-changing stories that we are following in the hour ahead.Israel's war cabinet, seen here yesterday, met again today reviewing plans for a potential counter-strike. The leadership here vowing to \"exact a price for what Iran did,\" which in turn was Iran's response for what's believed to be the Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals in Syria. What shape the Israeli response takes, the timing of it and Iran's reaction to it, it could transform an already dangerous confrontation into something even harder to contain. Just a short time ago, Iran's deputy foreign minister warned that his country will respond in just seconds if Israel, in his words, makes another mistake. Also tonight, back in New York, American history being made. Jury selection begins for the first criminal trial ever of a former president, the first of four criminal trials, as you know, for this former president, perhaps the only one to happen before Election Day. So as you might imagine, our focus over the hour ahead is divided for two good reasons. We - as we closely monitor any moves from Israel, we begin right now with a momentous day in the case against the former president and CNN's Kara Scannell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "This is an assault on America. Nothing like this has ever happened before. There has never been anything like it.(END VIDEO CLIP) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Donald Trump speaking out on a day that saw 96 potential jurors pass through magnetometers to enter the courtroom with Trump. They were sworn in and questioning began. A few minutes later, at least 50 prospective jurors were excused because they told the judge they could not be fair and impartial. Of those who remained, three questioned by the judge listed the New York Times and CNN as their sources of news. None said they had read any books by Michael Cohen or Trump. And none of them said they worked or volunteered for any pro-Trump or anti-Trump groups. Just nine members of today's jury pool were questioned and not dismissed by the time court adjourned. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg says the former president attempted to cover up payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election, trying to stop her from speaking out about the alleged affair with Trump. Judge Juan Merchan started the day by denying a motion from Trump's lawyers to recuse himself. As attorneys debated, Judge Juan Merchan said he would not allow the infamous Access Hollywood tape to be shown or video of Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit that found him liable for defamation. Karen McDougal, a model who says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet about it, will be allowed to testify. Attorneys also argued about how much the jury can be told about Michael Cohen crimes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I did it at the direction of, in concert with and for the benefit of Donald J. Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCANNELL (voice over): The credibility of Trump's former fixer, who admitted he orchestrated the hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, will be one of the most fought over elements of the case. Trump, for his part, entered very few words into the court record. He could sometimes be seen leaning back in his chair with his arms folded, and his eyes appeared to be closed for several minutes. When he was introduced as the defendant, Trump turned around and gave the potential jurors a tight-lipped smirk. Once jury selection began, Trump was active, at times conferring with his lawyer and holding the questionnaire up to read as the judge questioned jurors. Prosecutors also asked the judge to fine Trump for social media posts attacking witnesses involved in the case, saying he violated a gag order. The judge scheduled a hearing for next week to settle that matter. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. It may be the only case against Trump to face a jury before the 2024 election. The presumptive Republican nominee complaining about the judge as he walked out of the courtroom. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Two things in particular, one that needs a fact-check, which is that the question of what the schedule of this trial is going to look like.One thing that the Trump team had raised was his son's upcoming graduation. The judge was essentially saying, I can't make a decision on that right now. Something that's happening in May, that's a decision we'll have to make going forward. That is one thing that you've seen the Trump team really seize on, saying that repeatedly as they've been going after this judge and criticizing him, given he started today's hearing by saying, I'm not going to recuse myself. That second request that he had gotten from the Trump legal team to do so. And the really the one thing that they are focused on is what's going to happen once the questioning of these jurors gets underway beyond what we saw today, where just a few of them actually had the questionnaire read. Most of them were - left the room over half of that initial pool of 96 people, because they said they could not be fair or impartial. And that has been the argument that you've been hearing from the Trump team, complaining that they don't believe they can get a fair jury here. But of course, they are going to be ultimately trying to whittle this down to 12 people and a few alternates that they believe will be helpful to them, because all they need is one Anderson here to essentially not agree with the prosecution.",

People are going to have some pretty strong opinions about him. So half the people saying I've got strong opinions about this is a good thing because those people have self-identified as not being impartial and that's what you need in a trial like this.

That is going to be next Thursday.And Trump's team, right at the end, after they were done with trying to get jury selection working on that today, they made a request for Donald Trump to be able to attend that next Thursday in Washington. Todd Blanche, his lead attorney, said that he very much wants to attend that. And the judge was saying, I understand why that's of grave importance. It's obviously an argument that you're making before the Supreme Court, but he noted correctly that Trump is required to be here in New York. That is part of the agreement. He didn't ask for a waiver for his presence. He certainly could. But the judge said that next Thursday he will see him here in New York because they are trying to keep this on schedule, and I think that speaks to really what today underscores and what it means for how it's changing Donald Trump's day-to-day reality, Anderson.

And it's very possible that Trump won't get any jail time for something of this severity. There are other cases ongoing that could be more severe.However, this case is consequential in part because it's the one that we may see resolution on first before the election. So this is something that is going to have a big effect on the media cycle, a big effect on the election. And I will say that from what we've seen in the early proceedings, this judge pushing back very hard against efforts by Trump's defense to delay things, efforts to force the judge to recuse himself. All of that does suggest that you have someone in that position who is not a pushover and who is going to go hard on this. He did grant at least one motion that the defense brought forward today.

They formed themselves into the Republican Party. In the South, the person who did the attack, Preston Brooks, became a hero. And everybody was giving him golden canes to replicate the cane that he had used to bludgeon Sumner. And you realize that the same event was being considered in an entirely different way in terms of facts, truth, and emotions about how they felt it. And then people knew, historians have said, that once that happened it was really hard for anything to bring those two sides together. And that's what we're seeing today. Different truths, different facts, a different emotional set about even this trial itself and what's being said. So that's what's -- that's what makes me nervous as a historian.
