Defying the odds, a nurse, from Hawaii, about to sail solo, around the globe, before her incurable disease makes it impossible. She is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I am Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, cracking down. CNN is exclusively learning that the United States is planning to crack down on Russia, and Russian Intelligence Services, for efforts, to circumvent U.S. sanctions. We understand this will be coming, next week. And it is as Putin's best hope, for a win, in Ukraine, is crumbling, even more, tonight. The Wagner Group, suffering huge losses, now unlikely to meet their goal, of capturing symbolic city of Bakhmut, by the one-year anniversary, of the invasion. In fact, they had thought, right, they would have gotten it a long time ago. Already, Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner Group has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, roughly 9,000 deaths, according to the U.S. government, tonight. And that sounds like a lot. It is. Let me just give you the context, because this really brings it home. The U.S. recently said that Wagner has only 50,000 troops, in Ukraine, in total. 30,000 casualties; 50,000 people total. And the complaints, from inside Wagner, are starting to mount. I warn you that this video that we're going to share with you here is graphic. But a Wagner-affiliated social media channel posted it. It is alleged fighters. They're asking for more ammunition. Now, we can't verify the authenticity of this video. But it does track with everything that we have heard.

Today, we learned that 635 Ukrainian troops have just finished a five- week training course, at a U.S. base, in Germany.

He is based in the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa; and retired Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton. Thanks so much to both of you. Colonel Leighton, let me just start with you, with what Alex was saying, that Russia is struggling to get a new offensive going, a battered Military, the tremendous losses, obviously, from Wagner, being a part of that. What would a massive Russian offensive look like, with the Military that they have, now, presuming that they have tens of thousands or more troops that they're about to commit to it? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST, AIR FORCE COLONEL (RET.): Yes, Erin, that's a really interesting question. In normal times, you would say a Russian offensive would look like a huge mass of soldiers, going forward, with lots of tanks, helicopters and air support. The air support is definitely lacking, at least it has been lacking so far. You also have a situation, where there are, really, problems, backfilling the losses that the Russians have had that Alex mentioned, in his report. So, you're going to see probably, is this attempt to, like you see in Bakhmut, and in other places, along the front, where there're going to be these probes that are moving forward.

Now, there's a gap of time, as Michael points out, right? Tanks are promised. Those Abrams tanks are not coming anytime soon. They're just not ready. Biden has resisted the F-16s.

That would have then given the Ukrainians time, to get familiar with the platform, be able to employ the platform, and also get familiar with the avionics. Plus, it would also have allowed them to train maintenance troops, as well as the Intelligence forces, and radar operators, in order to effectively employ this weapon system, in a combined arms manner.

The Senator is being treated for clinical depression, after he wasn't eating, and was losing weight. It comes less than a year, after Fetterman suffered a stroke, in the middle of the 2022 campaign.All of this bringing awareness to what is a common struggle, for so many stroke survivors. And Manu Raju is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): John Fetterman, in the public spotlight, battling an illness that millions struggle with, in private. Clinical depression, not uncommon, for stroke victims, like Fetterman, who nearly died, last May, after suffering a major stroke, at the height of his high-profile Senate race, in Pennsylvania. DR. DHRUV KHULLAR, HEALTH POLICY PROFESSOR, WEILL CORNELL MEDICINE: About one in three patients, who have a stroke, will have depression, at some point, over the course of the year. RAJU (voice-over): Fetterman remains, at Walter Reed Hospital, after checking himself in, on Wednesday night. His symptoms had grown severe. A source, tells CNN, he had lost a significant amount of weight, not eating properly, or drinking enough fluids, contributing to light-headedness that forced him to be admitted, to George Washington Hospital, last week. After being discharged, Fetterman met with Capitol physician, Brian Monahan, who later suggested treatment, for clinical depression. The source says that Fetterman's stay could last weeks, or more than a month. His doctors search for the right mix of medication. DR. MEGAN RANNEY, ASSOCIATE DEAN PUBLIC HEALTH, BROWN UNIVERSITY: We know that Senator Fetterman pushed himself, so hard, in those weeks, after the stroke when, in an ideal world, he would have been recovering. RAJU (voice-over): Just a few weeks, before his stroke, CNN caught up with Fetterman, in rural Pennsylvania. He engaged in extended exchanges with voters. SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): Hello, everybody. Hey, hey, hey. If we legalized it, it would create tens of thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania.

And his life changed, in one day.And we, Dustin Reynolds and I have talked about this a lot that I've known that I have this internal stop-clock, of when I'm not going to be physically independent, anymore. Even within the last year, even when people don't see me, for a few weeks, they notice differences. And I don't know what's worse. Having your life changed in one moment, or knowing where your physical limitations or independence is headed, and watching my mother lose some of that independence, and the pain, and the surgeries? But instead of taking that as a downfall, or being scared, I'm trying to turn it around, as I'm going to do everything, I possibly can, to live the best life that I can, and try to inspire as many people, while doing so, in the process.",
