Happy Friday, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, 2:00 a.m. in California. There's new trouble for the president's son. Hunter Biden now facing a second criminal case this morning with nine tax charges brought by special counsel David Weiss. The 56-page indictment filed in California alleges Hunter schemed to evade at least $1.4 million in federal taxes from 2016 to 2019. And instead, he spent his money on drugs, escorts, girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing -- so basically everything but his taxes. If convicted in a tax case, Hunter could face up to 17 years in prison. Let's bring in civil rights attorney Areva Martin. Areva, good morning to you. Thanks very much for being here. What stands out to you about this case? AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR:  Good morning, Kasie. I think what stands out to me the most is the charges in this new 56- page indictment are similar to if not the same charges that we've learned about earlier this summer that were going to be a part of a plea deal that was going to be entered into by Hunter Biden, but we know that federal judge derailed that plea agreement when questions were asked about some of the fine print in that agreement. So here we are now with the same charges about tax evasion being brought in this very, very serious indictment after clearly no agreement could be reached between Hunter Biden and the special counsel assigned to this matter.",

I mean, it strikes at the heart of his brand, both as a business person and business mogul, but also what he has staked his career on as a political leader. I mean, he is running for president. We saw in 2016 and 2020 and now the third time that he is running that he talks about his businesses and his success as a real estate mogul a lot on the trail. So that is something that he cares deeply about.The other thing is that, you know, increasingly over the last several months now, Donald Trump's campaign has really merged his legal strategy with his political strategy. We've seen over the course of the summer when he was indicted four different times that he's been enjoying a fund raising boost, polling boost. And what is really interesting, you know from my conversations with Trump's team that there was a concern at one point sure, they are seeing a boost in the polls, boost in donations in the immediate term, but will that -- will that boost continue. And I think that they have kind of seen it has. So what they have done is lean into the messaging. Of course you are hearing his lawyers say, we don't want him to take the stand and testify. But the political part of it actually lends good optics for the campaign.",

This time, he's going to be in the driver's seat. He's going to be answering questions from his own defense attorneys, very carefully crafted questions I'm told.But look, I think that it will be a lot of, you know, political speech again. We saw last month the judge and him clash very heavily because Donald Trump wasn't answering questions directly. He was trying to give political speeches. A lot of what you've heard from rallies where he is railing against the judge, railing against the attorney general in New York who has brought this case forward. And again, that was when he was being questioned by the prosecution. So I think on Monday when he has the opportunity to speak and being asked by his own lawyers, I think that you're going to see, you know, a lot more open reign for Donald Trump to make those kinds of statements. And, of course, he's going to be very defensive. I remember when I was speaking with his lawyers when he was testifying last month, they said he's going to be defiant. He wants to push back on this. And you did see that. You know, Donald Trump pleaded (ph) between the courtroom and camera outside, always knows which camera is where, and where to look at --",

And also allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. We've seen the secretary travel multiple times to Israel to meet top leaders, including Benjamin Netanyahu and in each of those meetings, most recently last week, he has called for Israel to take additional steps to make sure civilians are safe. And he has made clear that the U.S. does not want to see the current offensive being carried out in the south prosecuted in the same way that Israel carried out it offensive in the north. He wants to see specific actions taken to ensure that civilians are safe, that they have somewhere within Gaza that they can go to, to ensure take they will not be hurt, they will not be killed as forces are carrying out this offensive. Now, this is going to be a key topic of conversation as Blinken meets with his Arab counterparts here in Washington today. This is something that we've seen sharp divides between the U.S. and the region on the -- U.S. has not called for a ceasefire, it continues to not call for a ceasefire, but he has urged these humanitarian pauses. We've seen the Arab leaders speak out sharply against the Israel offensive and for the need for unlimited humanitarian aid to get into Gaza and they also want to see a ceasefire now -- Kasie.",

Police say a 28-year-old man is under arrest after firing off two shots from a shotgun in front of temple Israel in Albany, New York, on the first night of Hanukkah. Officials are investigating the incident as a hate crime. Michigan school shooter Ethan Crumbley will be sentenced today for killing four students and wounding seven at Oxford High School in 2021. He pleaded guilty to murder and terrorism charges and he faces life in prison. It's first case in the country where a school shooter was convicted of terrorism. The House voted on to censure Democratic Congressman Jamaal Bowman for pulling a fire alarm in a Capitol Hill office building as lawmakers scrambled to pass a funding bill in September.
