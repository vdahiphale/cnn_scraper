Tonight, another round of relentless Russianattacks on southern Ukraine as officials say sites linked to grain shipments were hit. Then, Europe's blistering heat wave continues. Greece braces for even higher temperatures as devastating wildfires continue to burn. I will be speaking to the country's environment minister in just a moment. Plus, the Women's Football World Cup officially kicks off. We'll have all the latest action from down under. But first, tonight, it is about 9:00 p.m. or so in Ukraine. And as darkness falls, the city of Odesa is bracing for more Russian attacks. The key port has been battered by strikes for three straight nights. Emergency crews have been racing to douse the flames. Officials said earlier today that sites linked to grain shipments were hit and at least, one person, a security guard was killed. Russia says this is a retaliation for Ukrainian attack on a bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland, the Kerch Bridge. Russian missiles also slammed into another city in the south, that's Mykolaiv. Authorities there say at least, two people were killed and more than a dozen hurt. Ukrainians are again calling for more weapons, especially air defenses. They say they only downed a quarter of cruise missiles overnight. Meanwhile, video out of Belarus purports to show Wagner mercenaries training with Belarusian special forces, just miles from the border with NATO member, Poland. The Poles say they are monitoring the situation and have an ongoing military operation of their own. Let's get the very latest from our Fred Pleitgen. And Fred, this plea for more weapons, specifically air defenses for its southern region --",

      "sentences": "Yes, Mykolaiv, Odesa, the entire southern region is a pretty important key ports there as well, Isa, and I think you're absolutelyright, that it's absolutely no surprise that the Ukrainians are calling for more air defenses, because the Russians really did hit those regions hard. In fact, the mayor of the town of Odesa said that the last couple of nights have been going on there, is something that, that town simply has not seen since the war, since Russia's big invasion of Ukraine has started. And I think, one of the things that the Ukrainians are saying, look, the Russians are not only attacking with some of the cruise missiles they've been using in places like Kyiv and other places as well, they are using some of the heaviest stuff that they have. You look, for instance, at the Oniks anti-ship missile. That is a very powerful coastal defense weapons. I've seen those in Russia, it's part of the bastion coastal defense system, that has a massive warhead and is used to destroy warships. And they apparently use that on some of those port facilities in Odesa. You look, for instance, at the KH-22 as well with a gigantic warhead of about a 1,000 kilograms, that is designed to destroy aircraft carriers. So that specifically is what the Ukrainians, today in the forum of the spokesman for the Air Force, came out and said, look, we simply don't have the means down in Odesa to take those things down. And hence, you're seeing statistics like the one that you were pointing out, where the Ukrainians are saying that they were only able to take out about 25 percent of the cruise missiles that were fired at Odesa overnight. Of course, that also has to do with the fact that a lot of those Shahed drones, those drone swarms were sent as well, that Ukraine is all set to take out. So this was a huge barrage and the Ukrainians are saying they need more in the way of air defense if they are going to come to terms with that. Right now, they simply don't have enough, specifically down in that southern region, Isa.",

They are even stronger due to the extreme weather conditions. We have a lot of heat waves, one has just passed, and there were -- there was a lot of wind after that. And we are getting into a second heat wave in the next ten days. It's a very warm July, not only in Greece, but I think globally, it's a very warm July. Climate crisis is here.

We don't know an indictment is coming for sure, but Trump says his special counsel has notified him that he's a target of this investigation and has until today if he chooses to testify. Trump has already been indicted, if you remember, in two separate cases. An unprecedented situation, of course, for a former U.S. President who is actively campaigning for the White House again. I want to bring in CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz for more. So, Katelyn, all eyes then on this federal grand jury meeting in Washington. What are you hearing from your sources about what may happen today, and whether a possible indictment may come today? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, the indictment could come at anytime that he grand jury is meeting. Now, it depends on the Justice Department's decision-making, their sense of timing, now that they have notified Donald Trump he is a target of this investigation. The very likely already have a good sense of the case they want to bring before the grand jury for approval. And so, in this investigation, the grand jury, they are gathered today, but from what we know from our sources, is that they are still at work. Their work is confidential, and they have been working for months and months bringing in witnesses, hearing testimony, they even heard from former Vice President Mike Pence and some of the top advisors around Donald Trump previously. But today, they're hearing from at least, two people. One of them was a personal aide to Donald Trump, also had worked in the White House. He had testified before, so, was coming back potentially as what you would call a cleanup witness or something, to flush out a part of this story. But we really just don't know exactly when the indictment will come, and how much of a breath it would have to capture what happened after the 2020 election and leading up to end on January 6th. We know that Trump is facing some pretty serious possible charges that the grand jury could approve, but we just don't know the meat of what will happen here. And so, here at this courthouse today, the grand jury, they are still meeting as far as we can tell.

That is just not something that would be within Trump's nature as far as we know of him. And so, in the Florida case, the federal case against him related to documents he retained at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency, and then in this January 6 proceeding that may emerge from the courthouse, there's just a lot of legal work to be done. And so, the January 6 side of things, there had been lawyers that were working on that for several months doing proceedings inside this building, all kinds of witness discussions, making sure they had a good handle on what was going on in the investigation.

The Ukraine foreign ministry went on to accuse Russia of trying to increase world food prices through its withdrawal from the Black Sea grain initiative. What will be the impact then, on the global food supply, I want to get our guest for that. Joining us now is Matthew Hollingworth, the WFP Ukraine representative. Matthew, really appreciate you being with, us this evening on the show.

It there's 345 million people living in severe food insecurity right now. So that should not be underestimated. The second thing obviously is the impact globally, sorry, on the food prices and availability. We have seen an 8 percent rise on both sides of the Atlantic, in the last 24 hours on the price of, wheat that is going to hit a lot of poorer people around the, world in their pocket. It will mean global food insecurity, if those prices stick. And if they stick at that level. Obviously, what worries me, as the representative here inside Ukraine, is the devastating impact on the farming economy of this country. It's 15 percent farmers or 15 percent of the employment workforce of this country, if they don't, farm if there is no incentive to farm, because they cannot get their produce, to market, then it's going to have a long-lasting impact on this, nation as well as the rest of the.
