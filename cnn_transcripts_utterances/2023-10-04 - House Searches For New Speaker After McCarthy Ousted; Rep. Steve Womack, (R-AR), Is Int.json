Already, two declared candidates in the race, Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader, as well as the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, meeting with their colleagues and trying to secure commitments, suggesting to them that they could unite this badly divided Republican Conference. But the question is, can they get there? There is ample anger still at those eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy and at Congressman Matt Gaetz, even as some calls within the GOP to boot him out of the House Republican Conference altogether. Those are still coming in questions about how that will play out.But as we are hearing from Republicans on both sides of the Capitol concerned that the events of yesterday could undercut their ability to govern and raise serious questions about their ability to hold onto the control of the House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): You've got eight people over there that say they stand on principle and policy and it's really all about, you know, self-promotion. It's beyond frustrating. I would have a hard time actually saying they're true Republicans. They're about promoting themselves. They're Republicans by name and registration only.

Now, behind the scenes, Jake, there is debate within the Republican Conference about how to go forward and whether or not can maintain that rule to allow one individual member to seek a speaker's ouster. Many members want the next speaker candidate to declare that is off the table, that they will change that rule, raise the threshold for calling for such a vote. That is not what the hardliners in the conference want. They want to maintain that issue.And also, Jake, a question about how they'll deal with some key policy issues.

In fact, the only evidence we've seen of any work going on right now among House Republicans is that acting House Speaker Republican Congressman Patrick McHenry kicked out two senior Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, from their honorary offices inside the Capitol.

That's the freight train I'm talking about right here. Five and a half weeks to handle an issue that was already wildly contentious that set the stage for exactly what has happened now. And you would have to navigate all of this with all the same people and a new speaker in place, figuring out how to do it.Now, yes, as you point out, they do have a speaker pro tem.

No House speaker means no additional money for the war torn country, at least for now. And once a new speaker is chosen, it's unclear if that person will support Ukraine at all. One contender, Congressman Jim Jordan, as you heard from Manu, already has suggested it will not be first on his list of priorities at all. And it's not just Jordan. Ukraine's allies are worried that any speaker candidate will be pressured into ditching Ukraine aid as a condition of their colleagues' support, especially those in the MAGA caucus.

In fact, we were in one battle where the Ukrainians were using a lot of ammo that we know is western ammo to try and push the Russians back. And just earlier today, Jake, I was at an artillery position that the Ukrainians are using and they had a western supplied howitzer and American supplied ammunition.And they told us that ammunition is extremely scarce already. They said at this current rate right now, for every shot that the Ukrainians can fire, the Russians can fire 10. And so obviously they understand that if there's any sort of holdups, any sort of delays in further U.S. aid, that situation is going to become a lot worse as they're trying to support the Ukrainian troops that are currently trying to advance. Now, one of the things that we do know is that for things like artillery, ammunition, howitzer ammunition, there are other NATO countries that can make up for some of those shortfalls if bad comes to worse. But there's also other things that only the United States can supply. If we look, for instance, at ammunition for the HIMARS, those multiple rocket launching system, but also the surface to air missile systems that the U.S. has provided to Ukraine, any sort of ammo for that rockets for that has to come from the United States, Jake.",

It's thousands of rifles, most probably some sort of model of the AK47. But one of the things that we picked up on as went through that list and of course, CNN was the first to report on that is that there's also antitank guided missiles that are part of that as well. Seems as though it's 70 of those, which doesn't seem like a lot.But of course, at the current rate that the Ukrainians are using these things, it's definitely something that could also make a difference as well.

I just co- hosted an event two months ago for Republicans on behalf of the speaker, it was a very successful event, and one of the things that I found very interesting among some of the participants there, some of them were not even conservatives, but they liked McCarthy, particularly from a business perspective. And I'm not certain if some of the other names we've heard thus far will be able to have that gravitas.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, listen, and I think that was part of Kevin McCarthy's appeal, right? He seemed sort of like a standard issue moderate chamber of commerce Republican, right? He, of course, had his appeal to folks like Marjorie Taylor Greene and his way of being MAGA and going to genuine flex before Donald Trump, but at the same time, just the sort of establishment wing of the party liked him. You saw, obviously, a lot of moderates back him as well. And so I think a question is, does he sort of stay in that role? Some people are like, does he retire? Does he stay? Sounds like he's going to have a very big office, Nancy Pelosi's old office.
