According to FlightAware, the airline has only canceled 40 flights today.That is far less than half of today's total cancellations and far less than what they canceled earlier in the week -- or earlier in the week they were canceling thousands of flights per day. And at one point, it was making up as many as 90 percent of all canceled flights in the U.S. Now that we're on the other side of that Christmas Arctic blast, what will the last day of 2022 bring? CNN's meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, is here with all the details. Allison, what can we expect for our New Year's Eve celebrations?",

Revelers will need to bundle up and wear a coat to the big bash in Times Square. But with the festivities returning to full capacity for the first time in two years, New Yorkers are not going to let a little rain put a damper on their fun. CNN's national correspondent, Gloria Pazmino, is there. Gloria, what is the deal with New Year's Eve in the next 48 hours? How are preparations going?",

I've been watching all morning, all day all these people that are trying to set up the stage and the barricades.And all of the throngs of people walking through Times Square right now will seem like just a couple of people compared to the amount of crowds that will be here tomorrow. Now, you were talking about the rain and the weather. And you did say New Yorkers will not let that dampen the party. But I do have to give everybody a warning. If you are coming here tomorrow, you cannot bring an umbrella. No umbrellas, no backpacks, no large items, no chair, no blankets. All of that is part of the security measures that the NYPD is putting into place to make sure that this event goes off without a hitch, that it's safe, and that everybody can enjoy what is really a unique experience, a unique way to bring in the New Year. The ball has been tested. It came down just as it was supposed to do. More than 11,000 pounds of Waterford crystal on that ball. And tomorrow, a ton of confetti will fall on revelers as they ring in 2023 -- Abby?",

Their conversation comes just hours after Russia unleashed dozens more missile strikes on Ukraine, many of them hitting critical infrastructure. This video here posted on social media claims to be a Kharkiv power plant set ablaze after being struck. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Kyiv. Ben, Ukraine says it has shot down 16 Russian drones overnight. What can you tell us about that?",

He's a CNN military analyst and former commanding general of the U.S. Army, Europe, and Seventh Army. General Hertling, thank you for being here. You heard the reports that China is now vowing more political cooperation with Russia. But I think the big question that looms over all of this is that, will they try to creep into military cooperation? What do you see coming down the road here? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I don't see that happening, Abby. Certainly, Mr. Putin is attempting to shore up his partnership with President Xi. But I think President Xi a long time ago realized this mission is making Russia and Mr. Putin a pariah on the world stage. They have promised cooperation, political cooperation in the official statement. But as you saw, Mr. Putin was pressing it a little bit, saying, hey, we want military cooperation. So I'm sure there was an attempt to trade energy sources for some type of either ammunition or military equipment back from China. I'm not sure Mr. Putin is going to get that from the alpha male in this particular relationship. Mr. Putin is seen as the lesser of the two partners in this new China/Russia relationship.",

Ukraine says that their defenses have shot down the vast majority of the missiles in this Russian barrage overnight, 16 Iranian-made drones, and as you heard Ben say, many, many more in the day before. The U.S. is working now to stop the transfer of these drones from Iran to Russia. Do you think that that will be successful? How will that even be done?",

      "sentences": "That would be very challenging, Abby. And I think it's because you sometimes just don't stop another nation from transferring equipment to their partner or ally. And that's exactly what Iran is doing.There certainly could be sanctions, additional sanctions placed against Iran. But remember, we've got some dealings with Iran, too. We're trying to get some things from them in terms of improved relationship. So it's going to be very challenging to do that. The truth of the matter is, Russia is attempting to gain partners with different countries, who have different types of ammunition that they can help supply this war. And I think Mr. Putin is realizing that he's quickly running out of the kinds of munitions he needs to continue this fight. And we're seeing Ukraine be very successful. And I'm glad Ben pointed out that that massive strike was on Thursday. The additional drones that came in, Iranian drones that came in this morning that were repelled by the Ukrainian forces was the secondary strike. We're seeing, you know, as we monitor the types of missiles that are coming into Ukraine from Russia, there are days when it seems like a massive strike and then there's a few days where there's lesser strikes. And that is just an indicator that Russia cannot sustain these kinds of attacks. And even passing them out throughout the entire country, they're not amassing their ballistic missiles in any one area. They're just trying to create more terror and harm to the civilian population within Ukraine.",
