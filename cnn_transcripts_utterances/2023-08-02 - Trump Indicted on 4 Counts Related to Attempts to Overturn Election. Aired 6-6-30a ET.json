The First Amendment does not cover everything that may come out of a person's mouth. And one of the clear delineations is fraud. If you use words to steal something -- to steal money from a bank, to rip off an investor -- how do you do that? You do that with words, by speech, by promising things. That's fraud.

I am a little skeptical that they are, that they're going to take the time to really understand all the elements that happened across these months in the leadup to January 6th and even after January 6th. And especially, because I want to talk about something that Alayna said about the Trump campaign's argument around election interference. Because when we're talking about the heart of the matter, which is about democracy and protecting democracy and that this -- what Trump did threatened it. Him, again, saying that this is election interference, in 2024, is potentially leading us down a dangerous road again.",

We're replaying the same script. That's why this goes much bigger than partisan politics. To your point, we shouldn't retreat to partisan trenches. There are a lot of Republicans who are persuadable. They should read this document. If you're a self-styled patriot, and you have the obligation of self-government, then read this document, because this is something the Founding Fathers would have feared in a fundamental way: a sitting president trying to overturn an election on the basis of a lie.",
