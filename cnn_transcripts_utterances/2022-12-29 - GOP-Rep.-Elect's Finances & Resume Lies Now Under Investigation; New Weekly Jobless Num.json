Fabrications previously unreported.Now, first Santos claims that he attended an elite New York City private school called Horace Mann Prep. He said he had to leave when his family's real estate assets fell on hard times. But that claim is false. According to the school district, they have no evidence that he attended their school. Santos also says he represented Goldman Sachs at a financial conference. He says he spoke out there at that conference against the company for investing in renewables. That is also false. As we previously covered, he did not ever work at Goldman. And there's no record of him appearing on a panel there. But also no record of him even attending that conference that he claims he spoke at. There are also new additional false claims he's made about his family history. Santos said that his mother had a historically Jewish last name. But genealogists found -- that CNN worked with, found no evidence of that name, no evidence of Jewish or Ukrainian heritage at all in his family tree. The scrutiny intensifying around him, all the while it is notable it has been absolutely complete silence from Republican leaders on the Hill -- Abby?",

Errol, you are the guru of New York politics and interviewed Santos twice now. Or I'm sorry, you've interviewed Santos now once. Two investigations are now under way. What do you think is the biggest risk to him from a legal perspective?",

      "sentences": "Well, the two areas that you talked about are going on.There's a third investigation going on, Abby, as well by the state attorney general, who said she was looking into some things. Based on the jurisdiction of the state attorney general, it's likely that it involves George Santos' claim to have run a pro pet or pet rescue charity for which he publicly raised money. And there's no particular record of that charity actually existing and it's unclear what happened to the money. So he's got three different law enforcement agencies looking into his past. All of these are going to be real big trouble for him because any one of them could lead to serious criminal penalties or civil penalties, which could, you know, really persuade the House to take action. That would be really adverse action. As you mentioned, he is likely to be seated when the time comes next week. On the other hand, his life as a congressman, his career as a congressman could be very circumscribed and ultimately terminated if any of these legal claims turn out to work against him?",

I mean, on social media, people are showing posts where he claimed that his mother died in 9/11.And then there's another post saying he misses her because she died in 2016. It's unclear what we're going to find out. There's going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of contradictory statements. But to be fair about it, Abby, whether Republican leadership speaks out or not, members of Congress do not have the power to simply stop him from being sworn in. This has been litigated. It went all the way up to the Supreme Court in the 1960s. If he meets the basic requirements, meaning he's at least 25 years old, has lived in the country for -- been a citizen for at least seven years, and lives in the state where he wants to represent his district, there's nothing that they can do to stop him from being seated. They can expel him with a two-thirds vote but that's a big task and that's a little further down the road.",

And even a third Republican who also won. Part of what happened in New York was that Republicans did quite well in some of the down-state seats.All three of them said they want answers. The chairman of the Republican Party for Nassau County, his home county, has said he wants some answers. He's not happy about any of this. So people are distancing themselves. Again, they can't stop him necessarily but they can certainly pressure him. They can shame him. They can demand answers, which he ultimately is going to have to provide if not to his political colleagues, then certainly under oath to the law enforcement entities that are looking into his past.",

Almost exactly where claims were a year ago. And this is a sign that a lot of companies, they don't want to let go of the workers they have because they're worried that they won't be able to get new ones. And claims are still well below the level that would cause economists to be alarmed about a recession. In fact, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, thinks jobless claims are, quote, \"one reason to be optimistic that this economy can skirt a recession.\" That's because, if layoffs stay low, consumers can keep spending and consumer spending is the main engine of this economy. One thing to keep an eye on is continuing claims. That is how many people are filing for unemployment on an ongoing basis. That did tick up to a 10-month high, a sign hiring has slowed down. But, Abby, there's nothing in today's numbers that screams out imminent recession. That's good news.",

It doesn't take much to move it up or down, either direction.Despite the big gains today, though, markets are still deeply in the red for the year. The S&amp;P 500, it's down by about a fifth so far this year. The NASDAQ has lost a third of its value. Those are big losses. This would actually be by far the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008. And some of the household tech names, they've lost just staggering amounts in their market value. Tesla also $800 billion in market value down this year. Alphabet, Amazon, more than $800 billion. Apple, more than $900 billion. Now, clearly investors are worried about next year. They're worried about the economy and worried about the Fed and what it's doing to fight inflation. But, Abby, thankfully, this year is almost over for the stock market. We start with a clean slate next week. And if investors end up being too pessimistic here, right, if the economy can avoid a recession, if the Fed can chill out with some of these massive interest rates hikes, then maybe markets could rebound early next year.",

And they say that he is absolutely, they say, \"lucid and vigilant.\"So this update, Abby, compared to what we heard yesterday, seems to me to want to calm some of the concern that was raised yesterday about his deteriorating health. At the same time, of course, we're still talking about a 95-year-old man who is frail and in deteriorating health. But we are in this position now, Abby, of waiting because it seems that, as anybody knows whose dealt with an elderly person, sometimes there are ups and downs in the decline. So, we are waiting for further updates. But certainly this one today, Abby, suggests that the pope emeritus is doing OK -- Abby?",
