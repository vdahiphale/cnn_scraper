And part of that is undoubtedly that 18- to 29-year-olds, that category that we measure is young voters are very energized. The use of social media in this campaign is very sophisticated so far and we can expect that mobilization to be significant. But, you know, whether we are talking about the economy, inflation, job creation, none of it matters at the aggregate level.

TheTrump administration attempted some of the most monstrous policies we've ever seen at the southern border. I'm thinking most specifically of separating families, separating parents and children in an effort to discourage other families from coming in the first place. That was in 2018. In 2019, you had the largest number of border arrivals in years. I think ultimately, what allowed the Trump administration to sort of claim success at the southern border. insofar as they felt like they had stemmed the tide of arrivals, was a combination of things, but a big factor in all of it was the pandemic. And so, you know, that was a very unique historical circumstance. I think what has really troubled their case against the current administration is the fact that in the last year, the Biden administration has, I think, really kind of pivoted much more forcefully on the border issue. And as you know, the Biden administration has backed this Senate negotiation, a bipartisan Senate negotiation that was basically willing to really substantially overhaul how asylum worked at the southern border. And it was written by one of the most conservative members of the Senate. And what happened was, as this bill emerged in February of this year, Republicans got word from Trump himself that he wanted them to sabotage the deal because it was such a potent campaign issue for him. And so, the Democrats ever since essentially pitched themselves as the party that's actually willing to be tough and practical at the southern border when it comes to asylum and these issues. While the Republicans are just demagoguing on the issue and are nihilistic about that kind of broader values and policy stakes that they're just in it for the cynicism. And I think the Republicans, in that sense, have an uphill battle in actually proving that they substantially care about the issue.",

      "sentences": "I think the vice president is sort of launching herself as a presidential nominee at an interesting moment in the arc of the Bidenadministration's sort of evolving approach to immigration and the border. The administration has kind of hit a sweet spot, rhetorically anyway, also in terms of policy, but they've managed now to have a kind of theory of the case that they can articulate to the public. The theory of the case is this. We have to be much tougher on asylum seekers when they are crossing in between ports of entry at the southern border. In other words, when they're crossing irregularly or illegally, when they're not presenting themselves at ports of entry. So, for those people, we need to really bar asylum. But at the same time, what the administration has said is, OK, we're not closing the door on people in desperate need to arrive -- to come into the United States, we're creating other legal channels for them to do so. And so, at ports of entry, for example, they're creating appointments using an app that allow people to schedule the actual date and time of their arrival at the southern border, so it's more orderly and manageable when they arrive. The administration's created a parole program which is very substantial and very significant in which they basically allow, you know, 30,000 migrants a month to actually come into the country if they have a sponsor in the United States. Now, this program right now is being held up but it has been in effect for the last several -- last couple of years, and the effects have been significant. The number of arrivals from these countries that have been covered by these policies at the southern border, have dropped by 90 percent as a result of the administration creating other legal avenues for people to enter the country. And so, Kamala Harris inherits this thinking, this way of organizing the issue, which I actually think is quite intuitive to people. The idea of look, we have to be tough at the southern border. We have to be orderly, but we have to also create other avenues for people to enter legally. I think that's actually a fairly compelling argument, and I think it's one that she can make and the one that she has made. And then, coupled with all of that is the fact that Republicans tanked this bipartisan border bill earlier in the year. And so, Democrats now also have the claim that, look, we want to deal with this issue, they don't.",

So, for example, you know, you write about deportations and what that actually ended up doing to gang violence in those countries, which sort of goes back into feeding that cycle, which is when you create more unsafe and unstable places, people have a tendency to want to leave those places towards safety, which might be the U.S. border, right?",

You know, I think it's important to take these people at their word when they speak this way, I feel conflicted as someone who spends a lot of time covering immigration policy because I can think in my head immediately of all the complicating factors, all the resource constraints, all of the kind of agency and institutional hold ups. Some of the legal challenges that would obviously arise if the administration were to pursue some of these policies. So, I don't think it's a clear outcome. It's hard to know exactly what this would look like. But the fact that this is such a fundamental view of Trump and of the people in his orbit, I think has to be reckoned with because you have such a large undocumented population United States. Immigration enforcement actually has a lot of discretion in terms of who the government goes after. And one of the things that you see, particularly from the sort of second half of the Obama years on, among Democrats, is a desire to exercise much more discretion in who the government targets for arrest if they're here without legal status. I think the scariest thing about a Trump administration, particularly a Trump administration 2.0, so to speak, is that there would be no priorities for who the government targets for arrest. So, it would be a free for all. And I think that's a very scary prospect because it means that anyone could be targeted. And it certainly means that racial profiling is a key part of what immigration enforcement increasingly looks like. And so, right now, agencies like ICE have a few kinds of guiding principles, for instance, for places where they can't make immigration arrests, schools, hospitals, churches. I think that stuff would be thrown right out the window. The idea that there are kind of mitigating factors for, you know, how to consider someone's immigration case if they've got family that depends on them, if they've been here for a long time, that stuff would be thrown right out the window. So, I think the kind of randomness that everyone would have to look over their shoulder because the government would be coming after them kind of randomly and, you know, in any way is, I think, something to be reckoned with. And among the scariest are some of the plans that you've heard Trump allies and Trump himself tease about almost -- I mean, I don't know how to describe it, military involvement in the wider region to try to stem the flow of migration. I mean, there is a lot of talk in Trump's inner circle about military incursions into Mexico. I don't even know what this looks like. I mean, this is an outlandish prospect, but it gets talked about enough, I think, for us to actually have to pay heed. And this is something that came up during the first term. I think it was Mike Pompeo in his memoir, describe it, there wasn't a day that went by which Trump didn't ask him, you know, how do we fare in a war against Mexico? I mean, that is an absolutely lunatic notion, but that is tied to this great obsession with immigration enforcement.",

So, you know, I went in for preventive surgery to basically get a hysterectomy because I had a 40 percent chance of getting ovarian cancer. And they found out that I did have ovarian cancer and I didn't -- wasn't feeling anything. I mean, that's why this ovarian cancer is so insidious and so sneaky because you don't feel anything. But I was stage one. I was lucky. So, I went in, had the hysterectomy. They had to go in more to see if it had spread. It hadn't spread. So, I had my chemotherapy. And unbeknownst to me, two years later, Christiane, it returned into my pelvic area. So, I had to go through the whole thing again, the surgery and chemo. And meanwhile, Martina was fighting her own battles with breast cancer twice, I believe, and throat cancer. And so, we were going through -- you know, she was going through radiation and chemo, I was going through chemo, but we were staying in touch and just thinking about how ironic our life has been, where things are happening to us, the same things are happening to us simultaneously and that's really how we got so close.",
