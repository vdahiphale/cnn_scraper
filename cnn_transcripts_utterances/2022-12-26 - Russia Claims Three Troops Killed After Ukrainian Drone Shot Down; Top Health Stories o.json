What the Ukrainians have demonstrated of irrespective of the pounding that Russia has been giving Ukraine and its people, is they are standing up and they're going to celebrate at this time of the year. I mean, it is absolutely magnificent and unsurprising.It is all about morale and how you feel about yourself, how you feel about your country. This is about sovereignty. This is about independence. This is about staring down an autocracy that is completely out of bounds, completely corrupt. This is what will change the dynamic going forward. There will be more suffering, let's be frank.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  2022 was a year where we began to really see the ripple effects of living through a pandemic. So, while it is clear COVID-19 is here to stay, other health issues began to take the spotlight once again. And some of it is very good news starting with number ten of our top health stories. More people are surviving cancer than ever before in the United States. In the past three years, the number of cancer survivors increased by more than a million. The big reasons why, a continued decline in smoking. And we are catching and treating cancer earlier as well. But there is still more to be done.",

Number nine, a new experimental Alzheimer's drug called Lecanemab appears to be one of the first to slow the progression of cognitive decline. Now, the MAB stands for monoclonal antibody. Lecanemab works by removing amyloid plaques from the brain. The buildup of this naturally occurring protein can block neuro pathways make it a hallmark of Alzheimer's. Researchers found that the drug eventually helped reduced amyloid levels and slowed cognitive decline by 27 percent. DR.

Inflation is starting to cool off and consumers are becoming more confident about the state of the economy. Investors are now looking ahead to new housing and jobs data that is due out later this week. Joining me now to talk about all of it, CNN Economics and Political Commentator Catherine Rampell. Catherine, great to see you, good morning. All year, we've heard economists dreading a recession, and as we look to 2023, are there reasons to be more optimistic, do you think or not?",

We still have financial conditions tightening because of the Fed's decision to raise interest rates to combat inflation. We still have major disruptions in global commodity markets, including the energy markets. All of those kinds of things and continuing on uncertainty over COVID lockdowns in China amongst other issues mean that there are still some dark clouds on the horizon.That said, we have gotten some more comforting data recently, including the fact that inflation has been cooler certainly than it had been earlier this year, and cooler, in fact, than many people expected. That is good news both for consumers who are weary about paying higher prices as well as the Federal Reserve, which may, as a result, not have to raise interest rates quite as aggressively as they might otherwise. I think they're still going to continue raising interest rates.",

That doesn't mean the prices are going to go down, to be clear. It just means that they're going to rise a little more slowly than they had been doing in the past. It is hard to wrap your head around. But, basically, the idea is the car is still going forward. It is moving forward at a slower pace than it was in the past. It is not in reverse.So, all things considered, it does look like inflation -- the worst of inflation is behind us but we should still anticipate further price growth, including price growth above what is the historical norm. Usually, the Fed wants about 2 percent price growth. We're seeing multiples of that today. We're still going to see it more painful than we would like but not nearly as painful as it had been earlier this year.",

So, if we default on our debt obligations, a number of bad things would happen, including that would probably violate the Constitution, which says that the federal debt shall not be questioned, also potentially seize up financial markets around the world because, essentially, U.S. debt right now is considered the safest of safe places to put your money. And all other financial assets are benchmarked against our safety. If suddenly we reveal that we are not particularly reliable debtor, then that means that you're going to have credit markets or -- excuse me, financial markets around the world have these cascading panic effects, essentially. In short, you could have a global financial crisis as a result of all of this.In addition to sort of more short-term operational problems, like seniors not getting their social security checks, service members not getting paychecks, lots of other bad things happening. None of this would be good. And I'm very worried this could happen next year because we saw -- we saw a kind of brinksmanship about ten years ago and I think, if anything, Republicans have only gotten more serious about threatening default.",
