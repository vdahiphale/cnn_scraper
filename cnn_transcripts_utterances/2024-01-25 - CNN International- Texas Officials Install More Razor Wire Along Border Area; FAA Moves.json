South Korean media are reporting that a member of the country's parliament has been attacked in Seoul, in South Korea, the capital there.She is identified as Bae Hyun-jin, a member of the ruling People Power Party. Media outlets, including CNN affiliate JTBC, say she was hit with an object and taken to hospital. Reports say her life isn't believed to be in danger. Let's bring you up now, up to date, with some of our top stories this hour. Donald Trump is expected to be back in a New York courtroom today. His attorneys say he would like to testify on his own behalf in the defamation case brought against him by writer E. Jean Carroll. Jurors will determine how much in damages he has to pay to Carroll. A separate jury earlier found that Trump sexually assaulted her and is liable for defamation. President Biden has secured a major endorsement from the United Auto Workers Union. The union has more than 400,000 active members, though they can vote for whichever candidate they choose. Earlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. federal government can remove the reams of razor wire that the state of Texas has put up along the U.S. southern border with Mexico. So far, that hasn't happened, though. In fact, Texas state officials are putting up more wire. They want to keep both immigrants and federal border officials out of that area. That leaves desperate asylum seekers trapped, hungry, cold, between a river and the razor wire. Rosa Flores hears more from them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There's a few people back there who are waiting to turn themselves in to U.S. immigration authorities.I spoke to two of them, Kevin and Vanessa. They're both from Venezuela. They're students studying architecture. But they say that they fled Venezuela because they're fleeing the Maduro regime there. They said that they protested against the government in 2019 and that they couldn't live there anymore because the future that Maduro regime there. They said that they protested against the government in 2019 and that they couldn't live there anymore because the future that holds them there is either kidnapping or death because they stood up against the regime. Now, they say that they've been on the banks of the Rio Grande for two days. They say that they haven't eaten for two days and that they literally just had some water because a Texas National Guard member gave them a bottle of water. So, they've had water. But Vanessa has cuts on her legs from the razor wire. She says that she has difficulty walking. And really what they want to do is turn themselves in to U.S. immigration authorities. But you can see that there are several layers of razor wire here. And they're not able to do that. The other problem is that U.S. Border Patrol is not allowed in this area because this is the area that was taken over by the state of Texas. And so, what is unfolding is a humanitarian situation where these two individuals say that they are cold, they are hungry, they want to turn themselves in to immigration authorities. And technically, they are on U.S. soil. The international boundary between Mexico and the United States is in the middle of that river. So, they've been on U.S. soil for two days trying to turn themselves in to immigration authorities. And they have not been able to do that. Now, the future that holds them if they do enter into this park, according to Texas authorities, is they could be arrested because they are two single adults with no children. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. But these are the scenes that we see unfolding here at Shelby Park since the state of Texas took over the area. Rosa Flores, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas.

On Wednesday, the nation's labor unions held a nationwide strike against the policies pushed by President Javier Milei. They include spending cuts and ending some protections for businesses and consumers while making it easier to privatize public companies.The president has made it his priority to tame Argentina's skyrocketing inflation. Some of his reforms have been put on hold by the courts, while others are slowly making their way through Congress. Union members are also on strike in Germany, wreaking havoc on travel plans and supply chains across the country. Today is day two of a nationwide train driver's strike, which is demanding better pay and shorter working weeks from the state-owned rail operator. The company says the protests will cause delays and cancellations across the board, from commuter services to freight transport. Some passengers have mixed feelings about the workers' action.

The planes have been grounded since a door plug blew out in midair on an Alaska Airlines flight earlier this month.

And it's about to be used on someone who actually survived an execution two years ago. Executioners trying for four hours to find his veins for a lethal injection and then they had to stop because the time ran out on the death warrant. Well, Smith originally did ask for the execution method to be nitrogen gas, but then he reversed course after he got a hold of the state's proposal, how this would undergo. And the biggest sticking point is this mask that's going to be put on him, pumping that nitrogen gas. The worries here, according to court documents, is that he might vomit inside of that mask and end up choking on that, which they argue would lead to excessive pain instead of dying from the actual nitrogen gas. Now, I spoke with Reverend Jeff Hood, who is a spiritual advisor of Smith, and he has five children. He says he is worried about his own safety. He had to sign a waiver indicating that he understood the harm in being in the execution chamber with Smith, and he's worried about gas getting out. He had this to say about a safety mechanism that he checked out in person, an O2 monitor that will sound the alarm if there's hazardous gas in the air. Listen. REV. JEFF HOOD, SPIRITUAL ADVISER FOR ALABAMA DEATH ROW INMATE: I was even told today, Isabel, that if the oxygen monitors go off, they are -- they have no sort of requirement that they evacuate the room. So, what we're talking about is people who have put these monitors in place and basically told me today that they have no plan on how to follow them. I don't think that it's alarmist to say that this is a group of people who have consistently failed to carry out executions, and I believe that they are on a fast track to fail again.",

The 19-year-old Gauff has won four of the six previous head-to-head matches against Sabalenka. But Sabalenka, the world number two, didn't drop a set on her way to the semifinals.
