Trump is clearly under investigation here. And what's so significant about this is that Pence has never spoken before. He's clearly the second most important person in the country on January 6th, also became the presiding officer at the U.S. Senate as Donald Trump and his supporters were trying to block the congressional certification of the presidency. And now, Pence is going to have to speak about some of the conversations he had directly with Trump leading up to that day, especially ones where Donald Trump may have been acting corruptly. That's according to the judge in this case. And also we know some of these conversations from other witnesses who have spoken about them are ones where Donald Trump was berating or making fun of Mike Pence in different ways, pressuring him to block the election result in which he was not willing to do. And so it's quite a significant win for the special counsel's investigation. But Pence does have a bit of a carve out here. He's not going to have to speak about the time where he was specifically presiding over the U.S. Senate during that vote, and also we know that this is a resounding loss for Donald Trump, who continues to try and block people's answers before this grand jury by claiming executive privilege. He could not win in that argument either. There is the possibility that there could be appeals.

We found out on Tuesday that $100 billion in deposits were set to leave Silicon Valley Bank on that day, March 9th, but they just did not have the collateral to cover it. And that's why the bank eventually collapsed so quickly.So we're going to hear more of that, perhaps more questions around the partial sale of SVB and the losses that the regulator incurred as a result of that, and more attempts to apportioned blame be it to the bank itself and its mismanagement or the supervisors or the regulators. I think the big question now that this moves to the Republican- controlled House is will we get a sense of their appetite to update or change legislation around bank regulation, as a result of this. It was pretty unclear if you -- if you look at the responses from lawmakers on Tuesday, exactly how the opinion would sort of coalesce around this. Republicans tend to be more in favor of looser regulation, but Senator Elizabeth Warren did survey all of the three regulators and say, look, do you -- are you in favor of tougher bank regulation, and they all said yes.
