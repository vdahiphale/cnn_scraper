It is important to note however, there were no genuine opposition candidates running and that's because while they're dead, jailed or exiled. A defiant Mr. Putin sees another chance for a victory lap later today during a planned rally to mark a decade since Crimea was annexed by Moscow.Let's bring in CNN's Matthew Chance, who's standing by in the Russian capital. Hello to you, Matthew, what more do we hear from Putin during his victory address? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, well, I mean, it was an address that came late last night. And it came on the back of an extraordinary win widely anticipated, as you mentioned, but one which has left Vladimir Putin with a higher proportion of the votes that he's got in any of the four other presidential elections. That is one so far, we're talking about 87 percent of the vote just over that figure, in fact, according to the Central Election Authorities. Putin saying at this victory speech that represented overwhelming support from the Russian public, and he said that it meant that he would do everything he could to push through the grandiose plans that he had for the country. In particular, he mentioned the aims of the special military operation, what the Kremlin and what Putin calls the war in Ukraine, and he said he wanted to bolster the Russian military as well, in the years ahead. There was also a mention, for the first time of Alexei Navalny, the late Russian Opposition Leader by name. Normally Putin doesn't mention the name of Alexei Navalny always refers to him sort of in some other way using euphemisms or something like that. But on this occasion, you know, he was asked about Navalny and he answered specifically using the name. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It was very hard to really, you know, determine what exactly Donald Trump was referencing. We obviously saw the Biden campaign on his remarks, very short after he made them arguing that Donald Trump wants another January 6, that his violent rhetoric is something that voters will reject in November. But this is the type of rhetoric we have become accustomed to with Donald Trump. Remember in 2016, this is the exact type of language he used then, to help propel himself to the White House, the fear mongering, the warning voters of this dark doomsday picture of America if he would not be the one to lead the country again. And that's exactly what we heard from Donald Trump on Saturday. Now as for some of his other remarks, I do want to point out, you know, he spoke about the January those convicted on for their roles on January 6, he called them hostages a term we've heard Donald Trump use repeatedly on the campaign trail. But what was interesting is this time we didn't hear just Democrats criticized his language. We also heard some other Republicans and his former allies say that they were concerned about that language. His former Vice President, Mike Pence came out this weekend arguing that he should not be referring to those convicted for their roles on January 6 as hostages he said that language is concerning. He said it was unacceptable, because especially given the environment right now that we are facing with the war in Israel, with many American hostages still being held in Gaza.

It contains no concessions to democratic priorities -- the pathway to citizenship, the dreamers, those kinds of things. It emphasized only Republican priorities. It was a complete yielding by Democrats and the senate to Republican demands, and yet Trump shut it down.

That Trump's made it pretty clear that his fundraising plan is to vacuum up all the Republican money and concentrated in his own campaign and to pay his own legal bills.

Wade. So what happens down the ballot if you're a Republican member of Congress, trying to defend your record, your votes against the true charge that you are putting in vitro fertilization at risk? Your democratic counterpart has got lots of money from the democratic national organizations. You have none because it's all been vacuumed up to pay Trump's lawyers.",

And this prediction, Trump is going to be back. Remember six years ago when then President Trump traveled to Beijing, Chinese leader Xi Jinping pulled out all the stocks, the lavish state banquet inside the Forbidden City, a first for any U.S. President since 1949, the founding of Communist China.

Did the Biden Administration cross a line when it pressured social media companies to remove misinformation related to COVID-19 and potential foreign interference efforts in the 2020 election? And this case was brought by two states, Missouri and Louisiana,alleging that the Biden Administration violated the First Amendment by encouraging platforms like Facebook and X to remove that type of information, saying that it engaged in illegal coercion of these companies and essentially turning them into government actors. The Biden Administration says, you know what, there's a distinction between persuasion which is what it believes it did and coercion which is prohibited under the First Amendment. And this case could have huge implications not just for elections, but also for public health, for counterterrorism, anytime the U.S. government communicates with social media companies. Now, this has particular significance for this year's elections. Because if the Biden Administration is not allowed to communicate with social media companies about things like foreign interference or election meddling, then that could have a powerful influence on this year's presidential race, which we just heard about and it could affect future races as well. You know if the Supreme Court establishes a new precedent, saying that the U.S. government can't be seen pressuring social media companies on virtually any type of type of content, Amara?",

Their lava first burst through the surface in December, followed by a second eruption in January that destroyed several homes and buildings in the area. A third eruption last month demolished a hot water pipeline and cut off heat to more than 20,000 people. The last few residents of Grindavik who had returned to their homes have been evacuated again. And Icelandic authorities have declared a state of emergency for the area, calling this the most powerful eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula since 2021.
