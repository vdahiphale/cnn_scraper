That anybody who tries to step outside the buildings, there are several buildings that make up the complex that is the Shifa Hospital, anybody stepping outside comes under fire. Now, there are 20,000 people taking refuge in the hospital itself, in addition to the 400 patients that doctors are treating. We understand that the generators that are providing the electricity to the hospital have either run out of fuel or have been damaged by Israeli strikes. As a result, the intensive care unit, the pediatric unit, and oxygen devices are no longer functioning. And basically, what we understand from people in the hospital is that there are 36 babies in the hospital who are being kept alive by manual respirators. So, the staff have to constantly be pumping oxygen and air into the lungs of these 36 babies. Now, staff are utterly overwhelmed at the moment with, in addition to simply the amount of the battle that's raging around the hospital, the lack of supplies, the lack of food, water, electricity. And in addition to that, there are dozens of bodies of people who have been killed that are essentially piled up outside the hospital, but they can't be buried because of the fighting that's going on around it.

One of the groups organizing this told me that they expect around a million. We obviously cannot verify that at this stage, but they are expecting this to be the biggest one yet.The march is set to go down to the south, across the River Thames and culminate at the U.S. Embassy in London. I think that, in itself, a measure of where some of this anger is directed towards Western governments, towards the U.S. for supporting Israel. One of the people we spoke to here saying that they're staggered by the hypocrisy, she said, of Western governments supporting Ukraine at Palestine. So, it's sort of devastating here. Obviously, this protest in itself was incredibly controversial in the lead-up because the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, had wanted to ban it because of it happening on the same day as obviously the 11th of November, the traditional armistice events. And we did see some disruption around where those commemorations are taking place, around at the Cenotaph, which is the memorial where that actually happens, and far-right groups clashing with police. Our team heard a lot of noise on the ground, counter-protesters. And this is really what police have been worried about. Not necessarily the main protest, but other groups splitting off and causing trouble. They've had to make a hundred arrests so far in protest since the October 7th attacks, some of them for hate crimes. So, this is why we see this incredibly increased police presence today.

The preternaturally pro-Israeli frame that President Biden created on October 10, and that powerfully emotional speech in the aftermath of the slaughter and brutality that deeply affected him on October 7th, Hamas terror surge against Israeli civilians, I think the administration started to fill in in response to a humanitarian catastrophe, the exponential number of Palestinian deaths, and the general situation in Gaza.The secretary's comments weren't an observation. Implicit, I suspect, is a warning. Far too many Palestinians being killed implicitly suggests that the Israelis need to fundamentally revise and alter their current strategy. So, I think the pro-Israeli frame still applies. I think it still, in a sense, conveys the message that the administration is prepared to give the Israelis the time, the space, and the support to do what they need to do in Gaza. But as their operational clock is ticking, it's ticking is a much slower pace, Victor, than Biden's political clock Is he under enormous pressure particularly at home from Democrats, basically to Find a way to persuade the Israelis compel them to alter approach.",

What it would take to bring the administration to that position, because let's be clear, a ceasefire right now or in the weeks to come would clearly not only be perceived as a Hamas victory, it would be a Hamas victory.

And we're also told that there's going to be a House Republican conference call at 11But up until this point, Speaker Mike Johnson has been keeping his cards very close to the vest as he weighs this very consequential decision. And the reason for that is because the conference is so divided right now over what path they should pursue. There are moderates and appropriators who are pushing for a more clean stopgap spending bill that would extend funding through either the end of this year or perhaps in early next year. But conservative hardliners are pushing a much more complicated idea that would extend funding for government agencies for various lengths of time, essentially setting up multiple fiscal clips. Now, that option would be dead-on-arrival in the Senate, so would risk a government shutdown, which Speaker Johnson says he absolutely does not want on his watch, but at the same time, he does not want to infuriate his right flank, especially so early on in his tenure. A very familiar dynamic and one that his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, faced as well. Now, I will say that conservative hardliners have signaled they are willing to give a longer leash to Mike Johnson, but no doubt a big moment for the new Speaker that's going to tell us a lot about how he plans to govern.

Now, ESPN Stephen A. Smith, He joined Abby Phillip last night, and said, Michigan deserves a much harsher punishment than just a three-game suspension for Harbaugh. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN A. SMITH, HOST, FIRST TAKE, ESPN: As long as there's an open investigation, devoid of a conclusion by the NCAA and the Big Ten Conference.
