Egyptian authorities had brokered the talks and set out a framework that they thought could be the framework to at least agree the prospect of a ceasefire and hostage exchange of some nature. The details were then going to be thrashed out.Overnight, Saturday into Sunday, it seemed that it was getting close. The Egyptians appeared to indicate they thought it was getting close. The talks didn't conclude Saturday night into Sunday. Late Sunday, the Hamas representatives left Cairo. We understand they've gone to Qatar now for further talks amongst themselves about their position. We know this morning that the Egyptian authorities are saying that they have received from Hamas their response, or overnight at least they received Hamas' response to the proposal which has been passed to the Israeli authorities. We know that the CIA chief Bill Burns went yesterday to Doha in Qatar to meet with the Qatari negotiators, in particular the prime minister who's been leading from the Qatari perspective their efforts to be middlemen to get a negotiated solution. There were reports initially that Bill Burns would then go on to Israel today for meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu. That changed late last night. So at the moment, Egypt has received Hamas' response. They've passed it to the Israelis. Hamas delegation has gone to Qatar. The CIA chief has gone to Qatar. There seem to be a nature of talks directly between the CIA and the Qatari officials in Qatar. Where that leaves a possible trip by the CIA director to Israel is unclear. Where that leaves the overall talks is unclear. It did seem to be relatively close late Saturday, but there seems to be a gap. And if what we're seeing in Rafah is the precursor to a big military operation, it would seem that the talks at this stage have stalled. But we don't know that for sure.",

Daniels is a potential witness for the prosecution, but they've been tight-lipped over who they might call to the stand next. CNN's Zachary Cohen has more on what we can expect as the trial resumes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZACHARY COHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: A new witness will take the stand on Monday when the hush money trial of former President Donald Trump resumes. While it remains unclear who will be called to testify next, we're still waiting to hear from several key witnesses, including the adult actress at the center of the trial, Stormy Daniels, and Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. The trial picks back up after Friday's testimony from one of Trump's former key advisers, Hope Hicks. Hicks sat feet away from Trump as she described the 2016 fallout from the \"Access Hollywood\" tape and the Trump campaign's response to stories about hush money payments. Testimony from Hicks really set the stage for witnesses who have direct knowledge of Trump's alleged role in the scheme to keep Stormy Daniels quiet ahead of the 2016 election. Trump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records, stemming from how he allegedly hid the way Michael Cohen was reimbursed for paying $130,000 to Daniels. Hicks testified last week that she did not believe the story that Cohen had paid the money on his own, and she said that Trump was glad he did not have to deal with the stories about hush money payments coming out until after the 2016 election. Now, Trump White House aides, Trump Organization employees, Daniels and Michael Cohen are all still on deck for prosecutors to call. Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It doesn't seem that Americans are riveted enough on the details that individual days of testimony are really going to move the needle much in the presidential election. But when we get to the finish line, we do have polling suggesting that there are a fair number of voters who understandably would have hesitations about electing to the nation's chief law enforcement office someone who has been a convicted felon. Now, whether that plays out in the end, whether he is convicted and whether voters will respond if they do, if he is, we don't know. But that, I think, is more likely to be the impact than kind of movement around the individual days of testimony, as compelling as some of them have been, like Hope Hicks last week.",

They passed a series of bills with no more than two or three members voting no on some very polarizing, controversial issues.There's been nothing like that in these two years. And I think, obviously, as you know, the Democrats are not going to allow her to remove the speaker, particularly because he kind of stepped up and did what the bipartisan coalition in the Senate had done earlier in terms of aid to Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan. But I think this is just a very clear signal of what might be out there again if Republicans win another narrow majority in 2025. Don't forget the last two houses, the majority party has only had a four or five seat majority, historically narrow divisions. And this may be more of a kind of a preview of the future, particularly on the Republican side.",

And that means into his consciousness, I think, has to be the awareness that he is picking the person who would be the frontrunner to succeed him, whether or not he wins in 2024. And I have to imagine that might change the calculation a little bit. And there aren't that many choices that give him an enormous electoral advantage. Maybe Marco Rubio or Tim Scott to help him with the inroads he's already achieved in early polling among non-white men. But if he's thinking about if he's, in fact, committing to only running for one term and, you know, of course, we would see if he wins, that might lead him more to figures like, say, J.D. Vance, who has been in a state that he should win. Trump should be able to win on his own, but who he might feel more comfortable as a designee for the next generation of MAGA. So we'll see where he goes. But I thought that was an intriguing, perhaps, indication of some of the considerations that he may be pondering as he weighs this decision.",

Every stream, every dam and every river is overflowing across the country.And sometimes it makes travel difficult. Like you see in this case, this is a road that the water is flowing through there. There is a tunnel across the road on the other side, but that's partially clogged. That's why the water has made a new path on top of the road. I've just been speaking to a senior police officer who's been here directing traffic, and he says if this continues, this bridge could be swept away. This has happened already in other parts of the country as the number of casualties increases with this flooding going on in different parts of the country and more rainfall expected across the country. We saw dramatic scenes in western Kenya when one of the major rivers there, River Nyando, burst its banks and flooded a major part of the town of Ahero and places around there. People were marooned. The Kenya Wildlife Service having to use helicopters to rescue some people who were marooned and could not get out of there, and that is becoming more common. We've seen similar instances, similar cases in other parts of the country. Like in Kenya's longest and largest river that's also burst its banks, and the government warning people to make sure that they're moving to higher ground in places that are what they call fragile ecosystems to make sure that they don't get swept away by flash flooding. Sometimes the rains come overnight, as happened here, as happened in other parts of the country, when people are asleep, and that can have devastating effects.
