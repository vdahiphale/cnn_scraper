Israel says it's now unleashing a large-scale strike on Hamas, Hamas targets in Gaza, intensifying its air war while it builds up its ground forces while on the border in Gaza.The crisis in Gaza is deepening tonight amid mounting deaths and widespread destruction. Israel vowing to cut off critical supplies to Gaza until Hamas frees dozens of hostages believed to be hidden underground. As the war rages on, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is holding urgent talks in the region, showing U.S. solidarity with Israel and likening the brutality of Hamas to the worst, his words, the worst of ISIS. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Our breaking news coverage begins this hour in the war zone as the Israel-Hamas conflict grows increasingly deadly, and America's top diplomat is holding critical, very critical talks. CNN correspondents are near the frontlines and other key locations getting new information about what's happening on the ground right now and what may happen next. First, let's go to our Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward. She's joining us from Ashkelon, Israel, just north of Gaza. Clarissa, as Israeli troops are massing in huge numbers near the border, you visited a kibbutz now being used by the IDF troops. What did you see?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf. This is the place where some of the atrocities that took place on Saturday were perpetrated. It was very interesting when we arrived on the scene that it has now been taken over in something of a symbolic gesture, you might even say, by the Israeli military, by an artillery brigade. We saw a lot of troops. We saw a lot of hardware. We saw tanks. We heard outgoing artillery.And there was no sense walking around and talking to the soldiers they were on super high alert or super high level of preparedness in terms of an imminent, imminent move forward in some way, but certainly fair to say that there is now a huge amount of manpower and weaponry fanning out all the way across that border with the Gaza envelope and the very real specter of some kind of movement. But the question now becomes, Wolf, what does that movement look like. The situation in Gaza, as you mentioned, growing worse and worse by the minute. The U.N. today says that 2,500 homes have been destroyed, more than 23,000 have been damaged either moderate or minor damage. The number of displaced people has gone up by 30 percent in just one day. The hospitals are running out of fuel. You heard secretary of state Antony Blinken earlier on in his visit talking about the need to set up some kind of a humanitarian corridor and ongoing efforts to try to make that happen. But, so far, there is no indication that is quick in the making and very real concerns about the sky rising death toll in Gaza, many of these people civilians, and what that means for this conflict going forward, Wolf.",

It sounds, by all accounts, that it's catastrophic, in addition to the fact that the death toll in Gaza has now exceeded 1,500.The health system, by all accounts, and according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, is in a state of collapse. All the things you need to run a hospital are slowly running out. The fuel for the generators that keep the hospitals running, medicine, basic supplies are simply not being replenished. And, therefore, we're seeing it, for instance, in hospitals all around Gaza, many of the injured are simply put on the floor in the corridors. There are no beds left. The operating theaters are beyond capacity. Now, according to the United Nations, there are 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza who now have no access to healthcare, partially because of the fighting, but partially because the health workers and all the facilities are being focused on treating the injured. Now, speaking of the injured, earlier this evening, our colleague, Christiane Amanpour, spoke Dr. Razana Busite (ph), who is a Palestinian-British doctor who has been going to Gaza regularly. I've interviewed him many times also in operating theaters, while he's actually operating on the injured. And he says that among the wounded, 30 to 40 percent of them are children. And, certainly, there is a sense in Gaza that, at this point, people feel that the ordinary civilians, they are simply being abandoned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, things seem to be trending in the wrong direction for Steve Scalise. Now, he is meeting in his office, as we speak, with some of these holdouts, trying to win over their support, trying to assuage their concerns. But I can tell you, there are serious doubts right now about whether Steve Scalise can ever get there. And that is creating deep frustration in the GOP right now. And members are warning that they just don't have that type of time. It's not like in January where they could go through these rounds of votes. Right now, they are dealing with the crisis in Israel and also they have another government funding deadline coming up. So, now, at this moment, there are some discussions underway in the GOP about a plan B. If Steve Scalise can't get there, they're talking about drafting a new candidate to try to step up to the plate. And now there's also a group of centrists Republicans who are talking about trying to empower Patrick McHenry. He's the interim speaker and giving him more temporary power so he can move legislation and be able to help the House function more properly.

That second barrage was really quite close, and we know that because the boom of the Iron Dome System intercepting those rockets was quite, quite loud. Inside the shelter in our hotel, we spoke with a family, Natan Levy, the father of six children, and his wife, Ester (ph). They told us that they fled the city of Ashkelon, which is right behind us.

But as you can see, Wolf, it is effectively impossible to find 100 percent security in this part of Israel. I asked him what he's going to do next, because this military campaign could last a while. He said they are taking things day by day. But they have been getting offers from families all across the country to house them.Now, at the same time, right here on our balcony, we've been hearing, Wolf, the constant rumbling, very loud, vibrating the windows and the balcony that we're standing on.

At some point, there is going to be -- there needs to be calls for restraint, for more precision, military campaign. We are not sure exactly what Israel's plans are for now. Although, the circumstances are unlike anything we have seen before, because of the slaughter of civilians in Israel. So far, Israel's approach to this military campaign is more of what it's done in the past.

It's being decided probably in Gaza, potentially in Syria, and Tehran and, of course, because of Hezbollah's presence in Lebanon here as well. And in fact, the Iranian foreign minister just arrived in Beirut for a visit, he was meant to go Damascus, but the Israelis bombarded the Damascus airport and put it out of commission, so he cannot land there, and instead he advanced his trip to Beirut, he was supposed to come tomorrow but he's already arrived. And he was welcomed at the airports via representatives of Hamas, and the Islamic jihad who are in operation here. He was not sounding very conciliatory. So there is, tension. There's been, you know, crossfire across at the border between Lebanon and Israel. The Iranians not sounding conciliatory, but at the same time, very interesting to see the Iranians supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that Iran had nothing to do with the planning of this attack. So, I think everybody is taking pause, and looking at what is coming next. I think we're very much in unchartered territory.",
