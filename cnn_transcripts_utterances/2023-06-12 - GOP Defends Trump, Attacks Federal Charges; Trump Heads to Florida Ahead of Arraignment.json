It is an unprecedented moment. It's an historic moment. It's a test for the justice system in America. The former president set to be arraigned on those 37 felony counts over handling classified documents. And sources tell CNN that Trump is expected to meet with his lawyers ahead of Tuesday's appearance. But it is unclear as of now who that -- what that means, because we don't know who the former president is actually going to be able to formally hire to represent him. We do know that, right now, intense security preparations are under way in South Florida. And we have a news conference coming your way shortly. Officials will hold a conference to talk more about the security preparations to ramp up security, Jake, in the next hour.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILLIAM BARR, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  If even half of it is true, then he's toast. I mean, it's a -- it's a pretty -- it's a very detailed indictment. And it's very, very damning. And this idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch-hunt, is ridiculous. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER:  CNN's Evan Perez and Paula Reid are outside the federal courthouse in Miami for us right now. Evan, to you first.

We know that one of the things Jack Smith's team had the benefit of was a Miami-based prosecutor. Her name is Karen Gilbert. She actually supervised the last case involving Mar-a-Lago. It's a Chinese national who had snuck her way into Mar-a-Lago. That was back in 2019, when Donald Trump was still president. She helped oversee some of the steps before prosecutors carried out that search, that extraordinary search, that we saw of Mar-a-Lago last August. And so we know that, behind the scenes, Jake, the prosecution knew that the issue of venue was going to present itself. The fact is that Mar-a-Lago is down here. The former president left Washington hours before Donald Trump -- before Joe Biden was sworn in as president. And so that meant that, most likely, the best place to bring this case and the most natural place to bring this case was here in Florida. It poses a number of issues for prosecutors, which I'm sure you guys have already talked about. One of them is, of course, this is probably a friendlier jury pool for Donald Trump, compared to the one in Washington, D.C., where the grand jury has been hearing a lot of the evidence. Secondly, we know that one of the big pieces of evidence, Jake, the issue of the recordings -- or, rather, the notes taken by Evan Corcoran, Donald Trump's own lawyer, which is going to be a big part of this case, all of that was litigated in the courts in Washington. You can bet Donald Trump's lawyers are going to want to take another crack at that when they get to a judge here in the Southern District of Florida -- Jake.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right.It is challenging for the former president to find people willing to represent him. This has been an issue for him for the past several years throughout various criminal investigations. We know, for example, in Washington, D.C., over time, he's reached out to many of the big firms. And they have declined to represent him, based on a variety of factors, including concerns about getting paid, concerns about the impact on their reputation, and also worries about alienating other clients. Now, at this point, he is represented by Todd Blanche. He's sort of taking over after the departure of pretty much all the other lawyers who have been representing him in this investigation, including John Rowley, Jim Trusty, and Tim Parlatore. They're looking to bring on additional counsel, perhaps based here in Florida. Now, tomorrow, they do have at least one attorney, Lindsey Halligan, who has been on the team for quite some time. She is admitted to practice here in the Southern District of Florida. So, even if they aren't able to bring on any additional attorneys by tomorrow, they still likely will be able to get Todd Blanche sort of waived in, go through all the paperwork to do that, because she is admitted here. And, right now, it's unclear who in the state of Florida is going to be willing to join this team. I know I have spoken with the sources I have worked with and other cases down here. There have been some people who have raised their hand and said, in fact, they would like to work on this case. But I'm told none of them have been hired at this point. We have also learned from other -- from our other reporters here that some people have turned them down already. So, clearly, they're still in the process of searching. And, Erin, it's unclear if he will have his full legal team up and ready to go tomorrow. It seems unlikely. But, either way, he has the people in place that he needs to at least get through the arraignment.",

Donald Trump is famous for not paying his lawyers or for stalling those payments. But he's also got this $100 million PAC fund, which has made it easier to pay him -- pay them with money he couldn't use for other things.
