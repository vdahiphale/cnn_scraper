Let's break it all down with CNN senior legal analyst Ellie Honig, who's joining us over at the Magic Wall right now. Ellie, what are today's key moments, and what will we see when court picks back up in just a few minutes?ELLIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST AND FORMER STATE &amp; FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Well, Wolf, Keith Davidson will still be on the stand. He's in the middle of being cross-examined right now, and just to understand, first of all, who Keith Davidson is, he is very important here because he represented both Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels in quick succession in 2016 in the days leading up to the election. Now, in his prior testimony, Keith Davidson laid out for the jury how he negotiated a deal between Karen McDougal and the National Enquirer, where they bought her story and then did not run it, for $150,000. Now, today has focused much more on his representation of Stormy Daniels. And as Keith Davidson laid out, he ended up negotiating primarily with Michael Cohen, where Michael Cohen paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep silent. Davidson, incidentally, took 45 percent of that for himself for an attorney's fee. Now, importantly, Davidson testified that he didn't deal directly with Donald Trump, but here's what he said about what his understanding was about why this deal was reached. Davidson said, There was an understanding that our activities may have in some way assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. And again, remember, this is happening about a week before the 2016 election. Another interesting point that Davidson made this morning, he said Michael Cohen was furious at Donald Trump. He said Michael Cohen said to him, quote, I've saved that guy, meaning Donald Trump's blank, so many times that you don't even know that blanking guy. Again, Trump is not even paying me the $130,000 back. Now, Trump does later end up paying Michael Cohen that money back, and that sort of gets to the crux of what's charged here. Now, there was some interesting testimony earlier about this moment after the election when they have the agreement in place with Stormy Daniels, and she goes on the Jimmy Kimmel show. Now, Michael Cohen is very worried about what she will and won't say. Let's take a quick look at that clip of Stormy Daniels talking to Jimmy Kimmel in January 2017. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Donald Trump's defense team started their cross-examination of Keith Davidson. They'll pick it up after lunch. A couple of key points they made. First of all, Keith Davidson had no contact ever with Donald Trump while this was happening. He dealt through Michael Cohen. They also cast doubt on Michael Cohen's motives. Keith Davidson said Michael Cohen thought he was going to be appointed attorney general or secretary of state when Donald Trump became president and was furious and dismayed when that did not happen. And finally, Keith Davidson testified that the agreement was never explicitly, never in writing, specifically linked to the election itself. So, Wolf, that cross- examination will resume in just a few minutes when Keith Davidson gets back on the stand.",

      "sentences": "I think what was striking, and it very much aligns with what Paul was just laying out, is this is a good reminder as we go day by day through a rather lengthy trial, that as we cover minute by minute, feed by feed that we're getting from our reporters inside the room, that none of this is going to look great. All of this is very unseemly dealing with people that perhaps you might necessarily want to be going to church with on a weekly basis.But that also means that the defense has real opportunities, one, to poke holes, two, to make their kind of overarching point, which is proof to me Donald Trump knew about all of this. And three, as Paul has pointed out many times, actually making the case that's alleged here, actually getting a conviction, actually getting all 12 people aligned with what prosecutors are alleging, is not a slam dunk. It is not necessarily going to be easy because of how it's constructed, because of the different elements of the space, and because of the dots they're trying to connect through multiple different issues here. And this is a good reminder that Trump has a legal team that is pretty good at what they do, and they're going to take advantage of the fact that a lot of these witnesses aren't exactly the purest forms of individuals. BURNETT: And I guess kind of worth reminding what we, I know we have all said so many times, but to your point about the jury, right, the standard here in a criminal case, which is what they have used this business documents fraud to elevate this to, is of course beyond a reasonable doubt and unanimity.",

And Trump was not directly involved in facilitating this payment to Stormy Daniels. That is really going to be key here. And so that leaves prosecutors really ultimately eventually relying on the word of who? Well, Michael Cohen.And the one thing everyone can agree on in this case, it seems so far, is that no one has anything nice to say about Michael Cohen. That's why the prosecutors need to put on these witnesses to support things that the jury will eventually hear from Michael Cohen. But this is a tough case. It's much harder than just simply a falsifying business records case.",

They're not getting given much of a heads up on things, but also how in the wake of what, at least up to this point, has been a fairly difficult cross- examination for the prosecution's witness. Do they stack things? Do they change things? How does this all work and play out going forward? Remember, we talked from the very beginning about how they were laying out a very foundational story for their witnesses. What they could drive the jury toward at the beginning, when you had the individual from C-SPAN or the accountant come in, why they were doing that in terms of submitting evidence. What the point of that actually was. Now Davidson. How do they keep kind of drawing that thread to try and make their case, especially given the fact that, you know, the defense team had a solid effort over the course of the last couple of hours.",

And so something like that, a phrase like that can really stick with a jury. And then when Cohen seems to take, you know, the ball himself and run it down the court himself, it sounds like he's trying, to make it happen. And what's missing is Trump.

And the legal team was saying well, this is an ambiguous gag order. And the Judge just rejected it.
