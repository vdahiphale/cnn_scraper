      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Paula Reid in Washington.President Biden is doubling down on his support for Israel's war against Hamas rejecting mounting calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. In a new op-ed in \"The Washington Post,\" the president writes, \"As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a ceasefire is not peace. To Hamas' members, every ceasefire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters, and restart the killing by attacking innocents again.\" This comes as Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa continues to be a key military target for the IDF claiming Hamas is using the complex as a large scale command center, a claim Hamas denies. Hospital officials say patients and staff were ordered to evacuate the medical complex, which Israel denies. A head doctor there says six doctors are staying at the medical complex to treat around 120 too vulnerable evacuate. But as the fighting continues in the north, Israel's military is now vowing to advance anywhere Hamas is found. There are growing signs that a ground offensive into southern parts of Gaza could be imminent. Meanwhile, in Tel Aviv, thousands gathered at a massive rally calling for the Israeli government to do more to bring home the hostages six weeks after they were first abducted by Hamas. Let's go straight to CNN International diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson. He is live in Sderot, Israel. Nic, what can you tell us about the situation right now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, in the north of Gaza here, there is a lot of intense military activity going on, a lot of shells, a lot of shooting. I hear a helicopter. There have been air strikes. There is just very heavy bombardments, heavy machine gunfire as well, and I think what we're witnessing here is what the IDF spoke about -- there's another detonation -- what the IDF spoke about earlier today, that they're going to start pushing from the area that they have in the northern part of Gaza along the Mediterranean Coast, and they are going to start pushing in this direction, towards the east of the Gaza Strip so that they can get more control of more of the territory in the northern part of the Gaza Strip.So this is where the fighting is at the moment, and absolutely, both the prime minister and some of the other government officials speaking at press conferences today made it very clear, their intent is to go after Hamas, wherever they are. They have been dropping leaflets to residents in Khan Yunis, the biggest town in the south of the Gaza Strip telling people there to move to safer areas. So every indication is said that the scenario of fighting in the south of Gaza will as it did in the north change from airstrikes and artillery alone to the possibility and the reality of ground troops going in. We've also seen outgoing rockets coming from Gaza today, Hamas rockets, some fired in this direction a couple of hours ago intercepted by the Iron Dome defensive missile system, and all of that tends seems to indicate that while Hamas has been under huge military pressure here for three weeks with ground troops and ground forces on the ground, they still have the ability to fire out their rockets perhaps not in as big a number as before, but that shows that there are still Hamas fighters fighting on the ground. And the machine gun fire we can hear here again just indicates the fights that are existing on the ground there, too, as the IDF continues to try to take out the remaining Hamas fighters here. It is, and the military has said, it is going to be a very long job to do that.",

So far, those negotiations have yet to actually reach a deal for their freedom. But tonight, the pressure is being brought to bear on the Israeli government. I spoke tonight with Mia Roman, the cousin of Yarden Roman, one of those estimated 237 hostages. I asked her what her message is to the Israeli prime minister and his Cabinet. Here's her answer.

But it's also age in another way, it's age, if you look within the electorate and see where Joe Biden has lost support. Take a look at voters under the age of 35. This is the margin, Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. Four years ago, Joe Biden won these voters, overwhelmingly. He won them by over 20 percentage points. Look at where he is now. Now, he is still ahead of Donald Trump, but he is only ahead by five points. And of course, elections are all about margins. When you look throughout the different age groups, you see, essentially that Joe Biden's margins are actually holding amongst the older voters, but younger voters have been swinging away from him. And if this ends up being the margin on election day, it would be the smallest margin for a Democratic candidate among voters under the age of 35, since I was actually eligible to vote, so that's how long it's been.

He also says both Putin and Hamas are fighting to wipe neighboring democracies off the map, and insists that the US cannot and will not let that happen.General Wesley Clark joins us now. He is a military analyst and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. General, thank you for joining us. I want to get your reaction to this new op-ed. The president calls the United States a, quote, \"essential nation\" and says, \"The world looks to us to solve the problems of our time. That is the duty of leadership, and America will lead. For if we walk away from the challenges of today, the risk of conflict could spread, and the costs to address them will only rise. We will not let that happen.\" Is he right, first of all, to link the conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East? And is he correct that the US should take a leading role here? GENERAL WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I believe he is correct in linking the conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine. Russia has a strategic relationship with Iran. Iran is the source of the current problems in the region, in the Middle East, and so the -- Iran is also supplying weapons to Russia to attack Ukraine, but it's broader than that. I mean, Putin wants disorder. He wants chaos in the international community. He wants to invalidate American leadership. He wants to change the rules-based international order. He wants to go back to a strong-man diplomacy of three or four dictators in the world, carving up the world, and get rid of the ideas that we put in -- the Americans put in after the Second World War, that there were human rights, that nations had a right to choose their own course, and so forth. So Putin is against all of that. He's using Iran and, yes, definitely, it's linked.",

And that we need to have the military power to deter Xi Jinping should he choose to invade Taiwan and take it by force.It's always been a policy that has a certain amount of ambiguity in it. Under President Biden, we have become more and more clearer that the United States will commit forces to defend Taiwan if China attacks. So this is on China, and President Xi has many problems other than Taiwan. He's got a real estate problem. He's got a population problem. He's got other issues to work with, not just Taiwan. So we shouldn't overreact to this. We should stay strong and, as President Biden said, we are the essential nation. We do have to provide leadership. If we don't, no one else can.",

They may not get their funds back. Everyone sees what China did to Hong Kong. There's no relief on that. And President Biden said it very clearly, Xi Jinping has virtually almost total power right now in Beijing. He is, in essence, a dictator. Now, he's got internal opposition. There are people who are concerned, but they don't have the influence to really change the course of China's policy. So I think, yes, the meeting is positive. It's a step forward. We have to find a way to live with China in the long-term. Russia, different problem. Putin is a real source of disorder and chaos in the world community. China, not necessarily.

Sam Altman was not only the face up until this week of OpenAI, he was really the face of artificial intelligence after OpenAI, the company that he cofounded, launched ChatGPT less than a year ago, right? It was only a year ago.Since then, Sam Altman has been traveling the world, meeting with heads of state. He's testified in front of Congress, and he's led OpenAI through this massive boom that's being valued at one of the largest startups in Silicon Valley history what now in a stunning move, he is out. Now, what do we know about that? This is the question in Silicon Valley, from Wall Street. They are all asking. Alluded to (ph), the board was kind of cagey with the reason. They said that Sam Altman wasn't truthful with them. Now, what was he not being truthful with them about? We don't know. Now, there's speculation on what it could be. Our colleague, CNN Contributor, Kara Swisher, says that this stems from an internal fight at OpenAI, irresponsible way to build A.I. Now, we know, of course, all these concerns about AI. The people most concerned with AI are the people closest to it, right? Sam Altman testified in Congress that AI could be an existential threat. Well, those divisions were raging within OpenAI. Some people saw this incredibly valuable product and wanted to push forward. Others were more cautious, saying that they had to, you know, be responsible for humanity. The structure of OpenAI is a kind of interesting setup. It doesn't maximize profit in a way that a typical corporation does, and that clearly had some impact in leading the board to kick Sam Altman out.",
