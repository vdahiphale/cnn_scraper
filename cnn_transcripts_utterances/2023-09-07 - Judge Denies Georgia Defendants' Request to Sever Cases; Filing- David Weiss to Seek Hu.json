So, the fact that the district attorney is taking this step ahead of a potential trial, incredibly significant. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. CULVER:  So we could really use some legal perspective on this this morning, and for that, we're joined by CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. Joey, there is so much to this case. I want to start though with the time line. As we just heard, Judge McAfee seemingly skeptical of this ability to hold a joint trial with all 19 defendants and we're talking as soon as next month. Prosecutors also said that they plan to call at least 150 witnesses and they are expecting this trial to last four months. What do you think is reality when it comes to the timing?",

You've also got those deciding that they should be severed from each other. So where does it fall?",

And what does that interest of justice mean. The reality is, is that it needs to fall where are attorneys ready and prepared to go to trial?You have a right to have a fair trial. Now, these two have indicated that they want to have a speedy trial. That is also your right. So hey move forward. To what extent are other lawyers just not ready. There is a lot of documentation, are they involved in other matters such that they cannot become ready and move forward? Will the motion for Mr. Meadows be granted such that his case is elevated to federal court? If it is elevated to federal court, does then the district attorney say hey let's try, you know, the other defendants who have made motions to go to federal court at the same time. So just so many variables and so -- the direct answer to your question, Dave, is we don't know where it falls, but we know interest of justice will be first in mind with respect to where it ultimately does.",

It would be resolved, all good. You know, he'll be in this diversion program which means that as long as he abides by certain conditions, the case goes away and then, ba-boom, that's off the table.And so, now, you have a special counsel who has an interest in moving the matter forward and that interest will result as the special counsel noted in an indictment by at least September 29 and we'll see what that indictment is about. We expect it to relate to the gun charge and we expect as a result of that that, hey, the prior deal would be off the table and what does that mean. And don't forget, David, that we also have the investigation for five years into the business dealing of Hunter Biden and what is that all going to mean, will those charges be added? And if not by September 9, we've seen super seeding indictments before. Think about Donald Trump and his case, will then that there be some other charges coming down the pike.

What other legal motions do I have to challenge the evidence at issue? Do I have everything I need to move forward as it relates to discovery to try the case? And so, delay, delay, delay. But those delays are for good measure. Not just for delay sake, but so that you can ensure that the rights of your client certainly are protected and that if there is a trial, it's fair, it's responsible and that the airing of all the issues is out there for the jury to hear and for the defendant to get the measure of justice that they deserve.",

It opens up the possibility that the Spanish football president Luis Rubiales could face criminal charges. You mentioned that last week, the Spanish prosecutors office, the top criminal court in Spain, had opened this investigation saying that they were going to invite Jenni Hermoso to testify in an investigation which could lead to these sexual aggression charges. They released a statement on Tuesday saying that she has now testified. They plan on processing that testimony as quickly as possible and will provide us with any updates in due course. And really, this now has ramifications in the footballing context as well. You know, this is a man who had been suspended by world football's governing body FIFA from his duties provisionally for 90 days. But up to this point has refused to resign from his post despite calls from players, from other sporting bodies and organizations. The Spanish sporting tribunal had issued proceedings last week. They, though, had said he had committed a serious offense rather than a very serious offense which is the bar at which they were able to remove him from his post. It will be interesting to see now whether this criminal complaint has been filed, that next step can be taken.",
