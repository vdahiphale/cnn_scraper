We'll begin with that tonight. Because the all-powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which is led by Democrats, as you know, for now, voting tonight, to release the former President Donald Trump's tax returns, to the public. The Committee's vote was along party lines. And it's a giant defeat for Trump, so who - he's fought, for years now, to keep all of his tax information private, citing audits and the like. And, also tonight, sources telling that, the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is on his way, to Washington D.C., at this very hour. He will meet with the President of the United States, tomorrow, at the White House, as expected, and may also address a Joint Session of Congress. And now, here's a CNN Exclusive, tonight. Sources saying that Trump's former White House Ethics lawyer, told Cassidy Hutchinson - remember, she was the star witness, of the January 6th hearings? That person apparently gave her the advice, to give misleading testimony, to the Committee. And yes, I said, a White House Ethics Lawyer. So, you try to figure that out, if you can. I want to start now with CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent, Manu Raju, who is live, on Capitol Hill, tonight. Manu, a lot is going on. Let's begin with those taxes. When are we going to learn more, about these taxes, and maybe even see them?",

Ultimately, turned over to Congress, just a few weeks ago, and then, now, tonight, in a party-line vote, House Democrats voting, to move ahead, and to release these, into public. Now, what we're talking about here is six years of Trump's tax returns, including tax returns, for eight affiliate businesses. We also expect to see IRS audit reports, as well as two reports. The Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a non-partisan group that analyzes taxes. We expect that report, to come out, tonight, as well as the Committee's report, analyzing these tax returns. That also will be released tonight, according to Committee officials. Now, when I asked the Chairman of the Committee, Richie Neal, about whether or not those returns, the actual returns themselves will be in public, he said they'll come out within days.

If this injustice can happen to President Trump, it can happen to all Americans without cause.\" But very little they can do here, given they lost that battle, for years, in court.

We've never had a president, who had a sort of more complicated financial picture than Donald Trump. Has to be like the best case, for why such an audit should exist. And they didn't do it. And I have to wonder, if it was somehow wrapped up in this long- standing audit of a massive refund that he got 10 years ago. We're also apparently going to hear more of what we revealed, in 2020, which is that he has had enormous business losses, over the years, he's been under some financial pressure, and that he rarely, if ever, pays much in income taxes.",

Then, there is the mandatory presidential audit, supposed to be conducted. And that seems to be the hook, legislatively that this committee is talking about. But, on the point of the 2020, I mean, part of the sort of feedback that you're hearing, is the idea of well, we have seen some of the information, right, through your own reporting, back in 2020, and beyond. I'm wondering, one of the things that Congressman Doggett has had to say, the former President claimed tens of millions of dollars in losses, but with no supporting documents, to actually substantiate those claims.

Does he really have the Empire, he says?\" There was a curiosity in this figure. Then, it was \"Hold on, why don't you want to hand over the information?\" There's beginning to be a skepticism from that curiosity. But now that we are really at his second - well his third election bid, I'm wondering, first of all, do you think that the release of the information, now, and this quest, at this point, is as crucial, or necessary, or warranted? What do you think? Norm? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER HOUSE JUDICIARY SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP'S FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ETHICS CZAR: I do think that it's justified. The law of the United States is that the House Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Neal, who has been very careful, Laura, has the power, to obtain these returns, and to publish them. That is the law of the land. They've done a balance. And you're looking here, at an individual, who flouted - and it was my job in the Obama White House, to clear the Obama taxes, for release. He flouted that modern practice of releasing his taxes. There were the most serious constitutional questions, about payments, from foreign governments, so-called emoluments. I litigated them. Domestic emoluments, you can't get them from the States. That may be in the tax returns. Now, his business has been convicted, for two counts of tax fraud, with a larger investigation continuing as to him. He's running, again. I think, on the weighing and balancing, yes, I'm concerned about the privacy. But these other considerations far outweigh it. He's waived any right to claim the privacy of these routines. JONAH GOLDBERG, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, CO-FOUNDER &amp; EDITOR-IN- CHIEF, THE DISPATCH: Yes. I said, I can't - I don't see it that way at all. I mean, I have no sympathy for Donald Trump, in this. He violated a whole bunch of norms. He - not this Norm, but other norm.",

I think he was right to look at them. But to release them publicly, creates a moral hazard, and a bad precedent, and it just feels punitive.

We don't really know. I don't want to draw conclusions.But, so we do need to know that. But who is \"We,\" right? The Congress has to know. They have 100-year-old law that says the Treasury shall release, to the Ways and Means Committee, any tax return they request, shall. Trump flouted that, litigated it. But I'm kind of more with Jonah that I'm worried about the precedent. Now, I'm old enough to recall, in the Obama presidency, Republicans were running Ways and Means Committee. They did release some private tax returns, not of Barack Obama's, because he put them out. But they had some IRS conspiracy theory that they were - so, they released private information, then. It was wrong, then. It's a tougher call here. Because, if this allegation is true, as Manu's reporting is true, then somehow, he was placed above the law that every other President had to follow.

Our process does not capture that. The tax returns don't capture that.

There's a possibility, if it's read into the record, the Senate Finance Committee will pick it up, or another congressional committee, somewhere down the road, will pick it up, not so much related to Donald Trump, but really trying to fix that baked-in problem we have, which is just figuring out whether our presidents are subject to manipulation, because of their finances.",

And, at its core, beyond the first face-to-face meeting between the two presidents, since the war started, back in February, is what it will entail. There will be in-depth discussions, between the two presidents. President Zelenskyy will also meet with President Biden's top national security officials. But it will also include a $1.8 billion in new security assistance. And inside that security assistance, the most substantial effort, the U.S. has made, yet, to expand the capabilities, of Ukrainians, on the ground, most notably, Patriot missile defense systems. These are the systems that President Zelenskyy has been calling for, for several months, including in private phone calls, with President Biden. Up to a last couple of weeks, the White House was not willing to go down this path. They changed course, given Russia's escalation, and targeting civilian infrastructure.

And if you want to break out what this current package actually represents, you get an understanding of the scope of things. It's not just Military assistance. This package includes an additional $9 billion, in defense assistance, but also $12 billion, for the U.S., to replenish its own stocks, $13 billion in economic support, as the country attempts to maintain some semblance of an economy, given the invasion, and then another $9 billion in humanitarian support. You think about all the refugees, you think about the scale of the suffering, particularly as the civilian infrastructure has been targeted. If nothing else, the size of this package, the symbolism of this moment, underscores one thing, I hear over and over again, from U.S. officials.
