It is late summer. There is a holiday weekend next weekend. This is what one would expect to see, but the Dow itself by the way, worst week since March. The events that we're looking at and we'll bring to your close attention. The first ever trilateral Summit is taking place between the US, Japan and South Korea. More military and intelligence cooperation is expected to be announced and we'll hear from the leaders in a press conference during the show. From Mongolia to the US, direct and new open skies agreement. The MIAT chief executive, the airline is talking to us tonight about his plans. And around 30 percent of the population here are still herders, nomads. Now, they have access to technology. How to balance traditional with quality of life. In Ulaanbaatar, it is already Friday -- it is Saturday, actually, but for you, it's Friday, it's August the 18th. I'm Richard Quest, this time change difference, it is all very difficult, but even with that, I mean business. Good evening. It is our final day in Ulaanbaatar and we are glad to have you with us. It is 50 degrees Celsius, it's about nine or 10 degrees, so it is a little bit cold outside, hence I've got the scarf on, and we bring you to an end a series of spectacular programs that we've got for you, exploring Mongolia's culture tonight. We'll be looking at that, and tourism as well, as well as looking at the challenges of corruption and governance and we will also tell you about cashmere, which is very big here, one of their biggest exports and the throat singing. It's all to come. First whilst we're in Mongolia, other Asian leaders are in Washington DC. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol and President Biden, they are all at Camp David, and they are hoping to usher in a new chapter. They are set to speak during this hour at Camp David. It is the first trilateral summit. Japan and South Korea have a difficult history, of course, putting that aside amid security challenges has been the goal of the meeting. Ivan Watson is in Hong Kong and joins me. Ivan, despite the difficult background. What is -- I mean, can we sum up the concern, the common challenge as China?",

And that is the kind of thing the growing ties between Russia and China, even after Russia invaded Ukraine, these are some of the factors that have contributed to South Korea and Japan, which both independently were very close US allies for generations to overcome their own historic grievances, and to recognize that it's better to work together in a trilateral arrangement as the Americans have wanted for years than it is to kind of go it alone, and that's what we're seeing happen right now. Take a listen to what the Japanese prime minister had to say at the beginning of the meeting.
