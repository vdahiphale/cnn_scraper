And then you talk about what you're hearing here, that the care of the hostages that Hamas wanted it to be this way, that they prepared for it to be this way because they eventually wanted the sound bites that you're getting now, that they were humane and took care of their hostages. Of course, there are still hostages. And you must celebrate the fact that we have four home and that hopefully there will be more. But this is very much a part of what Hamas wants to portray to the world, right, that their the David against the Goliath and they take care of their hostages and look what we've done, and it's humane. But you have to, in the same breath, remember what it is that they were also doing that day on October 7th. And it is that juxtaposition, which, yes, on the one hand is so surprising and shocking and impossible to hold those two things as true in your head even though they are true, but on the other hand, Phil, yes, this is, in a sense, what could be expected because this is the public relations perspective they would want to impose upon a broader world to gain sympathies.",

And we know that that's the truth, that there is a complex network of tunnels, some of which are very deep under the ground, and perhaps even in that sense, immune to Israeli munitions, unless they move to some sort of bunker- buster bomb type of situation.But also consistent with what the IDF has said since the beginning, which is that they believe that the hostages were not only being held underground, but in locations underground, tunnels that in the past had not been -- Hamas had not been known to use, which is a little different than saying Israel doesn't know where they are. Their wording was very careful on that. But it does show, right? They're going to release the wife, but not the husband. This context really matters when you talk about what this is really about, right? And then you want to say humanity and well-treated, they shouldn't have been there in the first place. They shouldn't be separated. And these realities all exist at the same time, Poppy.",

They stand between -- they are the kind of final barrier between a full-on entry into Hamas, a tactical resolution by the Israelis, and they will continue to use the hostages to buy time. They have many to work with. The reports have been upwards of 200 hostages. And we will likely see a continued very small drip day in, day out of a few releases now and then to kind of maintain this anticipation that a diplomatic resolution to getting them all returned is right on the brink and, therefore, maybe the Israelis should hold off a major military operation.",
