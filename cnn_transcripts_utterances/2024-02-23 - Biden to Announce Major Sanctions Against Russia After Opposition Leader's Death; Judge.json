The Russian economy in general, Kim, has managed to weather sanctions initially imposed, and this tranche will be one of the biggest, or at least the biggest, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago.

I appreciate that.Ahead of Saturday's second anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Moscow is dropping a hint that it may be ready to talk. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says it extends only to talk with Washington, but the caveat is negotiations must be, in his words, open and honest. Meanwhile, a new video released by Moscow reportedly shows a mopping up operation in the town of Avdiivka, whose defenses were overrun last weekend. That was Russia's biggest victory in months, which Ukraine blames on the lack of military aid. But pledges of more aid are starting to trickle in, with Denmark working to deliver F-16 jets this summer. Britain is promising more anti-tank missiles, while France plans to host an international meeting on aid for Ukraine on Monday. And Kyiv is also striking back, saying it hit a Russian training ground near a Ukrainian bridgehead south of the Dnipro River. Ukraine says it held off multiple Russian attacks there and in parts of the Zaporizhzhya region that Kyiv recaptured last year. The city of Kherson has been free from Russian troops for more than 15 months, but almost two years into the war, life is still a grinding and heart-wrenching struggle, and hope is often hard to find.

Now, this was really a tense final few moments for this mission. Just a few hours before landing, Intuitive Machines announced that there was an issue with Odysseus' navigation system. It wasn't working. But in a spectacular example of a public-private partnership, it just so happened that one of Odysseus' or Intuitive Machines' paying customers, NASA, had an experimental piece of equipment that did the exact same thing as this broken piece of navigation software. And so engineers on Earth were able to patch up a fix and allow Odysseus to safely navigate that treacherous terrain on the south pole of the moon, dodging craters and boulders to find a safe space to land. And so that is what happened. It took a little bit longer than the company thought to communicate with the spacecraft, but it is sending back data now. [02:15:04] And this is now the first time that any American spacecraft has landed on the surface of the moon since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972. So it's a win for NASA as a sponsor of this mission, but certainly a win for this Texas-based company, Intuitive Machines. They were able to do for about $100 million what NASA was able to do with the Apollo program with a much larger budget. So some big cheers from that mission control room when the landing happened.
