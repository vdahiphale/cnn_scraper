They include 10 counts of first-degree murder, 86 counts of attempted first-degree murder, 48 counts of bias-motivated crime, which is how Colorado refers to hate crimes, and 90 counts of assaults. And Aldrich, who his attorneys say, identifies as nonbinary, and uses they/them pronouns, allegedly entered Club Q late November 19th with an A.R.-style weapon and a handgun, opening fire, killing at least five people. At least 13 others were injured, most of whom suffered gunshot wounds. And during this attack, police say Aldrich was effectively beaten into submission by club patrons who stopped that mass shooting within minutes. District Attorney Michael Allen said that the harshest charges would carry the harshest penalty, likely life in prison without parole, and if convicted, they will, quote, \"serve the remainder of their life in prison without breathing free air again.\" And at a press conference following today's hearing, Allen said the number of charges sends a message that the crimes are taken very seriously by the D.A.'s office.

And then controversy after controversy, a number of them are wary, or hopeful, that another candidate can ultimately emerge and win the Republican nomination. But it's very clear, though, at the moment, that Trump is running. He's the only candidate. And Mitch McConnell today decided to respond to it.",

With some acknowledgment that, based on experience, from McConnell, that was strong.But I think what's interesting, though, when you compare it to what you would expect, given the scale of what the former president put on the table, it doesn't seem like going that far. I think, to some degree, when you talk to White House officials that's been a point of frustration. First, just how slow the response from Republicans were to the idea of terminating the thing that they say quite publicly and quite often animates the entirety of the party. But also, even when we've seen -- and Manu has reported a ton of this over the course of the past 24 hours -- Republicans, particularly Republican Senators, start to criticize, start to kind of roll out criticisms of the absolute lowest-hanging fruit of things you can criticize right now. I think it's taken aback how tepid it has been to some degree. It's notable that it's happened. Anybody who has lived through the last six years would acknowledge that to some degree. The fact that this issue, sacrosanct at the center of all of the United States' democracy, is not something that's enough to really bring outright opposition, one, underscores the dynamic of where the former president remains in the party, and, two, drives a lot of frustration you hear from Democratic officials. One thing I would note, guys -- and this plays into this to some degree -- President Biden, when you talk to somebody close to him, very firmly believes that the grip of the former president is starting to recede at a pretty significant manner inside of the party. I think they think this is the moment to help prove that, to make that pivot. But it hasn't happened yet.",

Now, the Ukrainians are really not making any direct comment on the airstrikes.The nearest thing we've heard in terms of any confirmation that Ukrainians might have been involved, comes from undersecretary of state from the White House administration's Victoria Nuland. Her suggesting in an interview in Kyiv that the Ukrainians were developing the capability to potentially conduct this sort of strike. We haven't seen the use of long-range drones yet officially by Ukraine in this war, but there's no question they're trying to develop them. They have an advanced weapons industry here that has been targeted throughout the war, as, indeed, has the electrical infrastructure of the country. So, this is a significant development. I think above all, the Pentagon is now insisting and, indeed, putting out statements saying they have not supplied any offensive weapons that might be used in this way to Ukraine. Because they're very anxious, indeed, that Ukraine doesn't get accused of, much less actually conducts attacks inside of Russia using American or NATO-supplied weaponry, for fear of provoking a reaction from the Russians. Now, the Ukrainians are saying that they believe the Russians are really running very low, indeed, on cruise missiles. And have run out entirely of those Iranian-made drone missiles for the massive attacks that they've been launching recently.",
