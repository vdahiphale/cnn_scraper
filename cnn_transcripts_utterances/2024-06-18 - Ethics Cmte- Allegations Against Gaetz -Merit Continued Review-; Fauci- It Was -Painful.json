      "sentences": "We just got a rare and rather unusual statement from the House Ethics Committee about its investigation into Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. While the three-year probe into possible sexual misconduct and drug use, among other things, is still going strong, it looks like he may be off the hook for bribery and sharing inappropriate images or videos on the House floor.I want to read you part of the statement that just came out. \"There has been a significant and unusual amount of public reporting on the committee's activities this Congress. Much of that reporting has been inaccurate. Based on its review to date, the committee has determined that certain of the allegations merit continued review. During the course of its investigation, the committee has also identified additional allegations that merit review. Accordingly, the committee is reviewing allegations that Representative Matt Gaetz may have engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\" I'm going to go to CNN Congressional Reporter, Annie Grayer, who has been covering this. Annie, first, I just want to say that we don't hear from the Ethics Committee very much while they are doing a probe. They usually announce it, and they close it, and nothing in between. That's why this is so rare. Explain to our viewers what prompted this statement.",

      "sentences": "Well, the committee, Dana, kind of lays out what prompted this. And there's been a lot of reporting around this investigation is a very high profile case. There are a lot of eyeballs on it and people are eager to see what's going on behind the scenes as the committee's been investigating the congressman for over a couple years now.But yesterday, Congressman Gaetz put out a statement himself making claims about the investigation and calling it frivolous. So this could be, Dana, the committee's attempt to set the record straight here. And it really lays out an investigative roadmap of where the committee has been, what allegations around the congressman they're no longer looking into and what allegations they're going to be focused on. As you mentioned from their statement, it includes allegations of sexual misconduct against the congressman. Now, Congressman Gaetz denies any wrongdoing here. He has -- he claims that this is all because he tried to -- he ousted Kevin McCarthy last year and that this whole investigation is payback for that. Kevin McCarthy has denied that and there's no evidence of this. But the investigations, Dana, into Congressman Gaetz have been sprawling for many years now. The Department of Justice investigated Gates for a number of years, and closed their criminal investigation last year without bringing any charges. But Ethics Committee's statement today shows that they still have a lot of work to do investigating the congressman, and for the first time, we're really getting into a window -- getting a window into where this work has been and where it's going.",

But these press briefings during the COVID pandemic, even going back to the spring of 2020, all of a sudden, things felt very different.There was a collision between politics and science, which had existed before, to be fair, but much stronger collision this time.

They walk out, and then President Trump says, come over here, they walk into another room where there's all these TV screens, and President Trump says to him, take a look at these ratings, they're amazing.So he wasn't, you know, Dr. Fauci did not get the impression the president was angry with him, but was more fascinated by how fascinated the American people were with what was happening with these press briefings.
