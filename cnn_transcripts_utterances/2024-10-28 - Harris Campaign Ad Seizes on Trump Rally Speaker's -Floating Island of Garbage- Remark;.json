Let us just remember what Donald Trump has been saying for the last few days. He's been throwing around the term about how immigrants have turned America into the trash can of the world. That 'trash' word came out of his trash mouth. And let us remember that Donald Trump treated Puerto Rico like trash. Let us remember the way he threw paper towels at needy people after Hurricane Maria, the second class response to Maria in comparison to the red states that have gotten hurricanes that same year. Let's remember when it was reported that he talked about trading Puerto Rico or selling it off, trading it for Greenland. [20:10:06] This should not come as a surprise. I've been saying it for years. Donald Trump is a racist. If you are voting for him, does that make you a racist? That's up to you, but it does mean you are okay with racism.

And in fact, if you look at their TV ads from Sunday that they released, and you listen to what Trump said at the rally it's clearly not on the same measure. They want to talk about the economy and immigration, not all this stupid stuff. But I'm also, let me just put my strategist hat on here for a second. I'm also not going to pretend that if you've lived for the last nine years with Donald Trump and live through everything, everything he said, everything he has done, his presidency, the attacks and everything that's happened, you know, is a no-name comedian's comments or a radio host comments or even Tucker Carlson's comments is going to change your opinion for better or worse?

And he might, and you might be right, but you don't know that.And so I would just caution that it feels close to me. I also feel like Trump has had a pretty good October and he's tracked down this race, I mean, Harris was ahead at the beginning of the month and he's now effectively caught up. I do think there's a pretty good percentage chance that if it tips one way or the other, it may tip everywhere, not just in a state or two, but it may tip more broadly. And finally, to me, the real October surprise is that Kamala Harris still cannot answer basic questions about where she wants to take the country. She's not gotten any better at this since she got into the race and she's having a real trouble closing her campaign on anything other than a purely negative message on Trump. I think the mistake they're making is going fully negative and not telling people what would you do as president? People know what Trump would do, he was the president.

Let me just show you. I have the mini magic with me. This is the 2020 election map. But let me bring up this graphic. It is stunning when you take a look at it. This is the cost of living, an analysis across the United States. If you look closely at the graph, the darker the shading in any county is where the cost of living, housing, food prices, other prices, have outpaced wages over the last six years or so. You see all that dark in there? Those are places where housing costs, energy costs, and more have outpaced what you're getting paid in your paychecks. So let's zoom in on Arizona. Look how dark this state is. Most of the counties filled in, more dark, including Maricopa County, where I am right now. More than six in 10 Arizonans live here in Maricopa County. And look how punishing the cost of living had been. So that is the headwind facing Vice President Harris. Turn on the TV here, turn on the radio here. She's running ads saying her plans, as you were just discussing with the panel, would help with this. Another thing that might help her, though, Anderson, is also the conversation you were just having. There's no question, the cost of living is her headwind.

That's where both campaigns are focusing. But look how close it was in Maricopa County. 50.3 to 48.1. Yes, Joe Biden won by a bit there, but where you saw those voters in that piece? That was here in Pima County. Look at the margin here. This is a big blue area. This is where Harris has to turn out to vote. Biden had a 90,000 plus advantage in that one county. Won the state by 10,000. So you have to go where the Democratic voters are and you have to turn them out.

Of course it's not. [20:45:06] So that Republicans are trying to get their voters out earlier. The big question is, are they getting new voters, low propensity voters who might not show up otherwise? Or are people just enjoying the convenience of voting early so they don't have to wait in line on Election Day? We're not going to know the answer to that question. Are we getting a lot of new voters, or a lot more Republicans just now getting more comfortable with voting early? We won't know that until actually several days after the election when you get final turnout and all of that. But I will tell you quickly, though, this helps the campaigns and this becomes a giant test of the turnout. The get-out- the-vote operations. Because if you vote early, that's a public record. So they know you have voted. So then they go knock at the next house for somebody who hasn't voted. We know the Harris campaign, labor unions, that progressive group you saw me with in my piece in the last block earlier today in Pima County, they know what they're doing. They have deep experience at this. Trump has largely contracted his get-out-the-vote operation out. Maybe they're great. Maybe they'll be perfect. We don't know that yet.

So yes, we are seeing Republicans participate in greater numbers. But I ask operatives all the time, do you know if they are just shifting from Election Day voters to early voters, or if this is new Republican voters coming into the fold? And right now, I will tell you that Democratic operatives tracking this both in the Harris campaign and in other Democratic statewide campaigns, they think state by state, they just see Republicans participating early. The reliable Republican voters. They don't yet. So they claim. And as John said, we won't know the actual answer to this until Election Day.

Maximize turnout in this state. But the last time we were here, not on this trip, we were in Pinal County. And if you see that, that's a county Donald Trump won with 58 percent of the vote. But we were out with Democratic canvasses. A lot of Latinos there who are low propensity voters. And again, if you get to them early and get them to vote, then in the final hours, final days of a campaign, you can dedicate your resources elsewhere. That's why early voting is so important. If you can take people off the table, then it's a much smaller universe that you're targeting, knocking on the doors, trying to get out to vote. And so, this is a giant test of both the tried and true Democratic operation, which had a lot of experience in 2020 and is built from that.

And he acknowledges in his note tonight -- by the way, I've never seen him write an essay like this. It's a reaction to the unprecedented pressure The Post is under. But I think he wrote this tonight because tens of thousands, possibly even hundreds of thousands of subscribers have bailed on The Post in the past few days, even more might do it in the days to come, out of a fear that he's capitulating to Donald Trump, that he's giving in to Trump.Bezos is saying that's not the case. He's doing this as a principal decision, but he's doing it on the eve of an election. And that's really the issue at the heart of this. He acknowledges maybe he had some poor timing, maybe he should have announced this earlier, but he's doing it because he wants to win back people's trust over time. In the short term though, he's lost a lot of his audience's trust. COOPER: The -- he also wrote there's no quid pro quo of any time or there's no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here, that's a quote. The head of his Blue Origin had met with Trump apparently on the day the announcement was made. He says he didn't know about that meeting and it was an unfortunate.",

There's hard pressure, a quid pro quo, a deal with Trump, and then there's a form of soft pressure.And the real concern I'm hearing from post reporters, from editors, from columnists, is that there's a form of soft pressure being applied here. The author of \"On Tyranny,\" Timothy Snyder, has talked for years about the idea of obeying in advance. That in democracies that are studying toward autocracies, people try to obey in advance. That wealthy businessmen, that media leaders, that powerful people, start to give in to the aspiring authoritarian whims in advance. And that's exactly the concern that exists here. In fact, Snyder came out over the weekend and said that's what he thinks is happening at the Washington Post and at the Los Angeles Times.",

And those fears are palpable in other newsrooms as well. I think that's why this story has resonated so wide and so far.
