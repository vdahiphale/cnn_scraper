      "sentences": "Here in New Hampshire, two candidates left with one day to go. Republicans will soon hold their first-in-the-nation primary, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley, the last two candidates standing after Ron DeSantis bowed out on Sunday. It is make or break for Haley here in the Granite State, and she has leveled her strongest attacks at Trump yet, questioning his mental fitness and implying he is \"in decline\", too little too late. Plus, the Democratic primary where Joe Biden is expected to easily win by a write-in campaign. I'll speak to former New Hampshire Governor John Lynch about Biden's reelection message and the long shot challenge posed by Dean Phillips. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Amherst, New Hampshire. It's Monday, January 22. There is just one day until the New Hampshire primary, and only 287 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. And then there were two, with Ron DeSantis out, we now have a head-to-head matchup one day before the New Hampshire Republican primary. And in the latest CNN poll, Donald Trump extends his lead over Nikki Haley to double digits, winning more than 50 percent of the vote. Trump welcomed that endorsement from DeSantis, even promising to retire the Ron DeSanctimonious nickname that he had for the Florida Governor. Haley now has what she wanted. She is the only one standing between Trump and his third GOP nomination. The fate of her campaign rests on her showing right here in the Granite State. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know the political class wants to say that this race is over, and I know the political class is saying everybody needs to get behind Trump. This is not a coronation. You had 56,000 people out of three million in Iowa vote for Donald Trump, less than 1.5 percent of that state. We haven't even started with this election yet.

      "sentences": "Yeah. First, I would note that this is a very impressive and organized and disciplined campaign run by President Trump. In 2016, he ranas a celebrity, really didn't have an organization. 2020, he was the incumbent. This year, he has one of the most sophisticated, best- run presidential primary campaigns I've seen in my career. They're doing it all right. That's requite. I came to New Hampshire seven times last year and I can't even count how many times he has been here already this year. So, they've run a good race. Haley has done a very good job with a campaign starting from ground zero and trying to build up. Here is what I think her best shot is. Even though the polls show Donald Trump very heavily favored by registered Republicans, some of those folks may stay home because they may think this race is over. That could help Haley. The second thing is, our Secretary of State, Dave Scanlon, has predicted that of the 350,000 undeclared voters, we will have a record turnout. As you know, once that gets above 45 percent of independents turning out, that can really help Haley, and now that it's a one-on-one race, I think a lot of people who are undeclared voters, who sometimes take a Democratic ballot will not bother to write-in Joe Biden because it's not really that much of race there, and instead may take a ballot to vote for Haley. So, she has to count on independent and undeclared voters. The President is not correct when he says they're Democrats because they tend to take Republican ballots, witness Chris Sununu and how popular and what overwhelming votes he gets.",

All of the candidates I talked to keep saying, I'm going to wait until it's just me and Donald Trump. And bingo, by the time it gets to them, they were roadkill on the side of the road. I think in 2016 had there been a smaller field, it would have been tougher for Donald Trump. But, let's be candid. He dominates the Republican Party. He is an incumbent President, effectively. The rules of all the different states have been adapted to help him, which every incumbent does. And he has got a very solid base there. So, I think it was different in 2016. If it had been a smaller field, he might not have made it. But now, it's been a very tough road for all these candidates. Haley has done the best job of anybody, and we'll see. Tomorrow is definitely make or break for her. She is going to need a record turnout. And then, after that, it's a very torturous road ahead. But, you got to admire her fighting spirit. Her whole theme of conservatism without chaos and drama and tweeting, I think, appeals to a lot of people. We'll see how it turns out.",

Look, she made an investment in New Hampshire almost a year ago. She spent a lot of time here. She has campaigned the right way, the New Hampshire way.

That's the kind of thing that his campaign is counting on people to turn out, the base Republican supporters. Whereas Nikki Haley, like Steve said, she has got to get these undeclared out, but she has got to get a record number of undeclared voters out, kind of getting people who may not want to participate normally, get them engaged, get them to vote for her.

And so, I think from Nikki Haley's perspective, she is trying to pump the brakes and say, listen, let's, give New Hampshire voters a chance to speak, and then let's see where we are. And I think from her perspective, if she does well here tomorrow night, she has got a case to go, a strong case to go on to her home state of South Carolina. But, make no mistake, the Trump campaign, as Steve said, is much better organized than they were eight years ago. They're tough. They're smart.

I think she could have been more aggressive earlier on and saying, I'll have a foreign policy where I don't engage in name calling with our allies, and I show consistency and make no doubt about it. Putin is a thug who needs to be stopped. I mean, that was John McCain's whole theme back when he was arguing for the surge, which was wildly unpopular with most voters, but they understood you need to be aggressively strong and stand up for American ideals. I don't know why she didn't emphasize that more other than the fact that I think people who are supporting Donald Trump and who are not ready to vote for Biden, President Biden, in the general election, are worried about the economy, gas prices, food prices, inflation, in New Hampshire, housing shortage. The border has been a disaster. And I think that plays to President Trump's strengths. So, I don't know why she didn't emphasize it earlier.
