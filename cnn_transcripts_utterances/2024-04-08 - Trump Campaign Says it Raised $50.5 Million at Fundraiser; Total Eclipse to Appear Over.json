The former president also now, again, comparing himself to Nelson Mandela.An engine cover coming loose on takeoff, forcing a Southwest flight to make an emergency landing. And the countdown's on. Are you all set for today's total solar eclipse? Six a.m. here in Washington, a live look at the Washington Monument on this Monday morning. The sun still hasn't made any appearance here in Washington yet today. It's going to be the star of the show throughout the afternoon. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Former President Donald Trump this weekend both comparing himself to Nelson Mandela again, and also telling wealthy donors, according to \"The New York Times,\" that he likes immigrants from nice countries like Denmark, and promising guests at the Palm Beach mansion that he was speaking at, that they were safe, for now, from undocumented immigrants living across the river in the more diverse West Palm Beach. The Trump campaign claimed that they raised over $50 million at the event, doubling President Biden's record haul in New York last night. Last month, excuse me. Trump, according to \"The Times,\" was defending his remarks as president when he had lamented that immigrants were coming from \"s- hole\" countries. You may remember that. \"The Times\" also reported that Trump said that President Biden has, quote, \"soiled the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. Trump said, according to \"The Times,\" \"I mean that literally, which is sad.\" \"The Times\" then writes this: \"The attendee who witnessed the moment said that dinner guests laughed, and that Mr. Trump's remark was interpreted as the former president saying that Mr. Biden had defecated on the desk.\" This, of course, is the same guy who again posted on social media this weekend, comparing himself to Nelson Mandela, as he did back in October. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT/2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you want to challenge the result of an election, they hound you. Look what happened this weekend with two good people. They hound them, and they scare them, and they've -- but we don't get scared. We don't get scared. I'll tell you what. I don't mind being Nelson Mandela, because I'm doing it for a reason. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But will the general election be a different story, right? He's now in -- he's supposed to be in persuasion mode, trying to bring in skeptical voters, whether they're, you know, Republicans who cast a vote for Nikki Haley in the primary, or independents and even conservative Democrats.

The South Carolina Gamecocks finishing a perfect season and taking home their third NCAA title, posting an 87-to-75 victory over superstar guard Caitlin Clark and her Iowa Hawkeyes. In an emotional moment after the game, South Carolina coach Dawn Staley thanked Caitlin Clark for, quote, \"lifting up our sport.\" If you haven't heard by now, there's an eclipse today. How much of it you're going to see depends on exactly where you're going to be. Our meteorologist, Allison Chinchar, joins us now with the forecast. Allison, what are people going to -- going to -- What should they expect today?",

And that's going to entirely depend on where you plan to view it.Look, there are going to be some fantastic spots to view across the country, especially across these areas of the Mississippi and Ohio River Valley. Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Carbondale, Illinois; Evansville, Indiana, all looking to be very nice spots. And another good section farther off to the North, basically from Burlington, Vermont, up through Caribou, Maine. Also going to have plenty of sunshine there. Now there will be a couple of trouble spots. Namely say, for that Erie, Pennsylvania, up through Rochester, New York, and most of the eclipse path for Texas and the bulk of Arkansas, as well. And the main concern there is the fact that we expect some strong to severe thunderstorms. Now, the bulk of those storms are actually going to come after the eclipse. But we all know those clouds build ahead of time. So you're going to really start to see that increasing cloud cover as we go through the day today. And then as folks are leaving, they may have to encounter some of that large hail, damaging winds and, yes, even potentially some tornadoes as we spread Eastward into places like Shreveport and even Jackson, Mississippi. So if the folks live home there, but maybe you're traveling, they may encounter some of those thunderstorms on their way back.",
