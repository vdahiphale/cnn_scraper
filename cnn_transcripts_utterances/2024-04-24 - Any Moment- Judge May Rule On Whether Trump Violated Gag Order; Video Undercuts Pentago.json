I think we all know which one would be more convincing to former President Trump when it comes to getting him to stay within the lines here. And to that point, Joey, CNN's John Miller has reported that the Secret Service, court officers and NYC Corrections have been quietly discussing what happens if Trump ends up being jailed for contempt. If he continues to violate the gag order, do you see any scenario where that would actually happen?",

Number one, if we accept the proposition that no one is above the law, the options we looked at just there, right, there's the admonishment, but we also looked at the monetary $1,000 punishment.Guess what? Wasn't there just a civil proceeding wherein there's a half a billion-dollar judgment or so against the former president? Has that prevented him from doing anything? Hasn't there been an E. Jean Carroll defamation case too, right? I mean, one relating to allegations of sexual assault, wherein there's up to $90 million. What has that done? And so it gets us, Brianna, to your question of the other option, which is jail. Now potentially, you know, you have a maximum of 30 days under the law. Does that mean he puts him in? That is the judge at some point for a few hours as you put him in overnight. But it has to be a real possibility. And obviously the Secret Service and interested parties have to do it in a way where they're ready for such a contingency. Now, there may be other ramifications to that, I think, you know, that have to weigh on the judge, not only of this proceeding, but you know, how might there be a public reaction, right? We can say that, hey, the judge shouldn't be considering that. But you know, I just think people are so entrenched in their views that the judge has to consider everything in terms of safety. And incarceration, though, to get the president -- former president, to do what he's supposed to do and what everyone else really kind of does all the time, which is to follow judicial orders. And if not, they're in contempt, I think has to be on the table.",

They said their review, released earlier this month, focused not on gunfire but the bomber and events leading up to the blast, but found no new evidence of a complex attack and uncovered no new assertions of outgoing fire, having no materialistic impact on the original investigation.

Also key to this is the reaction of the families of the 13 U.S. service members who died. They have already at times expressed their dissatisfaction at the official Pentagon narrative. And we've also just heard in the last hours on X.com from Republican congressman from Florida, Mike Waltz. He actually said that 2.5 years have passed and now new questions are still emerging about the Abbey Gate bombing. He says, \"I was just briefed last week on the second investigation into the bombing and was told the opposite of this reporting.\" He's referencing our report there. He says, \"My heart breaks for the 13 gold star members who can't get closure or accountability on this tragedy.\" And that's ultimately what we're talking about here. That the grieving process palpable at times public amongst those who survived or those who lost people in this Afghan as well is hampered by the truth, it seems, not quite having been laid bare yet. We do know that the Pentagon are in possession of video. They've put that out in a Freedom of Information Act request. The fact that it's been viewed by the generals in charge was acknowledged during a congressional briefing. So the Pentagon probably know more about this than they've made public in terms of video.
