They have been willing to say yes, we're going to mess around with the debt ceiling. Yes, we're going to just shut down the government not to get what we want. Whereas, the moderates are much more focused on governing and they feel like that's their imperative. And in some ways, it's given them less power in some of these really down and dirty fights because they've wanted to say OK, I'd rather just avoid the chaos. How much do you think that plays in here? I mean, the moderates would really have to be willing to draw a hard line in the sand and potentially, cause a prolonged fight or more days and weeks without a speaker if they want to say, like, you've got to listen to us and not -- and not the hardliners?

Former President Trump is dropping a lawsuit against his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. That happened Thursday, just four days before Trump was to sit for a deposition in the case. Trump sued Cohen for $500 million, claiming that he breached his professional duties as attorney by speaking out in the media. Cohen, for his part, tells me this morning that the case is, quote, \"Nothing more than a retaliatory intimidation tactic.\" And lawyers defending conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell and his company, My Pillow, moved Thursday to withdraw from the case.

That's a massive toll on that tiny village.And I think when you look at the number of people injured -- just six people injured -- that also tells you the nature of the strike -- big, fast, and deadly. It hit a cafe and store while the villagers were attending the funeral for one of the villagers there. Not clear why the Russians targeted it but look, the missile that they used is a high-precision, highly expensive Iskander short-range ballistic missile. What does that really mean? Three million dollars. Russia doesn't throw those around without good reason. It's not like the cheap drones that it throws up a dozen or so of every night. This one had a specific mission. In this case, it was to wipe out the lives of all those villagers. The missile itself weighs about 8,000 pounds and it's got about 1,000 pounds of explosives packed into it. And that's why these images we're looking at right now show so much destruction. We were looking at aerial pictures earlier on today and you could see the whole of the center of this village completely flattened. What we heard from President Zelenskyy yesterday was the only way to combat this kind of strike is to get better air defenses on Ukraine, and that's kind of reflected this morning. There have been airstrikes in Kharkiv not so far away. Twenty-seven people injured there; a 10- year-old boy killed in that strike. And more strikes in the south of the country. So this is indicative of what Russia can do. It's got the power and it's got the precision to find targets but it's just so unclear why they would target so many civilians attending a funeral -- Kasie.",
