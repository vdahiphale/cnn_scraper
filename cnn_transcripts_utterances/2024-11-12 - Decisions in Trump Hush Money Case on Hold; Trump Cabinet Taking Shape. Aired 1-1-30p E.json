Again, these are people who don't necessarily have to go through the traditional traps here. They are people who are one of -- some of his staunchest loyalists. They are people who are on the campaign plane with them every day for the last several months of the campaign. They include Dan Scavino, who ran his social media and then became a top adviser. It also includes James Blair, who ran his entire political operation, as well as Stephen Miller, which we reported yesterday. There are a couple of other names we're trying to run down to make sure that they will be part of that. But, again, these are loyalists who will be part of that team. So now let's talk about those big names, the ones that you just mentioned, in terms of Marco Rubio, Kristi Noem, Mike Waltz. This is really showing you how the Trump administration is going to prioritize the next four years, particularly when it comes to national security. These are not necessarily, when it comes to Mike Waltz and Marco Rubio, people who are going to beat the hammer home on this isolationist, make America great or America first only policy. These are people who have a little bit more of a nuanced view.But one thing that they both agree on, they both agree on the fact that China is essentially a number one enemy. And that was one of Donald Trump's big promises, was to take on China. So you're probably going to see a lot of that once they get into office. The other big thing we're watching, of course, is the immigration space. Now, one of the most interesting things that Donald Trump has, done we talked about Stephen Miller. He's going to be the deputy director of policy, as well as Tom Homan, who is tapped to be a border czar. Neither of those positions have to be approved by Congress. And those two people are likely to be the most powerful people when it comes to immigration, people who have already advised him who are already making plans to implement some of that policy, particularly when it comes to mass deportations.",

They all question open-ended support of the war in Ukraine. Marco Rubio, for example, suggesting that basically Ukraine should just give up the 20 percent of their country that Russia has seized at this point through some sort of settlement, some sort of a deal. He may have more details on that, but that's generally what they're driving at. They're all hard-liners on Iran and they all agree that there is a border crisis that has to be addressed. In this sense, none of them would be a problem for Donald Trump. They're all pushing and pulling the same direction that he wants to go.

Now, that's not to say that they don't favor a strong and independent Ukraine. They just disagree with the Biden administration's level of support, saying that it will be with you as long as it takes. Mike Waltz in fact wrote recently that is a recipe for disaster. It's not just about Ukrainian compromise either. It is pressuring Russia in a way economically, militarily that would also bring them to the table in a way that a political, diplomatic solution could be negotiated sooner.

They have been very critical of the Biden administration, accusing them of not supporting Israel enough when it comes to their needs and desires to eradicate Hezbollah and Hamas, accusing the Biden administration of hamstringing Israel when it comes to Iran and going after their nuclear program, and in fact saying that Israel should have gone farther in the most recent response to that ballistic attack by Iran.",

Both Waltz and Rubio do see the wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine as distractions from confronting the big adversary, the main adversary, which is China, when it comes to China's movements in the Asia-Pacific around Taiwan. We have seen Senator Rubio be a leader in terms of identifying TikTok as a real national security threat, highlighting how much intelligence gathering and spying China is doing here in the United States. China really has been Rubio's bailiwick as the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee. We have also heard from Mike Waltz writing recently in \"The Economist\" that China has been the biggest beneficiary of America's deterrence failures, another critique of the Biden administration. I think you're absolutely right that, of course, these men are well aware that they have got a fall in line and they're basically going to implement whatever Trump's ideas are.

So they have asked the judge to give them a week to sort through what their recommendation would be for the next steps in this case, whether that would be continuing to proceed on the question of immunity and have the judge issue his decision, if they want to continue to postpone that now that Trump is in office. It's really unclear where that's going to go. And this is all because Donald Trump's team is pushing to still seek to have this case thrown out on a number of grounds, both this immunity question in light of the Supreme Court decision, but also because Trump is now the president-elect. And there's Justice Department policy on federal cases, big questions of, does that apply in any way to state cases? So be really key to see what prosecutors say next week about what they think the appropriate steps forward will be that will help guide what this judge is going to decide.

The law is pretty clear that that's the case that he cannot while he's sitting as president, so you put that away. Then, the separate question of, is a president of the United States immune from certain acts that might have been conducted when he was a president, right? Now, that's a hard one, and that's what Judge Merchan was sorting out today. And I think it's notable that both parties agreed to take more time to sort this question out.

Now, I know that might sound silly, but the simple fact is, you have a defendant with some infirmity that means he can't go to jail or can't be sentenced, but you can wait until after it's done. A great example is, if somebody were overseas, you couldn't prosecute them then, but the moment they step foot in the United States, you do. That can take years sometimes, but it does happen, and it's not uncommon. I know it sounds odd, because many people want this result in either direction to happen now, but the simple fact is, you have a defendant with a once-in-a-generation, if not once-in-history infirmity, and I'm going to use that word, for being prosecuted.
