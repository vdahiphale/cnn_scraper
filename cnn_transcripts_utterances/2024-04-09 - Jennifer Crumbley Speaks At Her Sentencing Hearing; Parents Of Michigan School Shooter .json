It is something that could happen to any of us. And people fail to realize what this (inaudible) shows the court through numerous letters of support, that this is humbly does have a kind heart. She does have compassion. She has spent night after night, crying not for only herself and her son, but also for the victims and for what her son did and what she will live with, knowing he did and what she missed all the years forward. At the end of the day, we asked the court to look at Ms. Crumbley's role in the offenses. We asked the court to consider that while she did not oppose having a gun in her home, she was not the person who was responsible for storing the gun and believed it was being stored properly and that it was locked. Ms. Crumbley obviously testified and all of the evidence at trial, so she believes there was a stream live (inaudible). MATHEWS: (inaudible) because you spend a lot of time talking about the fact that she didn't tell anybody about the gun. She didn't lie. She wasn't responsible for it. But at one time she was texting her husband to see whether or not he got the gun and how much it was. She posted pictures of it as her son's Christmas present. She was shocked. And I don't know if you're aware of this.

And what they are discussing is the sentencing for his parents who were already convicted earlier this year of involuntary manslaughter. Now, the question is, how long will they be in prison?I want to go straight to Jean Casarez, who has been following this trial since the beginning. And Jean, these four students killed at Oxford High School, not just four students, but also there was a teacher who was wounded, and six others also were wounded. Just before a fortnight -- just four students were murdered. And listening, Jean, to their parents, talk in such vivid and yet kind of mundane terms about what it was like, not only the day that they were killed, regular days for their teenage kids, but also hold the things that the kids will miss in their lives because Ethan Crumbley 15 at the time, murdering them in cold blood. And the question is the culpability today of their parents. We know that they've already been found culpable, but how much they will serve to pay their whatever debt that can be paid?",

Just as a reminder, James Crumbley just like his wife Jennifer, were each separately convicted on four counts of involuntary manslaughter.And one of the reasons at least for James Crumbley is because prosecutors said that the parents showed a quote, chilling lack of remorse. And for him -- for James Crumbley, the prosecuting attorney Karen McDonald, said that Crumbley called threatening. Saying there will be retribution, believe me. Jean Casarez, I know that you're still here with us. That is a very different approach that you just heard him take now, which to me sounded a lot more contrite than Jennifer Crumbley and her speech just shortly before he spoke. A tearful saying that I know you don't believe me to the family members of the four teenagers whom his son killed. I'm sorry for your loss.

Dana, there was this appeal that Donald Trump -- his team took to the court today over the gag order that he is under where he can't speak about witnesses, court staff, the D.A.'s office, even the judges' family.His attorneys in those arguments said, he might be rude, but this isn't incitement. This is something that is causing Donald Trump irreparable harm. And there apparently was a request to delay the case on the table as well from his team. That's not going to happen. According to the reporting we're getting out of our team in New York. Just after that appeal was heard, we get the decision. Just a few minutes ago, there isn't going to be a delay of the trial because of this gag order issue. The D.A.'s office was clearly successful in arguing to the appellate judge that the witnesses are hesitant that this gag order is within the law. So, there's going to be a flurry of things that happen as we await the beginning of this trial on Monday. And that flurry right now is Donald Trump's team making these requests to delay, to move the case out of New York to challenge the gag order. And the appeals court in New York Supreme Court, they're looking at these quite quickly and giving same day decisions.",

First of all, even if there was going to be some modification, some change to the gag order made by the appeals court, that would have nothing to do with this trial starting as scheduled on Monday, April 15.And second of all, this gag order is very narrow. It's actually quite remarkable to hear Donald Trump say it infringes on his rights or it's impeding his ability to defend himself because all that the gag order does is it prohibits Donald Trump from commenting publicly about jurors, about witnesses, and then about court and prosecutor, staff and family members. He is free and he has taken full advantage of his freedom to attack the case, the judge himself and the D.A. himself. So, it's no surprise Donald Trump lost this one. And as Katelyn said, he's been losing these arguments really quickly.

Have you ever considered yourself a supporter of or belonged to any of the following. The QAnon movement, Proud Boys, OathKeepers, Three Percenters, Boogaloo Boys, Antifa. Elie, can you -- I mean, the question is pretty straightforward. The idea is they're trying to weed out people who are pro Trump, we should also give some context. This is Manhattan. And this is a place where Joe Biden won by 86.7 percent, Donald Trump by 12.3 percent. I guess there certainly could be part of that 12.3 percent in the potential jury pool.",
