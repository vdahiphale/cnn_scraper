No, it really does seem because of the war in Lebanon, now, the escalating tensions with Iran, the idea of sort of having escalation for de- escalation to get to a peace deal with Hamas, to get the hostages home just seemed as distant or even more distant than it was a couple of weeks ago. It's become more complicated, more intertwined. The idea to get -- to get Hamas to stop their fight in the north, to then get a deal with Hamas in the south, there's nothing on the horizon that indicates that that's coming soon.",

And now, we're facing this additional threat. So, this is a very fluid situation, 5:00 a.m. is the update time from the National Hurricane Center. So, we're getting the latest information. So, this has actually strengthened overnight. It is now a Category two, and the storm has got a lot of interesting dynamics. This is also new as well, because we're seeing the first watches and watches ahead of Milton into portions of Tampa Bay. In fact, all of Tampa Bay inland, just north of Tampa, southward including Fort Myers as well as Naples. We remember what happened in September of 2022 with Hurricane Ian. We are facing a storm surge threat, flash-flooding threat and catastrophic wind threat as well. Hurricane Milton, 100 mile per-hour winds, it is a Category two as we speak, it's been meandering across the Bay of Campeche, threatening the northern Yucatan Peninsula through the course of the day today. Here's the forecast track. This is important. It has slowed down in its arrival time, so, we believe this is more of a Wednesday night into Thursday morning landfall as it approaches this region, it will be in a weakening phase, but that means it will expand and the impacts of the storm will be felt well outside of the center. Here's the first stab at the storm surge values, Kasie, 8 to 12 feet in Tampa Bay, that is higher than the record-setting storm surge values that Helene brought two weeks ago.",
