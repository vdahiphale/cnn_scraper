So officials are pushing back against a legal agreement that says they have to provide emergency housing. This week, the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams is traveling through Latin America where he says he will discourage migrants from coming to New York. And in Chicago, the governor, JB Pritzker and the mayor, Brandon Johnson confronted top White House officials demanding, they take steps to address the migrant crisis. President Biden pledged in 2020 to never build another foot of wall along the U.S. Mexico border saying that it was not a serious policy solution, but now citing high illegal entry, his administration has just announced it will waive 26 federal laws in order to build and add 20 more miles of border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley. It`s an area with especially high illegal entries. From last October to August, there were nearly 300,000 encounters there. There are no easy solutions. And the number of border crossings is expected to increase further as local and federal agencies continue to grapple with solutions. Ten second trivia. Kubal is the capital city of what country? Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, or Yemen? Kabul is the capital of Afghanistan. A nation of about 39 million people. Next, we have a story about a courageous group of young women in Afghanistan who are having to secretly get an education. The Taliban, a radical group took over the country in 2021 after the U.S. controversially pulled out its troops. And that`s when life got difficult, especially for women. They shut down schools for women. They ban them from public spaces, but we`re about to meet a group of young women who are sneaky and secretly getting an education because they feel it`s absolutely worth the risk. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Around 30 students huddle into this little room to learn everything from science to math, to tailoring and drawing. This is one of nine secret schools that educate more than 400 girls across eight Afghan provinces. It is operated by a clan destined network called SRAK. Families find the program through word of mouth and demand is growing. It was founded by this woman, Parasto Hakim. She says because of her activism, she was recently forced to flee Afghanistan. But in the summer of 2021, as Kabul fell to the Taliban, she tells us she anticipated the ban on female education and got to work.

Brave women and girls dreaming of a future without the Taliban and boldly preparing to step out into the light again. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
