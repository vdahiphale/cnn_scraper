It wouldn't get them all the way to 270. But let's be real about this and realistic about this. If Donald Trump is winning all three of those, it is a very safe bet, that he's winning at least one, if not two or more of the remaining states. Now, Nevada would not be enough electoral votes to get Trump over the top. You see, would just get him to 269. But again, if he's winning, the blue wall states again like he did in 2016, he's going to be the president, without a doubt. COOPER: As we mentioned, you've been in five swing states in five days.

And they're not telling anybody, but they're going to vote Trump.And then you meet other people and some have walked up to me and even said, this is happening in their own family, where they're in Republican families but the woman, the partner is going to at least the woman is going to vote for Kamala Harris because of the Dobbs decision, because of reproductive rights, because of Donald Trump's toxic character sometimes. So both sides think there's a secret vote out here. I'll tell you here in Swarthmore, this is a very liberal community. This is one of the suburbs where the vice president has to run it up. One thing you do find here, and you find this among a lot of Democrats, is a little bit of anxiety. It is this 2020 where you run it up in the suburbs and you win the close races, or is it 2016, a lot of people have raised this question, where a little bit of sexism and maybe a little bit of racism now in Harris' case, kicks in and cost her just a little bit of the vote.

First off, we get told we can't call Trump a fascist. And we can't say he's a threat to democracy because, oh, my God, that's going to create violence. But he can say Liz Cheney on a battlefield or he didn't say battlefield with nine guns pointed at her face, an oddly specific number by the way, and you can tell in his mind he may have been thinking about battle, but then he's visualizing nine guns pointing at Liz Cheney's face. So look, I've lived this stuff. We're talking about people's lives here. Why we can't just have a grown up for once doesn't have to go that route. And lastly, let me say this, if Donald Trump is saying that anybody who is scared of battle somehow can't have an opinion or can't do anything regarding national defense then what the hell is he doing running for president? Because there is nobody watching this show right now that believes that Donald Trump wouldn't be scared to death if he was on the field of battle.

We had 21-year wars in Afghanistan and that's why people are weary today about further entanglement and getting caught up in more wars.

He's repeatedly, his words have repeatedly led to violence and you know, there's no question left about who Donald Trump is.So from my perspective, I think the campaign is going to lean into to the point that there's a choice here in this election and, you know, if Donald Trump wins, it really says more about the character of this nation than it does about Donald Trump, that people are going to go into the booth and affirm that this is the person that they want representing them in the world. They're going to condone this type of action and corrosive, violent, dangerous actions from the president. I mean, actions I wouldn't even condone from my nine-year-old. So for me, it really leaves this -- begs this question of the 48 percent that's holding firm behind Donald Trump, where, you know, what is beyond the pale anymore?

These were late adds to his schedule. You don't normally go to a battleground state four times in three days if you're not at least somewhat concerned about shoring it up. So, you know, all of these states are within margins of error. And again, the Trump team has felt very good about it based on their read of early vote data.

Then you have to take that small envelope and put it into a larger envelope called the declaration envelope. And then you have your package ready to go, you mail it in and you're good. If you do that, your vote will be counted. The problem is, a lot of voters in Pennsylvania, thousands forget the secrecy envelope and they just take the ballot and they put it in the declaration envelope. Now, under the law of Pennsylvania, this ballot would be void, it's no good. Democrats didn't like that. They sued and they won. And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said if a person just sends in the ballot without the secrecy envelope, then the voter can still go cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday on election day. Now, Republicans didn't like that. So Republicans asked the US Supreme Court to step in and just an hour ago, the US Supreme Court said, no, we're not stepping in. So it goes back to where we were, which is this. If you are a voter in Pennsylvania and you think you've sent in your ballot without the secrecy ballot, you think you screwed up somehow, you can still go to the balloting place, the voting place on Tuesday and put in a provisional vote and it will be counted.",

He has had this conversation with Trump before in late 2016 or early 2017 during the transition when Trump was elected then. Trump was very skeptical of childhood vaccines during his own presidential race in 2016. So there is a like mindedness. And also when Trump says things like, I'm going to let him go nuts. Most federal agencies Trump didn't have that much interest in. He cared about the Defense Department, the Justice Department, and the intelligence community.
