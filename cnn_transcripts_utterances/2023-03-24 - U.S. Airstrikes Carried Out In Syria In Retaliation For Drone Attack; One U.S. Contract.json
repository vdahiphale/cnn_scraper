      "sentences": "Developing this morning. A U.S. contractor is dead and five U.S. troops are wounded after a suspected Iranian-backed drone hit a U.S. housing facility in Northeast Syria. In response, President Biden authorized what the U.S. calls a precision strike on facilities used by the groups affiliated with Iran. You're looking at the aftermath here. CNN's M.J. Lee is at the White House for us this morning.M.J. I know the president is in Canada, and he made this call for the retaliation while there. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, John. You know these were urgent deliberations that were taking place as President Biden was traveling up to Canada last night. So, let me just catch you up on exactly what we know from these developments overnight. We know that A suspected Iranian drone struck a facility in Syria that was housing U.S. personnel and that resulted in the killing of one American contractor and injuring five U.S. service members. And in response to that we saw President Biden authorize a precision airstrike in Eastern Syria that targeted Iranian affiliated facilities. Now, we saw Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, describing the strike as proportionate and deliberate action. And he said that the strike was aimed at both limiting escalation and also limiting casualties as well. And this morning what we're hearing from senior White House officials is a warning that the U.S. This will continue to retaliate if the administration sees that as being necessary. This is what NSC Spokesperson John Kirby said this morning on our air. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESPERSON: We've got militant groups that are supported by Iran, that are the ones conducting these attacks against our troops and our facilities. We're going to continue to do whatever we can to defend themselves. And if we have to retaliate, like we did yesterday, we'll do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Lee, thank you, as always.Ukrainian officials say deadly new Russian airstrikes targeted civilians overnight. At least two people were killed in the northern region. Three others were killed when a Russian missile hit the Eastern Donetsk region. Also, this morning, we are learning heartbreaking new details about a Russian operation, taking Ukrainian children. Now, just days ago, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and his deputy for forcibly deporting children. CNN's David McKenzie and his team travel close to the front lines to investigate what happened. David, thanks for being with us. Tell us what you found.",

So, I love it.So, this has been seven years in the making, this ski collision that took place in Deer Valley, a very upscale place to ski in Park City, Utah. And he says, that she barreled into him, causing him to break four ribs to have a myriad of brain issues and cognitive issues. We heard his daughter testify yesterday, saying that her father's processing speed appeared to have changed and that she would find him being almost reclusive. And that this was a guy that she called a goer and a doer and somebody that was just very much involved in the family. Now, Gwyneth Paltrow, although we are expecting to potentially hear from her later this afternoon, court has just begun moments ago. She says, he barreled into me. And that due to, like, Utah ski laws if I'm downhill, which I was, and he scooped -- skied into me, it's his fault. But again, no cameras. We have eyewitnesses from both sides that say totally different things. So, this is going to be up to those jurors to decide who seems more believable. Yesterday, we also heard from a neuropsychologist who treated Terry Sanderson saying that he did have some issues and that these were real things. But then he was cross examined by Gwyneth Paltrow's lawyer who said, but could it have been caused by something else? And she said, maybe. So again, Gwyneth Paltrow, seven years later, countersuing for just a dollar on the principle that she wants to say -- because it's not about the money for her. It's just $300,000, which just obviously that's a lot of money.",

They're -- the FTC is proposing fining businesses up to $50,000 a day if they go through these different hoops and create these different tactics.
