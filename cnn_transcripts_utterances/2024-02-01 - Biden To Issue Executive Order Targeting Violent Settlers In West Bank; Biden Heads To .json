President Biden is on his way to a must win state, trying to lock down key voting blocks that could give him an edge in that tight battleground.Plus, gut punch. That's how Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is describing his prostate cancer diagnosis, as he admits for the first time publicly that it was wrong to keep his surgery and hospitalization private. And a CNN exclusive. District attorney leading the Georgia election case against Trump is refusing to step down, amid allegations she had an affair with the lead prosecutor. We'll tell you why she's defiant. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start in Michigan, where President Biden is about to meet with a group of voters critical to winning this battleground state union workers. Just hours before the president's trip, CNN learned he plans to issue an executive order targeting violent settlers in the West Bank. The White House is clearly hoping that will help with another key constituency in Michigan, Muslim Americans. CNN's MJ Lee is in Detroit where the president is heading. MJ, you broke the story about this executive order. What more can you tell us about what's behind it aside from what appears to be pretty obvious politically?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Dana. You know, this certainly takes aim at an issue that has been of a growing concern for President Biden and his White House. And that is the intensifying settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. We've heard the president condemned this kind of violence.We know that privately he has spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And we're just getting the details of this executive order that is coming today, which would impose sanctions on four Israeli settlers. We are told who had been accused of engaging in these kinds of violent acts against Palestinians in the West Bank. All of this, of course, comes at such a critical moment for this president, as he has come under growing pressure over the Israel-Hamas war. Of course, there has been a lot of criticism for the president's support for Israel as the war has continued on. And a lot of people have sort of said he is responsible in part for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. And we've seen his political support eroding among some younger voters, progressives and voters of color, including among the Arab American community. And there is a significant Arab American population here in Michigan, which is where the president is headed this afternoon. Now, the plan for this afternoon is for the president to meet with members of the UAW. The campaign is obviously trying to capitalize on that coveted political endorsement that he received last week. And for now, there aren't any official plans for the president to meet with any leaders or members of the Arab American community. But that's a space that we'll be watching really closely, as again the president is trying to feel these criticisms, these concerns, and trying to make sure that the erosion of support that we have seen so far that doesn't become a bigger erosion and a bigger problem as we head into November.

Perhaps you can see behind me here a truck is just pulled up, knowing that we're doing a live shot here.But Dana, this is a bigger piece of this building the coalition over the next 10 months. It's a challenge the Biden campaign knows they have, but it's one of the reasons the president is coming here. And of course, they hope to privately perhaps meet with some leaders, it's unclear if that will happen. There is no doubt.

But even now, he's trying to given the fact that it's been so long, trying to do something definitely stopping short of a ceasefire. We can talk about that policy later on.Let's zero in on the union vote in Michigan and elsewhere. You covered Donald Trump. And what is so interesting it has been since Donald Trump has been on the political scene is the way that he has taken some of the rank-and-file union vote to from Democrats. And if you just kind of take a look at where the latest polling is. This is a union household in swing states that even 47, 47. And I want our viewers to listen to what Donald Trump said as he was very actively according, the endorsement from the Teamsters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Usually a Republican wouldn't get that endorsement for many, many years. They only do Democrats. But in my case is different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.

They want to peel away, not necessary leadership.We know that Shawn Fain, the President of the United Auto Workers union, came out and endorsed Biden last week. But they're really going after these rank-and-file members, many of whom did support Donald Trump in 2016, that they think they can pull away and peel away from Joe Biden. And that's also part of their large working class voter argument. They really have been ramping up their messaging and their strategy in these key battleground states going after the working-class vote. And they do see organized labor as being a key part of that.

And it was really our first chance to see him in person since he returned to the Pentagon on Monday after nearly a month in the hospital, following complications from that procedure to treat prostate cancer.It was notable and you see it right there. As he walked up to the podium for his opening statement, he was visibly walking slower and visibly limping. He said he is recovering and recovering well, but he is still feeling pain and still undergoing physical therapy for treatment for the pain that he's feeling. Unclear he said on how much longer that will take, but he said he is still expected to improve the feeling the ability to use his leg there. So, this this whole medical procedure is ongoing. You heard him a moment ago issue an apology for his failure to notify the administration, the president, the public and the press. He was pressed repeatedly on why he made that decision. He says there was no order given, neither by him nor his staff members to keep this secret or to keep it hidden. It was also pressed on whether there was a culture of secrecy. He insists there was not a culture of secrecy around this. He says the news when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December, shook him like a gut punch and his instinct was to try to keep this private and to handle it privately a decision, he says in hindsight was a mistake for which he apologized including directly to President Joe Biden. Whether his staff or have discussions around what his staff may have said or instructed. He said that will be part of an ongoing 30-day review. That's frankly due in just a few days now. I had a chance to ask him first, would he commit to making that review public? And second, would there be any consequences for his Chief of Staff Kelly Magsamen, because the Pentagon has said she is the one who should have passed on notification to the administration, but she didn't because she had the flu.

He was pressing, like, how could you possibly during all of that time, not have thought to call the president and tell him what's going on. And he was -- he was just describing, and he says that was wrong, but describing being in a mindset of not wanting to burden anybody else most specifically, the president with his own personal health problems.",

Again, we know what's wrong. He's Secretary Austin, so he doesn't get that right to privacy, maybe that a private citizen would.

I think that is what a lot of people wanted to hear and needed to hear from Secretary Austin after having kept this private, and obviously not hearing from him in over a month, as Oren said.The thing that I am interested in -- I am interested in to see how this report does come out because he did, you know, bring up his aides and think about the ambulance where they turned off the lights. Those sorts of decisions, saying that it wasn't his decision. He kind of cast blame in a couple of places.
