Trump's former top general telling Bob Woodward, Trump is the most dangerous person in the country and fears Trump will court-martial him if he wins. And Iran furiously working the phones tonight, nervous about Israel targeting its nuclear sites. CNN has some new details just coming in from Tehran this hour. Let's go OUTFRONT. Well, good evening. I'm Pamela Brown, in for Erin Burnett tonight. J.D. Vance in denial again and again and again. In a stunning new interview with \"The New York Times\", Lulu Garcia-Navarro, who is a frequent guest here on our program, and he will join me in a moment, Garcia-Navarro pushes Vance five times and five times. Vance refuses to say if he believes Trump lost the 2020 election. Just watch.

VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think that Donald Trump and I have both raised a number of issues with the 2020 election, but were focused on the future. I think there's an obsession here with focusing on 2020. I'm much more worried about what happened after 2020, which is a wide-open border, groceries that are unaffordable and look -- GARCIA-NAVARRO: Senator, yes or no?",

Lulu, let's start with you. We've seen -- we've watched it tonight several times. You gave Vance a lot of opportunity to say Trump lost the election. What was going through your mind as he pushed back the second time, the third time, and on and on? I think one of the things that's really important to understand is this is one of the key questions of the selection we've seen in polls, we've seen over and over voters saying that democracy is also on the ballot. People are concerned about this issue, 2020 is on their minds, and Donald Trump has refused to acknowledge that he lost that election. J.D. Vance is a hair's breath from becoming the vice president of this country. And so pressing him on this issue is important because we know over and over again that it is a lie, the big lie, at the center of what Donald Trump requires people around him to say. And so by pressing him over and over again, really there is just one question and there are two answers the question was the one that I said and the answer is yes or no. And the fact that he couldn't give a yes or no, I think is extremely telling, and what I'm doing there is really tried to make sure that the voters there's understand the position that J.D. Vance holds, and by extension, the Trump campaign.",

Vance is doing essentially whatever a running mate has always had to do, and yes, this is a different issue that's come up before. Yes, it's a different topic. We're not talking about adjusting your position on, you know, taxes or abortion or anything like that, but he is aligning himself with what Donald Trump has said, which is essentially his job as a running mate. And so, you know, I think that's essentially what he was doing. I will say I do give them a little bit of credit for at least engaging with \"The New York Times\".

Remember back to the Republican primary when it was asked if Mike Pence did the right thing every single individual on that stage said that he had. So no one even in the Republican primary when they are just appealing to the extremist base of their own party was willing to standby where J.D. Vance is. So, it's understandable. I think it's despicable. But what is not really -- doesn't really make sense to me and I'd love to hear everyone else's thoughts on this is when you're appealing to moderate voters in a general election less than one month from the election, why are you standing by this position?

GARCIA-NAVARRO: This is obviously one of the main issues that the Trump campaign and Vance as well has engaged with. He was the one perpetrating many of the lies about Springfield, Ohio. We had a very pointed exchange about that. And we also talked more generally about the idea of housing in this country. Listen, what you hear Trump and Vance trying to do over and over, they know that this is an issue where they get a lot of traction. People are legitimately concerned about what happened on the southern border with the surge of migration. But what you hear there with Trump right now, that that isn't true, no one's coming across the border and, you know, kicking people out of their homes and stealing their homes. And that's not the fundamental reason why we have a housing crisis in this country. And so, when I talked to Vance about this and I pressed him on this, you know, he didn't -- he didn't have frankly, a lot to respond. I mean, he believes and he kept on pressing the point that there are migration is the reason why people don't have houses in this country.

And this is just another example of that bigotry that he's chosen to lash out at the city of Detroit. And I think the most surprising part of it is that he did it while standing right in the city, almost makes you wonder, did he see the city? He drove through to get to the Detroit Economic Club? Did he see the events that the city has put on recently, that beautiful and exciting draft day that we held, all of the things that have happened in the city? That the growth -- increase of jobs, the increase of housing, the businesses that will come into the city. It's a true -- as Governor Walz said, American comeback. It's a great story. Detroit is.

Contrast that with Richard Nixon, who is actually running that time for president, goes in, certifies the vote that was, in fact, a challenge and Hawaii and he gave the votes. He ruled that the vote should go to Kennedy, not to him. And then with Kennedy in the House chamber says, I declare that John F. Kennedy has been elected the next president of the United States.
