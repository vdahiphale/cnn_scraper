This morning, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that is seen as the most significant case on the homelessness issue in decades. The debate is over whether it is cruel and unusual punishment to find or arrest people sleeping outside when shelter space is so scarce. This is all happening as homeless levels are reaching record levels in the United States. CNN's Nick Watt is joining us now. Nick, this is a really significant case.

He's going to get in that SUV and he's going to take what is now becoming a very familiar drive down to lower Manhattan to head back into court this Monday.A very big day in court for the president and for this entire historic first criminal case against him, which is opening statements from prosecutors and his defense team as they are going to begin laying out what they see are the facts of the case. And then quickly after that, this trial gets into full swing now that we saw last week the bumpy road to getting a full jury seated. Let's see if we hear from the former president before he heads in, but he's headed down to court right now. We're all -- also focused here right now from the border crisis to abortion. Vice President Kamala Harris has gone from standing in the background to front and center, becoming the front and center leading voice on some of President Biden's top campaign issues. It comes as the campaign is acknowledging that there is a group of Democratic voters who are turned off by President Biden. And Harris is becoming key to their strategy to keep him on board. This is new reporting from CNN's Isaac Dovere. Let me bring in Isaac right now. Isaac, tell us more about what you've learned. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Hi, Kate. Well, look, I have spent a lot of time on the campaign trail with president and the vice president. You can see what is going on now that on a number of key issues, abortion probably top of the list, but also things like student loans, gun control, legalizing marijuana. Things that Democratic voters want to hear from and pumping up that enthusiasm and the need from the base. They are seeing that people want to hear more from Kamala Harris on that than they have been. We are all pretty familiar, as is everybody on her staff, with that -- what a rocky start she had on the job. But in being out with her, I was in Arizona and Nevada with her, you can see in those battleground states and overall, a looser, more energetic, more ready to go kind of approach to her. She is talking about prosecuting the case, being the prosecutor out there. Taking a part to the arguments. And look, I, I said to her, we sat down in an exclusive interview in Las Vegas. I said, what about whoever Trump picks as his running mate, what do you think about that person? She said to me -- and I think a pretty good mark of where her mind is these days, I'm ready for whoever has the fill in the blanks to do it.",

The FAA investigating a frighteningly close call involving multiple planes at JFK International Airport in New York, Wednesday. A Swiss Airlines flight suddenly aborted takeoff because the pilot was paying attention because four other planes were crossing the same runway at the same time. Air traffic control recordings show the Swiss Airlines flight was cleared for takeoff by one air traffic controller, while another controller instructed the four planes to taxi across the same runway. You're looking at that simulation there. [08:50:00] Joining me now is CNN Safety Analyst and Former FAA Safety Inspector David Soucie. First of all, how does this happen?

Their work schedules. Their circadian rhythms. How they're sleeping. How they're not sleeping.

And he said the reason the president pardoned him, President Ford pardoned him, and what everyone accepted at the time was that Richard Nixon would have been subject to criminal prosecution for what went on during Watergate.
