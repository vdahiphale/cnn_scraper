I ask climate expert Lord Nicholas Stern. And Biden delivers his harshest criticism yet of Israel's Gaza war. I get insight on the region from scholar Fawaz Gerges. Then, Texas denied Kate Cox an abortion even with a fatal diagnosis for the fetus. I speak to her attorney.

      "sentences": "Cheers and hugs in Dubai today for a new major climate deal. One that supporters say marks the beginning of the end of fossil fuels. Nearly200 countries agreed for the first time ever to transition away from oil, coal and gas and move closer to the goal of achieving net zero by 2050. It's the end of two weeks of intense negotiations at the U.N. Climate Summit known as COP28. But not all parties are happy, because it doesn't actually call for phasing out fossil fuels. Island nations complained that it could be a death knell for them, and climate activists called the deal, which is not legally binding, woefully insufficient, claiming that it lets the fossil fuel industry off the hook. Here now with a verdict is the expert, Lord Nicholas Stern, a longtime climate scholar and author of a landmark report on the issue for the British government. Lord Nicholas Stern, welcome back to our program. So, we've talked throughout the years about what needs to be done. We've talked over various COPs about this. Can you just sum up in a word, everybody was worried until the last-minute thinking that these negotiations weren't going to actually happen in a way that was, you know, exemplary. What do you think they've come up with? NICHOLAS STERN, CHAIR, GRANTHAM RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT, LSE AND AUTHOR, \"THE ECONOMICS OF CLIMATE CHANGE\":  I think it's a pretty good agreement. I think many of us would have liked it to be stronger in key areas such as, you know, phasing out of unabated fossil fuel with kind of language I would have preferred. But it's clear they couldn't get that through. But on the other hand, I think the kind of language that you spoke about, that you described at the beginning, Christiane, which was transitioning away from fossil fuels and energy systems. Accelerating action in this critical decade so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science. That's a pretty clear steer of direction. Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and it's now challenged the countries to really step up and do the investment that's necessary to bring down the emissions. And that means investing in the new and the green and the clean in order to be able to run down the old and the dirty.",

But Britain, this country, your country, approved a new coal mine just a year later. And now, there's, you know, approving, I think, drilling off the North Sea and stuff like that. It appears to be backsliding from this country itself, which hosted -- you know, Great Britain hosted a COP. How can we take, you know, these -- how can people who are so worried about the climate, and we've just witnessed what may end up being, well, so far, it's said to be the hottest year on record, how can we take it seriously when we see, you know, things rolling backwards and governments reneging on pledges and speaking out of two sides of their mouth?",

Vacillating and backsliding, it makes people more uncertain about the returns to the investment in the new and the clean, and that increases the cost of capital. What we've seen from this government over this last month -- over these last months and including that coal mine decision last year, I think is a real problem and we have to call it out.

So, if Britain is doingthis, and you say it has to be called out and it's a mistake, what hope can there be for actual OPEC countries to do what they need to do? Again, no pressure on them at this final communique. And we know that they actively tried to intervene in the negotiations. Saudi Arabia and oil and gas companies argued that the talks should focus on emissions instead of fossil fuels. Let me just read a little from the FT editorial today. You know, it said OPEC didn't get its way. Here we go. \"The outcome is very far from perfect. It is better than feared, but less than needed. It bows too much to the forces of international diplomacy, and too little to the immovable realities of science. The oil cartel, OPEC, did not in the end get its way, though nor did nations seeking a stronger agreement. We've talked a little bit about the sort of blurring around the edges. But there were thousands, metric ton loads of fossil fuel industry lobbyists there. They vast out -- vastly outnumbered climate activists, and it's a concern. I mean, it's a real concern.",

And he took me around there personally, and that was about 15 years ago. So, his commitment to the low carbon, to the sustainable, to the clean is longstanding. But at the same time, he's also the chair -- the head of the oil company of the UAE, with Abu Dhabi, which is you know, one of the biggest oil companies in the world. So, both those elements are there. But I think we have to recognize that his commitment to net zero, his commitment to staying below 1.5, if at all possible, is genuine. And I think that in the end, it probably helped that that was his background. It made it somewhat easier. I didn't know this in advance for sure, but it made it somewhat easier for him to stand up to the pressures from oil and gas, which were clearly there.",

But the question that the American people should realize, should really contemplate, reflect on, does what happened on 7th of October justifies the killing of Palestinian civilians?

She then reached out to a lawyer. She filed a lawsuit. She had a court say, yes, indeed, your abortion is medically necessary and should proceed. Then she saw the attorney general threatening her, her family, and her doctors. Then the Texas Supreme Court putting that order on hold. And then, three agonizing days while she waited to hear more from the Texas Supreme Court about whether or not the healthcare that she so desperately needed, which in this case was an abortion would be able to proceed. And if you think about it, a week is a very short time for a court, but it's a very long time for a real person in the middle of a medical emergency. And so, she has been very resilient through this whole process, but I just want folks to put themselves in her shoes and think about how they would feel if politicians in their state were micromanaging the decisions that their doctors were making.",

I mean, if the state gives you the right, they put that exemption in a very draconian almost total ban in Texas, and the attorney general doesn't accept it, what legal sense does that actually make, based on what exactly?

And so, I feel like going back to 2006 and 2007, I knew, because I had a lot of debates with people where I would present myself as being, I am a moderately pro-choice Republican. I don't believe Roe is correctly decided, but I believe it should be legal in the first three months. I don't see another alternative to that. And I found it really interesting that immediately when I introduced myself that way, some people would be like, oh, well, then you're actually pro- life, or other people would say, oh, my God, you're a heathen, like, all of it needs to be banned from day one, or you would have other people who are like, how can you be anti-Roe? And I'm still pro-life on everything else, but I'm pro-Roe. And so, to me, it's been very evident for many, many years now that what Republicans have treated as pro-life was largely a collection of people who didn't think, for the most part, that Roe was correctly decided, but they didn't actually necessarily agree on what the underlying policy should be. And now, that we no longer have Roe on the books as good law, we're having to confront that, and it turns out that it's very uncomfortable for the party and we're finding out that the common denominator is, I think, significantly more abortion friendly than what a lot of Republicans had thought and had hoped for and are comfortable with.",

But that's significantly more sort of lacks and accepting of keeping abortion legal than even what I would say, right? But for my position, the way I look at it is, if you're arguing that it should be legal really at all, that puts you in a position where I think you're more pro-choice than pro-life. But I think it just is testament to the fact that these words really don't mean what a lot of people thought that they meant. I think there are a lot of people running around in the Republican Party who thought that when people said they were pro-life. It was a firm, concrete statement, not something aspirational, and I think that they really believed that that meant that people thought from the moment of conception that embryo, you know, whatever we're talking about, that embryo, that fertilized egg, the fetus when you get to that point, from day one, that would be protected except in the case of if you're one exception pro-lifer, where the life of the mother is in jeopardy, or if you're a three exception pro-lifer, where the life of the mother is in jeopardy, where it's rape, or where it's incest.

It's not just that her health is compromised, but that her ability to have future children is compromised. That's the advice she's been given, OK?

Really, really fast. And what you've seen is you've seen a lot of influx to Texas of people who are socially more liberal, but they don't like the tax regimes that you're finding in blue states. Texas doesn't have personal income tax, for instance. So, it's very appealing to a lot of people. I think one of the things that Ken Paxton is going to find is in addition to the fact that he has a number of other liabilities that I think are going to make it at some point really difficult for him to retain political power and position in Texas just as such. I'm pretty sure that if you looked at where the electorate as a whole is, he's in the significant minority here. So, you know, at the end of the day, what he and other Texas Republicans choose to do about that, their call, not my call, they've gotten lucky in some regards, because as Texas has shifted purple, the Texas Democratic Party has also fielded awfully weak candidates.

Morally, I don't feel that I know enough about the case to make a personal judgment here. So, I'm going to decline to do so. I will say I definitely do see a lot of abortions or hear of a lot of abortions that happen out there that I personally think are completely avoidable and should have been avoided.

But at the end of the day, one thing we do know is that most Republicans are not like me and most Republicans really do think that whatever Trump says is pretty much what they should go with and whatever policy they want to adopt. I mean, if Donald Trump says, the sky is pink, probably a solid 81 percent of self-identified Republicans are going to say, yes, it's pink.

You have to have incest. And my suspicion is that if you pushed him on it -- while Donald Trump is certainly no master of legal wordsmithing or legal drafting, my suspicion is if you pushed him on it, he would probably want some sort of a health exception in there too, because I think he probably worries as with this Texas case that where you have a life of the mother exception, that might not quite provide clarity to absolutely everybody in a situation like this one. And that is really -- you know, I will say, as a recovering lawyer, that is really one of the problems and pitfalls that I think the pro-life movement faces with things like what was put on the ballot in Ohio.
