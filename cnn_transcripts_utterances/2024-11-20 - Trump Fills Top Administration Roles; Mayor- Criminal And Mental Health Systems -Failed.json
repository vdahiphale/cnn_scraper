      "sentences": "All right, 5Donald Trump travel to Texas to watch Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket's latest test flight, a sign of Trump and Musk's growing bond as Trump prepares to reenter the White House. Trump was also joined by his pick for education secretary, Republican donor and former pro wrestling executive Linda McMahon. McMahon was one of three major roles that Trump tapped yesterday, including Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick for commerce secretary. As Trump fills out his cabinet there is one role that reportedly has Republicans at odds. Semafor reports this: \"At the moment, the two leading choices to lead the FBI in Trump's second term are Kash Patel, a former Trump administration official who's talked openly about revenge on the president-elect's enemies, and former Congressman Mike Rogers, who just narrowly lost a Senate bid with Trump's endorsement. Their rivalry is a microcosm of the tension simmering within the GOP as Trump prepares to take office, between his loyalists and the party's more establishment-minded players.\" If Trump were to tap Patel or Rogers that would mean he would fire current director Christopher Wray, who is still serving his 10-year term. Joining me now to discuss, Semafor's Shelby Talcott. Shelby, good morning to you. It's wonderful to see you. I know you've been covering so much of this drama very closely from -- you're in West Palm Beach, Florida right now which has, of course, become the center of the political universe. How do you understand -- and let's start with the tension here on the FBI pick question. First of all, I mean, it's clear Trump wants to upend the status quo here, right? I mean, we should underscore that it would be breaking a norm to fire another FBI director for him. But these two choices, Mike Rogers and Kash Patel, remarkably different. Explain what the dynamics are behind the scenes. SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, SEMAFOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. So it's -- you've got Kash Patel on one side of the spectrum and he has the support of a lot of what I call MAGA Republicans, right? The real diehard loyalists within the Trump administration like Don Jr. And then you have Mike Rogers, who has the support of a lot of members of Congress because he is sort of the safer pick. He is seen as more establishment. He is supported with some of the donors. And so that are the two sort of factions that we're seeing quietly at odds within the Trump administration. And, of course, if Donald Trump were to go with Mike Rogers, he would most likely have an easier confirmation process. But as we've seen that's not really Donald Trump's main focus at this point. He came into this campaign saying that if he won, he was going to, as you said, upend the status quo and he sees Kash Patel as somebody who is perhaps more aligned with that vision.",

I mean, Kash Patel is not someone that we see on TV. Rogers, of course, ran for Senate.But in these other jobs, right? I mean, Linda McMahon, for example, is someone who had when she was a wrestling executive a public-facing career. And then, of course, you have Dr. Oz who first made his name on his own talk show, right -- or did make a name for himself in TV on his own talk show. Let's watch a couple of the moments from that just to kind of remind people. He also testified at one point before Congress because of some of the controversies that arose from this.

So they seem more willing to potentially defend and try to push him through.And when I talk to people inside Trump world and I ask: \"Do you really think that Matt Gaetz and some of these more 'controversial picks' can get through,\" their argument, at least publicly to me, has been well, listen, Donald Trump got all of these votes. He won handily in this election. And he made clear what he wanted to do if he won that election. He made clear that he wanted a big change in the government. And so if lawmakers want to go ahead and vote against his picks then that's on them and they're going to potentially suffer the consequences AKA a potential loss if they are up for re-election.",

CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, POLICING REFORM CONSULTANT, FORMER PHILADELPHIA POLICE COMMISSIONER, FORMER WASHINGTON, D.C.

I mean, these random acts of violence like that -- I mean, you know, you wish they'd never occurred but unfortunately, they do occur. And this isn't just a New York problem. It's across the country where we have issues when it relates to people -- their mental health and being out on the street without the proper treatment. And so both the governor and the mayor are correct in their assessment of it. I mean, the individual was in custody -- in jail for a felony. He committed an assault on a -- on a guard and still released. And he had been arrested a couple of times before in New York and designated as an emotionally disturbed person and put into a hospital for temporary evaluation, and again was released. So the system does need to be overhauled, to say the very least. It is an issue. Not everyone that's homeless has got mental illness issues. Not everyone is violent.

Thank you so much for being here.Can you explain a little bit about this decree from Russia around nuclear weapons and what it means? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, WHITE HOUSE AND NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES, AUTHOR, \"NEW COLD WARS\" (via Webex by Cisco):  Sure, Kasie, and good morning. This was signaled a few months ago and it I think really reflects, as most nuclear doctrine does, an effort to try to go deal with a country's greatest fears. And their fear here is that they were stuck in a nuclear retaliatory doctrine that said that if another side used nuclear weapons, they could use nuclear weapons in response. But it's never been clear, both for American doctrine and for Russian doctrine, what do you do if you get an overwhelming conventional attack? And so, what Putin has done -- and as I said, he signaled this in September -- is revise their doctrine so that if you got a conventional attack like the kind that Ukraine has been launching now with ATACMS -- this short-range missile system -- deep into Russian territory, and the attack is backed by a nuclear power, the United States, then it could be considered to be the equivalent of an attack by that power. And he said he would have the right to use nuclear weapons. Now, having the right and deciding to do it are two completely separate things. And so you heard the Pentagon spokeswoman make the case there we haven't seen a change in posture. I think that may be looking a little bit too short-term here.
