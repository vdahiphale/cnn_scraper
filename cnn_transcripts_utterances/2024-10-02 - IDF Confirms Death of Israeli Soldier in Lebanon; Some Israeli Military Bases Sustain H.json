I'm Becky Anderson for you in Tel Aviv.It is a day of fierce fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, with the first reported death over an Israeli soldier happening as this region braces for Israel's promised response to the second Iranian missile attack on Israel this year. Israel's military says it has been clashing with Hezbollah fighters at close range today in several areas in southern Lebanon. The IDF releasing this video that it says shows troops in a town not far from the Lebanese- Israeli border. And Israeli airstrikes continue to hit what the IDF says are Hezbollah targets in and around Beirut. Jeremy Diamond is back with me this hour. Lebanon is the battlefield. It is intense and it is bloody. What do we know at this point?",

That certainly suggests much more than what the Israeli military announced a couple of nights ago, when it first sent troops into Lebanon, saying that these were limited targeted raids just along the border. Now we are seeing that they are calling up an additional division that could be some 10,000 troops being brought to the northern front to potentially go into Lebanon. We are now watching as this operation is certainly deepening. And the question is, how deep will they go and what exactly will their objectives be? One of the things they focused on is the immediate threat of infiltration from Hezbollah, trying to neuter (sic) these Hezbollah positions along the border that could be used to potentially go into Israel. But another threat is also more significant and that's the one that I've talked to a lot of residents in northern Israel about. That is the fear of anti-tank missile attacks. And those have a range of about 10 kilometers, 5-10 kilometers, depending on the type used. And so will Israeli troops push that deep? Some former Israeli generals I've spoken to pushing for Israel to establish some kind of a buffer zone to put those residents of northern Israel outside of the range of those anti-tank weapons.",

And what we're hearing from U.S. officials is that their private conversations with Israeli officials very much mirror what they're saying publicly in such that they aren't putting on limitations, that they should exercise restraint and not go after specific targets. That said, this is still very an active discussion as you well know. This just happened yesterday, less than 24 hours ago. The White House does not believe that Israel has definitively decided how they're going to respond to this attack from Iran. And so these are still active discussions. But U.S. officials, the tone that they're going into those discussions with is different than we have seen in the past, where they have very blatantly said that Israel must exercise restraint. And of course, as you well know, Israel hasn't always heeded that advice from U.S. officials.

Even Revolutionary Guards' affiliated media were criticizing the supreme leader for being too passive in the past two months, especially after Haniyeh's killing. And I think the Iranians in general had to come to the conclusion that the restraint that they have demonstrated by not responding to Haniyeh's killing and other attacks in the region had basically pushed Israel to press its advantage.

The concept was that we can, if we want to, get through the multilayered Israeli defense system. But you know, Israel often responds not just in kind but it escalates by multiple, multiple folds.

Why can't the rest of the world ask Israel to demonstrate restraint? And again, I think they thought that, if they don't reverse this dynamic, Israel might even eventually come after them. So they would rather take the initiative into their own hands. But the reality is that, Becky, at this point, if Israel targets anything of real importance today to the Iranians, whether it's Revolutionary Guard sites or nuclear facilities or energy or critical infrastructure in the country, that same logic would coax the Iranians to retaliate again.

What's the key -- the party that's the key decision maker here, I think, is the United States. So essentially, how hard Israel kicks the ball back to Iran depends on the messaging they get from Washington. Is Washington going to join them and support them in offense?

This is an administration that promised diplomacy with Iran, that promised a nuclear agreement, thatpromised essentially to prioritize diplomacy and do a U-turn from many of Trump's policies in the region across the world to prioritize human rights, et cetera. And it didn't take them very long to essentially sort of get back into or get comfortable into the direction that the previous administration was going, get comfortable with the Abraham Accords, which they were criticizing before coming into the White House. And just last year, I think that the embodiment of that is that piece that national security adviser Jake Sullivan published in \"Foreign Affairs\" just a little time before the October 7th, essentially saying that the Middle East is quiet and peaceful and they had everything under control. And then October 7th happened and essentially the opposite of everything promised happen. So I think I would call it timid diplomacy, a shyness toward actually taking a, you know, the political -- using the political capital needed and the cost also of diplomacy, of making the hard decisions is just something this administration has been, has been dealing with.

Out of that movement grew a specific strategy to urge President Biden and Vice President Harris, through the Democratic presidential primary campaign, urge voters to vote uncommitted as a pro-war -- or, sorry-- pro- peace, anti-war, pro-ceasefire vote, a pro-Palestinian human rights vote. And here in Michigan, that delivered 101,000 votes, people who self- identify and said Gaza is a top policy issue for me. This in a state where, the last time Donald Trump won, he won by something around 10,700 votes. So what we're saying is that this isn't just an Arab issue, this isn't just a Muslim issue. Voters here in Michigan, over 740,000 voters nationwide, ended up voting uncommitted, specifically to send a message to this administration that there needs to be a different approach. What this administration has done is talked a lot about a ceasefire but failed to deliver one because -- precisely because they're failing to stop the weapons that Netanyahu is using to prevent a ceasefire.

Thank you.Well, this is not the first time in recent decades that we have seen Israeli troops go into Lebanon. Let's take a closer look. In 1978, Israel first sent troops across the border into Lebanon. They were looking for members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO, after they attacked a civilian bus in Israel, killing dozens. Israel occupied most of the southern part of the country, although Lebanon's government, then embroiled in a civil war, had nothing to do with the bus attack. After protests from the United Nations, the IDF withdrew but created a narrow security zone, backed a local Christian militia. This eventually led to the creation of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which, of course, exists there today, UNIFIL. Israel began its longest invasion into Lebanon in June 1982. They took almost half of Lebanon's territory, including West Beirut. The operation is believed to have resulted in more than 17,000 deaths. Much like this week's declarations, Israel said the incursion would be brief and limited. That is not what happened. Israeli troops occupied southern Lebanon for 18 years, the last of their soldiers pulling out in the year 2000. Well, this video filmed in March of that year shows the forces withdrawing, crossing the border at Fatima Gate back in Israel -- back into Israel. The gate has been closed ever since. The most recent incursion happened in 2006. Hezbollah militants infiltrated Israel in a surprise attack, killing eight Israeli soldiers. Israel retaliated with a massive air operation and a sweeping ground offensive that lasted until mid-August. I was on the ground covering the devastation back then. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIDEON LEVY, \"HA'ARETZ\":  I think that everything is so expected. This scenario repeats itself in every war that Israel is launching. First nobody is interested in a full-scale war. Then comes the bombardments from the air and all kinds of operations. Then it will be a very, very limited ground operation, limited in time, limited in territory. And few weeks later, we might be in the outskirts of Lebanon, not Beirut. And then, and then comes the main question. How do we get out of there? Because entering Lebanon is the easy side, the easy step. Look what happens in Gaza. Israel is deeply stuck in Gaza without having any idea how to get out from there and what to do with Gaza. Same is expecting us now in Lebanon we will start a ground operation. It will get complicated. I'm sorry, I'm so pessimistic but experience told us that that's the way things are going. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel and Hezbollah both saying their forces are engaging each other in southern Lebanon. And the IDF says it's sending more troops to join its ground incursion. The impact on civilians has been devastating. Lebanon's disaster risk management unit there's at least 109,000 people have been displaced by the conflict with the actual figure likely to be much higher. Well, the U.S. says that Israel has the right to defend itself, although it has also said that Israel risks mission creep in Lebanon. Earlier, I spoke to Ronnie Chatah, host of the \"Beirut Banyan\"  podcast and asked him if Lebanon could or has turned into the epicenter of an all-out war in the Middle East. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONNIE CHATAH, PODCAST HOST, \"BEIRUT BANYAN\":  I think Lebanon has been the region's preferred battlefield for the better part of over five decades. And unfortunately, in 2024, 34 years after the civil war ended and 24 years after the Israelis left Lebanon, once more in Beirut it's a terrifying night. The sounds of bombs and echoes thundering throughout the city. Of course, watching the news as everyone is around the world, seeing ballistic missiles being flown from Iran to Israel. But in Lebanon, the strikes continue. The southern suburbs -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  This is CNN breaking news.",
