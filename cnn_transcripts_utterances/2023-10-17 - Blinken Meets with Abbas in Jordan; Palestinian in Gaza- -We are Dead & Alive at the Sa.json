We're going to bring you much more on that later on this hour. But we are going to start with breaking news out of the Middle East. President Biden will leave for Israel today. And what the White House says is a show of solidarity. He'll meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. Then he'll travel to Amman, Jordan, where he'll talk with regional leaders, including Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. U.S. National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby told CNN a short time ago the President Biden has several goals. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Outside Gaza humanitarian aid is piling up at closed border crossings. The World Health Organization says that some people inside Gaza are running out of water near the Rafah crossing airstrikes not far from people who are trying to flee the fighting. CNN Senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak joins us live now. Kevin, thank you very much for being here, for those of us those viewers who haven't met you, of course, are often on these trips with the President, I expect you'll be covering the Israel journey for us.

But I think in talking to people who have been around the President over the last couple of days. This was an opportunity that he felt he couldn't pass up. And in fact, he feels like this is the only way that he can really wield significant influence on this conflict, going forward, have been in a symbolic trip. But you can be certain the President wouldn't endure the risks if he didn't think that he would be able to accomplish something real on the ground. And in fact, we are told that before the President committed to making this trip, and before it was announced, he did receive a commitment from Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, to open up Gaza to humanitarian aid. And that was sort of a point of discussion in this lengthy marathon talks that the Secretary of State Antony Blinken held with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv yesterday. So certainly the President going into the trip, really hoping to accomplish something significant, which is to ease that humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but also to show support for Israel and to show America's backing for its allies as it endures this conflict because President Biden knows that support for Israel around the world is not necessarily going to last forever. Particularly as this humanitarian crisis in Gaza escalates, there could be potentially a backlash against the Israelis for what is happening there. And President Biden sort of wants to go there sit down face to face with the Prime Minister to sort of contain the fallout and to ensure that civilian lives are protected. And certainly President Biden is someone who places a premium on these face to face meetings. You know, he really doesn't like phone calls. He doesn't like zoom meetings. He is someone who believes that something really important can be accomplished when he gets in the room with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I mean, he has this lengthy relationship with him that he hopes to wield influence on this trip this week, Kasie.",

But, Colonel, I want to ask youabout some of the airstrikes that we have seen, because there have been reports of airstrikes around Rafah places, basically, where the Israelis said to Palestinians. We need you to leave we need you to get to safety. And then I think it's a little bit confusing sometimes for people to see that these airstrikes have been happening in some of those places. But we have heard news that it has affected leaders of Hamas. Can you help us understand kind of what's going on? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So the targeting process for something like this, Kasie, is very complex. But the basic idea is, if the goals, as the Israelis have stated is to decapitate, in essence, the Hamas leadership, what they're going to do is they're going to try to find where those people are, and they're going to try to eliminate them. And one way to do that, of course, is through these airstrikes. So what is probably happening is that these people are moving down south with many of the refugees that have been leaving in places like Gaza City, and moving down south to recon units, and then toward the border area near Rafah. They're kind of interspersed with some of these folks. So what do the Israelis do? Now they have a dilemma. They told everybody to go down south. But these Hamas people, these Hamas leaders, are probably interspersed among these refugees. And now they have to pick them out and figure out how to do that. So if they can, they will try to, you know, what would be called in a sniper language a clean shot, they will try to go after them in that way. But that becomes a really difficult thing to do and the pictures that result from that are of course, not good from a political standpoint or a public relations standpoint.",

And so their ability to listen in to find people within this, you know, mazes of buildings and refugees, and just all the mess that's there, and to take out individuals, that suggests a pretty high level of intelligence. It's very important right now because short of going in and destroying Hamas completely, which is really still say, they want to do. The other important thing is decapitation to take out the leadership and to be able to go back to Israeli people and say, look, the leaders that did this to you, they no longer exist.

And what we've seen the Lebanese Red Cross today, Kasie, is reporting that 4 people were killed in Israeli shelling. Hezbollah has also reported that four of its fighters have been killed. We haven't yet been able to ascertain whether these are two separate incidents or the same people. But certainly that would represent the highest death toll on the Lebanese side since the war broke out in Gaza. We've seen day by day the number of attack and counter attack increasing Hezbollah. There are reports that Hezbollah has knocked out many of the Israeli surveillance cameras along the wall which separates the two countries in many areas. And Hezbollah has put out other video showing them hitting observation and surveillance and communications equipment as well. But until now, it still hasn't reached what the Israelis are calling the threshold of escalation. There's always been an unwritten understanding between the two sides. That as much as there might be some cross border violence, as long as it doesn't reach beyond a certain level. It's tolerable, but certainly at the moment, with tens of thousands of additional Israeli troops deployed along the border with 28 communities on within a 1.2 mile area along the border evacuated. It's tense on that side. On this side, we know that for instance, the Canadian Foreign Minister yesterday suggested to Canadian citizens in Lebanon that they may consider booking a ticket out of the country, because it's not clear how much longer civilian aircraft are going to be flying into Lebanon. Swiss Air has canceled flights to this country. Lufthansa a few days ago did the same thing.

And that is a very telling sign that, you know, as far as the intelligence is concerned, Israel, and frankly us probably didn't know everything we needed to know about their capabilities. And you know, things like see drones his job we mentioned, that's a big risk for the aircraft carriers that are coming into position in the Eastern Med. It's also something to watch for when you look at the types of tactics that Iran uses in the Persian Gulf. Some of those tactics may be employed in the Eastern Med as well, things like swarming tactics, you know, where they swarm U.S. vessel and try to, you know, do various harassment things there. And then, as far as the bigger picture is concerned, Kasie, what you're seeing is, I think the Iranians are going to hold their fire until they see what happens with President Biden's visit.

There's holding these meetings, the President are expected to get a briefing to have an understanding of what their comprehensive strategy is. Because, again, you know that the President is making a calculated risk here in terms of betting, the White House is betting that long term, his position of being fully in support of Israel, Will is the right one, and then also politically, it will be beneficial to him, all well knowing that civilian casualties are going to increase. And that from his left flank, from Democrats and Congress, he is getting more pressure to potentially put restrictions on the resources that the U.S. is sending the weapons that the U.S. is sending to Israel.

The people I speak with that are really frustrated with the situation right now is the pressure that he and his supporters put on many of these members of the House caucus to not support Steve Scalise. And the way they treated Steve Scalise is a big reason why he's not going to get the number of votes he needs on this first round. And he also acknowledged the truth here that the world is on fire. The problem is the House Republican caucus is too busy igniting flames within the division of the party to look at what's best for not just Republican Caucus, America, and certainly on the global stage. And too many Republicans are currently fighting these internal squabbles. And I don't think Jim Jordan is a person that's going to unite this party, certainly doesn't have the fundraising capability that is needed in a speaker and certainly not going to be someone that's going to help us in 2024, given the far right support that he has, we need someone that's much more moderate.
