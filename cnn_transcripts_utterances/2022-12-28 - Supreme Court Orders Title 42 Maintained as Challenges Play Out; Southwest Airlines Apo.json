More rain is still going to come down over the next three days and three systems that would come in. You've already had quite a bit of rain. This is beneficial rain, look at me wrong. We need the rain in this part of the country. We desperately need to fill up the reservoirs for the summer. We just need this to come down a little bit slower.

But you dig a little deeper and it really smacks of Russia trying to have a both ways, to appear to retaliate while at the same time not shooting themselves in the foot and cutting off their biggest export. In the tactical degree, it basically says that oil sales are banned to foreign governments or legal entities where their contract for the sales directly or indirectly provides for the use of the mechanism to fix the price on. Perhaps, if not mentioned in the contract, it could go ahead. It's also temporary, for some the 1st of February until the 1st of July next year. So, just five months. And there is a clause that the president himself can essentially waive the whole thing. And allow a sail to go ahead anytime that he chooses. That could perhaps leave the door open to continue selling to China and India, which has a course become a release valve for the Russian oil that has not been so that the places like Europe. So, this, of course, means that Russia could still sell its oil in many cases. Really do not want to shoot itself in the foot.
