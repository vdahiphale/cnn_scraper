Violent protests, riots, and looting have rocked their cities since police shot and killed a teenager about a week ago. A French business association says that the riots have done $1 billion in damage. Now, an uneasy calm has settled over France after days of fury. CNN's Jim Bittermann joins us live from Paris. Jim, of course, it wasn't long ago that people were protesting because of the pension reforms, and now this. I mean, how has this, if at all, weakened Emmanuel Macron's power?",

The right wing says that he should do something to be tougher on these rioters.So he's still got some standing with the French people but it has definitely hurt him. And we haven't seen any polls since this rioting began last week to indicate exactly where it stands now. But in any case, it's no doubt had an impact -- Rahel.",

I think she really loves those benefits.Meantime, Coco Gauff, ranked number seven in the world, suffered her first-ever opening-round loss at Wimbledon. The 19-year-old was beaten in three sets by fellow American Sofia Kenin. But Sofia Kenin is a 2020 Australian Open champion. She's no slouch. She was ranked 128th, though -- so low that she needed to go through three qualifying rounds just to get into the main draw. The 25-year- old has never advanced past the second round at Wimbledon. And how anxious was Novak Djokovic to resume play after a nearly 90- minute rain delay? Well, the defending champion literally took matters into his own hands using his towel to dry the grass on center court. The Serbian superstar ending up breezing to victory after that. If he wins six more matches over the next two weeks he will tie Roger Federer with the men's record eight Wimbledon titles. He'll win a record-extending 24th Grand Slam singles title. But he can do it all. What can we say? Turning to baseball now. The Atlanta Braves are as hot as a Fourth of July firecracker. Michael Harris, who is sitting last in the batting order, coming up huge with not one but two solo shots against the Guardians in Cleveland last night. The Braves pushed their winning streak to nine in a row with the 4-2 win. And finally, it looks like there is nothing that Eagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata can't do.

It was June 14, 1777 when the Continental Congress made the stars and stripes the official flag of the United States. June 14 is also officially Flag Day in the U.S. There have been 27 official versions of the U.S. flag. The current 50-star version debuted on this day back in 1960. But how much do you know about the rules and etiquette for displaying and handling Old Glory? That is the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article. Let's bring in the author -- writer and journalist Sal Vaglica. Sal, welcome to the program. Happy Fourth. So I think a lot of people know that there is a flag code but perhaps don't really know all of its content. What surprised you most about researching the flag code and reading the flag code for this article? SAL VAGLICA, WRITER, JOURNALIST (via Webex by Cisco):  Hi, Rahel. Good morning. I think the first thing that people struggle with and the most important thing that they struggle with is knowing when to retire the flag. That's the question that the American Legion gets the most. It's this idea of when do I need -- when do I get a new flag and what do I do with my existing flag?",

And what my sources said was if you look at the flag and it just doesn't give you the sense of pride it did when you first got it, it might be time to get a new flag. Physically, if the flag is ripped or torn this is not the time to bring out duct tape. Have the flag -- you can have the flag sewn and stitched but if it's ripped, torn, tattered, or soiled then it's time to retire it.",
