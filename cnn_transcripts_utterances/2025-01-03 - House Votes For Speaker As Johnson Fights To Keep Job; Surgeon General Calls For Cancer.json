      "sentences": "-- in Washington. And you are in the CNN Newsroom on this very busy day in Washington.Right now, Speaker Mike Johnson is fighting to stay in power as the House is set to vote in just about an hour on whether he keeps his job. And really no one knows what's going to happen. At this moment, it's unclear if he has the votes, even with Donald Trump's endorsement. Now, Johnson is adamant that he won't make deals with fellow Republicans to lock down votes. They hold one of the slimmest majorities ever. Just two nos could cost Johnson the gavel. And there's already one no with Congressman Massie and a handful of Republicans that are undecided. And one, as I noted, is a hell no. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. THOMAS MASSIE (R-KY): I am the one, hell no. You know, they say there's up to five or six who may be voting no. You can count on me to be a no. You can pull all my fingernails out. You can shove bamboo up in them. You can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Will he get the votes to become speaker of the House on the first ballot? Will it drag on for a number of days? Will it go on before just today as into a messy floor fight that will force the Speaker to do what he has resisted for the past couple of days, cut deals with some of those holdouts, some of those holdout members, some of the more conservative members of the House Republican Conference have demanded changes to how the place is being governed, commitments on how to deal with issues like federal spending, more sway in the legislative process. But Johnson has been adamant, saying that unlike his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, who had to cut a number of deals in order to secure the speakership back in 2023 on 15 ballots, he said he is not going to do that this time. That is a message that he's conveyed privately and publicly.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), HOUSE SPEAKER: My simple message to my colleagues is, make suggestions about process improvements. We're open to that at all times. But I don't make deals with anyone. There's no quid pro quo here. I don't do anything in exchange for a vote. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "But Johnson has virtually no margin for error. Remember last year when Marjorie Taylor Greene, the congresswoman from Georgia, tried to remove him from the speakership, there were 11 Republicans, including her, who voted to advance that measure. He can only afford to lose more than one Republican on the floor. He can only afford to lose one, I should say. More than one Republican could be enough to scuttle his efforts assuming all members who are voting vote for a speaker specific candidate.And Thomas Massie, as you played there, Pamela, is a hard no. So what will those other people who are non-committal, what will they do when that critical vote happens at noon? Will they decide to side with the Speaker who is backed by Donald Trump, or will they decide to hold out and to try to extract some concessions from Johnson? All huge questions. And the reason why, of course, is so significant, Pamela, that the House cannot act. The 119th Congress which convenes today, cannot actually begin legislating until they select a speaker of the House, which is typically why these contested races don't happen. Kevin McCarthy was the first in 100 years to go to multiple ballots. Will there be another one today? That's a big question that we'll learn in just about an hour. Pamela?",

One, Chip Roy of Texas, he is someone who's a member of the House Freedom Caucus who has been on actually on the phone with Donald Trump himself over the past day as Trump has tried to lean on Republicans to get behind Mike Johnson, but others as well.Victoria Spartz is someone who a Republican from Indiana. She has not said how she would vote. She has said that she is concerned about some of Johnson's way he has governed in the past. What Johnson has told these members is that he is promising things will be different under single party Republican rule. But of course that will be so hard to manage in this rowdy Republican conference is narrowly divided Republican conference, not to mention a narrowly divided Republican Senate where they'll have to cut deals with Democrats on some key issues, including keeping the government open, which will have to do by March of this year. So a lot of big questions which is why some of those members, they want those commitments now because they know those must pass deadlines are coming in which the speaker will have to confront the fact that Democrats will have a say in the legislative process. They want a larger say. But the Speaker at the moment is saying, trust me, we'll figure out a way to get this done. We'll see if that's enough to win him the job. Pamela?",

He heaped praise on Johnson over and over again during our brief phone interview, saying he was the right man for the job, that he could get the votes.And I did specifically ask him not only just about his conversations with holdouts, but also specifically Chip Roy, because does seem a lot hinges on Roy right now. And he said that he had multiple conversations with him and that he thinks Chip Roy will do what's best for the country. Now, what exactly that means, and if Chip Roy and him align on that's obviously a big question. But I did also ask, what about these conversations with holdouts? What are you telling them? He insisted he wasn't telling them anything, but he was talking about the fact that he had won, that it was a huge margin, he had won the popular vote, and that this should just be an extension of that, essentially that this would be a big, beautiful exclamation point on that. But one thing was very clear in this conversation. He is currently all in for Johnson. Now, of course, we know Donald Trump could change at any time, but he not only believed he had the votes, but said that he wasn't eyeing anyone else for speaker and he wants to get this done. Now, separately, I had spoken to a number of his senior advisers who said that there was no appetite from Donald Trump to see what happened with McCarthy happen here, particularly given these multiple rounds and how close we are to the inauguration. He did not want a situation in which all of the focus was on the chaos of the Republican Party. He wants a situation where all the focus is on him coming into Washington. So part of this is looking at the landscape, and that's what I'm told by these advisers, and really making the decision that Johnson was the only person of all of the members that they believe could get the votes. And that is why he is pushing so hard for Johnson right now.",

I mean, you know, one of the things that we have learned in the last several months or year, really, and Donald Trump has learned since 2022, when he endorsed a number of candidates who lost, is that Donald Trump doesn't want to back a loser. So if he is getting this far out on a limb for Johnson, he believes that he does have the votes or he can get the votes. And that's why he's doing so much to work the ground.And as you said, what's really interesting here, he appears to have learned a lesson from what happened with McCarthy and how much time and oxygen this sucked out of any media narrative. So that is why he has really put down a marker here with these holdouts. He has called a number of them. We know. Obviously, as we said, he's talked to Chip Roy multiple times. So how this plays out? He really wants to get ahead of this. And -- and I was told by him that he is going to be watching it very closely today as it unfolds.",

Well, the White House says that President Biden and the First Lady will go to New Orleans Monday to grieve with the families and community members affected by the devastating New Year's attack. Bourbon Street is back up and running two days after a 42-year-old army veteran plowed his pickup truck into a crowd of people, killing 14 and injuring dozens more.I spoke with the CEO for Interfor International who says his firm identified potential security threats with the famous street's bollard system back in 2019. Bollards, if you don't know, are these sort of steel posts that can go up and down. A report called on those barriers to be improved to prevent a terrorist attack by vehicle. Meanwhile, CNN has obtained this exclusive surveillance footage showing the driver just hours before the attack. CNN's Ryan Young is live in New Orleans. Ryan, what more can you tell us about this new video and the latest on the investigation?",

The Super Bowl is headed this way, obviously. The Super Bowl and the NFL security was around this area. They were talking to the city about the security plan moving forward. They feel comfortable with that.Pam, I should note that yesterday more than a thousand officers from the feds, from the state and from local surgeons (sp?) area for the Sugar Bowl that went off without a hitch. The two officers who were shot when this happened, they were released from the hospital. We're told they're doing OK. We hope they get their names sometime in the near future. Pamela?",

And that kind of goes face of what we've been told for decades, maybe that, you know, drinking red wine, for example, can be good for our health.Increasingly, we're hearing the opposite. And so in this new advisory today, the surgeon general lays out the evidence, essentially looking at hundreds of studies linking cancer and alcohol consumption and also looking at the biological mechanisms that underlay this. He points out that it is the alcohol consumption is the third leading cause of preventable cancer in the U.S. after tobacco and obesity. And as part of this, he's calling for updates to the warning labels that are on alcoholic beverages to note that cancer risk, the seven different types of cancer that he notes have a causal relationship with drinking alcohol are breast, colorectal, esophageal, liver, mouth, throat and voice box. Altogether, on average, about 100,000 cases of cancer and about 20,000 deaths from cancer each year are linked to alcohol consumption. If you look at breast cancer risk alone, for example, one in six cases, they say in this advisory is attributable to alcohol consumption. And a lot of this, Pamela, they say the biological mechanisms are because of the way alcohol breaks down in the body. They say that can damage DNA and that can lead to the uncontrollable cell growth that characterizes cancer. It can also lead to inflammation, they say. And so really the message here is less is better.",
