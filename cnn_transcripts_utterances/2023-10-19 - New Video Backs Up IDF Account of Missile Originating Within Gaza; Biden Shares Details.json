Erin Burnett live with us again on the ground in Tel Aviv, Israel.And overnight, President Biden returning to Washington after a trip in the war zone in Israel. Today, he is getting ready to give a primetime address to the nation, as he pushes for wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine. But Congress is paralyzed right now, with no speaker of the House, so passing an aid package is impossible at the moment. President Biden says he clinched a deal with Egypt's president to start allowing trucks with desperately-needed humanitarian aid across into Gaza, where millions of civilians are stuck inside that war zone and running out of food, water and medicine.

But they're saying they've come to their own independent conclusion, although it is unclear whether the signals intelligence they're referring to is the same phone call that the IDF has put out. But they are making it very clear, the United States, that they have reached their own conclusion that this was not Israel's fault. And as the president of the United States said on his way back on Air Force One from leaving Israel last night, he said he doesn't think that it was done on purpose by Islamic Jihad either.

This has been a 24-hour period where we have seen the protests. We have seen the scale of the outrage in the Arab world. We've also seen a very significant push on both the Israeli side but also the U.S. side to try and lay out why they believe and why they are -- have assessed that this was not coming from the IDF, the rocket that hit the hospital, but instead came from a militant group in the area. I want to start with what we kind of saw in terms of the blast and what that tells you. This is kind of an annotated map from \"The New York Times\" that shows where the blast occurred right here and some of the damage. The severe fire damage where the roof tiles have fallen off. This has been pointed to in conversations I've had with U.S. officials as this could not have been a JDAM. This could not have been an airstrike. Why? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, you see, first of all, you see a very small crater. They do have close-in pictures of where that crater is. And it's just several inches into the ground. It's not the kind of thing you would see with a large JDAM, a 500-pound bomb. So when that rocket struck, it was probably a 122 millimeter, which is -- I mean, it's a significant blast, but it doesn't cause that kind of damage. There's more shrapnel than anything else.

He had come back to read out that phone call that he had had with the Egyptian president, but really, in listening to him and watching him, he really did want to sort of read out the entire visit. He had a lot on his mind. And he wanted to put in his own words sort of how he felt this historic trip to a war zone had gone. Because this was not necessarily the trip that he had originally set out to take. It was overshadowed, in some ways, by that devastating hospital bombing in Gaza.

His objective was really to show this utmost support for Israel in this time of national trauma. And you did see that when he was on the ground there, this full-scale embrace of Benjamin -- a literal embrace of Benjamin Netanyahu. But also these emotional encounters with people who had been touched by the events; by a grandmother who had been barricaded at gunpoint by a man, who recounted these horrific traumas, the president really feeling the emotion of the visit.

So it's not even fuel, we understand, coming in. Which is what all the humanitarians tell us is vitally necessary to, you know, purify water, to run hospitals, to do all those kinds of humanitarian needs. But if those 20 trucks do come in, then that will be important. This is what the U.N.'s chief humanitarian official told me yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARTIN GRIFFITHS, U.N. UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL FOR HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS: It's the safety of aid, which is as important as its dependability. We can do it because we have the aid. We have the people. We have the trucks, and we certainly have the will. You know, UNRWA has 14,000 staff still in Gaza: 14,000 staff who haven't left are still there working bravely, along with many, many others. And the -- and these people are available to deliver according to the usual mandate. We need clarity about the circumstances of that aid program, and then we need to get moving. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But don't forget also that Palestinians who have been told to move from the North are under bombardment still in the South occasionally. They're asking where is a safe zone? Where can we hide, even if we want to get away from the air strikes?So it's still a very, very dire situation. And remember, 20 trucks is just a test. It's a fraction of what they need on a daily basis. MATTINGLY: Christiane, Kevin Liptak just made a great point. The extraordinary statement and President Biden's remarks after his visit with the prime minister, with his war cabinet, about the mistakes, in his view, that were made in the wake of 9/11, basically saying, Don't let the -- the rage consume you in this moment, despite the fact everyone can identify with the why. Why do you think he said that?",

The backlash of that war in Iraq, even -- even the post war in Afghanistan continues to reverberate all across the world and across the United States, as well.And so he did say, Don't let rage blind you to what is justice and accountability. And remember, this is a warning -- I'm paraphrasing -- a warning from a friend, advice from a friend that what we did was mistaken in many, many aspects. Look at Afghanistan after 20 years. It is now back in the hands of Islamic extremists. Those are the Taliban. Look at Iraq. It is still unstable. Look at that whole region that the -- the U.S. and Britain. Here the papers are covered with this warning. That seems to be the big takeaway, because Britain went into that Iraq war, as well, and is continuing to -- to suffer the consequences like the rest of the world. So these -- this was an extraordinary comment to be made, advice to a friend, because in previous rounds in the Gaza-Israel wars, it's always hardened and more militarized and more militancy has come out of each one of those.",
