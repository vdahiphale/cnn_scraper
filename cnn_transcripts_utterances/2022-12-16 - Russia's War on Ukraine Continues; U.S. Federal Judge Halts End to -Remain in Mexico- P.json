That is, of course, assuming that they can find and hit them. Now, before Patriots can actually be deployed here, it is going to require a significant amount of training. Military experts say these systems are highly complex. They require large amounts of people working in unison to operate them effectively with little room for error. Other countries, other U.S. allied countries, when Patriots have been deployed, American forces are often there, personnel are often there to assist. But that is not going to be possible here in Ukraine. The Ukrainians are going to have to learn how to operate these systems autonomously to stave off the constant Russian bombardment that has been targeting the civilian power infrastructure, including some weapons that currently the Ukrainians don't have the capability to defend against.

It continues to fall this morning, will do so throughout the rest of Friday and into Saturday. Now the coastline from let's say Connecticut up into parts of New York and everywhere else holding on to that chance on the coast.But we've also picked up freezing rain. And numerous reports from the Mid-Atlantic into upstate New York, a couple in particular across Maryland, where we've picked up nearly three-tenths of an inch and that's roughly seven and a half centimeters of freezing rain. Enough to cripple the location and cause power outages and splitting trees, I'm sure. Winter storm warnings in effect for much of New England. These are areas that could pick up roughly two feet of snow by the time it's all said and done. That heavy snow continues to fall as we talked about through the rest of Friday and into Saturday. While it does start to taper back, we still hold on to that chance for snow. Most of the Great Lakes holding on to flurries and some Lake Effect which, yes, will accumulate roughly about one to two inches and about five to 10 centimeters. Now, the higher elevations across the northern parts of the Appalachia are talking about picking up 60 to 100 centimeters through the end of the weekend. All across the upper Midwest back into the Plains, northern plains that is, we're still not done. But you notice the snowfall totals, they're not that impressive. The problem is, is with this area of low pressure, the winds are still rather strong. We're talking about winds picking up over 35 miles per hour. So, blizzard warnings in effect for much of the Dakotas where we already have winds gusting over 50 kilometers per hour, in Rapid City as well, and in PR and that is what's causing the whiteout conditions. I mean we have zero visibility in parts of South Dakota, Michael.",
