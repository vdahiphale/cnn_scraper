Are plans in the works for your task force to visit the site of Sunday's incident? REP. LAUREL LEE (R-FL):  So it is an important step for us to get to actually visit the site of an incident like this. One of the task force's first things we did was go out to Butler so that we could walk those grounds and understand the proximity of the shooter to where President Trump was standing. So I do expect that task force members will absolutely want to visit the Florida site as well, so that we can get a sense of what happened there, the type of perimeter that was being maintained, and how this person was able to get into that area that made him such a significant threat.",

I know you guys are doing very important work.Questions are also being raised, Congresswoman, about the Secret Service's ability to protect Donald Trump, a former president, current Republican presidential nominee. The agency says it needs more resources. Listen to what Senator Richard Blumenthal said about that. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  The Secret Service has a management issue in the use of its money and manpower. Until it does better in accountability and management, it will continue to be short on resources because it is diverting resources and mismanaging them. We should consider more resources for the Secret Service. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's clear that we need more Secret Service agents assigned to protective details right now.The threat environment is intense. They need to be able to adequately protect President Trump, along with their other protectees. However, the senator makes a good point in this way. The larger Department of Homeland Security has a very large budget and need to be able to demonstrate to members of Congress that they're using it appropriately and that the resources that they are getting, those taxpayer dollars that are going to the broader Department of Homeland Security, are being spent correctly. So, Wolf, I believe both of those things are true. We need more Secret Service agents, who are the best and the brightest, who are working protective detail. But before we just send more money, we need to be sure that the resources that are sitting over there at the Department of Homeland Security are being used appropriately.",

What is it that it takes for the Secret Service to continue to operate effectively in this threat environment, which really appears to be unprecedented? And that we have a former president, presidential candidate, and then also the other -- we still have Vice President Harris and Joe Biden, who also need to be protected adequately. So that's certainly one of the very important questions for us all to be considering.",

He didn't directly answer that question today. But there are ongoing conversations.

      "sentences": "Yes, so, Wolf, as you teed up, the Department of Justice filing this civil claim against those companies that operate the Dali seeking at least $100 million, likely much more than that.But it's really the details in this claim that are so stunning, accusations of extreme negligence by those companies, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine, that they knowingly, according to the Department of Justice, sent an unseaworthy vessel into U.S. water that eventually caused this catastrophe. So the claim, it lays out how the ship lost power that morning when its circuit breakers tripped open because the circuitry had loosened over time from an excessive vibration on the ship, this excessive vibration that eventually caused a cascading series of failures on board. But now we're learning that the Dali had a longstanding problem with that excessive vibration. It had damaged its electrical systems before and the crew had even raised concerns about it to those companies. But, according to the Department of Justice, they'd really just put Band-Aids on the problem, rather than actually addressing the root cause. I want to read you a section from the civil claim that says: \"Instead of taking steps to eliminate the source of excessive vibrations, petitioners jury-rigged their ship. They retrofitted the transformer with anti-vibration braces, one of which had cracked over time, it had been repaired with welds, and had cracked again. And they also wedged a metal cargo hook between the transformer and a nearby steel beam in a makeshift attempt to limit vibration.\" We actually have photos that the Department of Justice provided as well that show some of that jury-rigging. And it's extremely concerning. Look, Wolf, a recent inspection found that the ship had loose nuts and bolts. Those are the photos, by the way, I was referencing. You can see that welding in the top left. That's the crane hook that I was talking about there. And this inspection recently had found that there were loose nuts and bolts on the ship, and that electrical equipment was in such poor condition that the testing agency that was on board discontinued its electrical testing because of safety concerns. The question now, Wolf, we know this is a civil claim. They're going to be seeking a lot of money, as is the state of Maryland, the city of Baltimore, and the families of those six construction workers who were killed. What we don't know is whether or not criminal charges may be coming. The Department of Justice would not comment on that. We know that eight crew members from the Dali, including the ship's top officers, are still in Baltimore, so we're really in wait-and-see mode with those criminal charges. But, again, these accusations are stunning of the negligence they say was carried out by the ship's owner and operator.",
