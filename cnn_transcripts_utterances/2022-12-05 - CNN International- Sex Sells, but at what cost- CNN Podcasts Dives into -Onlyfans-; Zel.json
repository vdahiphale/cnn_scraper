Iran's Attorney General reportedly says the country's Hijab law is under review but will anything really change? We'll have the latest details for you.Plus, taking Aim and Russian oil profits, the number of countries worldwide imposes a price cap on Russian oil shipped by sea, but will it have any impacts on the Kremlin's coffers. And England's Raheem Sterling rushes home whereas Brazilian superstar Neymar is expected back on the pitch today. We'll have all the latest on the Qatar World Cup. We begin in Ukraine where the country is bracing for what could be another devastating Russian bombardment. In just the last few minutes we learned that the military is warning that Moscow strategic bombers have taken off and the first wave of missiles have already been launched. Officials in Kyiv say the city's Air Defenses are working and residents are being urged to stay in shelters and regional authorities in the south say several explosions have been reported the City of Zaporizhzhia. Let's go straight to Will Ripley, who joins us live from an underground shelter, Will in Kyiv.",

      "sentences": "Hi Max, yes and in fact, we just confirmed out of Zaporizhzhia region that at least 2 people have been killed in those explosions, presumably from these Russian missiles that have been launched. And the Ukrainian Military is now confirming they're not giving us numbers.But the early indications were that we were looking at potentially dozens, which would put this potential attack if that's indeed what is happening on far with what Ukraine experience 12 days ago, when Russia launched in total over a period of about four hours, more than 70 missiles. And the Ukrainians successfully shot down more than 50 of them but still around 20 or so hit their targets and those targets were the civilian power infrastructure with the intent of plunging this nation this battle scarred nation into darkness at a time that the winter is fast approaching, temperatures are plunging every day, it gets a bit colder. And so to knock the electricity off for people is what military experts say a wartime tactic that is intended to demoralize the general population and also to potentially harm the Military because they need the power just as much as everybody else needs it. We were out yesterday, in Bucha, which of course, is a town that you recognize the name Max. This is a town that was terrorized by Russian soldiers during the occupation earlier this year. People there have been living without power, sometimes just 40 minutes a day. And yet, given all that they experience all of the trauma and the horror that they witnessed, including, you know, their neighbors' bodies being left to rot in the streets for a month or longer and you know, constant fear of what Russian soldiers might do if they came to their homes. These people say they're, OK with living without power. Certainly it's inconvenient. Certainly it's frustrating, especially when their cell phone communications go down along with the electricity. But they say regardless of the discomfort from Russia knocking out the power systems with these missile attacks, they say it strengthens their resolve to fight ahead. And they say they're grateful that they're being defended by Ukrainian soldiers and not occupied by Russian soldiers in that suburb of Kyiv. And that is the sentiment that is overwhelmingly being shared with us, as we report on this. So whether or not we're in the front end of yet another devastating attack that Russia's Foreign Minister just on Friday told exclusively to Matthew Chance, they were anticipating. We don't know how many of these missiles have been fired. We don't know how many have already been shut down, but yes, the Air Defense systems have been activated. There are missiles in the air and it is a really touching go minute by minute situation that we have to monitor very carefully from the safety of this underground shelter here. Like so many other people across the Ukrainian Capitol who are also sheltering in place, underground right now, Max.",

      "sentences": "Of course with everyone there, Will, thank you. Now the Kremlin says it won't recognize price caps on Russian oil and it's calling the implementation of that decision a step towards destabilizing world energy markets. The $60 a barrel price cap on Russia seaborne oil, agreed upon by the EU.The G7 on Australia is now in effect is aimed at limiting Moscow's ability to finance this war. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was much more needs to be done. And he says the price cap is \"Not serious\". CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now to explain what all of this means and the impact of any of this price cap and though you know, there's a lot of cynicism about whether or not it'll work Clare. [08:05:00] CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes Max, I think there are questions given the level of the price gap which of course is much higher than President Zelenskyy would have wanted the $60 a barrel. Though it is lower than some in the West European and Western leaders would have wanted to lower than they were originally discussing. But this Max, to take a step back is the biggest set of energy sanctions that we've seen yet on Russia in the course of this now 9+ months war. It is a major measure both the EU embargo on all seaborne Russian oil and this price cap, which should, in theory, limit Russia's revenues from oil which of course have gone up not down as a result of this war. That is the sort of loophole that the West is now trying to close. Will it work in its two key aims, one to punish Russia and two to try to stabilize the global oil markets and keep Russian oil flowing in terms of punishing Russia? I think there are some doubts given the level of this price cap Russian Euros oil is currently trading. According to data that I've seen below the price cap that there are some other grades in the far East that are trading above the price caps at the consensus seems to be that there will be a little bit of a limited impact initially to Russian revenues. Although of course the EU and the G7 can tighten the cap in future, can lower the cap progressively under this mechanism in terms of stabilizing the oil cap, the oil market we all say oil prices coming up fairly significantly this morning, about 2.5 percent global oil prices. But overall, I think the sense is that in the best case scenario, at least, this should lead to simply a reshuffling of the global oil market. The Russian oil that you used to buy will, hopefully in terms of what Russia will feel flow to Asia. Certainly a lot of it has already been displaced there and similarly, the EU will start buying oil from other places like the Middle East, it has already started doing that. So this should in theory achieve those two aims, according to experts that I've been speaking to the wildcard, of course, is what Russia will do next. The Kremlin has threatened to not do business with anyone complying with this cap, even if that means cutting production if they have to cut production that could send global prices higher, Max.",

Instead of bringing in a ban on shipping and insurance services from the EU and G7, which would have taken a lot of oil off the market is to keep Russian oil flowing.The U.S. has especially has made it clear that it doesn't actually want Russian oil off the market because of the impact that would have on prices. So the idea has been to stabilize things. I think, again, as I said, the question is what will be rushes next move?",

Well, comments by Iran's Attorney General have suggested that could be this case.He's saying that \"Parliament and the judiciary are evaluating the hijab law\" and that the morality Police are being disbanded something. And Iranian MP's has also said could be in the works but state media and others are skeptical. Some say it's all a ploy to quell this monster protests led largely by women, with a resounding around the world sparked by him in custody death of 22-year old Mahsa Amini who was detained allegedly for not wearing a hijab properly. Let's get some clarification on this developing story. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins me now. Salma, you know, depends what you read at the moment about where the truth is here.

Yes, these demonstrations started very much about that but they've morphed into something so much bigger. Those who are taking to the streets now some of them are demanding the dismantling of the entire Islamic government. They want to see this whole system really scout Max, not just a simple review of the hijab law. I think if there's anything that's really revealed in this back and forth in these conflicting reports. Is that Iran's government itself is struggling to suppress these demonstrations? They've been going on again, for months they continue to grow. This is not a monolith. This government has hardliners, it has reformers, and it has conservatives. They're trying to figure out how they get a hold of this, Max.",

Other big cities have scrapped the negative test requirement to ride public transport. Citizens fed up with China's zero COVID policy protested last month and President Xi recently hinted protocols would be loosened.Now lots of World Cup action on and off the pitch Neymar expected to return in the coming hours for Brazil. He's been sidelined with an ankle injury, but he'll be back on the pitch later today when Brazil takes on South Korea. Speaking of Brazil, the team is asking for good thoughts and prayers for soccer legend Pele. The 82-year old is in Brazilian hospital, battling a respiratory infection and colon cancer. His daughters told fans they are confident he'll return home soon. And a scary situation for England stars Raheem Sterling.

That's the first knockout round.We've already got four teams through to the eight places in the quarterfinals and that includes England's even without Raheem Sterling, who, as you say has flown home to deal with that personal matter involving a robbery at his home in Surrey, just south of London. England looked good and managed to beat the African champions Senegal by 3 goals to nil. And that came later on Sunday after a victory for the defending World Champions France who won their match 3-1. So England and France the latest through to those quarterfinals some heavyweight clash is already booked for the last 8, and certainly Brazil and Croatia in action later on Monday overwhelming favorites to beat South Korea and Japan respectively. First up is Japan against Croatia, the runners up at the last World Cup in Russia in 2018. And Brazil, although they didn't do so well at that tournament have won this competition more times than any other nation, Max. 5 times world champions looking good Neymar back from injury and that can only bolster their chances as they face South Korea.

So what actually impact what sort of actual impacts to things like this have?First of all, we've got Iran these are protests initially sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini under the morality Police allegedly and they are now possibly prompting a review of the rules on hijabs. For example, even the review of the Police system as well. This is China, these are protests against zero COVID policy and they may be being reviewed as well or at least relaxed to some extent. According to reports coming out of the country it's a bit murky. Let's go to Nic Robertson, who's across all of this, it's not entirely clear exactly what's changing within Iran and China. But there does seem to be a response in both of those countries to protests, which is pretty unheard of.",

So they need to find a way to control you know, the real question in both these countries, is what is actually going to happen? The review of the hijab law in Iran isn't due for another couple of weeks.China, you know, typically they the government can make some moves like they've done easing the ability for people to use the transport network by, you know, removing some of the COVID checks, removing the need to use QR codes. But you know, if you look at the way that China's handling it, it's somewhat, not systematic, somewhat shambolic. They're removing testing centers, COVID testing centers, in the middle of some of the cities. Yet the COVID testing booths, in other parts of those same cities are now having long, long lines, because you might be able to get on public transport without needing a QR code or a COVID test. But you may not be able to go in the shopping malls or offices without a 48 hour COVID test. So it seems what's happening at the moment, is a reaction to try potentially to placate the anger, three months of anger in Iran and that's boiled over way beyond wearing a hijab. It's now speaking about the leadership there. The reactions of the governments in both these cases fall short. And it's not even clear what these reactions actually are. But the opportunities are for the governments who both governments who have track records of doing something publicly and then walking it back when the world's attention is turned away, or when that bit of stinging the anger is ameliorated in the population, because let's face it. The Chinese population is really angry and upset about the COVID measures that they're still enduring and the rest of the world isn't? So it we can say that these governments are reacting, but we can't say what it really means yet. That's too soon to say, Max, I think.",

You know, all sorts of denial of access to freedoms, if people don't comply. So the go to instinct of both of these countries has been to try to crack down what's happening is those crackdowns are either backfiring or they're not working as effectively as a leadership wants. So this is a question of just trying to figure out if at the moment, they're just doing enough to take the initiative back and take away some of the momentum of the protests in both countries, and then just revert to tight. You know, both of these countries, the leaderships there the leaders themselves believe that their own personal destinies are tied up in the fortunes of how well they can control the population. They wouldn't be in power very likely. If the populations, there had a real say that dynamic hasn't changed.
