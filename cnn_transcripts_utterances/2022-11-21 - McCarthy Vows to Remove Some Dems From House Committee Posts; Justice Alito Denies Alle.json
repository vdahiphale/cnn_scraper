Why would we ever give him a security clearance and the secrets to America? So, I will not allow him to be on intel. You have Adam Schiff who had lied to the American public time and again. We will not allow him to be on the intel committee either. And look, Congresswoman Omar, her antisemitic comments that have gone forward. We're not going allow her to be on foreign affairs.

If Kevin McCarthy needs votes to pass essential legislation, such as keeping the government open or raising the debt limit, will Democrats be willing to help him if the Freedom Caucus folks, the Marjorie Taylor Greenes of the world refuse to participate?REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Well, it seems to me that that's a case by case basis, but Democrats have always been willing to lean in on making sure that we fully fund the government. And Democrats have always been willing to lean in in making sure that we meet our nation's obligations and do not default on our debt for the first time in American history. I think it's also important to point out, Jake, that we have consistently fought against extremism on the Republican side, including when it manifested itself often during the former president's tenure, while at the same time, being able to find common ground to make progress for the American people.

      "sentences": "No, absolutely not. And I think in the end what all this shows, Max, is that the Russians are still sticking by the war aims that they've put out at the beginning of what they call their special military operation. Which is where they said that they wanted to change, as they put it, the regime in Kyiv. Of course, meaning the government in Kyiv, essentially toppling of Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government there.And that they certainly despite the fact they suffered a string of setbacks recently on the battlefield still seem to have those aims going forward. It was quite interesting because at the end of last week, a spokesman for the Kremlin, Max, Dmitry Peskov, he also came out and said that the objectives of the special military operation as he put it remain unchanged and that also they remain unchanged in the fact that of course we have winter where some people believed there might be a lull on the battlefield. Certainly, the Russians seem to be indicating that they are going to continue this war in full force despite the fact that the winter months are upon us and of course, things are a lot more difficult on the battlefield at the moment. And all this despite the fact that you do have those setbacks that they suffered in Kherson currently also pretty difficult situation for them in the Luhansk Oblast as well. One of the things that the Russians seem to believe -- and this is something we're seeing on state media but also seeing from various Russian politicians as well, Max, is they seem to believe that these strikes that they're conducting on critical infrastructure in Ukraine obviously crippling a lot of power plants in some places but also the heating infrastructure as well, that those are going to have an effect in the long run. They do believe this is something that could bring Ukraine to the negotiating table on Moscow's terms. Of course, right now there is absolutely no indication that that's the case. In fact, the Ukrainians are saying that the opposite is going to be the case. That their resistance will be hardened in the face of this. But certainly, what we're seeing right now this morning here in Moscow, some pretty hard line comments from that very senior Russian Senator who does hold a lot of sway, who says that the Russians are still aiming to change who is in power in Kyiv -- Max.",

At least six protesters so far have been handed the death sentence.This latest protester not identified by state media sentenced on Sunday. They say for blocking traffic and clashing with members of the paramilitary group the Basij. Again, Max, this is just the latest in several trials that have been taking place. And a lot of concern that we might be seeing more of these death sentences in the coming days as the government is continuing to intensify its crackdown on these protests. This national uprising has now entered its third month. And they don't seem to be able to contain and suppress these protests. You're seeing also an intensifying violent crackdown taking place on the streets, taking place in several cities in the Kurdish region, in the western part of the country where we have seen a lot of demonstrations in recent days. And also, the Iranian regime announcing through its state media on Sunday the arrest of two actresses, as you mentioned. These are high profile, prominent actresses who have come out in support of the protesters. Katayoun Riahi, as you mentioned, one of the first back in September to appear without her head scarf and to voice her support for the protesters in her country. Hengameh Ghaziani another high profile actress on Saturday posting this video that has gone viral of her without her head scarf, tying her hair up in a ponytail when she's out on the streets in Iran with a message, Max, that read -- This might be my last post. From this moment on, if anything happens to me, know that I'll always be with the people of Iran until my last breath. Less than 24 hours after posting that video, she was arrested. Both actresses are being accused of creating chaos in the country, spreading propaganda by the Iranian regime. They are the latest in a list of very high profile figures, athletes, journalists, directors, musicians who have been arrested by the Iranian regime for coming out and supporting the protest movement. They are also among more than 14,000 people, who according to activists and human rights groups and the United Nations, who have been arrested since September -- Max.",

This is a residential neighborhood just south of Buffalo proper. Residents have been working all weekend to dig their way out of their homes, clearing their driveways. The city, the county, they're joining the efforts making sure the streets are clear as well. They're also taking some extraordinary steps to not just plow the snow but also remove the snow.So, this lake effect frozen precipitation it's wet, it's very heavy. So according to one city official I spoke to on Sunday, it's not the kind of snow you can just sort of plow and leave it there. So, they are taking these extraordinary steps by basically using equipment to remove the snow from these neighborhoods and then pile it up high, tons at a time, in some of the city facilities that they have. They say that certainly snow in Buffalo is not extraordinary but the volume that they received for the last three days it certainly is. Polo Sandoval, CNN, Buffalo, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
