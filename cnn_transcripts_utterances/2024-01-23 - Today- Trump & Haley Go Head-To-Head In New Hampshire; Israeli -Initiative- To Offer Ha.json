Phil Mattingly in New York, here with our friend Kasie Hunt as well.

Haley won all six votes there. In her final sprint across the state, Nikki Haley has been pushing back on the naysayers.

This is according to an Israeli official familiar with this negotiation. They do call it far from being a proposal, I should caution. Israel's military operations in Gaza have already killed more than 25,000 people there, according to the Hamas-controlled health ministry, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also facing increased pressure at home and around the world to secure the release of those Israeli hostages, and to ease the suffering of the civilians in Gaza. Netanyahu has created controversy also after doubling down on comments he made that Israel must maintain security control of the Palestinian territories. He posted on X over the weekend, quote, I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of the Jordan and this is contrary to a Palestinian state. Let's bring in from Jerusalem, former Israeli hostage negotiator and the Middle East director of the International Communities Organization, Gershon Baskin. Thank you for being with me. I was very surprised to read this reporting that came first from Barak Ravid at \"Axios\" and then I just told you CNN's reporting on this. Do you -- do you think that this could actually happen? Israel would agree to a two month pause in fighting to bring all of the hostages that are being held, about 130 of them home?
