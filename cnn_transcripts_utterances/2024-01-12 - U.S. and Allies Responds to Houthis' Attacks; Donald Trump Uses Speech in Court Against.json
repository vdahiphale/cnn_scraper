The U.S. and Britain going after Houthi militants in Yemen who are backed and funded by Iran. Not long ago, Iran condemned the strikes, calling them a violation of international law. And Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council later today. The coalition strikes are a direct response to the worsening surge of Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis claim they've been targeting vessels with a connection to Israel as a show of support for Palestinians in Gaza. Many of the Houthi launches have been intercepted by the U.S.-led coalition that had primarily been playing defense until now. American fighter jets have been taking off from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier to carry out their mission. The U.S. president issued this statement, quote, \"these targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes. I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.\" And we're also hearing from the Pentagon. Let's listen to this.

One senior leader issued a statement saying quote, \"we will confront America, make it kneel down and burn its battleships and all its bases and everyone who cooperates with it no matter the cost.\" The Houthi leader also called on the world to prepare for America's defeat and vowed not to abandon the people of Gaza. CNN's Paula Hancocks is following all this live from Abu Dhabi.

And when we have more to say and more to do, you will hear from us. So they have announced more than 60 targets have been targeted at this point. But we also know that one resident has told us in recent hours that there is smoke and they believe there may have been another target hit. But we are waiting for confirmation or any clarification from the Pentagon at this point. But the U.S. is definitely leaving the door open for further attacks if need be. Now we've heard from the Iran-backed Houthi rebels that they will retaliate. We have heard from a spokesperson saying, quote, \"they were wrong if they thought that they would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza.\" Also hearing from the leader on Thursday that if these attacks took place that there would be repercussions, saying that what has happened is barbaric to terrorists and a deliberate and unjustified aggression. So Kim, I don't think anybody believes that this is the end of it.

It was U.K. typhoon fighter jets that targeted two different sites. It was the United States missiles and fighter aircraft that targeted other sites. So Houthis say that they're going to respond and it's not quite clear how they're respond to U.K.-US. interests in the region, how will they respond. The potential here for escalation is very real, and it could be that the Houthis continue to try to target shipping in the Red Sea to send a message. Remembering of course that after October 7th, they began by trying to target Israel by sending cruise missiles to Israel, and that some of those were intercepted by the United States, by the U.K., and also by Saudi Arabia. So, there are a number of different ways and places that the Houthis can target back. They've had a long-running war against Saudi Arabia that only just ended not so long ago, where they were sending long-range cruise missiles to the capital Riyadh. They've sent drones into the United Arab Emirates. So there's a number of ways that they can destabilize in their own view U.K. and U.S. interests in the region by doing it not just in the Red Sea but more broadly across the region. So, the concerns of the Saudis about the potential for escalation are very real. They've been worrying about the October 7 attacks, Israel's response to that escalating tension, the northern border in Israel with Lebanon and Hezbollah, all these Iranian backed proxies trying to stoke tensions in the region and the Houthis are the one that seem to have precipitated this particular escalation. The Saudis of course are saying that the freedom in the Red Sea is of vital importance to the region. So, there are lot -- while they are not part of that military coalition in the Red Sea, they are clearly giving it a green light to go ahead. But this potential right now, depending on the Houthi response, this is a very, very volatile time right now. Nic Robertson, CNN, Tel Aviv, Israel.",

Iran is condemning the strikes, but for a week, U.S. officials have warned the Houthis stop the attacks or there will be consequences.CNN's M.J. Lee has more from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) M.J. LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Biden saying Thursday night that the U.S. is sending a clear message to the Houthis that their ongoing attacks in the Red Sea will no longer be tolerated. He said in a statement that he will also not hesitate to direct further measures to protect U.S. personnel and the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. U.S. officials, of course, have been warning for weeks that the Houthis must stop its attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. And last week we saw U.S. officials give what they said was a final warning. And what we are learning tonight is that the attacks that we saw from the Houthis on Tuesday, this was just two days ago, had targeted some U.S. vessels. And what we are told by sources is that had it not been for this defensive coalition called Operation Prosperity Guardian that was already set up by the U.S. and a number of its allies in the Red Sea, that we may have seen situations where ships were sunk by these attacks. And that there was even an instance within the last month where a commercial vessel that carrying jet fuel may have been hit. The senior official saying that some of these were basically close calls. Now it was after these Tuesday's attacks that President Biden were told convened his national security team and asked them to draw up a number of possible plans for retaliation. And that is what ultimately culminated in these airstrikes conducted by the U.S. and the U.K. with the support of a number of other nations. And what one senior military official said Thursday night was that while it's not possible to say exactly what the damage was, that the damage to the Houthi rebels and Houthi assets for the time being could be described as significant.

And look, the judge granted it, saying, I'll give you five minutes. And the judge had previously set a restriction on Trump, saying, you can participate in closing arguments, but you can't give a campaign speech. And that's exactly what Trump did, attacking the judge, attacking the attorney general's office, and insisting that he is a, quote, \"innocent man.\" Now, Trump addressed the public on his way into court, on his way out of court, those remarks in court, and then had a press conference. It appears that he got a real return on investment here in terms of amplifying his argument that he is being targeted because of a desire by his political opponents to try to, quote, \"interfere in this election.\" But I want to note something that the attorney general's office said in their closing arguments.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin released a statement that read, in part, this action is intended to disrupt and degrade the Houthis' capabilities to endanger mariners and threaten global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways. Today's coalition action sends a clear message to the Houthis that they will bear further costs if they do not end their illegal attacks. But the Houthis have heard that language before when they were put on notice by the U.S. and its allies to stop their attacks on shipping. But as Oren Liebermann reports, they didn't listen.

Now I think that the Israel kind of counter position that aid is you know, is freely allowed in and there isn't any obstructionist is frankly quite absurd. I mean, we know there's an average of 70 food trucks were entering Gaza before the war every single day. Last week I think there was average just over 100 trucks were able to get in.

The Iran-backed militant group has issued a strong condemnation, calling the strikes barbaric and unjustified aggression, while Tehran is calling it a violation of international law and Yemen's sovereignty.This comes after the U.S. and Britain struck dozens of Houthi targets, including radar, drone and missile sites. The strikes are in response to weeks of Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea, one of the world's key commercial sea lanes. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is making a case against pressing the pause button on the ongoing conflict with Russia. He visited Latvia and Estonia on Thursday as part of a trip that also includes a stop in Lithuania. Zelenskyy said that pausing the war would give Moscow a badly needed break before Russia would strike again. Here he is.

To not give Russia the opportunity to prepare for a powerful counterattack in a year, in two, in three, in five, to not let them do it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He said Kyiv should be invited to the alliance's summit in Washington this July.The U.S. military has not properly tracked more than a billion dollars' worth of weapons for Ukraine. That's according to a new report by the Pentagon's inspector general. The weapons belong to a category that requires enhanced monitoring after their exports, like javelin missiles and night vision equipment. The watchdog says it's outside the scope of its investigation to find out what happened to them, but the Pentagon suggests there's no reason to believe foul play was involved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: There remains no credible evidence of illicit diversion of U.S. provided advanced conventional weapons from Ukraine. We do see some instances of Russia continuing to spread disinformation to the contrary, but the fact is, as we observe the Ukrainians employing these capabilities on the battlefield, we're seeing them use them effectively.
