      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE, tonight.Judge Juan Merchan ruling Donald Trump will be sentenced for his hush money conviction, just 10 days before he takes the Oath of Office, as a convicted felon. But there's a twist about this particular crime and punishment. Trump just posting about this, moments ago. Also, Mike Johnson wins in the battle to remain Speaker, but only after fending off some last-minute drama that could spell trouble for ahead, for getting Trump's ambitious plans through Congress, even though both chambers are now controlled by Republicans. And some new details, tonight, inside the attack in New Orleans, including these chilling recordings that authorities say were made by the killer in advance, far in advance of the attack. I'm Pamela Brown in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Well tonight, we now know Donald Trump will be the first convicted felon sworn in as President of the United States. Judge Juan Merchan ruling today that sentencing for the President-elect will be a week from today. So, that's 10 days before Trump returns to power. No amount of posts on Truth Social or statements by a Trump spokesperson can change that. But this is no ordinary case, and of course, no ordinary defendant, right? Judge Merchan says that President-elect will not face any legal punishment for scheming to essentially cook the books, to cover up payments to a porn star. Judge Merchan also indicated in today's filing, the case is essentially over. The judge writing that not punishing Trump, quote, \"Appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality.\" Trump's spokesperson insists, quote, \"President Trump must be allowed to continue the Presidential Transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or... remnants of the Witch Hunts.\" Now, as for the transition, Trump won't even have to be in the court. The judge says, he'll let Trump appear virtually, citing exactly the quote, Mental and physical demands during this transition period. And just moments ago, just before we got on this show, Trump posted on Truth Social, saying in part, quote, \"This illegitimate political attack is nothing but a Rigged Charade. 'Acting' Justice Merchan, who is a radical partisan, just issued another order that is knowingly unlawful, goes against our Constitution and, if allowed to stand, would be the end of the Presidency as we know it.\" My lead source is a former attorney for Donald Trump, Tim Parlatore. All right, so Tim, in that post, Trump doesn't say what he's going to do. So, do you think the President-elect lets this be the end of it?",

And really, the sentencing is what is required to be able to start the appellate process.So, while I certainly understand that the President is upset by this, in a lot of ways, this does help him to at least go forward with that process, to be able to challenge some of the underlying rulings.

I think that those are good issues for an appeal. But this particular motion was one to try to push the sentencing out past the presidency, or cancel sentencing entirely, or to rely upon the presidential immunity. And none of those arguments, I think, were really applicable. So, I personally do think it's a good decision, based on what was in front of him, right here. P. BROWN: So, it's interesting, you don't think the immunity issue would make for a good appeal. Because as you read, the judge's finding said that, While the Supreme Court ruled the sitting president has immunity, President-elect immunity does not exist. So, it sounds like you actually agree with him here?",

But then also, does that apply to the underlying facts of the case, of whether some of these things happened, while he was president, or before he was president?And so, yes, certainly there's no immunity for a President-elect. It is an immunity that attaches to what you do while in office that is part of your presidential functions. And so, that is not something that the Supreme Court decision would extend to, prior to being sworn in. P. BROWN: How unusual is it for this to be virtual, like on Zoom?",

And I think that it is, you know, it's also very uncommon for a judge to telegraph in a written decision ahead of time, what sentence he's likely to give. And so, I do think that by having it by Zoom, that really does put the nail in the coffin that this is going to be an unconditional discharge, which is essentially a punishment of no punishment, because normally, if somebody is facing jail time, they have to be in the courtroom, so that they can be led out the back by the court officers.

Because he had already been convicted at the time of the election, and the American people voted for him. So, I don't really think it's going to have that much impact at all, the fact that he happens to be the first president with a conviction. P. BROWN: All right. Tim Parlatore, thank you so much for coming on to share your analysis. Also, as Trump's former attorney. We appreciate it. And I want to turn now to retired New York State Supreme Court Justice Jill Konviser. Thank you so much for coming on. I'm looking forward to hearing your perspective on this. What other options did Judge Merchan have here? You just heard Tim Parlatore say, he felt like this was the best option he had. Do you agree?",

And unless and until an appellate court says otherwise, that will be the case. The defendant is a convicted felon. So again, I'm back to balancing where this judge had to take all of that into consideration. Whether the case should have been brought in the first instance is a charging decision. That's up to the district attorney. So, I don't really have an opinion, in that regard. P. BROWN: You do have to ask the question, though, how different would this have been if Trump had not won reelection?",

I mean, it shows you that that wasn't correct, because he won. So that argument fell on deaf ears, and for good reason. P. BROWN: And just to kind of wrap this up for our viewers, or who are trying to process this, like, Wait a second, he's not going to be legally punished, but he has a sentencing. Help our viewers just make sense of that.",

So, the legislature gives judges a wide array of sentencing, depending upon the crime for which you are convicted.This, as CNN has reported many times, has been, is the lowest-level felony that one can commit in the State of New York. And, as a result, it carries everything, as I said, from a fine, to state prison. And so, you have -- you have all of this at your -- at the ready, to make a decision in terms of that. But here, you're faced -- the judge was faced with this significant -- significantly unique situation. What was he going to do? And in doing what he did do, made a whole, to me, a whole lot of sense, in terms of what should be the -- you know, what should be imposed here. If you look at this particular crime, a Class A non-violent felony offense, whether it should have been brought or not. Certainly, there are other people in the state who have been convicted of that crime. As I've said before, there are precious few people who have gone to jail or prison for this particular offense. From my perspective, if I were the judge, the only reason why the defendant would have ever, or I would have ever entertained jail, had to do much more with the contempt proceedings than with the underlying offense. And Judge Merchan, who bent over backwards to make sure, the defendant was not incarcerated for the contemptuous conduct, for which he was found responsible. That should be recognized too. Instead of calling him corrupt, I think the former President should probably be thanking him in that regard. P. BROWN: Judge Jill Konviser, thank you so much.",

      "sentences": "Right, that's a very good question. I'm surprised, because he -- well, you know what? It tells us, maybe he wasn't planning on suicide. Maybe he thought he would survive it. These bombs he had weren't dressed as a suicide vest. I mean, he did essentially commit suicide by cop when he got out of that truck in the end.But you're right. That's a very good question. He was trying to burn up his evidence, which he didn't do a very good job, I understand. They did recover a lot of evidence. But maybe he was expected to survive this, or to be caught and prosecuted. So, he wasn't intent on suicide, apparently. That's one thing I would say about the fire. P. BROWN: These audio recordings are such a key piece of investigation -- investigative evidence here. Because the FBI had said that he was inspired by ISIS, joined ISIS before the summer. These audio recordings are from a year prior to this attack. And when they were recorded, what did they tell you, Mary Ellen O'Toole, about the mindset of the Bourbon Street suspect. How helpful are they to investigators? MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR FBI PROFILER, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT: Those audios are going to be extremely helpful to investigators, because they timestamp it for, number one, which gives them an idea of how long he's been involved in this kind of thinking, this kind of ideology. But it also gives us a snapshot into how he is almost training himself to think in terms of a us-against-them mentality. These people who engage in drugs or drinking or listening to music are so bad, they are devil influence. And that really is an important part of developing this ideology, to the extent that eventually -- and it doesn't work with everybody, that's important to underscore. But when it is successful, it enables the person to look at all the other people, in the world, that don't subscribe to what you do, and you can say, These are terrible people. They're objects. They're not even people anymore, and they need to be destroyed. So, it makes killing strangers much easier. P. BROWN: John, law enforcement officials tell CNN that the suspect used this very rare organic compound, and the two explosives that were placed in the French Quarter, prior to the attack. And thankfully, they didn't go off. But it's a compound so rare that it had not been seen before in the United States. How crucial is it for investigators to pin down how he managed to get something like this? What kind of questions does that raise for you? [21:35:00] MONAGHAN: Well, it raises a lot of questions. And coupled with the audio that the other guest just mentioned, that you asked about, it changes my whole perspective, on this guy. I thought he was just a man, like Luigi Mangione, that went off the rails, and chose ISIS as his cause. Apparently, I was wrong on that. He was inspired by ISIS. He was spouting this stuff out a year ago. And now, we got this explosive that is not readily available in the U.S. or Europe. That couples with that year-old audio. It really does. And it is vital. Before this, I thought, I want to know where he got the flag. We need to know where he got everything, who he dealt with, who helped him, may not have helped him. But where he got those explosive, that is a vital link, it is. Because he's been on this track for a year now. It wasn't like he had his mental break, based on personal problems, and then suddenly decided to, be inspired by ISIS. No. This has been going on for a while, apparently. P. BROWN: Yes, and it does raise questions. Now, law enforcement says they believe that he acted alone. But it does raise questions. Where did he get the flag? Where did he get this rare ingredient, this compound? And John, I want to follow up by asking about this, the crime scene video. You've been analyzing it. And something stuck out to your trained eyes. Tell us about that.",

When I -- when I present evidence in court as an expert witness, my field of expertise is use of force, deadly force used by the police. And there's a rule, and it's a standard throughout the industry. And the rule says, you cannot shoot at a moving vehicle. And I mean, unless they're shooting at you, but then that's a separate category. They're shooting at you. You cannot shoot at a moving vehicle when a moving vehicle is the deadly weapon. That's a standard throughout the industry, except in a few jurisdictions. In New York City, that rule was written in 1972. They were the first ones implement it. It dropped police shootings. Other departments nationwide caught on, implemented the same rule. It's a very strict rule. 2016, we had Nice, France. 2016, we had the German market in Berlin. 2017, in May of 2017, the NYPD changed its decades-long rule. They didn't actually change the rule. They added a caveat that said, OK, you're in violation for firing at a moving vehicle. However, the fires discharge review board will take into consideration the totality of the circumstances, if it was a vehicle-ramming attack, by a terrorist, intent on mass casualties. In 2022, as part of this handcuff the police, defund the police movement in New York City, the City Council remove that caveat, went back to the 1972 restrictive rule. Now, I got to tell you, I looked it up. New Orleans Police Department, they have the same rule in place. P. BROWN: Where they can't shoot a moving vehicle.",

I think it's really important to remember, as your guests right before me were saying, the ultimate cause here is the assailant, the terrorist who attacked the city. And now, as we're backing out from the fact that we know that he did that, what are the things that can be done, particularly knowing that we have the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras coming up, that can be done better. Number one, putting bollards in places that they ought to be. Number two, talked about earlier, placing IEDs places. Well, how long were those coolers waiting on the street, before anybody noticed them and they were detonated? Number three, making sure that we don't advertise, that the bollards are out of commission, as was reported, last night, by a local affiliate. So, there's definitely things, I think, that we can look at. And clearly, this 2019 report is a place to start. P. BROWN: You were a Council Member at the time the report was released.

And we are going to look into, and that's part of the reason why we're going to have this committee with our legislators, about what needs to be done, going forward. P. BROWN: I want to ask you about something else. And that's the Department of Homeland Security, last month, issuing this bulletin about the threat of lone offenders around the holidays, and the potential use of vehicles in attacks. Were local officials aware of that bulletin? Do you know, was it discussed ahead of these massive celebrations and events?",

B, specifically, I was checking about the bollards, to see what people knew. So, I can't say that we were aware of those. Although, I would say this. Generally, I think we know that in a city, where you have so many different events, that cars, trucks can be used. Remember, years ago, we passed an ordinance too, to keep portalets further away from Mardi Gras routes, because those became a potential issue as well. So, I know that obviously being safe is something that's on people's mind. And I think now the question is, how do we re-examine all of that? P. BROWN: And I'm just curious, as you look back -- and of course, hindsight is 20/20. And you're absolutely right, the assailant is the one to blame. But unfortunately, oftentimes when this happens, you look back, and you see where there may have been lapses. There was that police car there. As you learn more, does it seem like the focus was more on making sure traffic wasn't going down Bourbon Street, versus keeping out any offender who could have been in a car, I mean? Because you look at what other cities do, like NYPD, they put big garbage trucks, and they make sure that the sidewalks are blocked.",

And look, the next couple days, after the accident, that's exactly what happened, on Bourbon Street.[21:50:00] And I think that all presages the questions about, Do we need to do something like that? Should parts of Bourbon Street be more pedestrian? How we re-route traffic? How we make sure that the sidewalk can't be used again? Because obviously, what happened is the terrorist went around the car, the unit that was parked on Canal and Bourbon Street. And all of those things are going to have to be re- examined and made sure that we're bearing down, in preparation for our next events. P.
