And Trump far ahead there, but not as quite far ahead as he is in the national polling.And so, what we're seeing is many of these candidates really jockey for second place. And to the extent that they can have a moment, I think, it's really helpful in terms of name recognition and fundraising.",

The Supreme Court has just rejected another attempt to -- out of Alabama's as Republicans have continued fighting against redrawing congressional maps there. That, potentially, this whole thing sets the stage for the creation of a second majority black district.CNN's Ariane De Vogue has the very latest for us. Ariane, the justices made -- seemed to make their position pretty clear when they first took this up, I think it was back in June. So, what does this mean now?",

      "sentences": "Right. So, right now, what the Supreme Court has done is reject this emergency appeal from Alabama. And it clears the way, as you said, for congressional maps with either a second black majority district, or at the very least boosting the black majority in a second district. Alabama had been fighting for its own map. Its map only had one black majority district in a state with a 27 percent black majority.So, this order, this brief order with no noted descent is a win for supporters of voting rights in the state. But I have to give you a little bit more of the history here because it is really fascinating. As you said, last term, the court did take up a very similar challenge. Again, Alabama was trying to push its map with only one black majority district. The court on a 5-4 ruling rejected that. They said there has to be a second black majority or something close to it. Alabama goes back to the drawing board, and in July, it really stunned the NAACP and others because the new map that it came up with again only had one district. The lower court that heard this said, look, you are in defiance of the Supreme Court precedent, and the Supreme Court very swiftly stopped Alabama from trying to take this route again. It basically said, we meant what we said last term and it rejected the bid. So, it's super important. It sends a message to other states, and of course, it could have an impact on tight races ahead.",

She was an assistant, nothing more.\" Passantino says, he did not advise her to mislead the committee. And Hutchinson says she was never told to lie to the committee. \"I don't want you to perjure yourself\" Passantino insisted. \"But I don't recall isn't recall isn't perjury,\" she says he told her. Another time Hutchinson says, Passantino tells her, \"We just want to protect the president.\" Jobs are dangled and then withdrawn from Hutchinson as she begins to cooperate with the committee. She's ultimately shut out off and then demonized by Trump world altogether. The rest, and her courageous testimony is history. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER (on camera): And John, a spokesperson for Mark Meadows denies the allegations made about him in the book. The spokesman says the burning fireplace was, \"Absurd mischaracterization and not at all what it was about and had nothing to do with documents.\" They claimed it was just newspapers to get the fire started. He also denies leaking classified documents to the right-wing media figures, calls it a completely ridiculous mischaracterization. He says the documents were declassified. And regards to the, we killed Herman Cain comment, Meadows' spokesperson says it is, \"Offensive to suggest that this was Meadows initial reaction.\" And that in the days after Cain's death, he was \"Expressing exasperation that the media would blame the president for Mr. Cain's death, very different.\" John.",
