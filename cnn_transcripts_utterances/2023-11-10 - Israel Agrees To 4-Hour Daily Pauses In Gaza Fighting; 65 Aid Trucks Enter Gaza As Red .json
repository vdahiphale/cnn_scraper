And we do begin in Gaza where Israeli forces continue their assault against Hamas targets in the Enclave. You're looking at a live picture coming from Gaza and you can see the smoke from Israeli strikes billowing in the background.The IDF says much of the fighting has been focused on locating and destroying the maze of tunnels that Hamas has built beneath Gaza. Meanwhile, as the Israeli offensive continues, an estimated 80,000 people evacuated from Northern Gaza on Thursday. That's up significantly from the 50,000 that Israel says left the day before. The IDF says it will continue to open the safe passages as they call them each day for several hours as it has been doing since last weekend, in fact, but the Prime Minister stood firm on his most basic demand regarding Hamas.

      "sentences": "Michael, I suppose we can see this as a kind of formalization and slight expansion of what's anyway been happening on an ad hoc basis, all of this result of pressure from the Biden administration.So, what Israel is now going to be doing is saying everyday there's going to be these four hours, in its words, tactical localized pauses, which are going to allow for Palestinian citizens in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where Israel's attacks are focused on where it's concentrating its ground forces to enable those civilians to leave the area and to head to the relative safety of the southern part of the Gaza Strip. In addition to that, they are going to identify a particular neighborhood each day where there will be no fighting, enabling people living there to go out. And if they can find it to get food, medicine, water and other necessities that they may not have been able to try to go and get hold of up until now. So this is, as I say, more of a formalization and a slight expansion, they are opening up a second evacuation corridor as well. So there'll be two corridors down which Palestinian civilians will be able to head south. Now, this falls short, despite this coming about because of pressure from the U.S. is still falls short from what the Biden administration would have wanted, which is a more meaningful humanitarian pause, and it falls way short of the immediate ceasefire that is being called for, again by the leaders of the United Arab Emirates, and Qataris, and also many aid agencies and the international community, which is for a total cessation of hostilities. Now, the hope is that with these localized -- tactical localized pauses, as Israel is calling them, there will be more aid trucks able to get in to provide humanitarian assistance. The U.S. is hoping that will jump to around about 150 trucks from just over 100 every day providing more humanitarian aid, but still around a third of the amount that was going into the Gaza Strip before this war began. But as you were just saying with that clip from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's position remains that there can be no actual ceasefire until those 240 or so hostages are released. And I don't think the release of the latest hostage video by the militants of Islamic Jihad, the smaller militant group in the Gaza Strip showing an elderly lady in a wheelchair and a 13-year-old boy speaking to the camera, saying how they missed their family and friends and saying that if anything happens to them, it'll be on BB's head. I don't think that video is going to soften Israel's position. If anything, Michael It may harden it.",

What is your assessment of the humanitarian situation right now in Gaza? And how much worse could it get? JANTI SOERIPTO, PRESIDENT AND CEO, SAVE THE CHILDREN, U.S.: Yes, thank you, Michael. Look, it is an absolute horrific humanitarian catastrophe that's been unfolding in front of our eyes over these past four weeks. As you say, vast number of hospitals are completely out of commission. The few hospitals that are there don't actually count run at full capacity because they like fuel for their generators. The incubators will stop working soon, there is no electricity.

A diplomatic source familiar with these Qatari negotiations confirmed to CNN that a meeting on Thursday between CIA director William Burns, the Mossad head David Barnea, and Qatari officials in Doha discussed a proposed plan to release up to 20 civilian hostages, in return for a three-day humanitarian pause in Gaza.Now, the source told CNN the plan also includes access for further humanitarian aid into the enclave. Why is this all significant? Well this certainly appears to suggest that progress is being made. CNN has been reporting for some weeks that there is no prospect of Israel agreeing to a sustained pause in fighting, or temporary ceasefire without a substantial number of hostages being released. That is according to one senior U.S. official. In public, Israel's prime minister and his defense minister have been categorical. No ceasefire deal without the release of all those held in Gaza. Well a pause fighting would enable HAMAS to compile and hand over a list of all hostages. This has been a major sticking point in any progress today, what have been extremely complicated talks made all the more difficult, mediators say, by the intensity of the Israeli assaults, since it launched its second phase of this war two weeks ago. What is not clear is how long of a pause Israel will be willing to agree to, and what would amount to an acceptable number of hostages released. The Israel Defense Force says the military's current count of hostages being held by Hamas, is 239. That number includes both Israeli and foreign nationals. Now these multi-party negotiations which also include Egypt have also centered around exchanging hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.

On Monday, the kidnappers demanded security guarantees in order to free their hostage and the Colombian army stepped aside.Thursday morning, Diaz was finally handed over to two Catholic bishops, and a commission from the U.N. A few hours later, he was home. Welcome news for the Diaz family, but the kidnapping of the father of one of Colombia's most popular football players lays bare the hurdles to secure a durable peace for the country. Seven years after signing a historic peace deal with left wing guerrillas, Colombia is far from pacified. This month, rebel groups suspended negotiations with the Colombian government, and the National Liberation Army appeared to defend their tactic of ransom kidnappings to finance their armed struggle. Even President Gustavo Petro, a former rebel who was elected pledging to open talks with guerrilla groups, had to concede that some of his hopes for negotiations were premature. While the march to bring Diaz back home ended with a success, the future of Colombia's peace process remains far from decided. Stefano Pozzebon, CNN -- Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now they want women to help solve it by staying home and having more babies.The one-child policy, decades of forced abortions, and other draconian measures imposed on the Chinese people, preventing an estimated 200 million births may be backfiring, experts say. For the first time since the post famine years of the 1960s, China's massive population is shrinking. It may be too late to turn things around. 1.4 billion people, living longer, getting older, aging faster than the social welfare system can keep up. China's birth rates also falling fast. Far fewer babies, a baby bust that could cripple future growth. Adding to Beijing's biggest economic challenge in four decades, youth unemployment skyrocketing. Many Chinese young people struggling to find decent paying jobs, unable to financially support themselves, never mind their aging parents. Marriage, children -- forget about it.

And what we've learned is that there are notable figures around Donald Trump, from this White House, people who may be former intelligence official, Secret Service agents, political advisers, and others, who are very likely possible witnesses against Trump at that trial the prosecutors will call. But there are also lower-level workers, staff members at Mar-a-Lago, even contract employees who were coming in and out of his Florida resort property, who could be witnesses in this case, and could build this picture, the prosecutors want to tell a jury about on how unsecure these documents were that Donald Trump had after the presidency. Those people include a plumber, a maid, a chauffeur, a woodworker even. And we have heard what some of these people were seeing. So the maid was someone that was cleaning Donald Trump's bedroom suite, and that when Trump found out that she was a person of interest to investigators and would be speaking with investigators for this possible case, he went ballistic. That is what one source told us. The woodwork or for instance, that person was putting crown molding in Donald Trump's bedroom, and when he was putting it into the bedroom, when he was installing it, he noticed stacks of papers that relying around or stack of papers that appeared so suspicious to him, that he thought might be some sort of top secret or classified material. He didn't actually know what he was seeing, but this is the sort of story that prosecutors may want to put on the witness stand, and have that person tell just to show how suspicious it was. How things were lying around the resort, and how the national security material was ultimately found there was being handled by Donald Trump and others. A very important aspect of their case going forward. That's just a glimpse into what may be seen in this trial. Right now the trial is set for May of next year, but it's unclear if that date is going to hold. The federal judge overseeing this case in Florida is looking at potentially moving that date, and other dates in the case. There are a bunch of deadlines on hold right now and we are waiting for that judge to say when that trial actually will take place, and there's a possibility that these witnesses may not be telling the story to the public or to the jury until after the presidential election.
