I'm Jessica Dean in New York.And we are now just 48 hours away from the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump. It will be the first time the two candidates meet face to face as they hope to move the needle with any undecided voters out there. And it will be crucial as new polling underscoring just how tight this race continues to be with \"The New York Times\" and Siena College poll showing no clear leader. And a new CNN Poll of Polls showing Harris at 49 percent to Trump's 47 percent. Again, no clear leader there. The two candidates spent the weekend in battleground states. Harris meeting with voters in Pittsburgh while she also prepared for the debate, while Trump took time to hold a campaign rally in Wisconsin. Let's check in now with CNN's Eva McKend, who is in Pittsburgh. And Eva, I know you've been following along with the vice president's campaign as they prepare for this debate. What are you learning about her mentality, her strategy going into this debate?",

And that was just a little respite from these intense debate camp that has been underway for four days. She's largely been indoors, safe for today, briefly, and then yesterday at that spice shop where she greeted some supporters.What we think that this looks like is poring over briefing books, anticipating what the moderators may ask, anticipating what the former president might say, and then also coming up with sharp responses to some of the policies where she has changed positions on, some of the evolution on key policy matters. What I know that they are not concerned about, Jess, are these polls. We have seen basically the former president and the vice president in a dead heat in many of these polls. But they're not concerned with that. Brian Fallon, a spokesperson for the campaign, tweeting today that they have always viewed themselves as the underdog and they are going to continue to act as such in the crucial weeks ahead, and that they have a lot of work to do in the next 50 or so days. They already have a strategy for post-debate. They are going to have a battleground blitz where the vice president is going to campaign in North Carolina and in Pennsylvania. Governor Walz is going to do a Midwestern swing in Michigan and Wisconsin. And their respective spouses are going to be out on the campaign trail as well. So every battleground state will have some campaign presence. And then the former president, he is going to have three fundraisers this week in California and Utah. So this contest really heating up here. The vice president continues to hunker down here in Pittsburgh preparing for Tuesday -- Jess.",

Good to see both of you. I hope you're having a good Sunday. We have some things, new things to chew on here. Meghan, we walked through some of the new polling that's out today. And it's again, really underlining how deadlocked Trump and Harris are in a lot of these battleground states and certainly in national polling. Most Democrats that I talked to are pretty clear-eyed about how tight this race is. Certainly her campaign wants the positioning of she's the underdog.

So I am one of those people who do not want to look at the polls and look at them more of a guideline, not of where we actually are. The only poll that matters is the one in November.But I do think that what she needs to do is they need to keep their heads down and continue to work. I think she's still introducing herself to the American people. I think there was some data saying that a lot of people don't know her and a lot of people want to know more about her policies. And so I think that she needs to spend the next, you know, 50 plus days doing that. I think the debate is an amazing opportunity to lay some of her policies out and to get more of who she is across to folks. But I think that hitting the ground just like they're doing after the debate, and, you know, barnstorming all the battleground states is exactly what they need to do. They need to keep their head down and focus on the organizing and continue to build off the momentum they're getting and keep going out and meeting voters.",

You look at some of the data that just came out in that \"New York Times\"-Siena poll and Donald Trump is polling or performing better with Republicans than not only 2016, but 2020.And that says a whole lot. You're looking at his numbers with Hispanic voters, with black men. I mean, the guy has increased his margins technically all over the place, despite a whole litany of things that he's gone through over the past year and a half now, despite the enthusiasm that Vice President Harris certainly brings to the Democratic Party. I mean, she's revived Democratic voters who certainly were not sure if President Biden could guarantee another victory for their party. They do believe the vice president is capable. She's had 28, 30 plus days of incredible news coverage. And despite all of those very, very favorable and positive changes for Democrats because of the vice president, the race is still so tight and Donald Trump is performing a whole lot better than any other time when he ran in the past, and so that suggests to me that the momentum that we have seen with the vice president is starting to slow down.

Number two, I got to give a lot of credit to my Democratic friends, Meghan, the vice president, they have done a good job of constantly reminding the American people about Project 2025. Now to Donald Trump's credit, he's attempted to step away from it,sure. He said I know people who are working on it, but those aren't my ideas. They decided to work with the Heritage Foundation. Some people will believe that, some people won't believe it. Instead of trying to go tit-for-tat with Democrats on that issue, Jessica, the former president needs to constantly pivot back to those consequential issues because, again, I believe that is what is ultimately going to be the deciding factor in this election, not necessarily Project 2025.

Now we've also just learned in the last few minutes that White House officials have been in touch with law enforcement in Kentucky and that they are monitoring the situation. We're seeing the suspect's car there. That's from the sheriff's office. They provided those photos to us just a short while ago.

But as we get into the evening hours, Jessica, they are saying this is going to become extremely difficult. And at some point they will have to pull their people out of the woods. It's an extremely heavily wooded area. A lot of trees, a lot of brush, not a place where you want to be in the dark when someone is out there with potentially a weapon. Now, the sheriff's office said just a short while ago, they believe that there is this containment area where they are searching where they believe that the suspect may be. However, they recognize that there's a possibility the suspect could have fled from that location, and that of course, is a concern not just for this community but also the surrounding area.

      "sentences": "Jessica, it's a new and dramatic development.We have learned that Marcee Gray, the mother of the 14-year-old accused of the shooting, called the school counselor roughly 30 minutes before the shooting and described a \"unspecified emergency.\" This was first reported by \"The Washington Post\" and later confirmed by CNN with Annie Brown, the teenager's aunt. The emergency turned out to be an alarming and apologetic text from Marcee Gray's son, Colt Gray. The text simply said, \"I'm sorry, Mom.\" CNN confirmed earlier today with Charles Polhamus, Colt Gray's maternal grandfather. It was after receiving that text that the mother placed the call to the school before beginning a 200-mile drive from Fitzgerald, Georgia to here in Winder, but by the time she arrived, the tragic shooting had already happened. The painful question that hangs in the air today here in Winder is whether this tragedy could have been prevented based on the new information we have learned about what the suspect's mother at tried to do. The answer, of course, is that we will never know. But these new revelations are very consequential and may widen the investigation into the shooting. Throughout the weekend, we have witnessed how thousands of people have arrived here at Apalachee High School in Winder to pay their respects, bring flowers, and show support to the families of the deceased and at the school itself. And the Atlanta Falcons decided to also show their support Sunday. This happened ahead of their season opening home game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Atlanta Falcons players wore Apalachee Wildcats t-shirts, during pre-game warm-ups. Also, a moment of silence was observed before the National Anthem in Mercedes-Benz Stadium to honor those affected by the deadly shooting, roughly 50 miles from downtown Atlanta -- Jessica.",

      "sentences": "This announcement didn't come as a total shock because the number of international adoptions from China have been in decline in recent years.The program, of course, came to a sudden halt during the pandemic and never really recovered even after COVID, but still, this marks a major change to a policy that has seen more than 160,000 Chinese children being adopted all over the world since the early 1990s, about half of them going to the United States. But remember, this program began when China was dealing with an overpopulation problem. The government very much enforcing its draconian one-child policy that basically limited most couples in cities to one child forcing many families to abandon children, especially girls and disabled kids. Now fast-forward to today, they are dealing with the opposite problem, a shrinking labor force and a rapidly aging society. That's why within the last decade, the authorities here have twice relaxed its once strict family planning policies, now, allowing most couples to have up to three children, but none of that seems to have worked against this backdrop of a slowing economy and young people's changing attitudes towards marriage and parenthood. Now, the Chinese reaction to this policy change seem to be mixed on social media, but those applauding this decision seem to be expressing a nationalistic sentiment saying China is now rich and the powerful enough to take care of its own abandoned children. And often, citing rising tensions between China and the United States and other Western nations as well. But none of this economic, social, and political realities, of course, offer any real comfort to the hundreds of international families in the middle of adopting children from China because the government here has reportedly indicated this ban goes into effect immediately with very limited exceptions, leaving hundreds of Americans in limbo and potentially heartbroken.
