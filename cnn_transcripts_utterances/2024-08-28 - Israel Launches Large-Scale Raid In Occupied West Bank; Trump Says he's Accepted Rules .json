Farhan Al- Qadi has been discharged from an Israeli hospital. 52-year-old veteran Israeli citizen was working at a Kibbutz packing factory when he was kidnapped on October 7th.

Later today, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are hitting the campaign trail together with a bus tour in the battleground state of Georgia. The pair will also sit down for their first interview since the start of their campaign. We'll lay it her right here, 9:00 P.M. Eastern time on Thursday night. Meanwhile, the dispute over whether microphones should be muted or not when the vice president debates Donald Trump next month still appears to be unresolved. But here's what Michael Tyler, the communications director for the Harris-Walz campaign, said on CNN earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL TYLER, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN: Listen, we fully intend to debate. We are going to be there. The question is will Donald Trump commit to the terms that he's publicly agreed to? Or will he let his team overrule him? So I guess we'll see if and when he shows up on September 10th, which decision he has made. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what has, what firmly do you know has the Walz or the Harris-Walz campaign agreed to with regards to mics? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: So this seems to still be a live issue, Bianna. The Trump campaign, ABC says that those mics will in fact be muted when the candidate who is not supposed to be speaking speaks out of turn, but the Harris campaign still seems to want to press this. And it's for clear reasons. They want a moment up on that stage. They don't believe that the former president can control himself. We have seen over the last five weeks, Vice President Harris is very much able to control herself. She runs a very disciplined operation. Everything is very tightly choreographed. And so they are really begging for that contrast in just a few weeks. And yet, these were rules agreed to by then candidate Biden. So that is the argument being made by Donald Trump. Obviously up until yesterday, we didn't even know if he would agree to this debate, even though he had agreed to that when the other candidate was Joe Biden. But given that now we have a new vice presidential candidate, what are the responses from the campaign about what looks like perhaps some flip flopping on their end?",

But looking ahead, Bianna, you have the vice president and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, out on a bus tour in the critical battleground state of Georgia. It's all the more notable because they're not just campaigning in Metro Atlanta, they are moving beyond that region to the more rural areas of the state. This is a big test for Governor Walz. He, of course, comes from a rural community himself in Nebraska, a farming community. And so they're looking to see how he connects with rural voters in Georgia. And if they can deploy him solo separate from Vice President Harris in other parts of the country with similar geographical realities. So parts of North Carolina, for instance. And so this is a critical next few hours for the campaign, as they try to test out different strategies.",

So they had to rewrite things. They had to take out possible evidence at trial. They had to remove moments. They had to remove interactions that Donald Trump had with people like his Justice Department officials. His chief of staff in the Oval Office, things he was saying in the West Wing, in the Rose Garden, other interactions he had with officials in the executive branch. All of that had to get crossed out. So this indictment that went through a new grand jury in Washington, D.C., it's about 13 pages shorter. And it focuses, as you pointed out, around Donald Trump, the candidate. And what Donald Trump, the candidate, was doing and being told by his campaign advisors who were saying, you've lost the election time to give it up. And at the same time was telling private attorneys working for him, people like Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, John Eastman, to attempt to block the transfer of power to Joe Biden and use fake electors, put pressure on state governments. That's the case that remains. There's going to be quite a bit to come in the coming days in fighting over whether this type of case and the way that the Justice Department has phrased it. Now, if it can go to trial, we're going to hear next on Friday from the Justice Department and Trump's team with a plan to move forward. And then they're going to be before the judge next week.",

It's really a state that if Trump loses, there's not really much of apathway for him to win the presidency without Georgia. So it shows how much Democrats have gone on offense instead of just playing defense, trying to protect the blue wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They are going into states where Republicans traditionally have won and trying to showcase that they can be competitive. It's important that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are not only spending time in Atlanta and in the metro area of Atlanta, where about half the population of Georgia resides, they are going beyond that. They're going to other places. They're going to the southeastern part of the state where you have rural communities, you have suburban communities. They are trying not only to bank democratic votes in places like Savannah, but they're trying to hold down Trump's margins in more rural places where you have smaller populations. But Trump has normally run up the score because he's gotten such a large margins in small towns. They are hoping that they can hold those margins down in a close race and that would be decisive by going to places and showing up in places that don't normally see democratic candidates come in part because they are smaller towns, in part, because Republicans are intent to win in those smaller areas. But if Democrats show up, they feel like they will be able to hold the margins down in a way that will benefit them statewide. And if they do win Georgia, it's very difficult to see Trump having any pathway to the presidency. And so this is an offensive move, a move to showcase how much the race has changed since Joe Biden left the race and Kamala Harris has become the standard bearer.",

About half of the population expected to face acute food insecurity. And so these 83 elephants, buffaloes, impalas, wildebeests, and other wild animals in this culling program will be distributed. The meat will be distributed to people who are facing insecurity -- food insecurity across the country. And in a way, this could only happen in Namibia, which has part of Southern Africa, has a population of elephants about 200,000 people -- 200,000 elephants, but also where people eat game meat. Already about 150 animals have been killed in this program and they have provided more than 125,000 pounds of game meat. So the way the government of Namibia is explaining this is that the animals identified will come from areas, national parks, and game reserves where they have sustainable numbers, and they will be killed by professional hunters and distributed to people, especially in rural areas that are facing acute food insecurity. But the other part of this is that Namibia is facing serious problems with having enough grazing land, enough water for the animals and the people. And they've been seeing some serious cases of human wildlife conflict, especially with elephants. And the 83 elephants identified here are from conflict areas where already you see people getting killed by elephants. You see the population sometimes trying to revenge back on the animals. So part of this is to depopulate the population of elephants in Namibia and make sure that when there's limited water, when there's limited grazing land, you don't see increased cases of human wildlife conflict. And it's something that could only happen, like I said, in Southern Africa, because in many of the parts of the world, including here in East Africa, these wild animals are protected and even killing them, hunting is illegal, and attracts very high fines, Bianna.",

There's been opportunities, especially for digital innovation, (INAUDIBLE) within the space. SAMIR IBRAHIM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CO-FOUNDER, SUNCULTURE: The problem we're trying to solve is that smallholder farmers in Africa are incredibly unproductive. When you look at smallholder farmers around the world, they use irrigation to increase their yields and to keep animals. But because both the water pumps and the fuel for water pumps in Africa are too expensive, of the 700 million people living in smallholder farming households, only four percent irrigate. The business right now is we sell and install and we finance solar irrigation systems. So as part of the package, the farmers getting a solar panel, electronics, a water pump, irrigation systems, they're getting insulation, they're getting training, they're going ongoing aftersales support. And now we're starting to sell other products like soil tests and insurance. When we started our business, the cheapest way to do what we're doing was $25,000 per farmer. We're selling things to farmers for $350. The farmers paying us a deposit of $40 or $50 and then paying us a monthly installment of $12 or $13 to totally transform their lives, to totally increase their incomes.",

According to one internet monitoring site, service was down from 5:00 to 7:00 P.M. Eastern Tuesday. A two-hour outage may not sound serious, but some government agencies warned that it may prevent customers from calling 911 in an emergency. That's also the reason on Monday that AT&amp;T was fine nearly a million dollars over an outage last year. Well, if you're a parent, you know this, raising children is hard. Now, the U.S. Surgeon General is weighing in as well. In a new advisory, Vivek Murthy, declared that parental stress is a significant public health issue. He says parents are overwhelmed and burnt out and pushed to the brink. He's calling for programs to address the issue. Let's bring CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard, with more on this. It's fascinating to hear the Surgeon General really weigh in on these issues from mental health to parenting. Jacqueline, many parents watching may say firsthand that they are always stressed, but how big of an issue is this? And what does the Surgeon General have to say about this?",

But what this new Surgeon General advisory now tells us is about 33 percent of parents have reported feeling high levels of stress in the past month. And that's more than the share of other adults who report feeling high levels of stress which is about only 20 percent of other adults report this. So we are seeing this high level of stress specifically among parents and that's what U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy is really shedding a light on. Just recently, his office put out this video of him talking about the importance of identifying parental stress as a public health issue. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Parents and caregivers in America are under pressure. As a father of two kids, I feel this pressure too. Raising children has always been a rewarding but stressful job. They're the usual difficulties of parenting, dealing with financial concerns, worrying about our kid's health and safety, and getting through the teenage years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
