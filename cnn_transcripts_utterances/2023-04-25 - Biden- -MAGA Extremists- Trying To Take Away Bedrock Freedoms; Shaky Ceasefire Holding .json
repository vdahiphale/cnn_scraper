The lab, like all public health labs, around the world, many public health labs keep specimens of various germs.So we are told that this one could have cholera, polio, measles. It is obviously not good if this has happened. But I want to put this into perspective. There is quite a bit of measles and cholera out there already in the world. In other words, these three things are not new. It's not like those three things would be unleashed into the world for the first time. There's also actually a fair amount of polio as well. In the highly vaccinated countries, the vast majority of people are vaccinated against those. The real risk if - and again, I'm using the word if here - if something bad were to happen on purpose or by accident, the people who would be most at risk would be people who are in that immediate area, especially since you don't always have very high vaccination rates in that area. Let us take a look. You mentioned the germ bomb. So this is from CNN's medical source. What they say is that the danger lies in the outbreak of any armed confrontation in the laboratory, because that will turn the laboratory into a germ bomb. An urgent and rapid international intervention is required to restore electricity and secure the laboratory from any armed confrontation because we are facing a real biological danger. Now, again, we don't know really how much danger this presents. That remains to be seen, because there are so many ifs here. Boris?",

You don't have to actually show up, but he has shown up for a deposition. And those statements he said then could ultimately come in. And if you're E. Jean Carroll's attorneys, knowing, number one, perhaps the unpredictability of a current in-person testimony and a witness, you want to rely on what's already down in black and white on those pieces of paper through a transcript. So him not testifying might ultimately inert of the benefit of E. Jean Carroll, but then again, the amount of time that has elapsed. Some of the jurors who were voir dired they were asked the question about how they (inaudible) the Me Too movement more broadly.
