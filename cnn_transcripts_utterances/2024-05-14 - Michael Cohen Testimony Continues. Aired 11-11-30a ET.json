We're learning that Keith Davidson, who no longer represents Stormy Daniels, in the conversations, Cohen was trying to use him to make sure he had more control over when she was speaking and not. We heard about Eric Trump wanting to enforce some aspects of the arbitration, or a TRO, a temporary restraining order, against her ability to speak about a variety of issues.

He eventually gets her to do \"60 Minutes.\" I mean, once Michael Avenatti enters the chat, things related to Stormy Daniels seriously escalate.

So, here, we're in 2018. And this escalation really has to do more with Michael Cohen and him losing control of the Stormy Daniels story and Stormy Daniels herself once she takes on Michael Avenatti. So, Cohen says he, along with Trump, eventually agreed not to enforce the NDA against Daniels. So, that's really why this portion of testimony is significant, not necessarily for the alleged criminal conduct, but I think this will likely help explain the sudden decline of the relationship between Trump and Michael Cohen.",

She felt that he had put her in a position to be embarrassed. And he was president of the United States. I mean, this was a huge news story at the time. So this idea that, yes, he thought that it would be fine post-election, that might have just been for the actual -- actual votes being cast, but now he was in office, and this story really took a life as its own, as -- as Paula said, everyone kind of losing control of the story. COATES:  Do we still have Kuby with us as well on this point? Because, if we do, I want to bring him back in, because I -- you're always told in trials, especially if you have witnesses and credibility, you got to be wary of speaking in absolutes. The fact that Michael Cohen suggested yesterday in court that Donald Trump did not care at all really about Melania Trump plays into the ability of the prosecution to make its case, because they have to show, by law in New York, not an exact percentage, but that there was a substantial motivation that was the campaign. How do you think the prosecution and then the defense has to talk about how the jury should quantify this?",

But what the prosecution has done repeatedly through a number of witnesses, most recently Michael Cohen, pointing out that Donald Trump's concern, as he stated it, was always about the election. If Melania came into the conversation, she was an afterthought. So Hope Hicks testified that she had to clean up the magazines around the house, so Melania didn't see the Stormy Daniels covers, but that's a far cry from adducing testimony to say that Donald Trump was substantially concerned about his wife. And that's the problem Donald Trump has. There's only really one person who can get up on the witness stand and say the motivation for not doing what I'm accused of doing, because Donald Trump denies that he ever authorized the hush money payments, but the motivation for doing what I didn't do was to protect my wife. He has got himself in this sort of bag of denying everything, having his lawyers attack everything, that he can't really get on the stand and talk about his motivation for doing the things that he is going to swear he didn't do.

They are talking about at this point in time that, one, much of 2018, as Trump's personal attorney, he continued to deny his involvement in the payment of funds to Stormy Daniels. We're also now up to speed on that FBI raid, where Cohen is saying, he looked through the peephole. He was some people out in the hallway. He saw the badge, opened the door. He was saying at the Loews Hotel because his apartment had flooded in some respect. So we are now getting into this point. They said that they identified themselves as the FBI and asked him to step into the hallway. You can bet your bottom dollar that the jury are beginning to lean in now, hearing about this. And I want to go back to Jake on this point, because, Jake, this is the part of the story that perhaps jurors had heard about in the past that the prosecution needs to be able to address and front. And if they cannot take the sting out of things that make him seem less credible because of convictions before the defense gets up to cross, they have got a problem.",

He didn't know the FBI was coming. That's number one. Number two is, this is the turning point. This is when it all goes bad.

He just finished explaining how he interpreted a series of Trump tweets in 2018 as a caution against him cooperating with prosecutors. I want to bring in Stephanie Winston Wolkoff. She's a former senior adviser to Melania Trump and author of the book \"Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady.\" Thank you so much for joining. So, you know Michael Cohen well. You both spent years in the Trump family orbit. Neither of you are in the family orbit currently. Have you spoken with Michael Cohen recently? How is he handling any of the pressure he might feel? STEPHANIE WINSTON WOLKOFF, AUTHOR, \"MELANIA AND ME\":  Yes, Michael Cohen I have spoken often, and almost daily, Jake. And I think Michael had to come to a realization that, yes, everyone is going to barrage him with the statements that we keep hearing over and over that he lied and he lied and he lied. I think it's most important that people start now listening to Michael, because what he's been speaking about is corroborated by so many individuals that were in the Trump orbit, that were close to the family, as well as myself. And we have Allen Weisselberg, who everyone keeps discussing as well, who was a part of all of this. And he was a silent camp -- he was involved in the campaign, as was Michael, silently. And so I think people need to just start looking at the facts of the case and stop focusing on what Michael lied about for so long for Donald.",

There's a strength within her that is unlike any other individual I have ever met. She does not care what others feel about her, nor does she feel she ever had to really explain anything to the American people. And that is why she didn't move to D.C. in the beginning or when she was in the hospital. Donald's way of dealing with Melania is something that I have spoken about very -- most recently, whether it be a podcast or in interviews. And that is that I do believe it is a transactional marriage in so many ways, that they both garnered so much out of their relationship. And by marrying Donald, Melania really did finally get to be the \"Vogue\" cover model that she's always wanted to be, that supermodel. And by marrying Melania, Donald was legitimized as trying to get away from that whole Playboy mentality that -- that everyone wanted to characterize him as. Donald's main concern, yes, there is -- there is something between the two of them that others cannot deny that are close to them. Donald's main -- in my opinion, knowing Melania, knowing that she really did fight for the locker room talk, that it was something that she shared with me at lunch after she had canceled her interview with Anderson Cooper. And that was something that she was very nervous about when it first came out. And it was the only thing she thought would put the -- the -- his election at any chance of being at risk. I do not believe Donald's first priority was Melania, because she isn't going anywhere. They are, to one another, unlike anyone is to, I think, anyone else.",
