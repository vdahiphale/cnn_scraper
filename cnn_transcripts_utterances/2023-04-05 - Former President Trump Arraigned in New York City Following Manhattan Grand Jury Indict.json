But the district attorney, he also had a press conference where he could not clearly articulate. He raised a couple of options, it could be a federal crime, could be a state crime. It's not clear.

Certainly 200 more detectives that are properly trained to help solve crime, but we also have to make sure that we're investing in what works, which is making sure that we are actually adhering and enforcing the laws that are already on the books, like the red flag laws. These are situations where individuals who have guns should not have them. We don't manufacture guns in the city of Chicago, but yet they flow through our streets, and they've caused incredible havoc.
