Plus, mysterious reports emerge in Iran that schoolgirls are being poisoned nearly 900 students have been affected. Welcome to our second hour of \"Connect the World\"! Israel's far right Finance Minister says the Palestinian village of Huwara \"Needs to be erased\". The town which is in occupied territory was already torched earlier this week by Israeli settlers, but there a little - now thinks the State of Israel and not just settlers needs to take action and those comments drawing a rare condemnation from the U.S. State Department.

The top U.S. and Russian diplomats have had an impromptu face to face meeting for the first time since Russia launched its so called special military operation in Ukraine a year ago. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in New Delhi. U.S. official says Blinken initiated that brief meeting. When it happens as Russian security officials announced what they say is a Ukrainian raid inside Russia. Regional Governor reports two people killed. President Vladimir Putin calls it a terrorist attack. Ukraine denies it calling it either a Russian provocation or an attack by Russian partisans who oppose their government. Kylie Atwood is following all of this from Washington. First to Fred Pleitgen, who is in Moscow! Let's start with that meeting in India G20 Finance Ministers Meeting.

And they're sort of trying to brush off the importance of that meeting between the two Foreign Ministers between the Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister a little bit. In fact, the main headline that we're seeing on state media here it was a meeting on the go as they said. Of course we know it lasted about 10 minutes. Nevertheless, Secretary State Blinken said that he did raise some serious concerns for the United States. Among them of course the fate of Paul Whelan whom the U.S. says is wrongfully detained here in Russia, saying that there was a substantial proposal on the table. But then, of course, those two key things, one of them being the New START Treaty, obviously Russia has suspended its participation. The U.S. said it called Russia out on that. And one of the things that Secretary of State Blinken said is that he urged the Russians to get back into compliance with that treaty. The Russians, of course, have a big issue with some of the inspections that are supposed to be part of that treaty. And then, of course, the war in Ukraine and that's a point that Secretary of State Blinken then later made in his press conference as well. But from the Russian perspective, Becky, they are downplaying all that they're just saying it was a short meeting it happened on the sidelines, there was no agreement reached. And they didn't really go into detail as to what was exactly said. They didn't refute anything that the U.S. has put out there at Secretary of State Blinken put out there. But they certainly aren't offering very much in the details except for them it's very important to point out that it was the U.S. side that wanted this meeting to take place. Of course, while it was short while it was on the sidelines and still is a key meeting the first time that the two diplomats meet really since Geneva in January of 2022, before the war in Ukraine even started so that alone makes all this pretty important, Becky.",

It's the first time that these top diplomats from the U.S. and Russia have met since before the war actually began their last meeting in January of 2022. So the fact that the Secretary of State took the initiative here, according to a U.S. official, he was the one who approached Lavrov and delivered some clear messages in person is quite significant. We know that of the things that he rose was the need to for Russia to end its war of aggression. We also know that he brought up Paul Whelan, who's an American who has been wrongfully detained in Russia for more than four years now. He said that there's actually a significant serious proposal that the United States has put on the table and he urged Russia to accept it. That's the first that we've heard that there's actually a tangible proposal that the United States has put on the table with Russia to try and secure Paul Whelan's release. And then the third thing, of course, that he touched on was Russia recently suspending participation in the New START Treaty, listen to what he described himself as saying to Foreign Minister Lavrov on that topic.

The third carriage behind me derailed and is now on its side. There have been dozens of deaths, dozens more injured and still in hospital, including those in intensive care some in a critical condition. And according to local hospital officials, many of those involved in the collision were young people. Now of course, there have been questions around the safety measures across the country's rail system, which is comparatively weaker than its European neighbors, the transport minister himself going too fast to step down from his position. He said that this was a sign of respect to those who lost their lives. But also conceded that the safety measures here in Greece simply aren't up to the standard one would expect in the 21st century. And of course, this has drawn a major backlash. There was anger and frustration across the country. We've seen protests taking place in the capitol in Athens.

The crewscheduled to spend six months there, it includes astronaut Sultan Alneyadi from right here in the UAE. Dubbed the Sultan space, he is the first Arab to be deployed on a long-term space mission. Alneyadi plans to fast during the holy month of Ramadan, though he says that will be a challenge because the space station sees about 16 sunrises and sunsets each day. CNN's Space Correspondent Kristin Fisher tracking the mission for us. And this is Kristin another very special moment for the Arab world, particularly for the country that I'm here in the United Arab Emirates, the second Emirati to travel to space programs here space programs are developing at a rapid pace. What do you make of what you're saying? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Becky, I mean, you know that the United Arab Emirates has invested so much time and money over the last decade or so to really become the leading space power in the Arab world. And so that's really what this launch last night represents. You know, the UAE launched a probe to Mars that has been very successful, they're planning to launch a probe to actually land on the moon next year. But last night, that astronaut right there, Sultan Alneyadi just became the Roosevelt to become the first astronaut from the United Arab Emirates to do what's called a long duration spaceflight and only the second from that nation to actually fly in space. And so, getting to do a long duration spaceflight is actually something that is very prestigious, very difficult, very technical. I mean, to spend six months up there, floating in space, requires a tremendous amount of training. And this is all training that he has done over the last year or so if not longer at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, alongside his crewmates, two NASA astronauts, and one Russian cosmonaut. So, this is a very international very diverse mission, they call it crew six, to the International Space Station. It's a partnership between NASA and SpaceX in terms of getting the astronauts there that Crew Dragon capsule launched successfully last night from the Kennedy Space Center. Becky, it's going to take about 24 hours or so for those astronauts to actually dock at the International Space Station. But when they do, all those astronauts are going to whether it really marks the beginning of their six months stay up there. And we've seen what can happen when things go wrong. Those missions can often get extended to about a year. So, they say they're going to be up there for six months. But something could happen and they could stay longer Becky.",

That's what some are calling the unique positioning of Jupiter and Venus; these two planets are passing each other in what's called a conjunction. Right now, Jupiter and Venus are the brightest objects in the sky after the moon. The phenomenon started on Wednesday, but the planets continue to appear close together in the night skies. Tonight, keep your eyes peeled folks. Wherever you are watching in the world, you are watching \"Connect the World\" live from Abu Dhabi. Coming up some say the gut is the brain second body will tell you and get you a look at how one artist uses the gut to heal trauma that is after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
