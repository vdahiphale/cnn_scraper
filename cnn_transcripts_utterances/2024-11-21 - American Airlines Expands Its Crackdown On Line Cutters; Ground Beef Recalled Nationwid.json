But this is kind of the most necessary at American Airline, the largest airline in the U.S., has nine, count them, nine boarding groups. Really 10 when you consider pre-boarding. Group one, of course, boards first. If you're not familiar with this, that's pretty much those with first-class tickets. Group nine is the last. Those are the folks with the cheapest basic economy tickets, the dreaded basic economy. There are few ways to get status in between. Group five, you have an American credit card. Group six, you have a frequent flier account. You can kind of see why people might get confused by this, or simply just try to cut the boarding sequence. And there is a name that those who this, for those who do this, put out by a lot of the Travel AvGeek bloggers. They're called Gate Lice. And so now when the gate agent scans their boarding pass, you can hear this audible alert. Here it is again. (BEEPING) (LAUGHTER)",

And American has been testing this at some smaller airports like Albuquerque and Tucson. A bigger hub, Reagan National Airport, has been one of the test beds just outside of D.C. here. But American says this will also be in place at Austin Bergstrom and Atlanta, Hartsfield-Jackson, in time for the holidays. Atlanta is the busiest airport in the U.S. Then about 100 additional airports beyond that. This is significant because American is expecting about 8.3 million passengers over the Thanksgiving rush, a total of about 77,000 flights.

He's the one that gets to dominate the herd. Giraffe, generally speaking, are not aggressive towards people. They can be very defensive. I've seen -- I've seen a giraffe actually kill a lioness trying to kill her calf with one kick, broke the lioness' back in Africa. So they can be very dangerous that way.
