Former U.S. President Donald Trump is now facing federal charges related to his handling of classified documents, this as he's also running for re-election. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says the U.K. and the U.S. are both doing their bid in supporting Ukraine in the war with Russia, a CNN exclusive interview. And the desperate rescue attempts after a dam collapses in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says is responsible. We begin with an unprecedented move from the U.S. Justice Department indicting former President Donald Trump. His attorney says Trump is facing seven counts under the Espionage Act, including conspiracy, obstruction, and making false statements. It's all related to the former president's alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left the White House. FBI agents seized about 100 documents marked as classified when they searched his Florida state last August. Trump says on social media he's been summoned to appear at a federal courthouse in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: It's called election interference. They're trying to destroy a reputation so they can win an election. That's just as bad as doing any of the other things that have been done over the last number of years. I'm an innocent man. I did nothing wrong. I'm innocent, and we will prove that very, very soundly and hopefully very quickly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is to say that amid these accusations from Republicans that this is a politicization of the Justice Department that the White House has remained out of criminal affairs as it relates to any active criminal investigations or prosecutorial actions by the Department of Justice.

Bush and have found the Trump Party, Trump-era GOP to be something they can no longer, you know, align with. And so it's -- of a pattern.I mean, Trump, the entire Trump strategy is about doubling down on mobilizing the base without a lot of concern about what, you know, it does on the other side of the equation. But we saw in 2018, in 2020, and in 2022 that while he does in fact energize a lot of Republican voters, he also provokes a massive backlash and I think the polling is very clear on this game that outside of the Republican base, multiple criminal indictments is not a calling card, is not something that makes people more likely to vote for you and don't forget he fell seven million votes short last time. It's just hard to see how any of this gets him closer to getting over the top in a general election even as it's making it tougher for his rivals to beat him for the nomination.",

How we research them, how we develop them, how we protect them from falling into the wrong hands. Or indeed in things like critical minerals, where the U.K. and the U.S. have today launched negotiations on a critical minerals agreement to ensure the security of those supply chains.
