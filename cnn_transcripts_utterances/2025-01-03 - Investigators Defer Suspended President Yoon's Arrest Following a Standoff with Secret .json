Hours ago, investigators tried to serve him an arrest warrant at his official residence amid a boisterous crowd that included hundreds of his supporters. But after a dramatic standoff with his security detail, the operation was called off citing security concerns.The arrest warrant is still valid and it can be extended. Yoon is facing charges of abuse of power and orchestrating a rebellion following a short-lived martial law he imposed last month. Those charges can potentially carry the death penalty. Mike Valerio is monitoring those developments, joining us now live from Seoul. From a very chaotic scene, I'm sure it's been, Mike, in the last couple of hours. We now know that investigators have abandoned their attempts to arrest Yoon. The question is, what comes next and will they try again?",

      "sentences": "Right, and nobody knows the answer to that question because if you can only imagine what the prosecutors and investigators are thinking about, Christina, at this hour, they have failed in their attempt to try to hold the suspended president, Yoon Suk-yeol, accountable for throwing this country down the path of martial law one year ago tonight, happened on December 3rd into the early morning hours of December 4th.So, what do they do now? They have to regroup and try to prevent kind of like a human shield from forming around South Korea's impeached and now suspended president. But to give you an idea of the tableau, we've gone from the standoff, which happened almost over the course of seven hours, to this mood of celebration. Everybody who you see in our live shot, Christina, let's say 99 percent of who you see in our live shot, they're all supporters of South Korea's Yoon Suk-yeol, the first person elected to the presidency here in South Korea who's been subjected to arrest, questioning, and potentially criminal charges. So, we can report that there's the criminal investigation, which is what this arrest was all about. And then we have the impeachment bucket, the political bucket. And January 14th, not this coming Tuesday, but the Tuesday after, that's going to be the first trial session of the suspended president's impeachment proceedings. So, his detractors, most of this country, hope that he will be removed from office through that impeachment. And there are so many across this country who hope that he will also face criminal charges as well. But the people who we see in the background all around us, Christina, this is part of the conservative slice of South Korea's electorate who are in favor of his policies. They might be against martial law, but they see him as a vanguard of conservatism in South Korea, and they are against him being removed and against him being suspended. So, this is where we find ourselves. South Korea has never experienced this before. A critical democracy in this corner of the world. And now the question is, with the arrest warrant that is valid until Monday morning, how do investigators try again? And do they try again to arrest President Yoon Suk-yeol?",

Thanks very much, Mike.Well, for more analysis, we're joined by Duyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. She is joining us live from Seoul. Thank you so much for your time. As we were hearing from Mike there, it does appear we are in uncharted territory here. And we know that President Yoon has not only ignored three summonses to appear for questioning, he has now avoided an arrest warrant attempt. South Korean police are saying it's practically impossible to arrest him. So where will this go next? How will this be resolved? [03:05:03] DUYEON KIM, ADJUNCT SR. FELLOW, CENTER FOR A NEW AMERICAN SOCIETY: Well, thanks for having me back. So, we don't know how this will be resolved, just because this is the first time they've tried to arrest and question a sitting South Korean president. So, what you have right now, what's going on is that you've got Yoon's lawyers who say that he will definitely go through all the proper legal processes regarding his declaration of martial law, but they're taking issue with the current process. They're saying that the investigative agency that is leading the investigation and trying to detain him, Yoon's side is saying that it's unlawful, that it's the wrong agency to be doing so. And so, they're really, you know, the opposition party and Yoon's side and the ruling conservative party, they're clashing over legalities and procedure right now.

But the constitutional court is now up next to decide his fate, to actually see if he is going to be ousted or not. But you also have the opposition party that wants to conduct this investigation into the martial law declaration as an insurrection. And so, you have multiple procedures that are happening at the same time.

Are each of these institutions functioning as they should in the midst of this chaos? KIM: Well, you know, technically, each component or each actor is trying to do their job. The Secret Service, their job is to protect the president legally. Yoon Suk-yeol is still legally the incumbent president, even though the National Assembly has impeached him. But again, the constitutional court needs to decide what happens to him. And so, each side, there are various investigative agencies that are involved, including the police, on trying to detain him. And they're trying to do their job, but they're brushing up against the president's guards and Secret Service. And so, you know, it really in the grand scheme of things, because there is also, you know, that I mentioned before, the whole debate over the legalities of procedure, that's not black and white. And so, you know, it's easy to question whether South Korea's institutions and agencies really are functioning properly because there does not seem to be a clear-cut path forward right now. But, you know, the, you know -- another big issue or another big concern right now is on a macro level is, you know, what this political uncertainty, the prolonged uncertainty does to South Korea's national security and economy. And, you know, the country's economy and national security really are at stake right now with this leadership vacuum and with this prolonged process of a situation where no one really knows how this will end, although it seems like, there will have the Constitutional Court will have to do its job, too, as we'll have to see how the situation plays out there in that court as well.",

Consultants warned mass shootings and vehicle attacks were highly possible whilst moderately probable. New Orleans officials say they were in the process of replacing the metal posts at the time of the attack. But a source says the city owns temporary barriers that could have blocked access to Bourbon Street, yet chose not to use them on New Year's Eve. Well, newly released surveillance video shows the attackers rented truck barreling down Bourbon Street at a dangerously high speed while people darted out of the way. Well, Glenn Schoen is a security management consultant and expert on terrorism. He joins me now from The Hague in the Netherlands. Thanks for joining us, Glenn. It's particularly galling to learn in the aftermath of this attack that authorities knew a vehicle attack like this was highly probable, according to this security firm. I mean, as we pore over the aftermath of this, Glenn, what lessons will we learn, not just in New Orleans, but perhaps police departments around the country, the need for protection against this type of attack?",

We've had incidents in the U.S. tied to extremism or terrorism in vehicles in 2016, North Carolina. We had an incident in Ohio in 2016, 2017. We had another one in New York City in 2018; Fort Meade, Maryland. So this is a known threat, both overseas, of course, in Europe, as well as in the U.S. There's also been for quite a while now, some standards in place from the U.S. DOD, 0201, and one from the ASTM, which is basically an industry standard for safety on what kind of vehicle barriers can you put against what kind of vehicle threat. So, it's already known what we can do about this, where you can place these, how they might be the most effective, what grade of vehicle will they stop? The big question has always been, can we make this an enforced standard? Can we make it an industry standard? So local, regional, state, national authorities need to use this, yes or no, at particular type of events, yes or no. And that's still not standardized, and that's part of the big debate now.",

And this is now, again, with terrible toll, overtaking it right away. So, you're right in that this, again, it's a principal threat. What's sad is it appears that some of the lessons we should have learned from a few years ago have not, or at least we haven't been disciplined about applying the lessons. Europe, in some ways, may have learned them better. We see more standardization in more countries around some of these efforts than perhaps in the U.S. It's always sad that we're, have a phase after these attacks of basically the blame game where the lawyers enter the equation.

So far, we have dozens of Republicans that have not said what they are going to do, that they're sort of keeping things up in the air. And that's an incredibly precarious situation for Mike Johnson, because as the report already mentioned, he can only lose one vote.

And there are others that are worried that he spends too much or that he is a neocon, really, and is ideologically not on the same page as many of the Trumpian Republicans.

And it's also highlighting the political fault lines on the continent. The pro-Russian prime minister of Slovakia, which up until now got about two-thirds of its gas from Russia via Ukraine, accusing Europe of putting politics first. ROBERT FICO, SLOVAKIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Nobody, I repeat, nobody is pushing Slovakia away from the living space, that is the European community. But we must see that selfish national interests of the big ones and meaningless geopolitical goals are beginning to dominate this community. And on the other hand, ignoring the needs of smaller ones. In world politics, it absolutely applies that it does not matter whether elephants love or fight. The grass always suffers. I do not want Slovakia to be such grass, as we see these days when the transit of gas through Ukraine is stopped, which will have drastic impacts on all of us in the European Union, but not on the Russian Federation.",

      "sentences": "So, over seven days, we coordinated 100 people to excavate these footprints and what we uncovered was just incredible.The footprints at the site are from at least two different types of dinosaur. A huge herbivorous dinosaur called a sauropod. Those are the ones with the very long necks and the very long tails, like Brachiosaurus or Brontosaurus. Those footprints are 90 centimeters long, the largest ones. The other type of track, the fifth track, was made by a carnivorous dinosaur called Megalosaurus. And so, they have the really distinctive three-toed footprints. And they're massive, they're 65 centimeters from front to back. So, the great thing about what we call trace fossils is that it shows us dinosaur behavior. We've calculated the speeds that they were walking and they were walking at the same speed. They were both walking at about three miles per hour and that's actually the same speed of an average adult human. LINDELL (voice-over): The trackways lie across the working quarry, so they're not safe for the public to visit. But scientists are figuring out how to preserve them so that people can see the dinosaur footprints in the future. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
