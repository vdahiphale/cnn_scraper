President Biden announced the three-phase peace proposal on Friday, insisting that it's time for Israel's war with Hamas to end. The administration is still waiting for an official response from the terrorist group.Joining us now is CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks, and CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid. Barak, we've been hearing some contradictory responses from Israel since this ceasefire proposal was unveiled on Friday by President Biden. What do you know about these efforts to get this deal approved? What's the latest?",

It was transferred to the U.S. to Egypt and to Qatar last week, and they transferred it to Hamas.I will tell you one more thing. I'm now reading to you the headline of this document -- the headline of this document that was passed to Hamas and that President Biden based his speech on Israel's response on May -- on May 6, 2024, proposal. This is the headline. Israel's response. So, I think anybody who says that this is not an Israeli proposal is being inaccurate, to say the least.",

And Netanyahu is referring to one clause, specifically.And this is the clause that says that on day 16 of the implementation of the deal, Israel and Hamas are supposed to start a negotiation over the next phase, and over what is called the cessation of hostilities. And in those negotiations, each side can bring his own positions and his own demands. And Netanyahu is saying I will demand in those negotiations that you know, the war will end only if Hamas's military capabilities are not there anymore, and only if Hamas will not rule the Gaza Strip on the day after the war.",

Let's be frank. So, there is a difference between not having the capability to conduct military operations and the destruction of Hamas. And that's where Netanyahu and his cabinet are viewing it visa vie what the -- our administration is viewing it. I think it's significant that Israel and the United States have a really strong conversation about this. Look, Israel is not going to walk away from what has taken place in Gaza. They're going to be very much engaged in what this thing looks like going forward, and they want to have a military capability for the potential inevitability to launch operations very quickly, very precisely back into Gaza, post some form of a ceasefire and inevitable reconstruction.",

He pretty much followed the line and Judge Juan Merchan has seen a lot more active defendants in his criminal courts over the years than what we've seen here. And with respect to the criminal contempt findings, I don't think they're going to weigh into the decision of the sentencing because he's already been punished for the criminal contempt finding. He was fined $1,000 per violation that the court found him guilty of after a hearing. It wouldn't be appropriate, nor do I think Judge Merchan would be allowed to consider that in giving a sentence.
