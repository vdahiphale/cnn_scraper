I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and this is the CNN Newsroom. Straight ahead, extreme heat in Saudi Arabia has led to the deaths of hundreds of Muslim pilgrims performing the Hajj in Mecca. And there are growing concerns that Israel's Iron Dome could be overwhelmed if a full-blown war breaks out against Hezbollah. And less than a week to go before the CNN U.S. presidential debate, we'll check in with both camps and see what strategies they're using to prepare for the television contest. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca this year, but hundreds won't be returning home. A dangerous heatwave has gripped Saudi Arabia, bringing sweltering temperatures to the annual event. Pilgrims are contending with 50 degree heat. That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit. For some, it's proved fatal. The toll so far is 460 and expected to rise. Saudi Arabia has deployed army personnel and volunteers to respond to heat emergencies. India's capital is also sweltering in the summer heat. One part of Delhi saw its highest ever temperature of just under 50 degrees Celsius. Nightfall brings little to no relief to Indians, many of whom do not have access to air conditioning. And in Brazil, thousands of hectares of wetlands are charred, thanks to a series of unprecedented fires, smoke and ash making living near the Pantanal wetland nearly impossible. Making matters worse, a heatwave is expected in the area. Julia Vargas Jones has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JULIA VARGAS JONES, CN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The world's largest freshwater wetland, scorched. Aerial footage captures the true scope of the blaze, what should be green now turned to ash. This month alone, authorities detected 1,729 fire sources in Brazil's massive Pantanal wetlands, and nearly 1.3 million acres have already burned this year. Along with them, some of its precious fauna, like the approximately 10 million crocodiles that called this place home. Over the crackling of the fire, you can hear the animals trying to escape, this woman says. Last week, children had to be evacuated from a school in Mato Grosso do Sul state when the fire got too close, and residents tried to continue to make a living as if life is normal under a blanket of ash, smoke hovering over the rivers in a glowing orange sky. But, experts warn that the worst may be yet to come, as the region is bracing for an impending heatwave. Isabelle Bueno, who is part of a conservation group trying to protect the Pantanal. She says too much heat, not enough rain, lots of wind, and extremely low water levels on the main river of the biome have created the perfect storm and only six months after the last fire season. One firefighter telling CNN, the scenes look apocalyptic. They've been battling the fire for 10 days, going into remote hard-to- reach areas day and night. But, the area is vast and resources scarce. This fire chief of a nonprofit brigade thanks a local farmer for giving his crew a ride to the fire line. Otherwise, he says, it would be a two day's walk. What Pantanal urgently needs, experts say, is airplanes to drop water on the burning patches. We do the impossible with very little and we need help, she says. Julia Vargas Jones, CNN, Los Angeles.

      "sentences": "Hey, Fredricka. Yeah. The Saudi government has got the army out in force to try to help people there. They have set up water stations. There are misting systems in place. But, at the end of the day, we are talking about a pilgrimage and an event that is almost entirely outdoors, involves this year about 1.5 million pilgrims. And it is also an obligation in the Islamic faith to go to Hajj, to attend this pilgrimage at least once in your lifetime if you are physically and financially able to. And though the dates change every year, according to the Islamic calendar, this year, it happens to fall in June.There is not much you can do about it and there is really not much you can do about the sweltering temperatures, really dangerous temperatures that we're talking about, reaching some 49 or 50 degrees Celsius on Monday. That's about 120 or so degrees Fahrenheit. I mean, it's frankly dangerous to be outdoors in those kinds of temperatures. 2,700 people is what the Saudi government says have been treated for heatstroke. And now that the Hajj ended officially on Wednesday, we're also getting a look at the number of people who actually died during that period. And as you pointed out, the numbers are staggering. 460 is the number that we know thus far. But, there are reports that the true number could be over 1,000. That's because some people are still in the hospital. Some people are unaccounted for. And some people are also not being counted in some of the official data because they are not officially considered to be Hajj pilgrims. And the reason why is because you'll recall that in previous years, they have had enormous issues with the volume of people trying to do their Hajj pilgrimage all in the same year. And so, to try to get the numbers under control and prevent the kinds of scenes that we saw in 2015, for instance, where you had a stampede that killed more than 2,000 people, Saudi officials have put caps on the number of people who can come from various countries. But, look, those people are given special Hajj visas. But, you can also nowadays go to Saudi Arabia on a business visa or a tourist visa. It's really not that difficult. And so, some people are going that way. The difficulty, though, Fredricka, is that you may end up with some pretty substandard accommodation, a tent in the desert, whereas the official pilgrims are sleeping in air conditioned tents, or you might end up getting lost or running into health trouble while walking between some of these sites, whereas the official pilgrims will have access to some better transportation options and things like that. And as I said, look, most countries are just reporting the number of official pilgrims. But, when you look at Tunisia, for instance, they say 35 people were killed. Just five of them were official Hajj pilgrims. The rest were not. So, perhaps that illustrates that the true number may be much, much higher than the official ones at this point. Fredricka.",

Israel should be concerned about the effectiveness of the Iron Dome, Fredricka, because, (inaudible) already is that Hezbollah has posted video showing one of their missiles striking a battery of the Iron Dome. You have to keep in mind the difference between what Hamas has and what Hezbollah has. Hezbollah is much better supplied with precision weaponry. And because of the terrain, for instance, you see, it's very mountainous here, they have in many areas the high ground. They can shoot down into Israeli positions.And also, because of things like just Google Earth. You can go on Google Earth and find where Israeli positions are. And we've seen in that nine-minute drone video that was published by Hezbollah that they actually identify individual Iron Dome positions. And what we've seen in the past is that they have, according to the Israelis, prior to this war, more than 150,000 rockets and missiles. The assumption is they may have well more than that, many of them far more sophisticated than anything Hamas has. So, the assumption is that in the event of an escalation, they will fire swarms of drones in the direction of an Iron Dome or other air defense systems and be able to knock them out. Will they be able to knock out the entirety of the system? Highly unlikely. But, what we've seen over the last few months, actually since October, is that Hezbollah has systematically targeted the border surveillance posts of the Israeli army. When the Israelis, when they were knocked out, the Israelis brought in cranes on which they put the same equipment. Hezbollah struck those cranes. So, the Israelis themselves say that Hezbollah is far more sophisticated than they thought, certainly since the beginning of this war. So, yes, there should be real concern among the Israelis, ergo the Americans, that the Iron Dome system isn't quite the insurance policy the Israelis perhaps assume. Fredricka.",

MAGA Inc. last month reported a $68 million haul. Now, $65 million of that came from just three donations, all from billionaires. One of those billionaires gave $50 million. Interestingly, that individual, Timothy Mellon, had previously given $25 million to RFK Jr.'s campaign, but now he has given to Trump after this felony conviction.

The way we understand it, they'll begin rather informally, going through those binders of questions and answers, trying to frame some of the responses, some of the retorts. Ultimately, that will all build up to some mock debates that the President will engage in.We do understand that the person who is likely to stand in for President Trump is Bob Bauer. He is the President's personal attorney. He filled that role back in 2020. And it was interesting. He just has a book out this week, and he talks about filling in that Trump role, and he said he didn't necessarily assume the voice. He didn't put on a red tie. But, he did try and really hone in on those personal attacks that they think Trump will levy against Biden in that debate. And so, certainly, you can imagine doing that again this time around. Now, we did just learn, that's in the last few minutes or so, what President Biden will be doing after the debate. He is going to head to Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign event. North Carolina is the state that Trump won by the smallest margin compared to Biden in 2020. It's certainly a state that the Biden team very much wants to put in their column this time around. And certainly, their hope is that the President will be propelled into that stop on Friday by a strong debate performance down there in Atlanta on Thursday. But, certainly, he will have a lot of time to prepare. Now, we did see him heading off to Camp David. Last night, he was asked how the debate prep was going and he gave a thumbs up.

That doesn't sound like a President who is taking care that the laws be faithfully executed as the Article Two requires of a President.So, those aren't official acts.

It is unusual how Judge Cannon has handled this case, even from the beginning, and that was something that we're now learning through this New York Times reporting, it may have been expected or suspected by other judges on the bench down in South Florida. So, Fred, after Judge Cannon was randomly selected to take on the Trump case and oversee it out of her courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she sits alone, the only district court judge up there in that courthouse quite remote from the rest of the bench in South Florida.Two different judges, including the chief judge of the district, called her to suggest that she may want to hand it off, that she was very far away from where most of the national security cases were handled, like in Miami and other jurisdictions, and that the optics might not be great because she had not handled something appropriately that she had, as part of the case, before it was charged when she blocked the Justice Department from accessing for months records that were taken out of Mar-a-Lago and then an appeals court said, she got the law, absolutely wrong, and that should not be the situation that she is allowing for Donald Trump. So, Judge Cannon, at that time, she didn't step down. She didn't take the advice or the suggestion of one of her colleagues on the bench and the chief judge of the very district she sits in, and she decided to hold on to the case. We're now a year after the indictment, Fred, and she is working through many things. There is a very long road, months, if not years, ahead to go in this case of work that Judge Cannon needs to do. And today, she is holding the first of a three-part hearing today, Monday, Tuesday, where she is looking at many different questions. Today, the question is if she believes the Special Counsel is valid, has the power to charge this case. Other judges across the country shot that down much more quickly.

And that really is likely to annoy some of the U.S.'s closer -- closest allies which have been waiting for these interceptors for, in some cases, several years, and the U.S. is going to have some pretty tough conversations with these countries about the fact that Ukraine really has to take priority at this point because they're being, of course, pummeled by Russian missiles daily. And so, what this is going to do is hopefully allow Ukraine to maintain security of its cities as it goes into the late summer months, fall and winter. And ideally, this is going to last them for quite some time because that funding stream that the U.S. has is not going to last forever, right?

But, unlike isolated, impoverished North Korea, Vietnam is emerging as an economic powerhouse of Southeast Asia. In less than a year, Hanoi has welcomed us President Joe Biden, China's President Xi Jinping, and now Putin, a pariah in the West, but not here.
