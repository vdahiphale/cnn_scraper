People have started filling in as the primetime part of this event really kicks off, and you can see there's New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand right there, part of the New York delegation. On the floor here you have delegates, party activists who may be grassroots activists side-by-side, rubbing elbows with sitting US senators. You've also got volunteers who are working the floor to make sure we're all going to the right place or not in the wrong place And then you have the events that are happening up on the stage, where the Democratic Party is trying to lay out for the people here in the convention and also for the American people, the message they want to send. This is union messaging right now. That's actually the New York delegation. We just walked by Randi Weingarten, teachers union, is sitting there. So the unions here are represented. The grassroots activists and the elected officials as well, Jake, and it's filling up.

LEE, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right and we are going to be hearing tonight from the couple that currently occupies the White House. Of course, Jill Biden, the First Lady and President Joe Biden, he is going to be making an aggressive case for why Democrats must elect Kamala Harris come November and we expect plenty of emotional tributes to the president. But tomorrow night, Jake, we are going to be hearing from the couple that occupied the White House eight years ago. This is former First Lady Michelle Obama, and of course former President Barack Obama and they are going to be speaking as a couple that can speak to the importance of the presidency, the high stakes of the election coming up in November. And what I'm being told by a source is that when it comes to former President Barack Obama, he will very much lean into why he believes Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are ready to lead the country at this moment. As for Michelle Obama, the First Lady who we haven't heard actually much from during this campaign cycle, she is going to lean into this idea that she believes Kamala Harris is absolutely ready for the job and that she can help the country turn the page, I'm told, on fear and division. And she's really going to stress that she believes Harris is one of the most qualified candidates to ever seek the presidency. Now, we do expect both Obamas to be involved in different ways throughout the course of the campaign, as we get closer to November. The former president, in particular is looking for ways to zero in on those persuadable voters in areas where he might be able to move the needle, I am told, but all of that of course, is quickly being reconfigured because we now have a new person at the very top of the ticket -- Jake.",

You saw a thing on their posters on Friday at her speech that I think you may see around here saying \"a new way forward.\" Well, implicit in that is it's not going to be the same and how you navigate that tonight, I think will be interesting to watch. COOPER: There was a moment the other day when a reporter asked President Biden words the effect of, you know, how will you feel if she's -- breaks away from your economic policy?

What are you hoping to hear from President Biden tonight? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Well, I'm hoping that the president will just take such pride in all that he has accomplished. We are here to talk about his legacy and I want him to talk about it as well. And also, the comfort level that he has with passing the baton to another generation.

She was one of the first black women to win a solo at a Grammy, and also has been praised by Beyonce, that matters.But also even Isbell, he has a huge progressive following online, and we've talked about this being a very online campaign. He's someone who has really been a kind of counter voice to the conservative voice of country music, or at least corporate country music, and he's someone who's always spoken out against that. I think him being on stage tonight is like a fascinating example of how the campaign is in dialogue with the culture, especially the culture of progressives online.",

Tomorrow night, she will be in Milwaukee at a campaign rally. Of course, a neighboring state, a battleground state. But here tonight, she'll be watching this speech. And of course, the speech from Hillary Clinton as well. She'll be coming home to Chicago, of course, her native Illinois that speech also will be so important as she passes the torch in a different way. Vice President Harris will make her first appearance. She will not be apparent every night like Donald Trump did, but tonight is her first appearance until Thursday when she accepts the nomination.
