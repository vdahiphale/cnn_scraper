We begin with the midterm elections now just 15 days away. Early voting already under way with more than 5.8 million ballots cast in 39 states.Right now, polls and political spending suggests Republicans are surging and stand a good chance of retaking the House of Representatives with a solid majority. Recent surveys show the reason for that surge, the economy, inflation, and to a lesser degree, crime. Early this Summer looked like the anger at the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe versus Wade would give Democrats a chance to hold back the red tide and keep control of the house. Now it looks like that abortion-fueled momentum may have peaked too soon. Democrats are having to split their messaging between abortion and the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  Nobody said we're doing abortion rather than the economy. But it's about both.

They are emphasizing the initiatives, the legislation and spending plans that they and Joe Biden have passed, including what they call the Inflation Reduction Act, but can probably best be described as that clean energy and prescription drug plan, emphasizing that over the long-term it will reduce costs for especially seniors, but everyone who relies on prescription drugs --",

It doesn't necessarily mean the same thing this year, and the reason why is COVID.Those COVID patterns set in 2020 where people became very comfortable with early voting. That's what predominantly Democrats want to do now. And so the question is, does this show huge enthusiasm, new voters coming out, new women voting for abortion protections, or is this just the people who would have voted any way voting early? [05:05:00] Maybe some voting early because they're concerned about restrictions at the polls, challenges at the polls, long lines, you know, fights over can you get a bottle of water in line, and saying I don't want to mess with that, I'm just going to vote now. If they're voting now, that's great. But it doesn't mean a Democratic surge between now and election day. And so I think, that's, you know, that's one of the big questions here.",

The three countries, the U.S., Britain and France all saying that they don't believe any of this is true. They're saying this looks like transparently false information, and could be used as a pretext for further escalation here in Ukraine. And it was quite interesting because the Russian defense minister, when he spoke to the French defense minister, he said that he feared that there could be an uncontrolled escalation here in this country. Unclear why exactly the Russians are saying this, but certainly right now, it looks like on many parts of the battlefield here in Ukraine, they are continuing to lose. But what they are doing, and what they're certainly continuing to do, Christine, is hitting the civilian infrastructure of this country very hard. It was an extremely tough weekend here for the folks in Ukraine, and especially on Saturday, there were flurry of Russian strikes especially towards the west of the country, hitting that critical infrastructure. Hitting power plants, but also, of course, hitting civilian areas as well. And if you look at the place that I am right now, Zaporizhzhia, this is an area that's in the south of Ukraine. It's very close to Russian position. So what they do here is they use less of those long distance missiles, but they use missiles that  are normally used to shoot down planes and hit civilian areas with them.
