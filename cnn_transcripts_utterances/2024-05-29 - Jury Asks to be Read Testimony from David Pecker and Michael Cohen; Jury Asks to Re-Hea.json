But his testimony about, reading from the note, the decision not to finalize and fund the assignment of Karen McDougal's life rights, that could be 20, 30 pages of testimony, maybe not even consecutive.So what the lawyers are doing right now is they're sitting there with a mountain of transcripts, thousands of pages, maybe they're word searching, and they're saying, OK, question one, can we agree that that's page 484, lines 23 through 492?

Sometimes they'll have extended debate back and forth. Now, this is a little more simple because you're just talking about pages of transcript testimony, so they're just going to decide how much of it. If it's a question of, well, how do we explain the concept of reasonable doubt, how do we explain, again, to the jurors what their role is, they may come back with a question like that. They'll go back and forth, and then ultimately the judge will make a call as to how much to provide, if at all.

Four different instances where right now you have lawyers figuring out what they're going to share with the jury to answer their questions.Let's bring in former Trump attorney William Brennan. He represented Trump payroll in the Trump Org payroll case. I think I have that correct there, William. William, tell us what you think of what the jury is requesting here. David Pecker's testimony regarding a phone conversation with Trump while Pecker was in the investor meeting. Pecker's testimony about the decision not to finalize and fund assignment of Karen McDougal's life rights. And then Pecker's testimony regarding a Trump Tower meeting.

They heard about the McDougal scenario. Then they heard from Ms. Clifford from Stormy Daniels, and they could look at it one of two ways. They could say, well, these things happen. We saw it happen with Governor Schwarzenegger, with Hulk Hogan, with many other celebrities, and this is the way people in that world work.Or they could look at it and say this is nefarious, and the Daniels payment was done because the defendant was in the midst of an election, and that's really what the case will hinge on.",

This is about the Daniels payment, but the other two instances were introduced, and it could have a spillover effect on the issue that they're really looking to solve.But it seemed to me, you know, just from the cheap seats, that the net effect of that testimony was positive for the defense in that it showed a couple of things. It showed that these things occur more often than, you know, those of us in the general public probably realize, and that they're not illegal, and that it's the way that these people do business. This lawyer Davidson, he apparently finds people in trouble and then exploits that to his benefit or to his client's benefit, and Pecker plays a similar but different role in that cycle of, you know, drama. And as shocking as it may be, and as distasteful as these acts may be, they're apparently not illegal.",

My recollection is their testimony about that meeting is largely mutually consistent, not identical. No two people are ever going to have an exactly identical account of it, but consistent for the most part. And I think as a prosecutor you like that, because remember, the central theme of the prosecution's closing yesterday was corroboration.You don't have to believe Michael Cohen in a vacuum. Look at the checks, and this is a good example of that. If you don't maybe trust Michael Cohen in a vacuum, you go, well, OK, cross-check it against David Pecker's testimony about the same meeting. So I think what we're going to see, and the jury's probably going to hear soon, is more or less mutually reinforcing, consistent testimony.",

OK, this next excerpt is page 2008, and then reading from there methodically, and then just send the jury back afterward. And he may give a little bit of an instruction as to what he's doing.

I mean, this is four requests at once. Like, a lot of times, you just get one at a time.So first, they have to pick the transcripts. Then they have to redact out, right, if there's an objection in the middle. That'll get redacted out. High-stakes redacting happening here. When they finally set the four pieces of testimony they're going to read to the jury, I mean, that could take a half hour, an hour, easy. Then they bring the jury in, and then the readback happens.

The jury is not allowed to see that because technically it's struck from the record, even if they heard it the first time around. So they've got to figure out which portions literally to excise.They'll black it out or just simply skip over it and pretend as if they didn't happen. All of this is a very time-consuming process.

But also you want to read a lot into it because we are desperate to know what they're debating or deliberating on what part of this debate that they are at right now. We're still waiting on the actual jury to be brought into the courtroom as it appears that the two parties are still trying to make sure they have exactly which parts of the testimony that the jury here is asking about.They got this note about an hour ago. That buzzer went off inside the courtroom. It got everyone's attention as they were waiting to see what it was that the jury had in mind. And it turned out it was a note requesting four different pieces of testimony all related to two crucial witnesses here. One, the tabloid king David Pecker. And two, Michael Cohen, of course, Trump's former fixer and attorney who is at the center of all of this. And Paula, you know, we can't read too much into this because we don't know. But if you were looking at how the closing arguments went, the prosecution pointed to David Pecker's testimony a lot. As Kristen noted earlier, they called it damning. And it was quite damning testimony because it directly tied Trump to this plot of covering up certain stories. And Michael Cohen is about the Trump Tower meeting. None of this is about looking, you know, necessarily at the checks or the invoices. We know they can do that on the laptop that they have. But it is interesting to see which portions of this testimony they feel they need to hear to assist them.",

And that's something that prosecutors did yesterday during their closing arguments. They went back to what they believe is the beginning of the alleged conspiracy.So we'll hear shortly the portions of the testimony back. But it suggests they're going through this chronologically, which also signals that it's almost impossible that we'll get a verdict today. And it could be a few days. If they're going to go through, sort of week by week, go through all of these key moments and discuss them, this could take a while. But this really, this makes sense. This is not a huge surprise that they'd want to hear more about David Pecker when you have multiple people in a meeting. That's so critical. And again, prosecutors argued this was the first action, the first step that was taken in this alleged conspiracy to help Trump win in 2016.

So right now, this buzzer has gone off again.It's unclear if this means the jury is coming in again, if they're ready, or if they just continue to work while the lawyers figure out the transcripts and that they perhaps have another request or another note. So we're waiting right now for our colleagues inside to give us a live update. What does this buzzer mean? Is this another request? What exactly does it signal?

But he essentially was asking that.And then he, after speaking with the general counsel at AMI, testified that he backed off of it and didn't want Michael Cohen to pay him back anymore. Which David Pecker, for those who remember, on day one of this trial really getting underway, he testified that Michael Cohen was angry about that, that he kind of went ballistic after David Pecker said, no thanks, I don't actually want you to pay me back for this $150,000.",

We should remind our viewers what the prosecution and the defense said about this meeting and their closing arguments. And what the prosecution was saying is that this is really a prism through which the jury should be looking at the case. At the charging conference last week, the parties debated over language for a definition of the phrase normal, legitimate press function to be read to the jury in Merchan's instruction on the law. And that's critical to this because this conversation where they came up with this catch and kill scenario, David Pecker, National Enquirer, they're going to be patting down negative stories. They're going to be playing up positive stories of Trump's opponents. Of course, the prosecution wants jurors to say this is in the service of the campaign. The real game changer of this meeting, this is a quote, was the catch and kill component, and that's the illegal part because once money starts changing hands on behalf of the campaign, that's federal election campaign finance violations. And this jury is asking, is there something illegal or not? On the flip side, the defense basically saying, no, this is normal. This is just what people do, is what famous people do.",
