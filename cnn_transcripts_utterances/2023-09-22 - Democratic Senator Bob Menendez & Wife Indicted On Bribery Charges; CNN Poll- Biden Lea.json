The indictment lays out how federal agency raided Menendez's home last summer, finding a stash of gold bars worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Nearly half a million dollars of cash stuffed inside envelopes, inside jackets bearing the senator's name and a gifted Mercedes convertible. Menendez's wife is also charged, and according to the indictment, she was paid for little to no work. Also named in the indictment, three New Jersey businessmen. Menendez for his part is no stranger to the justice system. He was charged back in 2015 on corruption-related charges but ultimately acquitted due to a hung jury. Today, he denies any wrongdoing. If convicted he could face up to 20 years behind bars. CNN's Kara Scannell details the shocking charges with links from New Jersey to D.C. to Egypt, and what's next for one of the highest ranking lawmakers in the United States.

U.S. military aid to Egypt, Egypt has been one of the biggest recipients in the world, especially in this period of time, billions of dollars at stake. In one particular case of $300 million in aid that they were looking for.According to this indictment, not only did he have meetings with military officials and intelligence officials, sort of off-the-record meetings from Egypt, he also at one point, according to the indictment, basically ghost wrote a letter on behalf of Egypt to his fellow senators as if Egypt was writing it, saying, here's why you should approve this because he would have insight into what they might approve. Beyond that, at one point, the indictment says he shared sensitive, not classified, but sensitive information about the U.S. embassy staff in Cairo so they would know more about exactly how many people were there and what they were doing. At one point there was a deal struck with an Egyptian company to handle all of the certification of halal meat, meat sent to United States to Egypt that would be certified as halal, meaning it complied with Muslim law. It was a monopoly granted there at one point, according to the indictment, he stepped forward to defend that deal which was defending a deal that was one of these people that was allegedly kicking back money to his wife and to him special favors. Beyond that, there was a dam project that was going on that involved Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. It was very important to Egypt. The project had stalled to some agree. The indictment says he suddenly kicked in a letter and parted pushing and saying, look, this deal needs to go through. We need to deal with this and seems to be taken care of. Again, it would seem possibly kind of mysterious. There wasn't something else going on. And through all of this, he, of course, says he did nothing wrong. Despite the photographs, despite the evidence but they say they have against him, he says he and his wife did nothing wrong in all of this. And yet, the prosecutors are saying look at the position he was in, look at the evidence we have, and these ties to Egypt in particular where it would seem, if you agree with the indictment, that certainly the interest of Egypt were being represented in some fashion by this U.S. senator -- Pam.",

Jennifer, I want to kick it off with you here because you also once worked for the Southern District of New York.

But most importantly, the facts are just very, very different.In the prior case, the problem was, and I think why jurors disagreed ultimately, the person bribing Menendez was a close friend of his with a prior relationship. And the bribes themselves were not cash, and gifts like they are here. They were trips that they were taking together, trips on a private jet, trips to the bribed luxury residences. So I think a lot of the jurors thought, well, maybe those trips were taken because they were friends not because of what Menendez actually was doing for the person bribing him. Here's, it's totally transactional. There are a treasure trove full of texts and e-mails laying out what these people were asking him to do, he and his wife agreed to do those things and then some of those things, they actually did. And in exchange, they got cash, they got gold, they got a Mercedes. So the transaction is laid out very, very clearly, making it much easier this time around for prosecutors to prove this case.",

They look into these deals, they assess whether they're in the interest of the United States, in the interest of their home state, in the interest of the government agencies involved, and whether it makes sense for the U.S.'s relationship.The U.S. obviously has had a long standing economic and military supply relationship with Egypt, even during the coup that took place in Egypt a few years back. We ultimately did provide Egypt with military assistance during the pendency of that coup. And so, you know, Senator Menendez is going to argue, look, this was sort of normal order of the course. Now, the challenge, of course, the prosecutors are going to bring and they're going to put in front of the jury, right, is, look, he also ostensibly took all of this cash. The problem is, as Jennifer and you were just talking about, they brought charges against him in the past and Jennifer is right, the charges are very different. But Menendez got 10 out of 12 jurors, according to at least one juror in the last trial, to believe that he wasn't guilty there. He's proven that he would withstand this. We're going to see what happens going forward.",

And the indictment also includes the mentions of fingerprints a few times as part of verifying or -- that this evidence they collected, the money, the gold bars was a direct gift from the three businessmen. So walk us through that if you would, Jennifer? RODGERSthis. One of the reasons is that even if these are things that he would have done anyway, even if he's really pro-Egypt just by his own policy, even if these are things that, you know, he would have done in the normal course, if he also was getting this money and that was a tiny, tiny part of why he was doing it then he's guilty of these offenses. So it was going to be hard for him to say, with all this money coming in tied very clearly to these people who were asking him to do the things what he was in fact doing, that that wasn't any part of the reason that he was doing it. So, you know, this seems like a very, very strong case to me, so different from the first case. And, of course, the jury won't know anything about the first case. They won't know that he almost got off of these charges. They will only hear what's within the four corners of this indictment and what happens in the courtroom.",

That's going to require the government to bring all semblance that they put in the indictment and bring them to bear and convince the jury unanimously that they have proven their case. He has beaten these cases before. I agree with Jennifer, it's a very different case. That being said, the fact that they have surveillance on his wife, they had a court order wiretap in 2019, back in the early days of their relationship, early before they even got married, they are already surveilling her phone, so they clearly had a sense that something was afoot. If they can bring all that evidence to bear and it's directly in, you know, the wife's voice and text messages, they can tie this money directly to events that happen, it's going to be a very tough case for the prosecution to bring, a tough case for Menendez to beat as well.

And, Pamela, this is all about basically two races unfolding at the same time. Of course, the former president is in command of this race leading the way but beneath that there is a scramble for second place. That is what Nikki Haley is trying to get to the top of here. There is no doubt at that debate next week in California, that's what is certainly on the minds of these candidates trying to come to the top of that second tier, if you will, all with the hope, of course, of one day eventually going head-to-head with Donald Trump -- Pamela.",

      "sentences": "Well, she's right about Donald Trump. He added $7.8 trillion debt. He left the White House with less jobs than he came with, which is the first time that's happened since Herbert Hoover.So, I don't blame her for going after Trump on that. I think she's a talented political athlete. She has a lot of talent. I wouldn't want to have that contrast as her at the top of the ticket with Joe Biden. I think it's a bad contrast for Democrats, because I do think she's incredibly talented and she knows how to put on a show. I think that's really good for her. I don't think her -- no one should have to teach Nikki Haley why Ukraine is important to the United States and why they are an ally, and why it's our national security just to be there. That troubles me as a former U.N. ambassador that she doesn't understand why Ukraine matters. I wouldn't be talking about Social Security reform in New Hampshire, which has a very huge senior population even Donald Trump knows that's a political loser. So, go ahead. ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  I think on the economy to her point, it's not just Donald Trump and it's not just Joe Biden, it's a culmination of many years of bad financial decisions and economic decisions. And as Jeff mentioned between Obama, and President Trump and Biden, we've increased the debt from $10 trillion to $33 trillion that is a bipartisan problem that this country has faced. And to Nikki Haley's credit, she's calling balls and strikes. As we're seeing with the polling numbers, people appreciate that. Her numbers have actually gone up. And this is a classic case of what we always talk about in these presidential races, it's a marathon not a sprint. You get your message out on your own pace, at your own time face-to-face. And between what she said in the debates and what she's saying on the campaign trail, it's resonating. People appreciate the fact that she's being truthful and honest as she was in the debate on abortion, a more nuanced position on abortion, as she was with foreign policy, and as she is now with the economy, saying, look, if we keep this out of control spending, Republicans and Democrats, our children will never forgive us. So that's the case that she's making and people are clearly resonating with it.",

But one thing that we all know about people in New Hampshire, they will window shop until the last minute, until the day before the primary. They're going to continue to change their minds and pick different candidates and that bodes well for all of these candidates. I expect these numbers to change dramatically with supposed head-to- head, with Biden and Trump. But also, with these other Republican candidates, DeSantis, Vivek and Nikki Haley. There's a good chance they could inch up on Trump and potentially make a difference in New Hampshire because they have not made their minds up yet. We still have a lot to see.",
