I'm Erica Hill in New York, and we do we begin this hour with breaking news.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hitting back at President Biden tonight in a new interview, vowing to cross Biden's red line and invade Rafah in southern Gaza. Netanyahu in an interview with \"Politico\" and a German news outlet defending his policies in Gaza. This after President Biden said this weekend the Israeli leader is, quote, \"hurting Israel more than he's helping.\" CNN's Scott McLean is following all of these developments for us from Istanbul. So what more did we hear from the Israeli prime minister?",

And frankly, there is nowhere for them to go.Israel has said that they would evacuate them elsewhere, but there is fighting and bombing taking place in virtually every other part of the country. And yet despite that warning from President Biden of not crossing that red line, we have Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that that offensive in Rafah will in fact go ahead saying that his red line is October 7th, and making sure that that doesn't happen again. And he said that an IDF incursion into Rafah to root out Hamas there could take two months, perhaps even less than two months, and that there would be no pause in the fighting until there's some kind of a deal made to bring the hostages home. He also left open the possibility of expanding military operations into southern Lebanon, where of course there have been many back-and-forth firing between Hezbollah and the Israelis. In fact, you have tens of thousands of Israelis who've been forced to leave their home in northern Israel. And this is what Netanyahu said about ensuring those people can go back home. Listen.

The Israelis themselves estimate, at least before the war, estimated that there were hundreds, maybe thousands of rockets stored in people's private homes near the border within firing range of Israel.When it comes to the negotiations to get those hostages back in any kind of a potential ceasefire the hopes of that happening anytime soon are pretty dim at this stage of the game. You had President Biden pointing out that the CIA director was in Israel to meet with his Mossad counterpart. But the problem is that the Israelis and Hamas are not actually talking to each other, at least not publicly. You had Hamas leaving the last round of talks in Cairo on Thursday and the Israelis were never there in the first place because they say that Hamas has failed to address its latest demands, which include providing a list of hostages which are alive and which hostages are dead. Something that Hamas says that it cannot provide. Hamas is also digging in on its key demands of a permanent ceasefire and a full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza. Both things that are going to be very difficult for the Israelis to agree to because they continue to insist that the war will only end, as you heard the prime minister saying there, until Hamas is completely destroyed. And that means going into Rafah, whether that's before or after any kind of a ceasefire deal is made. And they also say that the day after the war, the IDF will have full control, free rein, to go wherever they want inside of Gaza. And the IDF will also continue to control the borders of everything going in and out of the territory. We also heard from the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who gave a televised address and Hamas is still open to talks, but he says that it is Israel who is to blame for the lack of progress. And he also insisted that there would be no hostages released until there's a deal -- Erica.",

When asked about other specific red lines, he was a little less committal, if you will. He said there can't be another 30,000 -- another 30,000 Palestinian civilian deaths, for example. The fact that the rhetoric is now ramping up, and to your point, the impact that this could have moving forward, especially given the U.S.' role in these talks, in these efforts to try to get to a ceasefire, to try to get some of the hostages home, how damaging could this be at this point?",

It could be damaging for all the Palestinians, civilians that are, you know, caught in this -- in Gaza, especially in Rafah. And, you know, from a political standpoint, I think, Erica, what you're seeing here is, on the one hand domestically, President Biden is trying very hard to placate concerns from the Arab-American community.And on the other hand, he still wants to show himself as being a strong supporter of Israel. But there are things that Israel is doing that make it very difficult for the U.S. to, in essence, sell those policies or needed to defend those policies in international forums like the U.N. or with European allies, in the union, and with international public opinion at large. And so this is, you know, where the United States finds itself. And it's going to be really difficult for them to -- for the United States to be in lockstep with Israel at this particular juncture. HILL: Let's talk about the aid situation. So news today that some of the equipment for this new floating pier is actually on its way to Gaza. So the Pentagon has said that pier is going to take probably at least a month to construct. It would require as many as 1,000 troops to get that completed. That's a long timeline.

For example, we know that there's a barge that's on its way from Cyprus right now to Gaza or at least it's supposed to be on its way sometime today. If that is the case, then that will help alleviate some of the things that are plaguing the population in Gaza in terms of hunger and a possible famine.But the fact is that to the military, the U.S. military is going to have to the move very quickly to install this floating pier and to make sure that the requisite number of ships can actually come in to provide the kind of support that's necessary. I think it is something that should have been done a bit earlier.

Now, according to the State Department, the reason for this in part was because of escalating gang violence near the U.S. embassy compounds and the airport. Now this was an airlift by the U.S. military, this according to U.S. Southern Command, this is standard practice under these circumstances, and there were no Haitians on this military aircraft, but they were able to help evacuate and airlift out those non-essential personnel. We should note, though, that the U.S. embassy is still operating. Now, of course, the concern here is what the Haitian gang leader has said about a civil war, also saying that there will be a genocide if the prime minister doesn't step aside. Now it is believed that the prime minister is currently in Puerto Rico and Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this week spoke to the prime minister and talked about accelerating the transition of a more inclusive government. So this is clearly top of mind here in the United States as they watch the situation unfold with this extraordinary move to evacuate those non-essential personnel from the U.S. embassy as violence only worsens in that country.",

You know, Biden got on the app recently and that actually ruffled some feathers I think from people who said, wait a second, we're talking about whether this app is secure from a national security stand point and you're now on the app.And Trump, you know, who was very opposed to the app during his own administration, is now coming out and saying, wait a second, don't maybe pass this and taking a shot at Mark Zuckerberg saying it's going to be good for him in the long term. And so I guess we'll see where this bill goes. There's always been some hesitation to outright ban TikTok because of maybe of some political blowback that the lawmakers would get. And you're already seeing TikTok poured the gasoline on that. You know, they were encouraging their users last week to call Congress and they were flooding the congressional -- the phone lines, their supporters, saying don't ban this app. You know, we have to keep in mind that this is also, this is a free speech issue. There are a lot of people who have built businesses now on TikTok, rely on this app. And so it's a little more complex I think than outright banning it.

And those charged with caring for the wounded play, of course, an urgent, dangerous, and often heartbreaking role in the frontlines.Here's CNN's Nick Paton Walsh from Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice- over): Light is also their enemy here. Daylight brings the threat of attack drones. So it's hard to collect casualties from the frontline. Dark is when they bring most wounded out. Two medics hiding in the tree line. [18:45:04] The other light flashes from enormous bombs hitting the village of Horlivka and around a tiny place of outsized consequence. It's Ukraine's defensive line, but Russia is raging hard for a breakthrough. The flashes constant, a seven-mile slog from there to here for the wounded. MAXIM, COMBAT MEDIC (through text translation): There was a lot this morning. Six or four. WALSH (through text translation): But they were heavily injured. MAXIM (through text translation): It depends on the day. But now it's relative few. The Russians have more vehicles, more weapons, more men. And that's the biggest problem.",

Here comes some more. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): Put the camera away. Put it away.

Under the drones, under everything. They were waiting for us as soon as we arrived. Our two groups were pinned down by drones. The medivac was coming but we can't see it. It's also being shelled with everything they have. I just heard a bang right on my side. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): I feel down inside the Humvee. Couldn't feel my hand. Couldn't move the fingers. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): So the arm is still there, in its place. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through text translation): Can they fix it?
