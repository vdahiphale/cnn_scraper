Kai, I think when you talk to a lot of people today, I mean, their first memory or first thought when it comes to Jimmy Carter is Habitat for Humanity. But based on your work, what is your defining memory of Jimmy Carter? KAI BIRD, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, most Americans remember him as an excellent ex-president, but he was actually a very consequential president in those four years. He accomplished much more than people realize. He passed a lot of legislation that was extremely consequential. He passed -- he mandated seatbelts and airbags in our cars, which save 10,000 lives every year. He passed the Panama Canal treaty. He, of course, did the Camp David Accords, which brought peace to Egypt and Israel. He was a very consequential president. But as your clips sort of emphasize, he spoke to Americans almost like in a sermon. And this was very much part of Carter's character. He was -- he was a Southern Baptist. He was a born-again evangelical Christian. And at one point in 1979, he gave this famous so-called \"malaise\" speech in which he -- he said too many of us now are -- are tending to worship self-indulgence and consumption. Now, that doesn't sound like a political speech, does it? It's -- it's really a sermon. And it was speaking, however, to a truth that we are still grappling with as Americans, even in the 21st Century.",

And, you know, trying to make a better world, trying to always do the right thing. That was his key motto, to do the right thing. And human rights was, I think, his mantra. And, you know, it's hard for Americans to turn their back on that. No president since then has refuted the notion that human rights should be a central part of our foreign policy. But it's hard to live up to its -- you know, it's a difficult principle to follow. And, you know, were -- were constantly -- Americans were -- were torn between our idealism and our pragmatism.

But in a deeper sense, you know, you have to remember that, when Jimmy Carter came out of nowhere to win the presidency in 1976, you know, he won the black vote, he won the Jewish vote overwhelmingly. He won white working-class votes in the South and the deep South, his home part of the country. You know, he -- he put together an enormous coalition. And then just four years later, he only won the black vote. He lost, you know, the Southern vote. White Southerners turned against him. He lost the evangelical vote, which was, you know, had voted for him by 75 percent in '76. And he lost it. And the reason was that he had taken on tough political positions on all of these issues. The Middle East, he had brought peace between Egypt and Israel, but he offended many Israelis by being tough on -- on his insistence that they should stop building settlements in the West Bank. He lost the evangelical vote, because he was -- as a Southern Baptist, he believed in the separation of religion from the state. And so, he refused to give tax-exempt status to white Christian academies that were popping up in all over the South in the wake of integration. So, he was --  he was a politician who was most unusual in that he, you know, stood by his principles and refused to compromise. And he always decided he needed to do the right thing.

Because for all that there is criticism of decisions that were made during Carter's presidency -- and he was only one term -- it was the work that he did after office that has left such a big impact.
