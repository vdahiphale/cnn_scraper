But they still have those hints of caution in their words as this potential deal could be coming together. Now, according to a draft of a proposal that's being considered, there could be an agreement to have four to five days pauses in fighting in order to release around 50 hostages. That is according to sources involved in the negotiations. But they very much caution that none of this is finalized. These types of discussions have been going back and forth over the course of the past few weeks. Of course, Biden administration officials are in touch with the Qataris, who are really serving as the main negotiator between Israel and Hamas. But there is concern as the White House is trying to ensure that some of these hostages can get out. Now, one thing over the weekend, President Biden once again stressed that while there could be some pauses for humanitarian assistance or potentially to get hostages out, he once again said that a ceasefire is not the way to peace in this conflict. [06:10:10] He wrote in a \"Washington Posta\" op-ed and said, quote, \"As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a ceasefire is not peace. To Hamas's members, every ceasefire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters and restart the killing by attacking innocents again.\" So again, the president is going against calls from a -- for a ceasefire at a time when, back here at home, there is strong disapproval of his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. According to a new NBC News poll, about a third of Americans approve of the president's handling of this conflict and if you take a look at the divide amongst democrats, 51 percent disapprove of his handling. But the focus right now for this administration is trying to get those hostages released. And they are hopeful that something could potentially come together in the coming days; though always they are speaking with caution, as there are so many constantly fluid, changing situations on the ground there and in the negotiations.",

And so what Secretary Austin is hoping to convey to Ukrainian leaders is that the U.S. will continue to provide security assistance and support and will provide long-term security assurances to the Ukrainians. Because right now, the war does not seem like it's going to end any time soon. Some U.S. Officials have expressed concern that the war is in a stalemate. Senior defense officials who briefed reporters this morning, however, disputed that and said that Ukraine is actually making pretty substantial progress against the Russians in terms of firing into Russian defensive positions and behind Russian enemy lines. Now, Secretary -- I should say President Biden, he wrote in an op-ed over the weekend that he believes that the U.S. can do both, support Ukraine and support Israel. And he said, quote, \"Both Putin and Hamas are fighting to wipe a neighboring democracy off the map. America cannot and will not let that happen, for our own national security interests and for the good of the entire world.\" So secretary Austin just met with personnel at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, and he's expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today, as well, to discuss the air defense needs of the Ukrainians, as well as longer term security assistance that they will need in the future -- Poppy.",
