And what we are seeing now in the daylight hours is major impacts from flooding. These are scenes of water rescues in Clearwater in Central Florida. They've been going on all morning since before the break of day. The overnight rain dumped more than 18 inches or 45 centimeters in the St. Petersburg area, and that is considered a one in 1000-year event. Fierce winds ripped the top off this, the Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, home of baseball's Tampa Bay Rays, which was supposed to house first responders. A bit earlier, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis talked about what is facing those first responders as this day continues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL):  We will better understand the extent of the damage as the day progresses. And you have people that are out there assessing damage right now. First responders have been working all through the night to help people who were in distress. And what we can say is the storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario. The storm did weaken before landfall and the storm surge, as initially reported, has not been as significant overall as what was observed for Hurricane Helene. Right now, it looks like Sarasota County had the most significant storm surge, likely somewhere between eight to 10 feet. And remember with Helene, we had 15 to 20 feet up in Taylor County.

That's significant in part because of what this field represents. It was one of the bases of emergency operations in response to the hurricane. So, you had emergency personnel stationed inside. You had them sheltering there. You also had significant resources allocated to the area. Right now, those resources are being dispersed to the community. Fortunately, I can report that in the immediate vicinity of the baseball stadium, there does not appear to be a significant amount of damage. There's no flooding here. There's minimal tree limbs that are down. But that doesn't represent the whole picture for Pinellas County and neighboring Hillsborough County and areas further south where this storm made landfall. Here in Pinellas County, there are a number of areas that are -- at this point, are inaccessible. We try to make our way to one, but sheriff's deputies were blocking off a bridge, saying that in part it was because of downed power lines. There is still standing water in some parts, and that combination of power lines and water, never a good one. We heard Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, talking about this, the fact that almost after every hurricane, major hurricane that Florida has faced, there are always fatalities after the storm because folks go outside their homes, they start wandering around. They see that the storm has passed, that the wind and the rain has passed, and they see sunshine, and they think they're safe, but there's a lot of danger lurking, not only with downed power lines, but also teetering debris that could fall at any moment. We've seen expansive flooding, expansive property damage as well. We know that in neighboring Hillsborough County, there are water rescues that are underway right now. There was an assisted living facility there. This is a more sort of rural agricultural area. They were being evacuated, the senior citizens there in two to three feet of standing water. So, obviously it's a delicate process to get folks out to safety and officials don't want that complicated by folks coming out and trying to survey damage and getting themselves into danger. Becky.

About 10,000 peacekeepers are stationed in South Lebanon. Well, Israel could decide today how it will respond to last week's missile attack by Iran. The Israeli security cabinet meets just over two hours from now. That attack was discussed in a half hour phone call yesterday between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the U.S. President Joe Biden. It was the first time that they had spoken since August. Now, the White House isn't giving any details out on that conversation, but says it was direct and, quote, \"very productive.\" Well, the administration has been hoping to limit Israel's response to Iran's attack amid fears of a wider regional war.

We didn't get a sense from the White House fromtheir readout of the conversation with President Biden yesterday that Benjamin Netanyahu, who'd ruled off limits, any of the things that President Biden doesn't want struck. President Biden doesn't want the nuclear facilities struck. He doesn't want any of the oil facilities in Iran struck. I think the United States would be far more happier, if you could put it that way, if the response was proportional to Iran. Iran targeted intelligence headquarters and military sites, military airbases. I think the United States would see that as proportional if Israel struck back at those targets. But of course, Israel wants deterrence. Feels that Iran's main proxy in the region, Hezbollah, is weakened, and that this is the opportunity that it has to really strike the targets that it's long wanted to do. And one of those is the nuclear facilities. How to do it? Because they would have to overfly or potentially have to overfly countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia, who are validly want to stay out of this fight and don't want aircraft of any description, even though they had Iranian missiles flying over their territory just a week or so ago, they don't want a -- they don't want that to be replicated by Iranian aircraft flying over. I think we can take the fact that there's been a number of strikes around Syrian air bases recently as an indication that potentially Syrian air defenses, if you will, monitoring has been degraded, and that would give potentially Israeli aircraft the opportunity to fly more safely through Syrian airspace, that's a possibility here. But, you know, what we've heard from the defense minister saying that these strikes would be not only a surprise but they would be precise. He said, the Iranian wouldn't know or they wouldn't understand what had happened or how it had happened when these strikes come. The vote today in the cabinet will be to authorize the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to make the final decision about when to strike. And of course, that does fall into the political military domain. So, we can understand after that decision is made this evening, in a few hours, then the strike could come at any moment.

But then, also, you do have Abbas Araghchi, the foreign minister of Iran, as you rightly stated, meeting with Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia and really trying to drum up support for Iran and against Israel. Those threats are things that certainly have been reported. The Iranians certainly don't want any nations in the region to allow Israel to overfly their territory or allowed to fire missiles over their territory. But at the same time, the Iranians right now are speaking a lot about regional cooperation in order to try and defuse this very difficult situation in the Middle East. At the same time, of course, senior Iranian officials have said that if the Israelis target Iran's energy infrastructure, and that of course includes the oil and gas installations, that Iran could respond in kind and target Israel's energy infrastructure. So, right now, definitely very difficult situation here in this region, with the Iranians also issuing some serious threats. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PLEITGEN (voice-over):  After Iran's massive missile strike targeting military installations inside Israel's territory, Iran is now bracing for what the Israelis say will be a strong response. On Tehran's streets, some concern and a lot of defiance. Everyone's mind is busy thinking of what might happen, this man says, and if Israel makes a move, we will certainly respond to it. And this woman says, I am not concerned about war because I believe in my country and our leadership. I know if anything happens, nothing will threaten the Iranian nation. If there is a need to protect our soil and our land, like our fathers and brothers who participated in the eight-year war, we will go to war as well, this man says. And you will see the result of the jihad that has been ordered. If you want war, we are the masters of war, this poster in Revolution Square reads, both in Farsi and in Hebrew.

An Iranian member of parliament sending a warning to the U.S. The U.S. is aware of everything the Zionist regime does, he says. We would suggest that, firstly, the U.S. stop the military help, stop the arms and the backing of the Zionist regime, and then, secondly, for the U.S. to force Israel into a ceasefire.

Because of course, the Trump administration had very close relations with Saudi Arabia at that time. You'll recall, there were also really big tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar as well with the Iranians siding with Qatar, and really, the Saudis there, with the United States, really pushing for a more dominant role in the Middle East. And certainly, we have seen, in the past couple of years, a big rapprochement between Saudi Arabia, especially and Iran sort of starting to set -- or to take place. One of the things that really set that in motion was the administration of Ebrahim Raisi, less so Raisi himself, but more so his foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, who really started those talks with the Saudis and tried to get that relation jump started. A little bit also with the UAE as well, really trying to drum up support for Iran and for better relations between Iran and some of its neighbors in the greater Middle Eastern region. I think right now, you're absolutely right, it is a pretty difficult situation for a lot of these countries. They have very good relations with the United States. And if you look at the Gulf countries, of course, a lot of them are now in the Abraham Accords with Israel as well. And they certainly don't appear to want to jeopardize that either. At the same time, the Iranians right now, of course, in that really difficult standoff situation with the Israelis, with the United States, at the same time, trying to drum up that support as well. I think for a lot of these Gulf nations, for a lot of the nations in the region who are really essentially trying to stay out of getting involved in that conflict, it's very difficult for them. But it does appear as though, right now, at least between Saudi and the Iranians, there is at least a little bit of daylight and some better relations on the horizon. Becky.",

It has to be said. It's good to have you there in Tehran. We've seen the region is very much on edge as it waits for Israel's next move. And that our next guest says is part of its strategy. Kirsten Fontenrose, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council and writes quote, \"Israel's response to the missile barrage, that it will respond at a time and place of its choosing, forces Iran to expend the manpower and resources to sustain a heightened defense posture, while Israel can continue its campaigns against Hezbollah and Hamas.\" It's an interesting perspective.

So, their aim is to enlarge, the position because they understand, of course, here as they do in other European capitals and in Washington, Becky, that the peace plan that's being suggested, we don't have the full details of it, but the outlines of the peace plan, the victory plan being suggested by Zelenskyy, will take a lot of movement on the part of a lot of European capitals to happen since what we understand is that it could include the idea that part of Ukraine finds itself under the NATO umbrella, even as the war rages on elsewhere.

You are looking at a sinkhole, for example, in the area now. CNN's Isabel Rosales spoke with the sheriff on the ground a little earlier. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
