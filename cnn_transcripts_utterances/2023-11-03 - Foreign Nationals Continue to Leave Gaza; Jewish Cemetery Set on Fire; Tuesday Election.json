Of course, Qatar being the key mediator, but coordinating, of course, with Israel, Hamas and the United States.And we continue to see those foreign nationals. As you mentioned, our latest information just an hour ago, 99 foreign nationals allowed out this morning of Gaza through the Rafah border crossing. Important to remember that this is a very complex process, right? They have to get out of Gaza. Then there is passport checks, security checks and then they cross into the Egyptian side. More checks there. Imagine going through airport security essentially but on a land border and one, of course, where there is a war zone on the other side. So, a huge relief for the families. We're also tracking, as you mentioned, the Americans who are coming out. So, unclear how many of those 99 are American citizens. There's been other foreign nationals that have been evacuated as well as of yesterday. Our reporting shows that about 20 to 25 Americans had been evacuated. And yesterday there was a total of 341, according to Egyptian officials, 341 foreign nationals that were able to cross out of Gaza into Egypt, meaning that that 100 doesn't mean that the day's over yet. There -- we could continue to see more people seep out. Very important that this is happening while Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on the ground. This is absolutely, when you look at it, a test. Hostages are absolutely not included in these negotiations, but the fact that these four countries, Qatar, the U.S., Israel and, of course, Hamas and Egypt can coordinate and come to an agreement, that's important. That's a test. That's something that Secretary of State Antony Blinken is going to point to as a success. You also mentioned the ambulances. We continue to see wounded people coming out. But you have to remember, that's a tiny trickle of the thousands of Palestinians who have been injured in this conflict so far. Erica.",

But we did see, in blue and purple states, significant resistance to Republican candidates who carried, in effect, the threat of banning abortion, whether it was Michigan or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.
