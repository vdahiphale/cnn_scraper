This hour, I'll be speaking with a top Harris adviser.Plus, the breaking news tonight, federal prosecutors making a new push to revive the classified documents case against Donald Trump. We have details on a new brief that was just filed in court. Stand by for more. Also tonight, Ukraine is reeling after a massive Russian missile and drone attack aimed at Ukraine's energy infrastructure all across that country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now vowing to respond as officials say that at least seven people were killed. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with the race for the White House, the Trump and Harris campaigns feuding over debate details as the former president throws a wrench into negotiations. CNN's Kristen Holmes is on the campaign trail with Trump in Detroit. CNN's Eva McKend is tracking the Harris campaign here in Washington. Kristen, I want to go to you first. What is Trump now saying about the debate? And then what is his campaign saying?",

Both sides had agreed that they would show up at for this ABC debate on September 10th, and now they seem to be at an impasse. Originally, when Donald Trump had agreed to this debate with President Joe Biden, they had agreed to these same rules at the CNN debate, which was when the other candidate is talking, the mics are muted. Now, interestingly, at that point, Donald Trump's team didn't like that rule, but as it got closer to the debate, I spoke to a number of advisers who thought it might be helpful to Donald Trump.Well, Donald Trump's team thinks that debate went well, that first one with Joe Biden, and they want to mimic those results. So, they are saying going into this ABC debate that they want the same rules as the Biden debate, and that's what they say they agree to. Well, the Harris side says that's not what we agreed to. I'm new at the top of the ticket. This is a different debate, and we want those mics open. Then you have Donald Trump, who, as always, tends to say something that is not completely in line with what his campaign is saying. Here's what he said in Virginia earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: So, we're thinking about it. We're thinking about it. They also want to change the rules. You know, the deal was we keep the same rules. Now, all of a sudden, they want to make a change in the rules, because she can't answer questions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump said, no, I agreed to a different debate. Now, they appear to have swapped sides. But it's not that surprising because, again, they are just trying to get the best for their candidate in these circumstances.So, whether or not Donald Trump shows up on the stage on September 10th remains to be seen, but we do know one thing. He is ramping up his campaign, at least this week. I'm going to several battleground states. He's in Michigan, or he was in Michigan today, back in Michigan later in the week, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. They say this is going to be the new norm for the campaign. We shall see. Alex?",

Everybody else is polarized. Everybody else has an opinion about Donald Trump. But the lower propensity voters tend to like him more but they turn out less. And so his appearances, his media, everything they're doing has to be aimed at expanding the electorate, changing the composition of the electorate. So, to the extent, Alex, that everything they do is aimed at bringing in these low propensity, a lot of male, young male voters, that'll be a good thing. And I suspect that's sort of going to be the travel strategy and the messaging strategy is how do I change the composition of the electorate, get myself a little bit of an advantage going into the fall. And, by the way, that's also the reason you shouldn't -- you know, some of this polling has gotten pretty close, but these are the kinds of people that tend not to be captured in the polling.

Everybody asks this question all the time, but nobody stops to ask, what are the mechanisms by which this would actually reach the president's desk?So, the way around this for Trump is very simple. The court case has happened. This has been left up to the states. My personal views are basically what Ronald Reagan's were. I'm pro-life. I believe this should be left to the states. I believe in the three exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. And, oh, by the way, I and my entire party are strong supporters of IVF and other technologies that help people start families. That's his position. That's what's going to be his position. He just has to clearly state that. And for the Republicans out there who might be annoyed with J.D. Vance or Donald Trump on this, my advice would be, look at the situation in Washington.

      "sentences": "They're appealing this directly to the 11th Circuit, as we expected they would. And they're saying that Judge Cannon, she got this wrong when she dismissed this case against Donald Trump and his co-defendants. You know, they're saying that this case should once again be allowed to move forward. And they're saying specifically that Judge Cannon's decision was novel and that it lacked merit. And what they're really doing is they're pointing to several other court opinions, including a Supreme Court opinion from 1974, U.S. v. Nixon, where the Supreme Court said that the attorney general has the authority to name a special counsel.You know, of course, Judge Cannon, just a month ago on July 15th, she overturned that. She said that precedent wasn't binding. She said that the attorney general was unlawful when he appointed Jack Smith, and also saying that Jack Smith's office was unlawfully funded. Jack Smith is now appealing that decision and the Justice Department is arguing that not only was Judge Cannon's decision wrong here. But they're also pointing to how this could possibly -- if her ruling holds, how this could really affect the Justice Department and other departments. They're putting it this way. If the attorney general lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office. Other than the few that are specifically identified by statute, they also point to other agencies that could be affected. You know, Department of Defense, State Treasury, Labor. So, what happens now? Well, Trump's team will likely respond to this filing and then the 11th Circuit will likely set an argument schedule. Who knows if that will be any time in the next few weeks before the election, because, of course, if Donald Trump is elected, he could completely quash this entire case. I will note that although the 11th Circuit, it's based in Atlanta, it's you know, known as a conservative court, but they have overruled Judge Cannon before when she appointed a special master, way at the beginning of this case. So, who knows when this will move forward, or how they might rule, and it could go to the Supreme Court ultimately.",

So, Donald Trump argued to the district court that special counsel, in its entirety, is unconstitutional because the argument was Congress has never passed a specific law authorizing special counsel. But the problem, as Jack Smith, I think ably points out in this brief is there are a variety of laws that give the attorney general very broad powers to delegate his powers, to oversee prosecution at the Justice Department. And as Jessica points out, there are several prior decisions that have gone essentially Jack Smith's way and against Donald Trump's position.So, I think Jack Smith has the upper hand here.
