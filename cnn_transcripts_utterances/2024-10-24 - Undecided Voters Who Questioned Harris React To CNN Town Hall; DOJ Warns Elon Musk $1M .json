So many more people were voting by mail.That said, we are getting a lot of data on the early vote in now and we can start to look at that. And it's true that across the board voting -- early voting is down and it's down substantially in some of those states. Like Wisconsin, you can see it's down. Arizona it's down substantially. But in Georgia and Pennsylvania to the other key states it's down not so much. So we have a little bit more to look at there. In most of these states, Republicans are -- have more votes in the early vote than they did four years ago. And it's completely flopped in states like Nevada and Arizona out West where Democrats had an edge in the early voting, according to our data four years ago. Now, this year, Republicans actually have an edge in that early voting. And part of the reason for that could be that the early voting this year includes a lot more vote-by-mail -- or a lot more early vote-in-person as opposed to voting by mail. But it's all interesting stuff to look at as it comes in.",

The general groupings of who is voting -- for instance, women -- it's kind of similar to what it was four years ago but the numbers are a little bit down.And if you look at race, for instance, four years ago it was about 500,000 Black voters to about a million white voters at this point -- or that's what it is this year -- 500,000 Black voters to about a million white voters. And four years ago there were more than 650,000 Black voters at this point.
