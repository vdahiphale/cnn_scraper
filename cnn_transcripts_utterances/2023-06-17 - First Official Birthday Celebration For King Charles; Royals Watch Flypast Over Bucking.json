On that balcony you are seeing the King, you are seeing the Queen, you are seeing the Prince and Princess of Wales, all three children pointing at that flypast. Yes. Louise spotted it and he's pointing as well.You can also see Princess Royal. You can see the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Prince Edward, and his wife, Sophie. And you'll see, of course, many of the Royal Family in their royal regimental uniforms. That flypast though, 70 aircraft from all over the U.K., joining together and culminating in this magical moment, a flypast over Buckingham Palace. And it's particularly significant, if you can remember just a few weeks ago for the coronation, the flypast couldn't really happen. It had to be scaled down due to the weather. And I believe now we may be about to get the red arrows. Let's listen in. It's pretty noisy. We've heard about the Buckingham Palace, not the red arrows yet, more aircraft, I believe.",

And this is really what we've expected from the King all along. He's always talked about having a slimmed-down monarchy.These are the key players in terms of working members of his family. These are the people who carry out the engagements day to day and who are paid from the public purse to carry out those duties. So this is really about reflecting the people who were in service, if you like. Obviously, the Royal Family is much more extended than the people appearing today on the balcony. But I think there's a very clear distinction between people who are relatives and members of the family and those who are actually officially working on behalf of the monarch.

Make sure we're staying hydrated in the cleanup process.Right now radar showing some storm activity across parts of the Central Plains, everything sub severe at the moment, and we had storms rolling through the southeast that are now pushing closer to the Big Bend up to Florida down into parts of let's say, Tampa back into St. Pete. Clearwater area probably seeing some lightning but the bulk of it really develops throughout the afternoon and evening hours today and tomorrow across the Central Plains then back down into the Florida Panhandle even down into the peninsula. Then stretching again into these parts of the Mississippi Valley for tomorrow.

Still holding on to the storms but that dies out then we redevelop with the heat of the day, parts of Kansas down into Texas all the way through Oklahoma by 8, 9, 10 o'clock this evening.

Here, the Special Counsel's Office is asking a judge to sign off on a list of rules that have been agreed upon between the prosecutors and Defense attorneys for how to protect sensitive evidence in this case. Now, of course, there's also the issue of classified information. I'll get to that in a second. But in this proposed order for the judge, they've agreed that for example, the Defendants former President Trump and his aide, Walt Nauta, should not be able to look at any of the sensitive evidence without their attorneys present. They're not allowed to have copies of it. If they take notes, those notes cannot leave the room. They have to be with the attorney. They have to be stored securely. They're also promising that this will not be shared with the public.I mean, prosecutors have to share all of their evidence with Defense attorneys as part of the discovery process. And clearly, there are concerns about some of this getting out. Now prosecutors said in their memo to the Judge, they said they were concerned that if some of this evidence is shared or used improperly, that it could impact \"other investigations, witnesses or people who have not been charged\". Now we know the special counsel is also conducting an investigation into January 6, though no charges have been brought in that case yet. We know from our reporting that a lot of the same witnesses who've spoken to investigators in the Mar-a-Lago documents case have also talked to investigators in the January 6th investigation. Now when it comes to classified information, a slightly different matter. The Defense attorneys will need active clearances in order to review that classified information. Of course, the former President is alleged to have taken over 30 documents after leaving the Whitehouse. And earlier this week, the Judge overseeing this case told the defense lawyers to get that process started so they can get their clearances. It's a process that'll take several weeks. And Trump's current two Defense attorneys Todd Blanche, and Chris Kise has said they are in touch with the Justice Department. So clearly they're well on their way to getting their clearances. But again, that's a process that takes several weeks. And we know they're still looking for another addition to the defense team. Amara, Victor.",

Have you ever been arrested, where you went to school, and then there'll be names given so that investigators can go and follow up and find out information about these attorneys. But on top of that, then once these investigators speak to these other witnesses, they're going to find other people to speak to beyond that which is provided by the attorneys.

PETROS LEVOUNIS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION: Well, two major things. One is that we do see the rates of depression, anxiety, substance use disorders going up with a pandemic, people are stressed, people feel lonely, people are in particular crisis. So that's one major reason. And the other one is more of a hopeful one. And that is that people appreciate mental illness much more in 2023, than ever before.

So it masks some of the more severe consequences in the mental health of people.As we are moving out of the pandemic, now we'll see an unmasking of these problems.
