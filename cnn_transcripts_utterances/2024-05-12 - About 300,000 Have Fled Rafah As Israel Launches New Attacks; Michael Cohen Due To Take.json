Israeli troops moving in on the eastern part of that city as well, as well Central and Northern Gaza where the IDF claims Hamas is trying to rebuild. More than 300,000 civilians have now fled Rafah since Monday.

In that call, Sullivan discussed alternatives to a ground invasion and very interestingly, the White House said that his counterpart, the Israeli national security adviser, said that those concerns were being taken into account. But at the end of the day, the issues that President Biden has with the ground invasion into Rafah are not new. He has been raising them for months with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, really going back to February when he first raised them in a phone call, that has not deterred Netanyahu from moving ahead. His view is that in order to completely eliminate Hamas, they need to go into Rafah. That is completely at odds with what we have heard from American officials today including the American Secretary of State Antony Blinken who said that a ground offensive into Rafah could lead to a Hamas insurgency.

It is in the Rafah crossing, which is on the eastern outskirts of Rafah City, started evacuating the eastern neighborhoods of Rafah, but the Israeli military still did not go into the city. And I think there's a good reason for it.I think the reason is at least for now, President Biden's ultimatum. And the Israelis, as far as I understand, are going to give another few days for completing the evacuation of the eastern neighborhoods before they take a decision on whether to go in. And I wouldn't be surprised at all. We saw it in the statement the White House put out on the conversation between National Security adviser Jake Sullivan and his Israeli counterpart. They spoke about the possibility of holding an in-person meeting between Israel and the Biden administration about the Rafah operation. A meeting that was supposed to take place two months ago and Netanyahu canceled it. And since then there were only virtual meetings. So I think that if you see that they're talking about holding such an in- person meeting, it means that maybe nobody is going to go into Rafah at least in the next few days.",

You want to go into Rafah, let's have a discussion about what's the strategic goal?What do we want to do after we take Rafah? How do we want to see the situation over there? And this is what he hears from his own cabinet, his is what he hears from his own security services, and this is what he hears from the Biden administration. And I'll give you another anecdote. Today, the IDF went into Jabalia neighborhood in northern Gaza. It was the third time the IDF went there. Every time the IDF went in, it went out, Hamas came back. Why did they come back? Because the Israeli government has refused until now to even have a discussion about whether there is an alternative, a governmental alternative that you can put in to those areas of Gaza where Hamas was defeated and because you don't do that every time you take the military out, Hamas comes back in.",

That really underpinned the criminal charges in this case. The jury has already heard a lot about Michael Cohen and prosecutors made it very clear in their opening statements that he's a complicated and potentially problematic witness of sorts, and they've spent the last several weeks trying to prepare the jury for that reality. Now, Michael Cohen is going to have to face a tense and significant cross-examination from Donald Trump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, though, when he takes the stand and those questions will try to hit at Michael Cohen's credibility. They'll try to dig into Michael Cohen's past. He is a convicted liar and I'm sure that will be highlighted. But they're also going to -- Todd Blanche will also try to suggest to the jury that Donald Trump really has no idea what deal Michael Cohen struck with Stormy Daniels nor what went into or how it was recorded ultimately after the fact. And that really will be the big question is whether or not the jury believes Michael Cohen and in the case that the prosecution has presented so far, or if there's enough holes poked in Michael Cohen's credibility to where there's reasonable doubt enough not to convict Donald Trump.",

I think we can definitely expect to see Trump allies going after Mr. Cohen. I think that's going to be skirting a very dangerous line because whether or not they're doing it on their own, or whether they're not -- they're doing it at the direction of Mr. Trump is going to be a question. It could also potentially be a distraction because the judge has indicated he's ready to put the former president in jail if he violates the gag order.

You know, we talk about RFK. We talked about the worms in his brain. We kind of sometimes think of him as a sideshow. But there is a reason why Donald Trump is going after him and it is because he is polling higher than any Independent or third-party candidate at this point, since Ross Perot in 1996. He is polling higher than Ralph Nader was in 2000 at any point. He is pulling higher than Gary Johnson was at any point in the 2016 campaign.

And now obviously, republicans like Donald Trump believe that they are pulling more from it him and you see on the screen right now why Donald Trump is so concerned. So this is a Quinnipiac University poll that was taken in the middle of last month, and what you see here is while Joe Biden is puling some of those RFK, Jr. supporters, he is their second choice, the plurality clearly say that Donald Trump is their second choice. And this I think is reflective of Joe Biden's campaign earlier on in the campaign, basically trying to sour Democrats on RFK, Jr., and now you're seeing Donald Trump do the same. And so I think the real question is, Jessica, we have seen throughout the years third party and Independent candidates fade going down the stretch.
