      "sentences": "And welcome back to our continuing breaking news coverage of the Israel-Hamas War. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv.Major breaking news right now. We're learning that the third group of hostages has been released to the Red Cross. Today, 17 hostages are being delivered to freedom. The IDF says the most recent group of hostages includes both Israelis and foreigners. We had heard from American officials that they had hoped that at least one American would be among the latest transfer of those held in Hamas captivity in Gaza. We're watching all of these dramatic developments unfold. I want to start with CNN's Oren Liebermann. He's here with me in Tel Aviv. Oren, I know you and I are being briefed on what's going on. Give our viewers the latest. What do we know? So right now, we're expecting the release of a total of 17, 14 Israeli citizens. And that includes an Israeli-Russian citizen, as we've learned, as well as three foreign nationals. If we look at the numbers under the total agreement, this first part of the agreement that we hope will be continued, it was for 50 Israeli hostages. That means as of right now, we have 13, 13, and 14. So that's a total of 40 at this point. If my quick math is correct there. And we look for this to continue over the course of the next several hours. We have seen how long it can take for this to play out from Hamas to the Red Cross into the hands of the IDF and then straight to the hospitals. That's the process that we have seen begun now, crucially, at least as of today so far, it has played out without the roadblocks, the problems, the issues that required intense diplomatic efforts. Last night, we don't seem to be seeing that right now. We have heard that that didn't happen. So this process now playing out much smoother and more quickly than it did yesterday.",

The country's President Joe Biden in the U.S. stepping in there to make sure this didn't fall apart at such a critical moment.The U.S. had always viewed the first two days as the test period. And there was a serious risk that on day two of this test period, it would fall apart. Now here we are at day three. The process of the release of the Israelis has begun.

We'll see as the evening goes on here. It's in the early evening hours. We'll see how this plays out over the course of the next several hours. I also want to point out the health of the hostages. We've had a chance to hear from some of the families. The biggest issue from purely the physical side appears to be malnutrition. In fact, the family of Karen Munder says Karen and her mother lost between six to eight kilos. That's 12 to 16 pounds over the course of seven weeks. That's tremendous weight loss. They say that's largely because of the diet, which for days on end was only pita bread. And there were some rice and bread mixed into there but certainly not enough. We've even had a chance to speak to some of the doctors who treated the patients who say, look, this was the most serious physical issue. We've simply had tremendous malnutrition and that's one of the big issues. That, however, doesn't touch on the mental health aspect of being in captivity for so long. That process just began.",

He said that they have a good sense of who that was but was unable to confirm at that time who they anticipate this American citizen who will be released by Hamas to be. Now, there are three Americans that officials have said fall into the category of the 50 women and children that are expected to be released over the course of this four-day pause. That includes two women who the U.S. has not named just yet. And also that young girl, Abigail Edan, a 3-year-old when she was taken captive by Hamas and turned 4 years old on Friday. The White House has been very eager to get her back home for her -- to her family. Jake Sullivan would not confirm she was part of this group, but said that there is growing optimism about getting her out of Gaza. And it comes as officials have really been working around the clock trying to ensure that this deal remains on track to not just get that larger group out, but also to get those Americans out. The White House has said they are hopeful that those three Americans will be leaving Gaza in the coming days as part of this deal, but they want to ensure that the implementation has been able to go forward as planned. President Biden himself jumping on the phone yesterday with the Emir of Qatar to talk about ensuring that any hurdles that needed to be cleared were cleared. But the White House is also keenly aware that it's not just these three American women and children that they're trying to get out but there are in total about 10 Americans who are unaccounted for in missing. Jake Sullivan, this morning, said that they still don't know the conditions and whereabouts of these American citizens but that they are hopeful that they will also be able to get them out at some point. Now, I want to note President Biden is still here in Nantucket at this hour. He's scheduled to leave around 1.30 P.M. before he heads to the White House. So we will wait to see whether we will hear from President Biden a bit later today on this latest release, but Jake Sullivan did say that they are hoping for a good day, a joyful day as they are hoping that there will be at least one American citizen coming out of Gaza.",

Part of this deal, of course, was to deliver much more aid, humanitarian aid, medical supplies, food, water, fuel to Gaza. We believe that is also happening as we speak right now.

And it is on a day-by-day basis, an incredibly specific timeline.First, from the big picture, the truce itself has to hold. And from the first few minutes a couple of days ago, it has. And because of that, that has allowed the humanitarian aid to go in, more trucks than have gone in since October 7th. It's not just entering Gaza, it has to get to northern Gaza. And that was one of the stumbling blocks yesterday. One of the issues that slowed the entire process of the release of the hostages and led to the whole diplomatic necessity of the U.S. and of the Qataris stepping in to make sure this happens. The aid has to continue getting in, not only into Gaza, but also to northern Gaza, according to Hamas. And that was one of the major issues. That aid continues to flow in. But Larry was right to point out it is a -- an incredibly small percentage or fraction of the aid that's needed overall. And that's why it's so critical to try to alleviate even a small fraction of the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded on the ground there. Meanwhile, Israeli forces remain in large numbers inside of Gaza, but have taken up effectively defensive positions, waiting to see how long this truce stops. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other members of the war cabinet have made it clear that when this pause in fighting ends, the war itself, for lack of a better term, is back on. And both sides, obviously, preparing for that moment as well, even as there are Qatari efforts, as well as international efforts, to make sure the pause and the fighting continues for as long as possible to release as many hostages as possible and as many Palestinian prisoners as possible, but to get as much humanitarian aid as can be done in this -- in this short window after 50 days, nearly, of war.",

Abigail Edan has been held hostage for the past seven weeks. Her two parents were killed during the October 7th attack. She has two siblings who survived. And the White House has been working around the clock trying to get these American hostages home. She is the first American hostage that is being released as part of this four-day truce that is hoping to get at least 50 women and children out of Gaza. Now, the White House has said that there were three Americans who fell into that category. That included two women who they have yet to name, and also this young girl, Abigail Edan. President Biden, yesterday, spent some time on the phone trying to ensure that the deal stayed together, speaking with the Qatari Emir and the prime minister of Qatar also. But the White House has really been working since the start of this attack in trying to get these American hostages back home. There are still, believe to be about nine missing Americans. Americans believed to be held hostage, but they're getting some very welcome news today as Abigail Edan is in the hands of Red Cross officials. We will wait to see once she arrives and is reunited with her family.

LIEBERMANN: And that is such wonderful news for the families of the hostages waiting to see them here. We have just gotten the heads up from the Israeli military that the next stage of the transfer of the hostages has been completed, which is to say they have gone from Hamas to the Red Cross. We learned that a short time ago. And now we've learned from the Israeli military, the IDF, that they've gone from the Red Cross to the IDF. And we'll begin making their way towards their families, crucially, but also towards the checkups that they need at this point. And that means that today's process has played out, as we expected, certainly much better than all the roadblocks and the difficulties and the delays we saw yesterday. The process today is moving, at least from what we can see, smoothly, certainly smoother than yesterday and smoothly that bodes well for tomorrow, at least from where we're sitting right now.

From there, they'll make their way to the Hatzerim Airbase. One released hostage who returned to Israel was evacuated via helicopter directly to a hospital. That perhaps indicates a challenge with their physical condition. So we'll learn more about that.In parallel, Red Cross representatives transferred four released hostages, including an Israeli civilian and three Thai civilians over to Egypt through the Rafah Crossing. So multiple crossings, it seems, use today here, from which they will make their way to the meeting point with IDF soldiers in Israeli territory.

One has to build the alternative. The alternative needs to be discussed in the -- in various key places and see what's next. In the interim, there has to be a major humanitarian aid, and a major humanitarian effort. In this respect, for example, I commend the hospital which has been built now in Rafah by the United Arab Emirates.

And I'll say it again, this is not only a war between Israel and Hamas, this is actually a wall that defends the real values of liberal and democratic countries or countries who believe in the rules of the family of nations, as opposed to an empire of evil, which is an empire of Jihadis, which believe only in eradicating all of us out of here, not only Jews, but also Christians. And the next will be Europe and the United States. So that is what the war is all about.And therefore, how you come out of the war, meaning, how do you make sure that what will come out of the war will promise, regional security and stability, will promise peace, or let's say, seizing of fire and terror. This is the key, and this has to be analyzed clearly. And in a very punctual way, not slogans. I heard President Biden's speech on Friday from his vacation, and I come -- I truly welcome these words. I mean, these were important words, as he spoke about the fact that there is an empire of evil which wants to undermine all the peace processes in the region. It is clear that what Hamas did under the instructions of Iran is to undermine the ability of further peace agreements following the Abraham Accords, also peace agreement with Saudi Arabia and of an offering a huge, huge connection between Europe all the way down to Australia.",

The Israeli military says the 13 Israeli hostages were handed over to them. And that one is being flown by helicopter right now to a hospital. The other four freed hostages were being taken through the Rafah border crossing from Gaza into Egypt. And then there'll be going over to Israel directly.I want to go back to see this Jeremy Diamond.

What happened was the convoy went directly to hospitals where those newly freed hostages were able to be reunited with their families. But it appears that tonight once again, that Hatzerim Airbase option with the helicopters awaiting them at that base has been reactivated. And that is indeed what is happening this evening.",

The White House had expressed a lot of optimism this morning that at least one American citizen would be part of this release. And in fact, it was Abigail Edan, that four-year-old girl who was in captivity for the past seven weeks her two parents were killed on in October 7 during that attack by Hamas, her two siblings have survived the attack.Now, officials will be working in the coming days, trying to get her any type of medical attention that she might need as also trying to reunite her with her families. But in just a short while we expect to hear from President Biden for the very first time as this is very welcomed news not just for the family, but also for the President and his team who have been working around the clock trying to get these American citizens home. Of course, there had already been two Americans that had been released earlier on in October, Judith and Natalie Raanan, but Abigail Edan is the first American that has been released as part of this four-day truce to try to get at least 50 women and children out. Now, the U.S. has also said that there are two other women Americans who they believe could be part of the release in the coming days. So we will see if President Biden has any further update on that or any of the other Americans who remain missing and/or believed to be held hostage. But certainly this is all welcome news for the White House today. And we will hear directly from President Biden in just a short while.",

I think that that's one of the issues is that Hamas may believe that their best chance of getting an extension of this, which is what they very, very much want, is to hold on to those Americans. So that's a possibility. But it also could be simply that Hamas is having difficulty locating or moving around hostages without the Israelis being able to monitor that.And I think that the ties coming out, the story of the ties coming out might give us a window into that. And that only four ties were released today, bringing the total to 17 out of what we think is maybe 25 or 26. So there's no reason for the Hamas -- for Hamas to hold back on the tie. So it may give us an inkling that there really are logistical problems, or that some of those ties might be dead.",

That's it. But now we hear from senior Israeli officials similar to what the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told Dana Bash this morning, that the truce can last and the humanitarian assistance can enter Gaza, as long as Hamas continues to release hostages. So that is a shift. And surely part of that is because of the pressure from the Israeli public. The families that haven't yet got their loved ones back. But the difficulty is going to come when we get through the women and children and its main men and soldiers that need to be released. Because the Palestinian Islamic Jihad has said that the soldiers, the Israeli soldier should only be released if every last of the 8000 some odd Palestinians held in palace in Israeli jails are also released.",

And if you see the remarks by for example, the Iranian foreign minister who was visiting Lebanon and met with the Hezbollah Head, Nasrallah, on Thursday, on Thanksgiving Day, they are all saying the same thing that this ceasefire or pause is good. They call it a ceasefire. They want it extended and they want it to turn into a peace, permanent ceasefire. And the reason they want to do that is because that would leave, you know, Hamas, basically where, you know, where it could still become Hamas 2.0 in the future in terms of running Gaza. And I think that that, regardless of what happens is actually a fairly high possibility that whatever we see in the future, might look a lot like the pot past.",

The Israeli President Herzog told me in our interview, and more of that will be airing shortly. He told me in our interview that a Qatari delegation is in Israel right now.
