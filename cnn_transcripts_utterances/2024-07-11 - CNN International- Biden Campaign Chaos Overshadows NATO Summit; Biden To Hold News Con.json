      "sentences": "Well, President Biden is obviously going to be under a lot of scrutiny, just to see how well he performs in this press conference, whether he can speak clearly and confidently and coherently about the achievements that were done here at the NATO summit over the last several days, importantly, the plan he is going to lay out for continued support for Ukraine, and of course, his conversations with other NATO leaders here at the summit over the last several days.But, just in terms of the atmosphere here, it is true that questions over Biden's future are lingering, really, over the entirety of this summit. But, several world leaders have actually already come out and said that they believe that President Biden can do the job, that they are confident that he has been participating in these meetings in a very constructive way, and that he has shown that he has the strength and the capacity to continue to lead the alliance in this very, very difficult time, when you have the war in Ukraine, of course, and China's continued support of Russia and the fact that they are fueling that war. And so, according to officials that we have spoken to here, look, it is obviously on everyone's mind, particularly when it comes to what is going to happen in November with the election because former President Trump has indicated that he might even be willing to pull out of NATO or at least significantly reduce the support that the U.S. provides to the alliance. And so, when presented kind of with the alternative here, world leaders say that they obviously are supportive of any leader of the United States who continues to provide the kind of support that NATO needs in terms of leadership. At the same time, though, everyone here is very aware of the stakes. And they are all watching very closely to see what happens today at that press conference and see if Biden can really articulate a clear vision, not only for the next several months, but ideally over the next several years, if he is reelected.",

He is joining us now from Washington, D.C. Ambassador, great to see you. I will ask you less about the President's upcoming press conference and more about, I guess, the successes and maybe near misses at the NATO summit. So, in your view, what is the most encouraging development or promise that has come from this summit in Washington, D.C.? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FMR. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE, &amp; VICE PRESIDENT, RUSSIA AND EUROPE, USIP: Well, Fredricka, probably the most encouraging one is the support that's going to come to Ukraine on air defense. Air defense is the key capability that they need most of right now. President Putin actually helped make that point when he attacked this children's hospital, children's hospital, children's cancer hospital in downtown Kyiv, on Monday, just at the beginning of this NATO summit. So, Putin made the point that he is ruthless, that he will attack civilians, children, and that the Ukrainians need air defense. So, the biggest thing for me so far coming out of this NATO summit is a good response by the NATO alliance, the Americans, but others as well, to provide Patriots and other systems to defend themselves against this attack from Russia.",

So, they did get to the irreversible language that this is a bridge to the membership for Ukraine. It's an irreversible -- it is one-way bridge to membership.They could have taken another step, like the European Union did, frankly. European Union said, you're going to be a member of the European Union, and we're going to start the negotiations with you on the specific detailed aspects of being a member. NATO could have done that. NATO thought about that. There were a lot of conversations about that. Those conversations, those negotiations between Ukraine and NATO will come, they will come soon, because the alliance was clear. The summit communique is clear that this bridge is to NATO membership, and it's one way and they're going in that direction. It will happen. They could have taken the step toward negotiations, and maybe that will come soon.",

However, it's also important to point out that there are two candidates for President, or there are going to be two, we don't know exactly which ones, but there are going to be two, and the one policy on the one side that is on the President Biden or that side is strong support for NATO, because American people support NATO. American people support providing this assistance to Ukraine.On the other side, on former President Trump, it's less clear exactly what the policy will be. It could be OK. It could be from NATO's standpoint. It could be OK from Ukraine's standpoint. There has been bipartisan support for Ukraine going into this campaign with the blessing, the bipartisan support for this $61 billion package with the blessing or at least implicit blessing of former President Trump. So, it's not entirely clear what that side is. What they -- what the NATO allies and leaders are watching is how this plays out.",

Still, some Democrats on Capitol Hill appear unwavering in their support.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): He is the only person to ever beat Trump's ass an election. I'm proud to stand with Joe Biden. And I'm showing up tomorrow with brass knuckles. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): At this point, I think he has a strong campaign and a strong message to deliver.

I gave him my first democratic vote ever in my lifetime with the understanding that he would do what he said, which was be a bridge, a transitional President, not a transformational one, and then pass the torch.I did it to get Trump out of office. I still want to keep Trump from the White House. Joe Biden can't do that anymore. And he needs to start putting his country before himself and before his party. It is denial and delusional to think that he is up to the task of running this country for another four years. I'm worried about him running it for another four months. But, it's really crazy to think, with all the polling we see and all the defections we see that he can actually beat Donald Trump. He needs an intact coalition, which was fraying before the debate. He was already losing Black and Hispanic voters. A lot of independents and moderates were wavering. Young voters, who are mad about Gaza, are going to stay home. That was all before the debate.

In fact, when Tim Ryan raised his hand and tried to take Nancy Pelosi's place so that younger blood could get in, he was sort of patted on the head and said -- told it's not your turn. You got to wait. These people have been marginalized so that no one in the Democratic Party, including Democratic voters, are ready for someone new.

All eyes are on Washington, as U.S. President Biden prepares for his first solo news conference since his disastrous debate performance right here on CNN. That as his Democratic reelection support wanes and the chorus grows for him to drop out of the race. Mr. Biden is facing the most high-stakes press briefing of his political career. And when the President holds that news conference, the world will be watching. During the day, President Biden is attending working sessions at the NATO summit. He is meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, as the security alliance continues to drum up support for the war against Russia. CNN's Stephen Collinson is calling the upcoming Biden event \"the most high-pressure presidential news conference in modern history\", and this is his cnn.com headline, \"Biden's political position is rapidly deteriorating as critical news conference looms.\" Stephen, great to see you. I mean, how does this President stay in the race and lead while doing so?",

He has to restore confidence among Democrats, especially those in Congress who are hearing from their constituents that he is the best person to beat Donald Trump in November.What is happening right now is there is an increasing focus, not so much on the debate, which was after all exactly two weeks ago, but on the possibility that the Republicans could not just win back the White House, keep the House and also win the Senate at the same time, as there is a very robust conservative majority on the Supreme Court. What that would mean for Trump's authoritarian impulses in a second term is what's keeping many Democrats up at night. And those lawmakers that you've seen come out and raise questions about Biden continuing the race, they're worried that not just their own jobs are at stake, but the democracy that President Biden has said he is running to protect could be at stake. So, these are exceedingly difficult tasks that the President has to restore confidence, because what voters saw in that news -- in that debate two weeks ago, the picture of an aging and diminished President is something that's going to be very difficult for voters to forget.",

The federal corruption trial of New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez will soon be in a jury's hands. He and his co-defendants are accused of participating in a years-long bribery scheme. Closing arguments are expected to wrap up today. Prosecutors call it a classic case of corruption on a massive scale, saying Menendez took bribes to influence policy. The Senator did not take the stand at trial. But, a defense attorney says the case is rotten to its core, insisting Menendez was just doing his job. Let's get the latest now from Kara Scannell.

I mean, it's been four days of closing arguments now, and the prosecutor is giving their rebuttal, saying that what the jury has heard over the past three days from the defense lawyers, he said that they are asking the jury to believe the unbelievable.And as you said, part of Menendez and the other two defendants in this case, they've been charged with being involved in a bribery scheme and then discharged with acting as a foreign agent for the government of Egypt, also for interfering in criminal investigations to benefit these two businessmen. And in exchange, prosecutors say he received gold bars, nearly half a million dollars in cash that was found when the FBI searched his home in envelopes, including an envelope with his fingerprints on it, all part of this alleged bribery scheme that prosecutors say was a massive corruption scheme. What the prosecutors are honing in on now are some of the arguments advanced by Menendez and the other defense lawyers that Menendez, the work that he was doing, when he made calls about these criminal investigations, when he was taking steps to aid Egypt, they were arguing that these steps were all done part of Menendez's job. They were routine. They were normal. There were things that Menendez was doing to help some of his constituents, that the prosecutor pinpointing some of those examples raised by the defense, saying in fact reaching out to one of the prosecutors investigating one of the businessman's associates, arguing to the jury that that was not an instance of helping a constituent. It was about getting a car. It was the only time Menendez had ever reached out to this office for -- at any point in his career to try to influence an investigation. So, the back and forth between the prosecution and the defense will be coming to a close, and the prosecutor has about another hour to go. Then the judge will instruct the jury on the law. And once that happens, then deliberations will get underway. Certainly, a lot at stake for the Senator. He is still the Senator from New Jersey and still on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

I mean, we are seeing that there is some progress, according to multiple sources in these discussions, but so far, no clear indication of exactly where that progress is, what the remaining obstacles are. What is clear, though, is that these are very, very thorny discussions, especially as we are now in that critical phase of detailed negotiations. It seems that both parties are more or less on board with a framework for a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal, one that could see a months-long ceasefire in Gaza, the release of dozens of hostages, and hundreds, if not thousands, of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails in exchange.But, now they're getting into this very detailed phase. And so, that Israeli delegation returned. They met with the Israeli Prime Minister today, and the Prime Minister now dispatching the chief of the Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, to Cairo to pursue negotiations over there. But, as all of this is happening, the Israeli military doesn't appear to be slowing down in its military campaign in Gaza. We have watched as over the course of this past week, we've seen Israeli military operations in all parts of the Gaza Strip, several notable strikes in southern Gaza, and now Israeli troops appearing to extend and amplify ground operations in Gaza City, in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Earlier this week, the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for parts of that city, and yesterday, now extending that evacuation order to include the whole of Gaza City. At least 250,000 people are expected to be impacted by these evacuation orders. And it just needs to be said that the Palestinian population in Gaza is being squeezed into a smaller and smaller part of the Gaza Strip, with very little where to go in terms of a safe place for these displaced Palestinians. And in addition to that, we are seeing as the -- these people who are being displaced are being displaced time and time again, and they are heading to areas that appear to be under-resourced in terms of infrastructure, like running water, for example, and also just basic humanitarian resources. But, the Israeli military now says that Gaza City is an active combat zone. They say they've opened two roads up for safe passage for civilians to be able to leave that city unchecked, and be able to head south towards that what the Israeli military has described as a safer humanitarian zone of Al Mawasi. But again, the fighting seems to be intensifying, and the Israeli Prime Minister, even as these negotiations are ongoing, he is vowing once again to carry forward this war effort until victory, making clear that he is not going to drop certain conditions in order to get a ceasefire deal. So, very, very delicate times and very difficult times for the population in Gaza. Fred.",
