The Trump team is calling his chat with Elon Musk on Monday a success, saying the talk reached 25 million X users and raised more than a million dollars.In recent weeks, Trump has appeared frustrated since Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee. In the X interview, Trump aired old grievances about the 2020 election, spewed conspiracy theories and showed he remains fixated on his former opponent, President Joe Biden. Many of his Republican allies fear his behavior is costing him the race.

I mean, blue collar unions, kind of, construction unions and industrial unions have had trouble holding their white working class members against Trump, both in 2016 and 2020. For Trump to so explicitly endorse union busting seemed to me just an incredible unforced error because it will allow them to allow these union officials to make the case that Trump wants to take away your union, which is a point of agreement between union leaders and blue collar workers, as opposed to all the cultural issues that might divide them and lead them toward Trump. Look, Trump has had success at reaching a universe of voters who are loosely connected to the political system. And you can see in all sorts of ways, you know, from some of the podcasters that he's done interviews with to associating with the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He is looking particularly to kind of present himself to young men who are not habitual voters and who tend to be alienated from all elements of the political system. X is useful for him in that. But over the course of that very strange conversation, I would say the unforced error of endorsing union busting so explicitly is probably the piece of it that's going to live on the most and it's going to live on more in the hands of Trump's critics than his supporters.",

We've heard from the state departments that Brett McGurk, the Middle East envoy for Joe Biden, the U.S. president, is going to be in Egypt, also Qatar.He'll be in the Middle East trying to push what has been described as a final bridging proposal that both sides, Hamas and Israel, can agree to. We also know that Amos Hochstein, who's the special envoy trying to calm the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border, will be in Beirut trying to pacify things there. Now, of course, the concern among many in the region, also the Biden administration, is that whatever Iran's retaliation could be may spark a wider conflict. There are, though, some within the Biden administration who believe that Iran may not have decided what that retaliation is going to look like as yet. Of course, retaliation for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader on Iranian soil. Bear in mind, this is a very new Iranian president. He was only inaugurated less than 24 hours before this assassination took place. So we do hear from two Biden administration officials that Iran may not have decided on its exact course of action as of now. Wanting to retaliate, as we've heard from many officials within Tehran, that they need to retaliate. It's their right to self-defense, that there's been a violation of their sovereignty. But of course, at the same time, not wanting to spark that wider conflict. Now, we've also heard from two diplomatic sources that they believe that these last-ditch mediation efforts when it comes to a ceasefire- hostage deal will not make a difference to Tehran when it decides what its retaliation will be. So as of now, we believe that these talks will still go ahead on Thursday, trying to hammer out that final deal. According to a U.S. official, the one main difference we have at this point is the sequencing of the hostage exchange. So that's something that the mediators, Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. are trying to iron out before the end. We do still have both Hamas and Israel blaming the other for this not having been done yet, this deal. But we really will have to wait and see what, if anything, can come out of those talks on Thursday. Rosemary?",

But I think what it will take is for the United States and this current administration to use the leverage it has and say enough. Enough bloodshed. We need a deal on the table right now. What we've seen, at least publicly, in terms of the demands of Hamas, at least the statement that was made a couple of days ago, is they said we want to go back to what was agreed to in President Biden's three-point plan. So clearly the goal posts, as I said, had been moved and shifted many times. So they're saying go back to this three-point plan. We need something on the table, concrete, rather than continuing these endless discussions about the ceasefire deal, where every time we get to the point where there is a deal on the table, it gets scuttled by Prime Minister Netanyahu.

We saw Russia saying that it destroyed some 117 Ukrainian drones overnight over the border regions including Kursk, where of course the epicenter of this incursion by Ukraine is still taking place. Four missiles as well. That is a higher number than we usually see because of course even before this Ukrainian drone attacks across the border were fairly commonplace. The Russian Ministry of Defence meanwhile releasing this video saying that its jets are striking Ukrainian targets in the Kursk region. So they are trying to look like they're really pushing back here, taking control of the situation.

The governor is trying to have that upgraded to a federal level emergency which would mean that assistance for civilians and things like that would come from the federal budget.
