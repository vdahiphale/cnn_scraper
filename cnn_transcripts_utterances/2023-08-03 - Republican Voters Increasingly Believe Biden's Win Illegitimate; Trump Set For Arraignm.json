And it is those lies that are central to the prosecution's case. And the man behind it all, a man who has been a target of a public smear campaign by the 45th president, is the special counsel, Jack Smith. You see him there. Our Paula Reid is outside that courthouse right now. So, Paula, how is this all going to play out, the logistics of this, once Trump arrives where you are?",

So, we may not even get to see him at all, because, of course, there are no cameras in federal court. But once he is inside, he will be placed under arrest. He will be processed. We expect they will take his fingerprints, but there won't be a mug shot. Federal authorities have concluded that they really only need the mug shot if someone goes on the lam and they need to know what he looks like. He is, of course, one of the most recognizable faces in the world. Now, after the processing, the hearing itself, it's pretty procedural, should be pretty sure. He will hear the charges that have been filed against him, and he will have the opportunity and is expected to enter a plea. Now, in Florida, he had his attorney enter that please, so also possible we won't hear him utter a word. They will have to contend with his bond agreement. Assuming there are no glitches there, this hearing should be over pretty quickly. And this will all take place in front of a magistrate judge, so not Judge Chutkan, who will oversee the rest of this case and an expected trial. But this is, of course, his third arrest and arraignment this year, so he knows what to expect.",

That's Susie Wiles, Chris LaCivita, Jason Miller, as well as two of his attorneys, Todd Blanche and John Lauro. And we are told that they are going to meet the motorcade here -- and we will be a part of that, as you mentioned -- and then go to the courthouse. Now, advisers do not believe this is going to be a lengthy time spent at the courthouse. I was told they feel like it's going to be a lot shorter than some of the previous arraignments. Now, not entirely sure why, for the reasoning, but that is their belief right now. And when he goes into court and it's behind closed doors, he is going to appear with two of his attorneys, Todd Blanche and John Lauro. It's not clear if anyone else is going to join them at that point. Then he will come back here to the airport before taking off to New York. He wants to get out of here as soon as that arraignment is over. Now, we do anticipate him giving remarks to the reporters traveling with him. But, of course, it will all be dependent on the former president himself, how he feels after that arraignment. But, given what he has already posted on TRUTH Social today, talking about how it is a great honor for him to be indicted because they are indicting the public and his voters, not really him, he's doing it for the people -- he's talking about how another indictment, it means he's going to be elected president. Given that stance that he is clearly taking, I would anticipate very strongly that we are going to hear from the former president after that arraignment today, Erin.",

He's always had that characterization from anyone who's ever worked with him, even when he was attorney general overseeing the Justice Department. And he knows Trump so well. And I think that's why, that moment there at the end, where he did acknowledge that he does believe Trump knew that he lost the election was really notable, but he also -- and I wasn't sure what he would say about the argument that Trump's attorneys are making that this is a free speech -- he was just exercising his free speech, and that they can't move forward with this prosecution, they don't think. He completely eviscerated that and poked holes in that and said that that's not why Trump is being indicted here, it's a conspiracy to subvert the election, and speech as part of that. And that's what Bill Barr was saying. He also went after the other defense that we have heard, which is that Trump was acting on the advice of counsel, particularly John Eastman, who was the attorney who basically came up with the blueprint for a coup. And Bill Barr said, A, he didn't really think that John Eastman was giving him, he would qualify that as advice. But he also said he doesn't think that would work, because he thinks it would require Trump to go on trial, to be cross -- to take the stand, to be cross- examined, and that he doesn't believe Trump would be able to essentially remember his own version of events. I mean, he was incredibly blunt. It was a nearly-40-minute interview, where he really kind of went through all the steps of not just this, also the other federal charges he's facing. (CROSSTALK)",

And there was a request for an interview of President Trump. And the question was, well, are you going to let him talk to them, to the special counsel?

Don't assume that the arguments we're hearing from them now are the same ones that they're going to use in court. The government and the defense, of course, always plays a certain amount of a pretrial game. Jack Smith can't talk. He's letting this indictment talk for him. John can talk. And he was also with Kaitlan, and he's been everywhere. These First Amendment and advice of counsel arguments aren't the version I think we're going to get a trial. These are weak versions. Bill Barr was right to knock them down. They're serving another purpose now, which is consolidating Trump's support. This is free campaign programming Lauro is taking advantage of. He's consolidating his support. There will be more refined versions that are more dangerous that John and his co-counsel, who is also excellent, Todd Blanche, will launch at trial. The problem is, they don't have the facts on their side. They don't have the law on their side. And Jack Smith and his team are just as ferocious. Still, it will be a legal battle for the ages.",

There are several names that the Trump campaign believes that it could be, but no one has really been able to say. But, obviously, that's a huge question here of the role that they play. And the other thing Bill Barr said last night is, he looked at that indictment. He said he found it impressive in its restraint. But he said he believes Jack Smith has a lot more information.

You have more pretrial motions. You have more lawyers. Every lawyer gets to cross-examine on behalf of his own witness. The jury has to keep track of the evidence against each defendant. Everything takes longer and is exponentially more complicated, whereas the reason why this indictment is really -- one of the great things about this indictment is, it first basically tracks Trump, what Trump was told, what he said, what he did, what he's -- what he was told, how he lied about what he was told, and just a continual sequence of following Donald Trump along.

Now, all of those, they can -- if they choose to bring defenses in court, which they don't have to -- they can just let the prosecuting -- prosecution shoot their shot -- those will all be tested. But I think Eastman's attorneys \"this was just a misunderstanding of opinion\" point isn't really going to hold, particularly -- and particularly given that at least one other federal judge has already found that John Eastman, more likely than not, committed a crime in concert with the president of the United States. Now, the way our courts work is that the mere fact that a court in California has ruled something doesn't obligate the folks in D.C. or any judge in D.C. to find the same thing. But it's still persuasive that a federal judge has weighed the evidence, looking in the context of attorney-client privilege, and said, you know what, I think these two individuals committed a crime together.
