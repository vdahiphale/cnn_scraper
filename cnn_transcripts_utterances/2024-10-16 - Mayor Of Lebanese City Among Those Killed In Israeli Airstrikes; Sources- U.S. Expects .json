Intentionally targeted -- the Lebanese prime minister has a strong accusation he's making against Israel, this after an Israeli attack on a municipal building in southern Lebanon. State media say it killed the mayor of Nabatiyeh. Lebanese officials say strikes in the city killed at least 16 people in total. The IDF says it struck dozens of Hezbollah targets there today, claims it was targeting underground infrastructure used by Hezbollah. Israel also pounded the southern suburbs of Beirut for the first time in several days. According to Lebanese authorities, their country has now seen more than 10,000 Israeli strikes. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is tracking the crisis in the Middle East. He joins us now from Jerusalem. Jeremy, tell us what we know about this Israeli strike on that municipal building in southern Lebanon in terms of who was there and who were some of the civilian victims apparently caught up in this.",

One of those at least striking the municipal building in the heart of that city killing at least 16 people altogether, including the city's mayor who was killed in this attack. These really military is claiming that they were striking an underground Hezbollah facility belonging to Hezbollah's elite Radwan force, accusing Hezbollah of using civilians in that area as human shields.But the -- but the -- forgive me, I'm just getting some feedback here but the Israeli military is making that claim. But, Lebanon's prime minister is accusing the Israeli government of intentionally striking this building at a time when government officials were holding a meeting about emergency relief efforts. The Israeli military hasn't responded directly to that claim, but, of course, we have seen over the course of the last two months is we have seen, intensifying airstrikes in southern Lebanon, but also, of course in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, in the Dahieh, the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital. We have seen as so many of these strikes have not only targeted Hezbollah posts, Hezbollah underground facilities, but have also of course, resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians, including hundreds of women and children all together over the course of the last couple of months. So this is a situation that is continuing to escalate. And even though there seemed to have been an understanding over the course of the last five days or so that Israel would no longer be striking Beirut, at least not for the time being and understanding between the U.S. and the Israeli governments on that, last night, the Israeli military did indeed carry out yet another airstrike in Beirut. The first in nearly a week now, but showing that they very much are continuing to do so and that they are going to continue to carry out strikes anywhere in Lebanon that they deem necessary, Jim.",

Remember there's the Nikki Haley voters, especially in Pennsylvania, that's an area where clearly they are trying to seize on as many of those votes as possible.But there's also symbolism in each of these stops. So for example, today, she's doing it at Washington crossing near where George Washington across with his troops -- cross the Delaware River. And that is part of the message today, which is patriotism essentially, party -- country over party. That's very similar to the message that she delivered alongside Liz Cheney back in Ripon, Wisconsin, which was the birthplace of the Republican Party. So, as she's making these stops, she's doing so quite intentionally in these locations to broaden her message of not just it being about voting for her, but voting for something that's bigger than her and she will also be joined with Republicans today. Now, there are risks to the strategy. I have talked to Republican strategist about this as well as Democratic strategists and the risks that you face is that maybe they're more turned off by the message that you're delivering than willing to vote for you as a candidate. That's being Kamala Harris, but certainly they're willing to try and they feel as though within their internal polling that there could be just enough Republicans to get on their column.",

This is the first time she's done an interview with Fox News. Of course, most of those, if not, all of those who watch Fox News are Republicans. And so this is -- comes with some risk.

And, Jim, he has a chance to address it this November. He is going to be voting in on a ballot in Florida where they have a question that asks, do you want to expand abortion access in a state that now bans abortion at six weeks?

He also called themselves the father of IVF as you heard in that clip that you played.

These drones are among Ukraine's most top secret weapons controlled by its most clandestine agency. Their targets are deep inside Russia. Here's Fred Pleitgen's report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Ukrainian drones attacking southwestern Russia, sowing panic among local residents. Russian air defenses frantically trying to take them down before they slam into their targets. These massive drone strike carried out in late September by Ukraine's defense intelligence agency, the GUR, and they granted CNN unprecedented access to the entire mission. Their target, a Russian ammo depot, the Ukrainian say is storing missiles supplied to Moscow by Iran, even though Tehran vehemently denies giving Russia ballistic missiles. All of these missions have to move extremely quickly, they have to be very precise because obviously, if they get discovered by the Russians, the Russians want nothing more than to kill everybody around here. When you're badly outgunned as the Ukrainians, even strategic airstrikes become hit and run operations. The launch location totally secret, the mission run in near complete darkness. We can only identify the unit commander by his call sign :\"Vector\". How fast you guys have to be able to do all this now? \"VECTOR\", LONG RANGE UAV UNIT, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE:  I hope it will be 20, 40 minutes. PLEITGEN:  Okay. Tell me how much the Russians want to kill you?",

But what they really need is permission from the U.S. and its allies to use western supplied longer distance weapons. So far, the U.S. is not allowing Ukraine to fire American supplied weapons deep into Russia, as Russia has escalated its own aerial attacks against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure using heavy guided glide bombs, cruise missiles designed to take out whole aircraft carrier strike groups, and nuclear capable strategic bombers. All the Ukrainians have, are their little drones launching them in swarms to even have a chance to penetrate Russia's air defenses. They blast the Ukrainian folksong, \"Hey, Falcons\" as the GUR's one birds take to the skies. Back at base, it's crunch time. Russian social media starts exploding with reports of an attack on the Kotluban weapons depot. The GUR operatives sometimes chuckling as they listened in. While the Russians claimed to have shot down the drones, Ukrainian defense intelligence showed CNN the unblurred version of this video, now heavily blurred for operational security reasons. And it shows 11 blasts coming from the same place, they say, so large, they're confident they hit their targets. CNN was also able to independently verify through a source what seems to be a direct hit on the facility. We're not publishing the image to protect the sources anonymity, but it showed an explosion at the facility and what seems to be wreckage scattered around. A Maxar image shared with CNN shows the same heavily damaged building with some debris still laying on the floor. Signs that the Russian military may have cleaned up the site. A small but important victory in their ongoing covert war against a powerful enemy. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's been going on since the start of last year and the FAA says that this audit will focus on these 45 busiest airports in the U.S. and honor them for the potential of these near collisions on runways known officially as runway incursions. I've been reporting on that since the start of last year.And the headlines have really been emerging coast to coast the catalyst at New York's JFK in January 2023, American Airlines flight bound for London taxi out in front of a delta flight and was already accelerating for takeoff pretty harrowing. Nobody hurt in that incident, thankfully. But investigators say the pilots of the American flight were distracted heads down in the cockpit with paperwork, essentially got lost on the ground, but the list really goes on here. Austin, Boston, Burbank, Reagan National Airport outside D.C. in June, the most recent incident just last month, a Nashville, just want you to look at this. The tires of an Alaska Airlines flight that was taking off blew out because the pilots had to slam on the brakes so hard when a Southwest Airlines flight taxied out in front of them. Investigators still doing interviews in that case. Now, the FAA says this audit will really drill down on the risks at each individual airport. Remember, it might not always be pilots who are entirely at fault here could be something a bit more structural, and the FAA wants to know if there are gaps in the procedures or if there are issues with equipment or maybe there's a process at an airport that's causing some problems. And investigators have been really concerned not only about the design of some airports, but also the lack of early warning technology, 35 airports have technology that alerts air traffic controllers in the tower of these impending collisions. But just to put that into context, there are 500 airports in the U.S. with commercial service or talking about only a small slice of the pie that have that technology or the NTSB has said the technology really saved the day at JFK in that near collision that we talked about just a second ago, and the NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy, has told me she wanted it more airports we'll see though. Of course a lot of eyes on this audit and the FAA says it'll be finished sometime next year -- Jim.",
