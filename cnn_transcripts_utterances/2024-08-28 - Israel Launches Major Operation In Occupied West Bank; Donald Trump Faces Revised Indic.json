Tonight, it's 2in New York, 7:00 p.m. in London, 9:00 p.m. in the West Bank, where the Israeli military has been carrying out its most expansive raid in years. We are live in Tel Aviv with more. Plus, Donald Trump is indicted All over again in his election subversion case as the special counsel tries to work around the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. And opening ceremonies underway in Paris for the 2024 Paralympic games. We'll have more on why the games are expected to be historically popular. You'll want to see it. The U.N. Human Rights office warns that a major new Israeli operation could inflame the quote, \"already catastrophic situation in the occupied West Bank.\" And it is calling on Israel to abide by its obligations under international law. Today, Israel launched the largest offensive in the West Bank that we've seen in years, carrying out coordinated raids and airstrikes in Jenin and several other towns. Palestinian authorities say at least ten people were killed. They also say the lives of hospital patients and medical staff are now under threat, accusing Israeli forces of blocking roads to some of those facilities and obstructing the movement of ambulances. Israel's Foreign Minister says the operation is meant to combat what he calls Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure. He accuses Iran of trying to establish an eastern front against Israel, and suggests Israel must address the threat with the same, quote, \"determination used in Gaza.\" He says, quote, \"this is a war\". We want to get more now from Jeremy Diamond who is live for us in Tel Aviv and has been following all of this. Can you try and put this into context for us in terms of the escalation that it may represent in this region, I will add a region that can afford no escalation. And how much longer are we expecting this operation to last?",

Khaled Elgindy is a Senior Fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. He is also author of \"Blind Spot: America and the Palestinians, from Balfour to Trump\". And I thank you for joining us on, obviously, what is a concerning day and perhaps days to come. The Israeli military describes their operation as targeting militant strongholds, meaning it sees these areas as a threat. Now, this is on a scale rarely if ever seen. Do you expect this to continue?

And so, I think it's extremely likely that this is just the -- you know, just the beginning of a much wider operation. I mean, I -- we've seen a steady kind of ratcheting up of violence, both from the Israeli army and from extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank in the last 11 months in particular.

I think there's no credible observer who would look at what happened in Gaza and say that Israel is in some way abiding by international law. I mean, we've seen massive and egregious violations repeatedly. And I think the danger here in the West Bank is if there's a muted response from the United States, the U.K., the international community in general as there has been in Gaza, then Israel will take that as a license to ramp up and move to the next phase, which could very well be these mass evacuations that this -- that the Israeli Foreign Minister is talking about. I mean, I certainly don't think he's joking. I think when he raises the specter of mass evacuations and compares what is happening now to what we've seen in Gaza, people should be very alarmed. Now, with regard to the assertions that you know, there's Iranian weapons and so on and so forth, Israel has not produced any evidence of this. And I think what is even more alarming is we know that this is a very extreme government, they have a very -- I would say even unworkable -- unworkably broad definition of what constitutes terror. But in this particular case, they're not even pretending that these are militants who are targeting Israeli civilians. They're targeting an occupying army, an army that has been ravaging the Gaza Strip for 11 months. And that has been on a rampage --",

Sometimes they participate and sometimes the army just simply stands by and watches. But ultimately, there are the cases where individuals are actually held accountable for destruction to Palestinian life or property are extremely rare.

That's more than 20 percent of other adults who said that they felt high levels of stress in the past month. So, we do see   this increased stress among parents and caregivers. And in a video that Dr. Murphy's office released today, here he is talking about parental stress as a public health concern. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL:  Parents and caregivers in America are under pressure. As a father of two kids, I feel this pressure too.

And then when we think about cultural norms, he called for more research on parental stress, and really looking at parental stress as a normal area of research for instance.

And then having to go through gauntlets of checkpoints and having their things taken along the way, and many of them have been displaced multiple times. You know, there was a -- I spoke to a man who just arrived from further to the west who had gone several days without eating. And many of the people who are in the camps, they've seen children dying along the way, and even when they get to the camps in the Nuba Mountains, relative safety, they're surviving on leaves from trees. And as I said, many are multiple times displaced. Another woman said she left Khartoum because of the war. She left another city, Kadugli, because of hunger.

It's sort of prided itself, Telegram has, for its lack of moderation compared to, for instance, Facebook or X, which are much more judicious in what they allow to be broadcast and their platform used for. But, you know, Telegram has been used by autocratic governments like, like Russia, in the Middle East, China, the Ukrainian government uses it as well as the Russians as well. You have criminal gangs that use it. You have, you know, groups of pedophiles or neo-Nazis or anti-Semites, they use it to sort of propagate their sort of hate speech as well. But you also get libertarians, you know, people who are strong believers in the freedom of speech who value Telegram as an essential asset in the sort of media landscape. And so, it's this extraordinary sort of coalition of, you know, sort of disparate groups that have come together in support of Pavel Durov as he is sort of scrutinized by the French authorities in this way. The Russians have been very outspoken, of course. He's originally a Russian citizen. And they've called this an attack on freedom of speech, which is, you know, ironic given that there's been a huge crackdown in Russia on free media over the course of the past several years. But of course, it's about a much broader concept as well of, you know, the extent to which social media platforms should obey the law and should be held accountable and their owners should be held accountable for the content that goes inside them.

Now, they will roll through Southeastern Georgia. Remember, this is an area that leans Republican. Joe Biden won the state by less than 12,000 votes in 2020. He was the first Democrat to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992. Harris' campaign is spending a lot of time and money on the ground there and has 24 field offices in Georgia. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is live for us in Savannah, Georgia. And that's the thing that's fascinating about this, not just that they're going to go to perhaps Atlanta and the suburbs where the Democrats might have more strength, but they're going to places that the Republicans will likely win. Why?",

I will be on the lookout for Mr. Walz's flannel shirt, which might be right at homethere at a barbecue, although a little warm right now for that flannel shirt, I will say. Priscilla Alvarez, thanks for being on the ground there as we will follow that bus tour. Appreciate it. Now, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will have their first interview since the Democratic Convention right here on CNN with Dana Bash. That's Thursday at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. We're all looking forward to that. Still to come, thousands of athletes gather in Paris for the opening ceremonies in the 2024 Paralympics. Stay with us. We'll have more on that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
