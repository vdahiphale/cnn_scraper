      "sentences": "President Biden is on track to appoint more judges to the bench than his predecessor, but the chances of Biden replicating the level of Donald Trump's successes are unlikely. And here's why. While Biden is on track to appoint more low level judges than Trump, Trump appointed more appeals court judges.Not to mention three Supreme Court justices, and that conservative transformation of the highest courts is halting key parts of Biden's liberal agenda. And just yesterday, the Supreme Court blocked the Biden administration's student loan relief and repayment plan. And earlier this week, a federal judge in Texas paused Biden's program that offers legal status to the spouses of U.S. citizens. CNN's Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider joins me now. Jessica, nice to see you.",

      "sentences": "Well, as we saw from President Trump's presidency, we see just how consequential judicial nominations are. And to be sure, President Trump is really -- sorry, President Biden is really making this final push to the finish as he ends out his term. In fact, just yesterday, the White House nominated three more district court judges to the federal bench.So, you know, in the end, President Biden will actually have appointed more federal judges than the former President Trump. But as you mentioned, President Trump's picks are a lot more consequential. So our team has been crunching all these numbers led by the incredible Tierney Sneed. And what they found is that President Trump actually nominated a lot more circuit court judges. And why does that matter? Well, circuit court is sort of the appellate level above the district court and their precedent can be binding unless it's overturned by the Supreme Court. So a lot of what they say can affect what's going on throughout the entire nation. You know, President Trump, he named a number of circuit court judges more than President Biden has so far and probably will before the end of the term. And what's also significant is that President Trump actually flipped three of the circuits to become Republican leaning. Once President Biden got in office, he flipped back one of those circuits, but still, you know, President Trump, he flipped the 11th Circuit that is based in Atlanta, it encompasses Florida, Georgia. And just in the past few months, that 11th Circuit has really -- they've stopped voting rights for ex-felons. They've also upheld state restrictions on gender affirming care. So it's really the circuit court level that has this broad effect, just as much as the Supreme Court. And President Trump was able to make a lot more inroads than President Biden so far has been.",

But there is a not insignificant share of the electorate who truly hasn't made up their minds.The other element of persuasion that I think is perhaps even more important is the persuasion of people are on the fence of do I vote or not? Am I going to come out to vote in this election? That's a even bigger chunk of the electorate. And when you're seeing some of these swings in the polls that we've seen over the last few weeks, a lot of that is actually the second category.
