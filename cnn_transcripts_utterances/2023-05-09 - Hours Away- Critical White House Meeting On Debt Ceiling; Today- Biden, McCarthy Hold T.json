      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Very busy news day. Thank you for your time. Five min, one room. The stability of the global economy on the line. Today, the White House is the stage for debt talks and what happens could set the country on a path towards paying its bills or on a path towards financial chaos.Plus, heartbreak and waiting in Allen, Texas. A family cut down from four to one, two school aged sisters robbed of their futures. We're learning more about the victims and more about the shooter who slaughtered them. His fascination with guns, his swastika tattoo, his misogyny as police stay curiously quiet. And Donald Trump's civil case goes to a New York jury, after contentious closing arguments that focus on credibility and Mr. Trump's refusal to show up. But up first for us in just hours, a White House meeting that will help answer this question and Washington still work. The stakes for today's big sit down could not be higher, the full faith and credit of the United States. The roster pulls together the biggest players, President Biden, the Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. The task to start steering away from a debt ceiling iceberg sitting three weeks or so away. The stalemate is over something you, American families in good times and bad face all the time; paying the mortgage, the car loan, the credit card bill, but here in broken Washington, this is somehow hard. Today's huddle breaks a month-long play -- month's long play by both sides to weight the other out. This afternoon, we get an initial read on just how entrenched both sides are. Let's begin at the White House, go live now to CNN's Arlette Saenz. Arlette, it's a big meeting, but there are relatively small expectations. ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, John. Progress has been made on at least one front and that is getting President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the same room together to talk about the debt limit. But aides on both sides are not expecting any type of major breakthrough. And officials from the White House have said, heading into this meeting that they don't view this as a negotiation. Now, this is the first time that the two men along with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are sitting down in the same room together in 97 days after that meeting in early February, and both sides still remain dug in on their positions. President Biden is insisting and will hold firm to his line, that there should be a clean debt ceiling increase without any conditions attached to it. He is going into that with the backing of the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. But then on the Republican side, the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is still holding firm on his calls for a cleaned -- for an increase of the debt ceiling with spending cuts attached. You'll remember the House passed that bill just a few weeks ago. And he's also coming into this with a report, with the support of Republicans in the Senate, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. But really this marks a key test for both President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy as they are dealing with these power dynamics of an era of divided government as the U.S. economy could be at risk of potential default.",

And so, the question is, you know, the Democrats want to hold out instead of the Republicans will spell out exactly what you would cut because they think that would benefit them politically. But the president faces his own pressure, including from a name that has been quite familiar to him in the last couple of years, trying to get things done. Senator Joe Manchin, who says the president's position, especially since now Republicans control one branch of the government. Joe Manchin says, get over it, Mr. President.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D-WV): It's not rational, it's not reasonable, and it's not practical. And something that it's hypocritical to say that we're not going to do it. Now, when we've done it every time that there has been a split in the party. And anytime there's been a split in one of the houses or from the president, there's always been negotiations.

This is the first meeting where both sides will hold their ground, and then the substantive work starts happening behind the scenes. The actual work will not happen in the meeting most likely.But look, one thing the White House has been hoping all along here that Republicans in the House and indeed the Senate would be fractured, that they would blink, that they would separate. That did not happen. Speaker McCarthy was able to hold together his House republicans and now joined by some 43 Senate Republicans unlikely others in this idea that some spending cuts have to happen here. So, this is not how the White House was hoping to go into June. They thought that they could really sort of drive a wedge between the very divided House Republicans. That hasn't happened. So, the president, one person pretty quiet in all this is a Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell. He is allowing a speaker McCarthy to do it. At the end of all of this, the person who the president has the longest relationship is Mitch McConnell. So, I think looking ahead in our crystal ball, are those two men of Washington going to sort of help broker some deal, but it will not happen yet. We don't know what's going to happen between here and now. But Joe Manchin is an outlier a little bit, but not as much as you may think, a lot of Democrats are thinking the White House has to do something.",

Three-year-old James and his parents, Korean Americans' Kyu Song Cho, Shin Young Kang were gunned down. Six-year-old William survived that according to a GoFundMe post written by family friends, also lost two sisters Daniela and Sofia Mendoza in fourth and second grade.Their elementary school principal described them as to quote, \"rays of sunshine.\" Their mother is in critical condition. 20-year-old mall security guard Christian Lacour, 27-year-old engineer Aishwarya Thatikonda, and 32-year-old Elio Cumana-Rivas, all dead, all killed by a hateful gunman. We're learning he made disturbing social media posts fixated on Nazi ideology guns and mass shootings. Let's go live to CNN's Josh Campbell. He is at the scene in Allen, Texas with the latest. Josh, what are we learning? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, John. So, a law enforcement source that previously told me that investigators had uncovered this really troubling online presence from the shooter, where he's talking about white supremacy. He's talking about Nazis. We're now seeing some of those images for ourselves. CNN has identified a site of Russian social media platform where this shooter had an account. And his account is just replete with all kinds of vile material about Nazis, about white supremacy, again, his obsession over firearms, his obsession over past mass shootings, and essentially looking to those and discussing those types of attacks. He obviously is accused of coming here this weekend and killing eight people at this mall in Allen, Texas. Now, he also describes himself, John, as an Incel, which is, for those who, who don't follow extremism is essentially a man who can blames women and society for his lack of romantic success. We're also learning chilling new details, and I'll show you some of the photos from this account. It appears as though he had conducted attack reconnaissance here prior to this attack. You see a photo from the parking lot. You see him researching on GoogleMaps, one of the busiest times of day out at this Allen mall, truly troubling stuff. Finally, John, I'm learning new information about the firearms that the suspect had. A law enforcement source tells me that authorities recovered multiple firearms, including that AR-15 that he used in conducting this massacre. I'm told that all of those firearms were purchased legally, most of them from private sellers. The reason why that's so important, and we often hear people after these mass shootings say, well, let's not talk about politics. Let's not politicize that. Politics obviously drives policy. And here in the state of Texas, if you buy a gun from a private seller, you don't have to go through a federal background check. John?",

So, this is just a very, very familiar timeworn story of another alienated, isolated, angry young man gravitates towards these communities of these extremist communities, extremist ideologies, as a way of seeking a tribe, seeking a community, seeking that sort of affirmation for his own anger and his own beliefs, and then carefully planning out this massacre and executing it in the most lethal way.",

His attorney Mr. Tacopina told the judge, he would not testify but he could have come in if he wanted to, correct? JOEY JACKSON, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY &amp; CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes. There's no question, John, good to be with you. Well, your distinction is very important. It isn't a criminal case where you have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We're talking about liability as to two claims. What are they, battery, the unlawful touching of someone without consent. We know Ms. Carroll has said, made the accusation that she was raped by Mr. Trump. Second allegation with respect to defamatory statements. What is defamation false statements, that impugn and impair your reputation. The president to your question could have come in and in fact, the judge allowed the door to be open until Sunday, this past Sunday for Mr. Trump to come in and testify on his own behalf.

I won't repeat the specifics of it.Joe Tacopina, the defense attorney saying in this, you know, what they want is for you to hate him enough to ignore the facts. You can think Donald Trump is a rude and crude person, and that her story makes no sense. Both of these things can be true.

It's a political operation and hit job, whatever you want to say. There were two recent outcry witnesses. What are they? They are people who she confided in friends of hers with respect to what happened, when it happened, how it happened, and they gave her advice. Additionally, you mentioned the Access Hollywood tape. Why was that played? To show this was the president's modus operandi. And then it goes a step further from that, John, and that are two other women who came in and said that this happened to them too. So, the defense certainly saying that, listen, there's nothing to see here. This is all made up. There's no evidence to be shown.
