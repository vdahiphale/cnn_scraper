And it was high emotion last night as Donald Trump made his first appearance since the attempt on his life at his Pennsylvania rally. When he entered the room, the hall, you can see, he had a bandage on his right ear, standing ovation from the crowd, and the crowd chanting, \"fight, fight, fight\" at one point to the former president, who is now officially the Republican nominee and who also officially announced yesterday his running mate, JD Vance, in the midst of it all.Today, Trump's chief rival from the Republican primaries, Nikki Haley, is expected to be speaking at the convention. A lot of anticipation around what her message will be. Joining me right now is Republican Congressman, and House majority whip, Tom Emmer. It's good to see you, Congressman. Thank you so much for coming in. Did you have a chance to speak to the president when he - when he was here last night and how he's doing and what - like what your view of it is? REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): No, I did not get a chance to talk to him last night, but I was so impressed when he showed up. You know, normally he waits until the very end and he builds all the excitement.",

Foreign policy became something of a focus last night, even though it was more of an economic message, but became some of the focus last night on stage, especially when we heard this speech from David Sacks. He's a Silicon Valley investor who was given a prime speaking slot. And he really went after Joe Biden and his policy and aid for Ukraine. Let me play this really quickly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID SACKS (CEO, YAMMER): Then he provoked, yes, provoked, the Russians to invade Ukraine with talk of NATO expansion. President Biden sold us this new forever war by promising it would weaken Russia and strengthen America. Well, how does that look today?

I've heard from Democrats he represents something quite different from what David Urban is laying out.MATT BENNETT, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND CO- FOUNDER, THIRD WAY: Look, I'm a fan of JD Vance circa 2016, at least when it comes to Donald Trump. Vance is a radical. He has said that abortion should be banned in all cases. And he said that, you know, cases of rape and incest are inconvenient. He's told women to stay in violent marriages. He's trashed the Affordable Care Act. He's said that Social Security and Medicare should be on the table. I mean this guy is yanking the party as hard as he possibly can strongly to the right. So, I agree with David, that it is a departure. But I think there's some other things to keep in mind. He massively underperformed the top of the ticket when he ran in 2022. He was something like 20 points behind where the governor ran. So, this idea that he's going to help Trump lock up the Midwest is nonsense. He didn't do very well in a very good year in Ohio last time. So, I think Vance poses real problems for the ticket, and he kind of doubled down - Trump doubled down on the base when, in fact, he needed to be looking to expand his coalition, which he did not do with Vance.",

And, obviously, don't want to prejudge that.But I think from everything that I've heard, in the discussions I've had, and from what has been reported thus far, it's clear that there was a lack of resources. I mean you didn't have drones available for use, which is insane. In addition to the fact that the shooter was able to get on the roof of a building with a direct line of sight of the former president, and able to get a shot off. And as we learn more, and it seems as though, you know, this individual was in the sights of law enforcement officials for, you know, roughly 25 minutes, that obviously raises significant concern and questions about protocol. It raises concern about communication. And we want to get to the bottom of it. But the bottom line to me is this, our elections should always be decided by votes at a ballot box, not by violent at a rally. And the fact is, but for the grace of God we came a millimeter away from Donald Trump being dead versus Donald Trump being here this week to accept the Republican nomination. And I think that should shock the conscience of our nation to its core, and we should be moving expeditiously to ensure that every resource is available to not only Donald Trump and Joe Biden but to RFK Junior, whose family has twice been victim to political assassination.",
