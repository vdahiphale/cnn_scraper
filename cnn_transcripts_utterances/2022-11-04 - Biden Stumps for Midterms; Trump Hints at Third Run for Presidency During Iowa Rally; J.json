That nothing has been decided so far at the Justice Department. It's an indication though of the conversations as they gear up for a potential Donald Trump presidential run and don't want to send the signal that the current President Joe Biden's Justice Department could be going after someone he may be running against. Now right now, the Justice Department is in its quiet period. There's still been a lot going on behind the scenes though. Grand jury subpoenas, secret court battles to get folks to testify. That activity though is all going to ramp up after the midterms. The Justice Department is already staffing up as it prepares to make some big decisions including whether to indict allies of the former president or whether to bring an unprecedented indictment against Trump himself, the former president. In addition to these legal woes the former president faces, he also faces an investigation in Georgia. That is a criminal investigation and the district attorney there has said she wants to wrap up her probe by the end of this year. Sources tell us the indictments there could come as early as December. Sara Murray, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we did see the main flag -- the main building rather in Kherson city, the flag, the Russian flag taken down from there on a social media video.But an Ukraine official saying, look, this is just a trap. Yes, we've seen some troop movement, yes, some checkpoints have been cleared but there is absolutely no mass withdrawal. And you wouldn't expect a mass withdrawal. The city is absolutely a strategic prize for President Putin. It is critical to the bridge, the land bridge that he's built connecting Crimea to the rest of those Russian occupied territories. It is the one and only regional capital that Russian forces has been able to take. And it's of course, part of those illegally annexed regions. So, you cannot expect the Kremlin would back down easily here. But what I want to point out -- because I know it's difficult for us to really get a clear picture here, there's really tough reporting restrictions on the Ukrainian side. Very few journalists have gotten access to those front lines. It's very hard to find out what's happening if you can't see it ourselves.

They say they've switched to diesel generators to keep going.To the best of my knowledge, the reactors are all in cold storage right now. They're not actually producing nuclear power at the moment. But of course, they need electricity to continue to cool and of course, for the day-to-day activities it's absolutely critical. So, they're running off of generators. Energoatom is alleging that Russia wants to do this because, of course, as you know, Putin signed a decree to bring Zaporizhzhia which is in Russian occupied territory in that region that they have illegally annex under Russian control. And they said the allegation is that they want to disconnect from the Ukrainian grid so they can connect it to the Russian grid, right. But this deserves a lot of attention. Because this is Europe's largest nuclear reactor. This is a vulnerable installation here. The shelling continuing to go on, according to the Ukrainian side.

So, that's good news for Ukraine. But this is not the biggest fear. The biggest fear In the West, is not that Russia will be proved rightand that Ukraine is actually building a dirty bomb. The biggest fear is that this was a Russian false flag operation and it's Russia that's actually, you know, planning some radiologically or nuclear attack. And I think those fears remain because of course, as we see Russia remains on the back foot in the battlefield, the city of Kherson is now heavily contested.
