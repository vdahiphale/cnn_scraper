It also showed that he understood that the crime was wrong and he sort of apologizes for it.

He moved to Hawaii. He lived in sort of a community facility. Often complained about his back. He seemed estranged from his family or they didn't really know where he was. His social media posts show people who knew him trying to connect with him through his social media. So he sort of drifted off.And so what was that triggering and how did he become radicalized? I will say some things are answered. As we talked about last week, I thought this was a sophisticated, relatively sophisticated attack and killing, to the extent he was able to evade law enforcement, sort of, you know, not in all sorts of ways, sort of evade the surveillance. In the end, it was a McDonald's worker who recognized him because of a lot of the investigations that have gone on and a lot of the disclosures by the NYPD. But he was smart, and we know that. And he was into apps and technology and engineering. He understood how, what the surveillance state was like and then how to evade it. And the one other thing I want to add is his, you know, this is really hard, and I want to be careful here. But his family clearly knew it was him when they saw the pictures.

The leader of the main rebel group, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, met former President Bashar al-Assad's outgoing prime minister on Monday to discuss the transfer of power.But a source tells CNN that a decision has not been made yet of who will be the transitional prime minister. The U.S. says it's not planning to review the terrorist designation of the leading rebel group, but the State Department says that could change in the future. Meanwhile, rebels and civilians are tearing down symbols of the Assad regime. And the rebel coalition says members of Assad's military forces must register with them. They have issued a general amnesty for soldiers conscripted into the military, but that does not apply to those who volunteered. For civilians life in Syria is starting to return somewhat to normal. In Aleppo, people are back on the streets. Some shops are open and banks are expected to reopen in the coming hours. With Assad gone, ordinary Syrians and the world are getting a look at his luxurious lifestyle. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You are looking at the extravagant car collection of the now deposed President Bashar al- Assad, a red Ferrari F50 worth at least $3 million, a Lamborghini, a Rolls Royce, a Bentley among 40 luxury vehicles stored in this warehouse in western Damascus, proving to Syrians what they already believed to be true, that while Assad bombed and brutalized his people, his family reveled in vast wealth. Inside the Presidential Palace, more signs of luxury, a massive kitchen equipped with an industrial freezer, a pizza oven and piles of food in a country where most go hungry every day. The woman behind the camera reads from what appears to be a draft menu for the former first lady, the madam's food, she says, she hates spinach. Tomorrow we will make her salmon or latakia fish. Vogue magazine, infamously dubbed Asmal Assad, arose in the desert mere months before her husband used brute and barbaric force to crush a revolt against his dictatorship. But as rebels swiftly advanced on the capital, the Assads were finally dislodged. Fleeing to Moscow, where they received asylum. Overjoyed Syrians celebrated in the streets and ransacked the regime's residences and offices, taking chairs, plates, clothes, whatever they could carry. Is this stealing one person jokes? No, no, it's not. Another laugh. Syrians have long accused the generational autocracy of pocketing hundreds of millions from the state. Festering corruption was one of the key grievances of the 2011 uprising. The Assad family is estimated to be worth 1 to $2 billion. Epic wealth maintained and cultivated while the regime killed, maimed, disappeared and displace Syrians were plunged into a living nightmare. Some 90 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to the UN. I came to see what Assad forbade us from seeing, this woman says, we were only allowed to know poverty, deprivation and suffering. Now clear for all to see the grandosity of the Presidential Palace, the callousness of his reign, and the joy that Assad is finally gone some. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And again, people should be cautious about this and not naive, have been good where they haven't tried to replicate what they did in Idlib anyway and actually have been sending out good signals. But more than that, this isn't just HTS. HTS was the most powerful group at the head of the opposition, which is no longer the opposition, obviously, but there are many other groups, that's one. Two, that ordinary Syrians across the country joined in this past week, and they're going to have to contend with that. Three, there are scores of Syrians who are trying now to return to Syria, who were refugees and now want to come home. So it's not as simple as saying that a rebel group that used to be really extreme, which has kind of moderated a bit now in comparison at least, has taken over the country. I think there's many more elements that are in the mix, and there will continue to be experiments going forward. And I think that the government and the international community in general should look at that at face value and again, try to help in order to make sure that this transition is as bumpy absent as possible. But there will be mistakes. There will be bumps along the way. I think that's inevitable. They're not going to be perfect, but there was going to be no sustainable future with Bashar al-Assad at the helm.

There have been statements saying don't look for revenge. They seem to be very keen to make this orderly and not to plunge the country into chaos. OK.But does that mean that everybody is going to stay on side? I don't know. Does that mean that the amnesty is going to be expanded? And by the way, we see this in many other post conflict or post-regime sort of places like this as well. When apartheid in South Africa fell, of course, very different, but there was this big question, what do you do with all of these officials and civil servants and, you know, people in the country who are responsible for the apartheid regime? [01:20:00] What do you do in these post-colonial edifices that are built against the backdrop of a war against colonial rule? And then there were those who stayed behind who were actually involved in atrocities. So these aren't new questions, they're old questions. And I don't think anybody has a perfect answer. But that's more of a reason, in my opinion, for the international community to build this with, of course, the Syrians, as in, you know, stand by for assistance, not, of course, try to lead anything. This is not that situation at all. As I said, this is a Syrian affair. But I think Syrians will want external assistance, not lead, but external assistance in trying to reconstruct the country. There's going to be a lot that needs to be done. This is a country of trauma. I mean, just literally over the last hour, I was looking at updates and the stories from the prisons, what they found in the prisons, the people who have been killed, the people who've been tortured, the people who were in jail for like 30, 40 years and didn't even know that, you know, Hafez al-Assad had passed away, Bashar's father, you know, I mean, there's a lot of trauma that's going to be, that's going to have to be dealt with now.

Now, we don't know yet if this was actively coordinated, but our analysis of more than 100 videos indicates this was a multi-pronged approach with groups swarming the capital from different directions. Here's how it unfolded. Rebels under the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had been capturing key towns in the north of Syria as the week progressed. They started heading south towards the capital, Damascus. On Thursday, they captured the city of Hama. By Friday, they are still inching their way further south reaching nearby the town of Talbiseh, just north of Homs. An airstrike hits nearby, but the fighters are undeterred. Cheering after the strike hits, And now they're not alone. To the south of Damascus other rebel groups are also mobilizing. This is on the road outside Daraa on Friday night, where the revolution started back in 2011. The group filming called themselves the Southern Operations Room. The next day, fighters from the Druze religious sect are also part of the rebels progress, tearing down a statue of President Assad's father in a town just outside of Damascus. As the different groups of rebel forces continue to close in on Damascus, regime forces begin withdrawing. Here, they're fleeing on foot.

We saw this back in the first iteration of the Syrian civil war back in 2011, 2012, when also there was concern that Syria was disintegrating Israel moved some of its military into the buffer zone, basically more of a symbolic message to whoever is there that we -- as Israel was basically saying, we will not tolerate any violation of the agreement from 1974 that was supposed to see the Syrian side of the border demilitarized.Israel is basically concerned that whatever happens in Syria is up to the Syrian people. It's up to the international community. This is not something that Israel is going to be able to engineer one way or the other. But at least along its own border, and I think that Anna, this is even more important in over the last 14 months, when we've seen what happens when Israel neglects its border security, like what happened last October 7th when Hamas barreled across the border and massacred so many people in southern Israel. Israel wants to make sure that there is no threat that is now emerging along its own border. So what I would anticipate is that it will stay there for a short period of time. It won't be something that's going to be long term. It's going to be there to be able to defend itself for the short term and to send a message to whoever might be taking over the country to the north don't even try to militarize what is supposed to be a demilitarized zone.",

These aren't exactly liberal progressives who are now taking over Syria.So Israel is obviously being very vigilant and is watching what happens. But I think that Israel also has to be modest in what -- it can impact, or how it can impact what's happening in Syria. You have now Turkey in Syria, you have obviously American forces. You still have Russian forces. You have the Kurds and the Druze and the Alawites. This is a country that is now fractured into so many different pieces. But Israel is going to be very -- is keeping a watchful eye, especially on HTS because of its radical Salafi Islamic background and its stated purpose and the way that it has controlled some of the territory in Idlib Province for example, over the last few years. Israel does fear that they will eventually turn their guns, potentially against the state of Israel. So therefore it's trying to remove those weapons off the chessboard. It's beefing up and bolstering its own defenses and it's going to keep an eye on what happens there in case there is a new emerging threat. Just after Israel dealt with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, it actually wants to walk away from war, not have to engage now in another new front.",
