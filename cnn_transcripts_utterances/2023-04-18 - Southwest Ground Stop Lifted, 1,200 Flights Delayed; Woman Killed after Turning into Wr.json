      "sentences": "You know, we'll see the ripple effect here, John, this ground stop by Southwest Airlines were laid by the FAA, lasted only about 20 minutes. But we are seeing the delays continue to pile up.At 10:30, there were 800 nationwide. Now we're up to 1,249 according to FlightAware. That's 30 percent of Southwest's entire schedule for the day coast to coast. We see in these incidents that once something like this happened, there is a big domino effect. So we will see how quickly this does truly resolve itself for Southwest Airlines and at airports across the country. What's interesting here, John, is that we have just heard there is a departure delay for flights going into Dallas Love Field, which is one of Southwest Airlines' biggest hubs, because simply, because of these delayed flights, they do not have enough gate space. We first found out about this from a tweet from Southwest Airlines, relaying its message to a customer that was complaining about these delays. It said there were intermittent technology issues. The FAA put out this ground stop around 10:30 this morning on the East Coast due to equipment issues, according to the FAA. Still not totally clear what these equipment issues actually were and how similar this is to the holiday meltdown that Southwest Airlines experienced, stranding tens of thousands of customers nationwide over the Christmas and New Year's holidays. We're talking 17,000 flights were canceled during that period, John, so this may not be near as big as that meltdown, although still very significant for an airline that really took it on the chin reputation wise, when it had that meltdown at the end of last year.",

Apparently they feel they've got that situation fixed. But now there's a backup and the reason there are concerns about this, particularly with Southwest, is what we saw in December, when you had so many people just stranded.",

In fact, at some point Southwest was flying planes that were completely empty, trying to get them back into position.And that just simply seemed to fail over and over again. In this case, we are not sure if it's the scheduling system that Southwest had that meltdown with over the holidays. This could be something completely different -- not to speculate. But it could be an operational system. Might be something as simple as not being able to get weather to its pilots. We just don't know from Southwest Airlines just yet. We've not actually gotten an individual statement from them. We're putting this all together from what the FAA is telling us and what the information is from FlightAware. And the delays just keep going up. John. [11:05:00] BERMAN:  Well, if anyone can get to the bottom of it, you, Pete, it is you. We'll let you work the phones for a little bit. Let us know what you find out about this and if these delays start being alleviated. Appreciate it. Sara.",

But Ralph had made a mistake. This home is located on 115th Street; the home where Ralph was supposed to pick his younger siblings is about one block away, 115th Terrace. That mistake nearly costing him his life. Now Lester is facing two charges, the first of which, armed criminal action, could earn him 3 to 15 years behind bars. The more serious charge, which is first degree felony assault, could see him spend the rest of his life in prison. And we've been here, Sara, for the past two days. It does not appear that anyone's been home there. We -- again we are waiting for this 84 year old suspected gunman, suspected shooter to turn himself into police custody.
