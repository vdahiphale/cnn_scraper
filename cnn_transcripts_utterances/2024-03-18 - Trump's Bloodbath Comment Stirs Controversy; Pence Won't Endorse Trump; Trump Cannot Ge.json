A new civil rights complaint alleges pervasive anti-Semitism in one public school district, including in classrooms and sometimes from teachers themselves. CNN's Nick Watt sat down with some of the students and parents raising concerns.Plus, after weeks of silence, President Biden speaks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the war against Hamas in Gaza. The call comes just one day after Netanyahu appeared live on CNN and criticized one of Biden's closest allies in Washington, D.C. and the highest-ranking Jewish American in history, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Were Biden and Netanyahu able to find any common ground? And leading this hour, one specific remark from Donald Trump's rally on Saturday has set off a political firestorm. But is it possible the firestorm is missing what should be of real concern? Before we get there, we'll have to once again play the tape and the game of interpreting the former president's viral clip made the rounds where Mr. Trump predicted a, quote, \"bloodbath\" should he lose the election in November. Now, this sounds on the surface such as, well, it sounds like he's calling for political violence and commentators and Democratic politicians, even President Biden, were quick to call it as such. Joe Biden's campaign issuing a statement saying, quote, \"this is who Donald Trump is, a loser who gets beat by over seven million votes. And then instead of appealing to a wider mainstream audience, doubles down on his threats of political violence,\" unquote. Of course, as always, when it comes to journalism, it's important to view the entirety of any politician's remarks and view the context. So, Mr. Trump said this. We're about to air the clip in the midst of a riff on the auto industry and unions and the transition to electric cars and auto plants in Mexico. So, listen to the quote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, and if you talk to members of his campaign, they say not to expect that at all. They are doing what they can to work around a candidate that they know who his strengths and weaknesses are, and Donald Trump is going to say and do whatever he wants. Now, one thing we were told by senior advisers is that he might tailor his message.Now, again, this isn't some kind of presidential pivot. This isn't changing who he is. It isn't even toning down these remarks. It more meant that based on where he's going, if he's shown the data for what those voters care about, he would likely talk about that, for example, immigration. He might lead with immigration those same remarks about immigration. But I do want to point out one thing here. Donald Trump has been saying this for over a year. He was talking in CPAC more than a year ago after he announced his second candidacy. He said, I will be your retribution. I will be your revenge. He often talks in these dark undertones or really overtones. He's very clear about where he stands on immigration. He has said he wants to round up migrants and then deport them. These are all things he has said. The difference is now that we are in a general election. He is presumptive Republican nominee and everything is under a microscope. He is no longer saying this stuff in a vacuum to conservative media. He's no longer ranting just on True Social, where there are far less viewers or users than on Twitter or Facebook. He is now saying this in the context of one of the two candidates who are running to be president in November. So, people are paying attention. So, the question is, how exactly is the campaign going to handle this? One of the things they have told us is that part of their strategy is to try and grow his base, like what we saw in Iowa, finding people who supported Donald Trump in some way but had never voted in some of these critical battleground states. But also, a lot of this is going to be played out on the Internet, like you saw, taking those snippets of these various remarks that he makes that, as you say, are hard to interpret and hard to defend.

He's trying to argue that the total judgment will come down. Of course, the New York attorney general's office is opposing that.So, Trump has laid out his efforts to try to get a bond, saying that they have approached 30 different bond underwriters. None of them were willing to secure the bond. In their filing, they write, very few bonding companies will consider a bond of anything approaching that magnitude. As you said, it's nearly half a billion dollars that he has to come up with. And what Trump's team said is that among the insurance companies they've gone to, including some of the biggest ones in the world, they have limits internally where they singularly will not underwrite a bond in excess of $100 million. His problem is five times that size. And in addition, that these companies want cash or stocks as collateral, Trump doesn't have that much cash or stock to cover the amount. So, they're telling the appeals court they've got this problem and that they're hoping the appeals court will see that they've made an effort and give him this ability to appeal the case without posting the money. They've also said to the appeals court panel, if you're not going to allow this, then let us go to the New York's highest appeals court and let us continue to not have to come up with the money until then. We are expecting this first layer of the appeals court to make a decision this month. His bond is due next Monday. So, this is all coming to a head, yet again, down to the wire, Jake.",

And Donald Trump on the trail is reminding us every day of who he is and what he will wreak on America. So, what is the context? The context of him talking about bloodbath is the memory of January 6th, and what his words and actions set forth then. It's the context of him talking about American carnage.

I don't think people who hate migrants really can tell the differenceas to who's legal or who's not, as to who may be a U.S. citizen or not. How do I know that? I know that because of what was triggered in the man who drove over 10 hours to an El Paso Walmart to shoot up migrants and immigrants and Latinos, including 13 who were American citizens. I know that because of the children. Let us remember the children that were bullied mercilessly, the Latino children that were bullied mercilessly during Trump's administration because there were kids replicating his speech, because there were kids learning from the things that he said and saying that to little brown kids. So that's the reaction that it brings from me. I don't want to defend MS-13. I think they're terrible people. But I think that Trump keeps putting these dog whistles in everything he says, trying to signal to the people who are racist, to the people who do hate immigrants, to the people who think that folks who look like me and sound like me are poisoning the blood of America.

And what that did is it gave Texas State officials and judges really the power to enforce immigration law to hold hearings, to deport people who were here illegally.Now that was appealed by the Justice Department by the Biden administration. The federal trial court first decided against Texas. They said you can't enforce the federal immigration law that's for federal authorities only. It then went to the Federal Court of Appeals which said the law looks OK and can go into effect. But then the Supreme Court put a stay or a pause on it up until today. And what the Supreme Court has just done, as Joan just said, is to extend that state, to keep it paused. So the SB 4, the law in Texas is not in effect as of this moment. And it will be pending further Supreme Court opinions.",

You cannot have individual states applying and enforcing immigration law, it would lead to chaos, and it's against the core tenant of the constitution.

The request worth noting and remembering how Peter Navarro got here, he's got to serve four months. Peter Navarro was subpoenaed by the January 6th Committee back in 2022. He completely rejected, defied that subpoena. He was then held in contempt. He was tried for contempt of Congress. He was found guilty and sentenced to four months.And I think it's interesting that in this ruling, the Chief Justice Roberts as Joan just noted, he basically said straight up Navarro has almost no chance of winning his appeal. Therefore, he can't avoid prison. He's got to go in. Now, he can still make his appeal, but he seems to have very little chance of prevailing.",
