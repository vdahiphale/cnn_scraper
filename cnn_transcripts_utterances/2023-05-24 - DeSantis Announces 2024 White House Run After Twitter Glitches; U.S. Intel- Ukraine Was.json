This is his Twitter and yet they could not host it.But even when DeSantis spoke, it was a very different speech that what we've heard from other candidates who have announced so far. He didn't really offer much of a vision for the country. Instead he really focused on the problems that he has seen with the country under Joe Biden and the problems he has seen in the Republican Party under Donald Trump, though he did not call out Trump by name. And then he issued a call for Republicans to get behind him in 2024. Listen to what he said and how he put that call to them. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

Now, he's not going to say that, and I don't expect him to. Folks who are on Twitter are experiencing that, including myself and many other people. So if -- I hope Ron DeSantis gets a huge campaign contribution after doing this from Elon Musk. He surely did promote twitter, and, I mean, it failed, and I think that will last for a couple of days, but I will pay attention to what Ron DeSantis is saying, and once you get past Twitter and the launch, it was some of the same stuff you hear from Ron DeSantis, questioning the validity of masks during COVID, talking about overcensorship when he's the governor who is trying to censor what students and people can read in the state of Florida. So, I can look past the kerfuffle of the failed launch in terms of Twitter and I am really paying to the policies that DeSantis is talking about because it is a totally different direction he's trying to take the country and I don't think it's one the overwhelming population wants it to go.",

I'm so grateful to have both of you on to talk about a woman that you admire, that you performed with, who you consider a friend. Ruth, what did you think when you first heard that Tina Turner had passed away today? RUTH POINTER, GRAMMY-WINNING MUSICIAN, THE POINTER SISTERS: Oh, my God, I just started weeping, you know. I loved her so much. In my opinion, she was my queen in the music industry. She was my queen. I wanted to be her. You know, I tried to be her with my sisters, and I saw her several times. I actually saw her with Ike in Oakland, right after I graduated high school at a little joint there in Oakland, a sportsman club, and we used to go to with the eye cats (ph), and I was never the same after that. You know, but I'd seen her concerts, and I saw her musical, and we did the world together, and she's watched us perform at clubs. I remember once her standing on the side of the stage. We didn't even know she was there, and they came and told us that you got a guest that's watching you perform, and it was Tina. And we just fell apart, and she said, you guys look like four Tina Turners up there on the stage because we were tearing it up.",

And I think the appointees of the Biden ministration doing the negotiation, Shalanda Young and Steve Ricchetti, are capable, able, principled, and Speaker McCarthy had said the same. And I think the way the negotiation has been handled has been adequate. But what I have done some things differently? Of course. I think it would have been an opportune time for the White House to demand universal background checks on gun purchases, something that 80 percent of the country wants.
