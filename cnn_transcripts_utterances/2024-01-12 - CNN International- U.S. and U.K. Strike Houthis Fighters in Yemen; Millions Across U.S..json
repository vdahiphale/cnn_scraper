So the former initially leads to short-term disruptions by adding 10 to 15 days to the time spent in transit and potentially an immediate shortage of goods until the trade routes are reestablished.Then secondly, that ties up transport capacity and equipment for longer, which leads to tight supply in freight markets. And that leads us on to the second point, which means increased costs, which is also twofold. So firstly, there's longer sailing distances. That means more fuel costs to operate the ships. And then in addition, the tightening of the shipping market itself increases the freight rates when customers need to compete for the available slots.

And look, the judge granted it, saying, I'll give you five minutes. And the judge had previously set a restriction on Trump, saying you can participate in closing arguments, but you can't give a campaign speech. And that's exactly what Trump did, attacking the judge, attacking the attorney general's office and insisting that he is a, quote, innocent man. Now, Trump addressed the public on his way into court, on his way out of court, those remarks in court, and then had a press conference. So it appears that he got a real return on investment here in terms of amplifying his argument that he is being targeted because of a desire by his political opponents to try to, quote, interfere in this election.

They noticed that even though Chris Kise talked for two hours, other attorneys got up and laid out their closing arguments.
