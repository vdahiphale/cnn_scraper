Haiti's gang leader says the people should decide who will govern them. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY CHERIZIER, HAITI GANG LEADER (through translator): Today because today we're taking this opportunity to ask the international community to give Haiti a chance. Because in the situation that's in right now, it's up to us Haitians to decide who can govern the country and what kind of government we want, and how we're going to work to get the country out of the misery it's in. It's clear that it's the inhabitants of the working class districts and the Haitian people who know what they're suffering at the moment.

It's not clear what those issues are.Now the situation in Gaza you know, it remains bleak, especially now for Ramadan. CNN's Nada Bashir shows us how some Palestinians in Rafah are marking the holy month but first warning, part of her report contains disturbing video. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Moments of joy like this are rare in Gaza now. As the holy month of Ramadan begins, this is a moment of togetherness in the very worst of times. Amid the horror, children across the strip are somehow able to escape their reality, even if only briefly. In this refugee camp in Deir al-Balah, some Palestinians have decorated their tents, just as they once decorated bed now destroyed homes. But festivities here are muted under the constant buzzing of Israeli drones overhead. And the ever present threat of getting more airstrikes with hopes for ceasefire dashed. What are your wishes for Ramadan? A journalist asks this young boy in Rafah. A ceasefire and that price is going back to normal, he says. It's very expensive. There's no gas, no water, nothing. Official say hundreds of mosques in Gaza have been destroyed since the war began. And yet, night prayers have continued amid the ruin. In the north, worshippers gathered at this makeshift U.N. school overflowing with civilians displaced by Israel's relentless bombing campaign. During Ramadan, observant Muslims refrain from eating from dawn to dusk. It is a month centered around faith and community, with worshipers traditionally breaking fast amongst family and friends. With a quarter of Gaza's population now on the brink of famine, according to the U.N., many in Gaza will have nothing to eat. Even after sunset. I came to the food market but I can't find anything to buy, Sophian (ph) says. There's nothing. There are no dates, no milk, nothing. People can't even find food for their children. No food and no peace, this Ramadan. The first day of the holy month, marked by yet more airstrikes on Gaza and more civilians killed adding to a death toll already exceeding 31,000 over just five months. But while many are still being killed in Israel's ongoing bombardment of the besieged strip, others are now dying from starvation among them to newborn babies at the Kamal Adwan hospital. They died on the first day of Ramadan as a result of malnutrition and dehydration, and a lack of medical equipment at the hospital, Dr. Samer (ph) says. But even as the situation in Gaza grows more desperate, Israeli officials warn that a ground offensive in Rafah in the south where more than a million Palestinians are now displaced has not been ruled out. And with ceasefire negotiations stalling, there seems to be no end in sight for Gaza suffering. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So there are a couple of factors that are in place here.First of all, there's more production ramping up in the United States at the big facility in Scranton, which is right near where President Biden grew up. It's actually just a few miles from the house he grew up in. And in Europe, I've just been in Berlin for several months. And there's a new facility that is ramping up as well in Germany. But these won't be coming online with significant production until probably early next year, maybe the middle of next year. And the question is do the Ukrainians have a future that's that long. And the problem is not just artillery. It's also that with the absence of funding, you can't get the air defenses to the Ukrainians, and that's what they need to take down the drones and missiles.

But I actually think that we've often seen the royals do this. They won't explain. And as a consequence of that, people start absolutely panicking and there are people saying that it wasn't even original photo. It was different versions of photos that were taken last year and all conglomerated together. So what they're going to have to do, I think is they will have to release a photo that is just a snap on the camera, unaltered of Kate, perhaps with no children. Already there was I think I would say this was rather staged yesterday when we saw Kate coming out of Windsor castle in a car first time we've seen her. That I think was damaged limitation and I think in a week or so, we will probably see a picture of Kate. I would say perhaps with some of the cards and letters she's received from the public saying, thank you. We saw Charles doing that about his cancer diagnosis. I think that's what well see because at the moment, there is this spiraling panic and a lot of reputable sources are doubting the photo.

On the 15 February the day before Alexei Navalny died Navalny's team learned that the message had been delivered in some form by Roman Abramovich. They don't know when and they don't know how. But that when Alexei Navalny was found dead in prison, Roman Abramovich himself was said to have been flabbergasted by the news, but also speaks to the informal nature of how these deals really start to come together. Now, a U.S. source told us that the deal to free Alexei Navalny, albeit informal, had reached to perhaps seven or eight out of ten. And as one source told us, the offer can only ever be made once it's been accepted informally. That's how it works in these negotiations. Now, the White House commented to CNN saying that there was no formal agreement to free Alexei Navalny, but the informality of these talks is what is crucial and that there are channels outside of the regular channels between government organs that help initiate opening up doors to prisoner swaps of all kinds.
