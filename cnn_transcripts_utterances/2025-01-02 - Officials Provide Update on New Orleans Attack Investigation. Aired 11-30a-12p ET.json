Yesterday, the FBI said that people should be vigilant, that he did not act alone, that he likely had help. And now you're coming out the very next day and saying he was a lone wolf, everything is safe, the game moves on, everybody, have a good time. How can you be so sure just 12 hours later?",

In a lot of these instances -- I also had the opportunity to deploy to BOSBOMB. And I will tell you, this is almost carbon copy to BOSBOMB as far as the inaccurate reporting that comes up. And what the governor said is, we want to be transparent with the public. Years of the FBI not being transparent -- we're being as transparent as we possibly can. Unfortunately, as we're being transparent, unfortunately, for that, there is some information that we have to go back and we correct. And, in this particular incident, you heard the resources that we brought, that the other state and locals have brought. We have had 24 hours now to go through media, to go through phones, to interview people, to analyze those videos, analyze other databases. And after all of that, there's been hundreds and hundreds of leads done just in 24 hours. We're confident at this point that there is no accomplices. And I will give you an idea of how that information -- sometimes, a lot of the early reports came out that there were people that -- extra people that were setting the coolers down, right? It turns out those were just patrons on the street that were looking -- looking inside the coolers, right? Well, we didn't know that at first. We had to kind of track all that down and put that to rest. So that's just an example of one of the pieces of information, but there were other pieces of information that after we got our feet under us a little bit and on the ground here, we were able to put together a much more accurate picture of the subject and his attention.

They -- on Bourbon Street, there's a lot of senses, right, a lot of smells. I don't think you can run a bomb dog down Bourbon Street with thousands of people there and be able to sniff out a bomb. What we have been doing, what they have been doing, it's certainly a complete sweep of the Quarter because of the limited amount of traffic that's been out there. Let me just say this. I think this may help. It would be my hope that, as some additional time goes through, maybe closer to maybe to the beginning of next week, we will -- if we have got it to what extent buttoned up as we could, I would work with the FBI and the city and maybe we can come up with a timeline to be able to get you those information, kind of walk everyone through from day one through. I think it is, it's extremely premature, and you're really putting us on some speculative grounds to ask some of those questions, because, again, it's only been 24 hours.

There's a lot of different ways to do it, but that is why our ATF National Response Team is here to answer those questions and get that investigative lead back to our team. So, more to come on that.

That's the stuff in the coming days as far as that path to radicalization that we're really going to be digging into and making a priority of. So what I can tell you right now is that he was 100 percent inspired by ISIS, and so we're digging through more of the social media, more interviews, working with some of our other partners to ascertain just how -- to ascertain a little bit more about that connection.

And there is just nothing to indicate through call records, through anything on those devices, through interviews, through anything in our systems, that he was aided in this attack by anybody.
