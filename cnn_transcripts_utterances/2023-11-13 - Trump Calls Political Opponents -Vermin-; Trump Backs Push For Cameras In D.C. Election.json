But tonight, Donald Trump's campaign is defending how he called his political opponents, \"Vermin.\" Plus, CNN is on the ground, inside Gaza, getting a firsthand look at the tunnels that are used by Hamas. As Israeli forces are closing in, President Biden says that hospitals, in Gaza, quote, \"Must be protected.\" And for the first time, in U.S. history, the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted a code of conduct, with one major question left unanswered. Who exactly will enforce it? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. It is becoming clearer, by the day, what a second term, for Donald Trump, would center around. Revenge, or as he often puts it, retribution. He's spelling it out, clearly, for us, on camera, warning that it's his political opponents he says, who are the most dangerous threat (ph) Russia or North Korea, his opponents. For someone, who has long used similar language, to authoritarians and fascists, this weekend, in New Hampshire, Trump took things a step further. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: We will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country. The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous and grave than the threat from within. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's been a ton of reporting about plans that are underway, for a second Trump term, including from The New York Times, which says tonight that Trump is plotting, mass detention and the deportation of undocumented immigrants, should he regain power. Trump promised, last week, to conduct quote, \"the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\" And not long ago, he said that undocumented immigrants were poisoning the blood of the country.

And that is a new piece that he has added, to his repertoire, about immigrants. So, I think the language, which has been, very, very, fascist- invoking, or at least echoes of fascists, in history, for a long time, has become much more dramatic, and much more severe, in recent weeks. And to your point, he's not hiding any of it. What's striking to me too is when his campaign tries to insist, he's not really saying what he's saying. So, as you note, they push back on what he said. But they push back on it with a quote that, talks about crushing his opponents. And I can see where they think they're being clever, and that they're suggesting this as some kind of a liberal troll.

And so, they laid out, and various people we spoke to, laid out a very detailed plan that would involve camps, on massive open land, to enable this expedited removal and mass deportation. They talk about invoking all kinds of different laws that would enable them, to get around existing systems. They talk about reestablishing Title 42, which was used, during COVID, as a protocol, and which was initially kept in place, by President Biden, and this time for some kind of general illness. And so, it's very specific. And this is something that, those of us, who have seen Stephen Miller around, a long time, this is something Stephen Miller is pretty passionate about.

We are just going to stay in power.' (END VIDEO CLIP) FARAH GRIFFIN: A pretty remarkable statement, from Jenna Ellis, who's one of President Trump's chief attorneys, at that time. It nearly identically mirrors something that then White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, said to me on, I believe, is December 3rd of 2020. I was in a meeting, another aide was present, in the Chief's office, when he said, I was saying that, I plan to resign the next day. And he said, \"What if I told you we wouldn't be leaving office? We're not going to be leaving office.\" I shared that with federal investigators. I shared that with the Congressional investigation. But it clearly shows Dan Scavino, yes, did run the Twitter account. He's also a White House Deputy Chief of Staff, at that time, and probably one of the closest allies of the President, somebody who sat right outside of his office, in the Oval -- right outside of the Oval Office. It shows that at these senior-most tier of the White House, there was a coordinated decision, to potentially try to not leave power. That's terrifying. And, by the way, Jenna Ellis was a diehard loyalist, up until the point that her attorneys basically got to her, and said, \"Ma'am, you've got to take a plea deal,\" because as recently as a few months ago, she was still rooting for Team Trump.

They're deliberately holding the patients there, the babies, the medical staff, as hostages, to protect their Military machine, which is right under the hospital. It's complex. It's difficult. But if any finger of blame should be pointed, it must be at Hamas, that has deliberately abused the hospital, putting its Military machine deliberately. It's premeditated crime. They've deliberately built their Military machine, their command and control, their network of tunnels that lead to rocket-launching sites, and arms depots, and other underground fortresses. They've deliberately build all that under a hospital.",

      "sentences": "Tonight, the Supreme Court is putting new ethics rules, in place, after months of reports, about justices flying on private jets, vacationing on billionaires' yachts.All nine justices have now signed on to a 14-page code of conduct, governing gifts, fundraising and also finances. Pressure had been building on them to do this, especially because of reports that Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas, had failed to disclose luxury vacations that were paid for by the conservative billionaire, and donor, Harlan Crow. But the new code of conduct leaves a lot of unanswered questions. So hopefully, here to answer this is Supreme Court expert, and law professor at the University of Texas, Steve Vladeck. Steve, so great to have you on this. Is it clear to you, who is going to enforce this ethics code? PROF. STEVE VLADECK, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I mean, I think the only thing that's clear, Kaitlan is that the justices are expecting that they will enforce it themselves, which of course raises the time-old question, who watches the watchers? And so, I think part of the issue with today's development is we have these rules that at least look somewhat reasonable, on paper. But part of the issue with the prior behavior, is rules that weren't followed. How are we going to know, going forward, that these rules are being followed? What are the consequences going to be, if and when the justices don't follow them?",

And when you look at this on the first page, they talk about the recent questionable behavior, from some of the justices.I think the question that I have is if this code had been in place, 10 years ago, would we have known more about trips, like the ones that Justice Clarence Thomas took, in advance? Or would we still have had to learn about that from reporting, like we did?",

But I think this is the point like this is a necessary step, on the justices' part. It is not remotely a sufficient one, because we still have this question, going forward, of how these rules are going to be enforced, and by whom.",
