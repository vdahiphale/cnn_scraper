You are looking at live pictures here of Moscow. The mayor is saying all security restrictions have now been lifted on the Russian capital, if we can show you those pictures. But it's not business as usual there today, after an insurrection that ended quickly and without major bloodshed that left huge questions about Russian President Vladimir Putin's future. Along with Wagner military chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose forces halted their march on Moscow after they were granted an apparent amnesty. The Kremlin released a pre-recorded, undated video Putin a few hours ago that did not reference the immunity. And as of now, there's no word about the whereabouts of either Putin or Prigozhin. Matthew Chance has details of a remarkable weekend that posed a major challenge to the rule of Russia's longtime leader. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's been a weekend of chaos in Russia. An armed insurrection, threatening the Russian state ending as suddenly as it began. It kicked off on Friday with allegations of a deadly strike on a Wagner military camp in Ukraine. The leader of the Russian mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, accusing his rivals in the defense ministry of ordering the attack. Russian officials denied any role, but a furious Prigozhin, who is repeatedly accused the military of mishandling the war in Ukraine vowed revenge. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, CHIEF, WAGNER GROUP (through translator): Those who destroyed our guys today, along with 10s of 1000s of lives of Russian soldiers, will be punished. I asked no one to put up any resistance. Justice for the troops will be restored, and then, justice for all of Russia.",

Putting Wagner on a collision course with the Kremlin, a criminal case waslaunched, accusing Prigozhin of insurrection. But that didn't stop him. By Saturday morning, Wagner forces had moved into the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, in the country's south, taking over a key military facility there with little resistance. All Wagner forces continued north towards Moscow, shooting down Russian military aircraft that challenged them and ratcheting up the stakes as the Russian president addressed the nation. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): This is a blow to Russia, to our people. All those who deliberately chose the path of treachery who prepared an armed mutiny who chose the path of blackmail and terrorist methods will face inevitable punishment and will answer both to the law and to our people.",

PRIGOZHIN (through translation): Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides, we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps, according to the plan.",

Thanks very much, Kevin.Well, let's continue to talk about the global reaction to this, and significantly, among Putin's so-called allies. Nic Robertson is joining me here. He is been following developments. Nick, despite seeing no evidence of Putin, or indeed, Prigozhin for that matter today, other than this pre-recorded message that was put out a few hours ago. We have been hearing from the Kremlin that Putin has been holding calls with some of its allies, I think the likes of Iran, and Qatar. But the response we saw play out over the weekend was very muted in its support of Putin. And what does that say about the situation he is currently in, and how problematic is that for him currently?",

Is in China's vested interest that Russia doesn't crack apart, that Putin stays in power, and maintains his challenge to the west. That's what Russia -- that's what China wants to see. I think the image that's being projected by the Kremlin, Putin on T.V., but no speech, we don't know what is recorded, announcing that he's speaking to the Qataris, to the Iranian, that's supposed to project the image of business as normal, this is an important country, he is an important man, they want to speak to him, everything's good. In fact, we're moving on nothing to see. And his left the message of what there is to see to the prime minister today, for example, who, you know, has said this was a challenge in the country. But there's unity, we're moving forward. It's going to be a worry, it's going to be a worry for China, because it is the principal country financially supporting Putin in this war, even if not with heavy armaments.",

They've altered interaction poses the biggest challenge yet to Vladimir Putin's decades long rule. There is no official word on where he is right now. The man at the center of it all, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, has not been seen in public since Saturday night. And it's not really clear where he is. The Kremlin says he made a deal to go into exile in Belarus. Russian state media reports he is under investigation for inciting armed rebellion. Now, The U.S. intelligence community has been watching the revolt in Russia very carefully. One key takeaway the lack of bloodshed in the uprising. Intelligence sources say they expected it to be more violent, and ultimately, there was no fight for Moscow, which is where a strong resistance would have been encountered.

They had spiked tire earlier today as investors reacted to the weekend's chaos in Russia. Markets are now largely focused on the current uncertainty in Moscow, and whether any potential fallout from the aborted insurrection could disrupt global energy supplies. Russia, as you may know, is the world's second biggest, biggest oil exporter. Well, CNN's Anna Stewart is tracking all of this and joins us here now. Anna, the second largest exporter of oil, the biggest exporter of wheat. So, there was, of course, some expectation, there will be reactions from markets.

Ifwe even need a reminder, post invasion of Ukraine, we've seen huge volatility across global commodities, particularly oil and gas, of course. But what we saw over the weekend, just as a result of the implications of political instability within Russia, and the implications of disruption to something like oil or gas, reaching global markets was interesting. We saw oil prices rising higher, no surprise there. Russia accounts about 10 percent of the world's oil demand, we saw natural gas prices higher. They're still actually slightly higher this morning. And wheat. And wheat was a particularly interesting one because Russia, as you say, is the biggest exporter of wheat around the world. But the Rostov region, particularly is important when it comes to Russian wheat. And there's a significant port there. So, the story unfolding over the weekend was something that I think commodity investors were getting quite nervous about. Prices have pretty much recovered now, but I think they remain heightened and there will be volatility until people feel that this risk has passed.",

What potential does this have to further impact us all, as this fallout carries on? The invasion of Ukraine is just a huge part of why we've seen inflation as high as it is, and it's really becoming a struggle to bring it back down. It's a struggle for central banks all over the world, particularly, in the Eurozone, here in the U.K., and in the U.S. And a story like this, making jitters through markets pushing up prices higher, albeit only for a short time. If this were to continue, more political instability. You can certainly expect to see prices higher. And that will feed through the entire global system and increase inflation right now is becoming even more of a problem because central banks can only raise rates so far without pushing an economy into recession. The Eurozone is in recession already. The U.K. could well fall into a recession later this year or next. So, this is becoming a bigger issue and it's harder to deal with.",
