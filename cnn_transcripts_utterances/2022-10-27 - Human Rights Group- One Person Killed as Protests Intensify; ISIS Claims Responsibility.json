At least 15 people were killed more than 40injured when an attacker opened fire on worshippers on Wednesday. Officials say the suspects are foreign nationals. Two people have already been arrested while a manhunt is on we are told for a third suspect that the attack took place during one of the busiest hours for worshippers. Iran's military is now saying without evidence, it has to be said that protesters are complicit in that shrine attack and is threatening a further crackdown. CNN's Nada Bashir following the story for us from London and the concerns for many critics of this regime is that they believe that these suggestions by the government that this is protesters, in some way without evidence, complicit in the attack on the shrine will lead to further government crackdowns on demonstrators just explain what we understand to be the detail here.",

Since these protests began in September, the Iranianregime has characterized these protests as being not about human rights, not about women's rights or anti-regime sentiment, but rather they have characterized these protests as riots. And they've accused foreign actors, including the United States and Israel as being responsible for encouraging instability, chaos and unrest in Iran. They accused these protesters of working for foreign agents in their words. And I've long maintained that this is the product of foreign interference, not peaceful protests, calling for those human rights in Iran, to be upheld. And so of course, there are significant concerns now that this claim by the Iranian regime that this attack at the shrine in Shiraz on Wednesday night may now have been a cause perpetrated by foreign nationals and that could play into the regime's narrative at the protests that we're seeing are part of a wider conspiracy of wonders the regime by foreign actors. Now, as you laid out there, we've already heard reaction from the Iranian authorities a statement from the Iranian armed forces, saying that these protests have been designed to stoke unrest, chaos and instability in Iran. And that attack that we saw yesterday is part of this movement and that anybody taking part in these demonstrations is complicit in that attack, there are concerns that that could allow the regime to set the pretext for an intensification of that crackdown. We've also heard from Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, saying that there will be decisive action in response to this attack. We've already seen a significant, brutal and deadly crackdown by the Iranian security forces. We're talking about live fire ammunition tear gas, metal pellets, and beatings. And as you saw there in that report, from Katie Polglase this has led to dozens of deaths. We've seen according to Iran HR, at least 200 deaths since protests began, although it is difficult for CNN to independently verify that figure. The concern now is that this could set the pretext for the Iranian regime to really double down on that crackdown.",

It's also significant in that previous administrations had been trying to strike a deal in this maritime border for years, and they had failed. But in this the past few months, there seems to have been new motivations popping up because first of all, there are potentially billions of dollars' worth of gas and oil in this part of the Mediterranean Sea. And now when you have Russia's invasion of Ukraine, really putting pressure on Europe's gas supply, you have Lebanon, in dire economic situation really desperate for some new investments and Israel, of course, wanting some security measures on its northern border. I think all of these motivations came together to really push this agreement forward. Now, the deal was mediated by the United States by the U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein. And what's interesting about this deal is though we're calling it the Lebanon Israel maritime deal, each country actually signed an agreement with the United States. And then both of those were sent to United States and then sent to the United Nations. There is no piece of paper that has both the signatures of the Israelis and the Lebanese.

Inflation Reduction Act from the United States, 400 billion U.S. dollar in terms of tax incentives in terms of subsidies for solar, wind, nuclear power, hydrogen, electric cars. In Europe, there is also a similar plan, which we call the Republic EU. In Japan, in China, India, governments are putting real money on the table to accelerate the clean energy, not necessarily for environmental climate reasons, but mainly for energy security reasons. They see that the Clean Energy Renewables or nuclear power or electric cars, they are an insurance for energy security. So another reason why we are seeing so much money put on the table by the governments the public spending growing so much is that the government's want to make sure that their economies are one of the frontrunners when it comes to the next chapter of the clean energy industry, in terms of battery manufacturing, in terms of hydrogen, in terms of the new nuclear technologies.
