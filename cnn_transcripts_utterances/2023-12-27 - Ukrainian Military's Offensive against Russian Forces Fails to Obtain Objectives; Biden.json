One of the things that Zaluzhnyi also talked about is the difficulty they are having in places like Mar'inka where there is really heavy fighting going on. I want to listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GENERAL VALERY ZALUZHNYI, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES (through translator):  The methodology is exactly the same as it was in Bakhmut. Street after street is destroyed, block after block our fighters are buried, and then we have what we have. So again, this is war. And the fact that we have now withdrawn to the outskirts of Mar'inka and in some places have already equipped positions behind Mar'inka, there is nothing in this that can cause any public outcry there.

Officials tell me that these asks include, for example, movingmigrants who are in the northern border of Mexico south. It also includes controlling railways, which are often used by migrants to more quickly get to the U.S. southern border, and providing incentives for migrants in Mexico to avoid that irregular migration to the U.S. southern border. And all of this an extension of that phone call between President Biden and the Mexican president just last week to provide some relief to these border towns which are growing increasingly restless. To give you a sense of the numbers here, in the seven-day average for December was 9,600 encounters. Compare that to the month prior, and it was about 6,800. So clearly, the numbers have continued to grow. And it remains a pressing challenge for President Biden who started the year in Mexico talking about migration and how best to handle it with his Mexican counterpart.

Ron Dermer, a member of Israel's war cabinet, met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. A White House official tells CNN they discussed the need for Israel to focus on high value Hamas targets, ways to improve the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, and the future of Gaza after the war. This comes as Israel says it's intensifying operations in Gaza despite the growing international pressure to change its tactics.Joining us now, former spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, a former director of the White House National Security Council, Hagar Chemali. I appreciate your time this morning. To start with, when you heard Ron Dermer was going to be physically in Washington meeting with the top two deputies for President Biden, what did you think? HAGAR CHEMALI, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE U.S. MISSION TO THE U.N.: Well, first, it was a blast from the past, because when I was at the White House we used to be on the phone with Ron Dermer almost daily.",

And he was very adept at the White House system, the Washington, D.C., circuit, and we had this very close relationship with him.So when I heard that, my first thought was, wow, nostalgia right there. But also, it's important because, while they are probably talking to him daily as it is, for the meetings to actually happen in person means that these are going to be working meetings where they are going to sit down and strategize, and the U.S. is going to press Ron Dermer very hard on what it sees as its national security interests.

And I was at the White House when we had numerous disagreements about other conflicts, about other general issues, about the peace process at the time. And the issue is that we have a close enough relationship where we can press them. That doesn't necessarily mean they will always do what the U.S. says, and they are not very receptive when being ordered. But they are receptive to the U.S. perspective. They pay attention to the U.S. perspective in general. And we have an ability to shift it.Now, Ron Dermer specifically is quite stubborn and difficult, and, yes, has gone against wishes of the U.S. government, particularly under the Obama administration when I was there. He was the one who orchestrated Netanyahu's address to Congress against the Iran deal at the time. So there is a little bit of bad blood there. But not entirely. At the same time, we work with everyone. He is somebody that the United States works with very closely. But I would say that those meetings, it is the greatest chance to influence decisions because Dermer has the greatest influence on Netanyahu's decision-making.

That's how Trump would want to win the -- run the race. Now, if I'm Joe Biden to try to get people to remember that the Trump years weren't all that calm, and that they were chaotic as well. The problem is right now, if you look at the polling, a lot of people are having nostalgia for the Trump years, particularly on the economy. And so that's Biden's challenge is to try to get people to remember that, hey, this wasn't as good. This wasn't as good as you think it was or that you remember it being. On the word cloud, by the way. The word that jumps out to me, frankly, is power. Because I think one of the Republican arguments this year is that Biden is too weak. He is too weak to control the border. He's too weak to manage these international crises situations that we have popping up everywhere. He is too weak to control inflation, you know, so it's really less about here's my policy prescription and more about, you know, you're just too weak to do anything about any of these problems, and we have to eliminate that.

Donald Trump himself, if you'll remember, in 2016, almost released zero ads. He relied completely on earned media, now they know that's not an option this time around.

However, we can note that senior advisers on both campaigns are in communication, the two of them Ramaswamy and Trump have sat down on multiple occasions. And Trump, I am told really likes them.
