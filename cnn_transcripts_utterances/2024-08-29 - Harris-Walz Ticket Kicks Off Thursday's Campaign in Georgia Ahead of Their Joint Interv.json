New polling shows Kamala Harris with an ever so slight lead in the crucial swing state that President Joe Biden won by less than 12,000 votes four years ago.(VIDEO PLAYING) Fresh off their high from the Democratic National Convention, Vice President and her running mate Tim Walz are on a bus tour through southern Georgia where they visited a high school band and a barbecue joint. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is getting a boost from Georgia's governor despite their testy relationship. Brian Kemp will appear at a Trump fundraiser in Atlanta later today, even though the former president has repeatedly insulted him after losing Georgia in the 2020 election. Well meanwhile, new polling suggests Harris may be gaining an edge on Trump in Georgia and other battleground states in the so-called Sun Belt of the US. The survey from Fox News finds there's no clear leader in the overall race when the 3 percent margin of error is taken into account. Still, these new Harris figures on the right point to a stronger showing against Trump when compared to how President Joe Biden was doing in April when he was still the Democratic nominee. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is traveling with the Harris campaign and has this report from Savannah, Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Essentially, France is arguing that Pavel Durov is responsible for the content and activities happening on his platform. They've launched this formal investigation and I just want to detail what investigators are looking at. I know we have a list to pull up for you. Complicit in aiding fraudsters and drug traffickers, helping people spread child pornography, and also this platform has come under scrutiny for its use by terrorists and far-right extremists. So these are all the potential avenues that France could dig into when it is building this case against Pavel Durov. Now you've mentioned, of course, he has not been formally charged. It has just been deemed that there is enough there for French prosecutors to carry out their investigation. He is required to stay in the country under judicial supervision. He has a bail set at five million euros and is required to report to the French police twice a week. So very strict measures there. This has of course sparked this free speech debate as well, Rosemary, with supporters of Pavel Durov saying, including Telegram of course, saying that it is absurd that he would be responsible for the content and activities on his platform. Durov himself of course would say, I can't be held accountable for the private conversations that happen virtually behind closed doors on Telegram. And you also of course have Russia, the Russian government has been speaking out in favor of Durov describing this again as a censorship issue, as a free speech issue. Much of that is because of how important Telegram is to Russia. It is extremely popular there. It is also used as military communications during this conflict in Ukraine. So it plays that role as well. But France standing firm here after this huge arrest earlier this week, now launching this investigation holding Pavel Durov in France and setting a bail, making this massive step forward to hold to account a man whose platform has been used according to France for these very horrific criminal activities from terrorists communicating on the platform to child pornography, to the sale of drugs, all of that being looked into now.",

Journalists and lawyers are carefully reading the judgment to find out just what it means for working reporters. I mean, are there new media guidelines? Are there new red lines for journalists, especially local reporters?During the trial, we heard some interesting comments from the senior counsel, Audrey Yu, who said that she said reporting a murder doesn't mean the press is in support of the murder and she said that the prosecution had to prove seditious intent so ultimately with the judge in this case ruling against \"Stand News\" it suggests that reporting on anti-government activity can be seen as support for such activities and that's a worrying development for all journalists here in Hong Kong.

Appreciate it.A new advisory from the U.S. Surgeon General warns that parental stress is a significant public health issue. It calls for a shift in policy and cultural norms and changes in the ways to support parents. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy spoke to CNN about some of the major issues that parents are facing. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: How to manage social media and technology and phones in your kid's life. How to contend with a loneliness epidemic in a youth mental health crisis that's taking a profound toll on millions of kids. And also how to deal with issues like gun violence, which are really a source of so much fear for parents and kids. Keep in mind, more than half of kids are worried now about a shooting taking place in their school. You put all of this together with one other critical factor, and that's this intensified culture of comparison that we're all living in that's really potentiated and fed by social media and the online environment where parents are looking around them and comparing themselves to sometimes hundreds of other parents, some of whom they know, some of whom they don't know, but they often come away feeling worse about themselves and like they're falling short as parents.
