He said that was really an anchor and a weight on the vice president.But interesting, many, many questions about how she responded or didn't respond to the trans ad. That was one of the Trump campaign's most successful from their view, spots that they put out. And they said that they had a few ads that they devised and they ran them through focus groups, but they didn't think that they responded well enough. So they didn't use them because it was in the vice president's own words. That is a decision that was made. There's still a lot of uncertainty about why this was made. Was it the right call or not?

She got on it, but a little bit late. And I was talking to Democrats in the aftermath who said that two things stood out to them, the amount of people that believed those anti-trans ads, people who were in their own communities and the fact that she didn't respond to them, and also the amount of people that believed that Democrats were out to touch on things like electric vehicles and gas powered cars.

But, it's something that I think Democrats haven't figured out yet in terms of how do they run against a candidate like Trump and not being as cautious and not running as traditional of a campaign as both parties had basically up until the last 10 years. And they're going to have to figure that out, especially with the new way that people get their information because they just don't get it in the old ways anymore.

So now, in these elections, of course, it looked like a package deal. Musk and Trump were riding high together. Musk was instrumental, I think, to Trump's victory.

And from talking to one of his friends for the story, it's clear that that his mission, his ultimate goal has not changed and he sees his role, whatever that role may look like, in the future Trump Administration as a path to achieving that goal eventually or more quickly than he otherwise would.The clearest advantage would be regulatory hurdles that have been put in front of Musk and his companies in their ambitions. I think that's certainly something that Musk might expect in his relationship with the Trump Administration in the future. But, on many things, their views, their agendas don't align.
