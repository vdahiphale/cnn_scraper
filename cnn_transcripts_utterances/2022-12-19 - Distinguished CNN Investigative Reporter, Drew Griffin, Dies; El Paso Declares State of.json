We're waiting the see if they have anything new.But then there's that big moment of what they do with these possible criminal referrals that they are expecting to want to ask the Justice Department to pursue. We already know where the committee stands on a lot of this. They showed their cards in federal court even previously when they were pursuing John Eastman's emails, that election attorney for Donald Trump. And they basically said quite clearly that they believed that Donald Trump was working on a conspiracy to defraud the United States, that's sort of that disinformation campaign, and then obstruction of a congressional proceeding. That's the sort of stuff where the people around Trump, Trump himself, would have been trying to put pressure on Mike Pence. Insurrection, of course, that would be a big, a new thing if the committee chose to make a criminal referral on that. That we would expect to see them trying to connect Trump to the rioters themselves, the people that broke into Congress. Remember this is Congress investigating themselves.

Just think about it. Take a step back. This committee after months and months of voluminous research, interviewing 1,000 witnesses or more, is telling the United States public that we believe we need to criminally refer a former president for trying to obstruct a free and fair election, effectively orchestrating a coup. And that is remarkable when you think about it. He was trying to keep himself in office. And it has already affected the public, I believe, to a certain degree.

Earlier Musk faced serious backlash claiming abruptly suspended several journalists, including CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, claiming they doxed him by posted links to an account that shared information about his private plane. Then Twitter implemented a new policy to prevent users from sharing links and user names from other social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter competitor Mastodon. Less than 24 hours later, there was an about-face, a big one, of course, as Twitter deleted that policy.Before he asked his Twitter policies to decide his future, which he does say he will abide by, Musk was spotted at the World Cup with Jared Kushner. Here to talk about all of this and the results of this is CNN's media analyst and \"Axios\" reporter Sara Fischer.

You'll recall that he put out a poll to ask whether or not he should bring Donald Trump back. The conclusion of that poll was to bring him back, and so he did, in fact, say Donald Trump could return. So I think that Elon Musk is eventually going to step down as the CEO of Twitter.

The Mayor saying that based on what he is hearing from the experts that we could see at least another 1,000 asylum seekers arriving here in New York City a week, that is on top of the numbers that we have been seeing lately, which is still a decrease from what we saw earlier this summer.
