The push for electric vehicles is something that has ruled UAW and one of the things that they've criticized Biden over.So they have withheld their endorsement of Biden for now. I think part of that there is they're trying to get more of a commitment from Biden as they head into these critical labor negotiations, but it's certainly not a constituency that Democrats can take advantage, take for granted.",
