There is growing concern on the safety of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, details from the ground, next.Also ahead, eight people killed in a mass shooting in Texas. We're learning new details about the gunman and the final day of King Charles coronation weekend is here. And look at the best moments and how it's gone for the new monarch and his family. Ukraine shaken after a night of intense air attacks, the military reports dozens of Russian strikes across the country. Some drones were intercepted over Kyiv but debris still caused heavy damage. One person was killed in a missile strike in Odessa. Pro-Moscow officials say a Russian controlled area Zaporizhzhia is under fire by Ukraine 1600 people have been evacuated there.",

      "sentences": "Max, across the front line here in the south, we are seeing evidence of what Russian officials called for on Friday, which is a significant evacuation of civilians from some of the frontline towns. In fact, some towns even that way past the frontline deeper inside Russian occupied territory.It's another indication of the pressure. They're feeling perhaps a head off or perhaps in the opening stages of Ukraine's counter offensive and suggests possibly a Russian Military, which, according to some Ukrainian officials, maybe using parts of that civilian evacuation to withdraw some of their forces too. We'll have to see what the overall impact of these evacuations are on Russia's ability to hold on to these frontline towns important to remember too, that if they lose this initial front, there may not be an awful lot of defensive positions in terms of in tight side territory for Russia to try and push the Ukrainians back from. But Russia's continued response to this drumbeat of Ukraine's counter offensive is to launch strikes against major Ukrainian population centers, increasingly not that effective as they could be because of the air defenses we're seeing in play. But last night 35 drones are launched against Kyiv alone, all of them shut down. We are told by Ukrainian officials but still because of the falling debris and wreckage five people injured on the ground there. And in a desert, the key Southern Port City, eight missiles were launched at that city hitting a variety of targets. Also we are told that a one individual was killed and night watchman in a warehouse that was struck. So Russia continuing to use these overnight or daily ways of drones and missiles to try an exact price on civilians across Ukraine for what we're beginning to feel here is a slow sense of momentum. For perhaps the early stages of Ukraine's counter offensive Russia for its parts, putting up some extraordinary signals too in the past three or four days. We heard the Wagner Head Yevgeny Prigozhin over the weekends and after say that he was going to leave Bakhmut if he did not receive extra munitions supplies, essentially artillery shells for his forces using the backdrop of some of his own recently deceased fighters mercenaries to make that particular point, saying that they essentially had died because of a lack of Russian munitions for his forces. He said he was leaving in the middle of this week, and then dramatically just reversed that decision, saying that he in fact, got everything that he wanted. Now, we have no idea what the truth of all this is it could be Yevgeny Prigozhin having a conversation with in himself in public. But certainly, what we can take away from this remarkably dramatic episode is there is this sense, certainly within Russia's ranks about how this war is being fought and the timing of this message, the blunt statement that a key part of Russia's fighting force and the vital for them City of Bakhmut would be leaving. Well, that can't do much for Russian morale, even deed. In fact, that damage has tried to be undone in the past hours by this dramatic reversal about Wagner staying in place. Russia, giving off curious messages about where it's willing to stay, who is willing to deploy, who is willing to arm and dissent inside its own ranks. Ukraine keeping relatively tight-lipped about its military maneuvers here, despite as I say indications from what Russian officials are saying that things may be beginning to get underway in terms of pressuring Russian forces. And still now here a remarkable amount of anticipation as to what Ukraine can achieve in the months ahead, given the Western backing, training and arming of this imminent counter offensive, Max.",

This has really opened for clients within the state that already has a history and has witnessed ethnic clashes between these communities over decades now.The easiest and simplest way perhaps to put the story into perspective and talk about the situation on the ground would be to say, Manipur is right now witnessing a fragile calm, that could break anytime. And that's the fear of the locals there. According to the Indian Army, they have the situation under control. 23,000 people displaced, you have more than 50 people dead and more than 200 injured. What's worrying is that these numbers have not come from the state government, Max. They've come from the Indian Army. They've come from the hospital authorities, we put straight questions to the Manipur government, and we asked them, you know the details of the death toll. They refuse to give us any answers. So what we did was the team went down to all the hospitals possible in in fall the state capital of Manipur to understand where the death toll stands. And officially it stands at least at 55. What we do know at this point is that the streets were deserted look, obviously an indication of the fragile calm that I've been talking to you about. The Indian Prime Minister has not really come out and said much right now. There's a state election down south, the opposition leaders have been criticizing him for focusing on that instead of what's happening in the Northeastern state of Manipur. But for now, what we know is that normalcy is returning at least that's what the Chief Minister of Manipur is saying. But of course, it's going to take a while before these citizens, these civilians can once again gain the trust of the people around them in terms of this conflict that they're facing between the two communities. And more importantly, the state government has to invest more time and assure these people on the ground that they will not be a repeat of this violence because that's what they really, really fearing at this point, Max.",
