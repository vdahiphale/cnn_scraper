Well, tonight, Liz Cheney standing side by side with Kamala Harris in Wisconsin and officially endorsing Harris for president. The Republican encouraged Republicans and independents to join her, and she listed many reasons why she's voting against Donald Trump.

And the reality is, obviously, J.D. Vance had a very good performance on Tuesday. I think he impressed many people that weren't expecting for him to do as well as he did.

If you look at polling and talk about what actually authoritarianism actions are, 40 percent of Americans are perfectly fine with it.

So, I'm worried that you're going to wind up not with Trump but with J.D. Vance as president.And J.D. Vance, I think, is not yet tested. A year and a half in the Senate, people say Obama, he did four years, and people say he wasn't ready.
