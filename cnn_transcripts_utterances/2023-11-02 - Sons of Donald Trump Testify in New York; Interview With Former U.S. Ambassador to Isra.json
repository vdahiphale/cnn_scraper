Israel has the right and the obligation to defend itself and, again, to try to make sure that what happened never happens again.No country, no country, not the United States, not anyone else that I can think of, would tolerate the slaughter of its civilians. So we stand behind that, and we stand behind the proposition. But, as democracies, the United States, Israel, other democracies, have a responsibility to do everything possible to protect civilians who may be caught in harm's way. And this, again, is a crossfire, quite literally, of Hamas' making. The fact that it, cynically and monstrously, deliberately, has people, men, women, and children, as human shields puts its command posts, puts its leadership, puts its fighters, puts its weapons, puts its munitions underneath hospitals, or even inside them, schools, mosques makes this incredibly challenging. But we have to rise to that responsibility. And so we will be talking about concrete steps that can and should be taken to minimize harm to men, women and children in Gaza. And this is something that the United States is committed to. I'm not going to get into the details here, but it's very much on the agenda. When I see a Palestinian child, a boy, a girl, pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child in Israel or anywhere else. So this is something that we have an obligation to respond to, and we will.",

But he did say that how Israel does this matters. He says that steps need to be taken to protect civilians, because he said that civilians are bearing the brunt of this action. Notably, the secretary of state saying that seeing children pulled from the rubble hits him in the gut. He also talked about focusing on getting humanitarian aid into Gaza while getting foreign nationals and U.S. citizens out. And, notably, he not only talked about discussions regarding the current situation in Gaza, but also the future, the secretary of state saying, we need to be focused on the day after, referring, of course, to a two-state solution, saying that he believes that may be the best and only way to secure peace, not only for Israel, but for Palestinians as well.",

He wants to get an update from the Israelis on their military operation, on the objectives inside Gaza, but, importantly, he wants to reiterate to them that they need to be taking all steps possible to be trying to protect civilians there. Now, he also said that a key part of their conversations is going to be getting sustained aid into Gaza. Right now, the number of trucks going in is around 50 to 60 a day, but he has said that he wants that number to get up to 100 trucks a day and for it to be sustained. So that's also going to be a key part of these discussions. But really interestingly here, he seems to be very focused on not only what is going on right now, but what the endgame is. What happens if and when Hamas is eliminated? That is a Israel's stated goal. Who is going to govern the Gaza Strip? And how is a durable and sustainable peace going to be achieved? He said that that is going to be a topic of discussion as well, because he said that what he wants to see, what the U.S. wants to see is two states for two people. And he said that remains the best guarantor of a secure Jewish and democratic Israel and Palestinians for the state that they are entitled to. So there's going to be a lot on the agenda for him here, a lot of tough conversations that he's going to have with the Israelis about protecting civilians. But, as you mentioned, he did reiterate multiple times that the U.S. believes that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas.",

Melissa Bell is in Cairo for us. She's been monitoring the situation at the Rafah Crossing. So, Melissa, given these remarks from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, what have you been hearing about what's happening on the ground, as we learn that some Americans have been able to get out?",

      "sentences": "That's right.We have seen a few dozen Americans, Boris, now able to get to the Egyptian side of the Rafah Crossing. Of course, that is hugely important and what we understand is going to happen is that that's going to continue. In fact, the latest list that was published, nearly 600 names of those who are meant to be allowed out today, included 400 Americans. [13:10:02] So that's a large amount. But remember that this is a fairly chaotic process, not just the opacity with which it is decided who on any specific day can get out. And this is a question for Israel, Hamas, and Egypt to consider on a case-by-case basis. There's a whole vetting procedure. But then, of course, on the other side, the chaos of trying to get families or those whose names might be on the list that day to the Rafah Crossing and to make them even aware that their name is on that list that day. And remember that, just yesterday, we saw another sort of Internet and communications blackout. Very difficult to reach anyone inside or for families outside to reach their loved ones. Still, several dozen now have made their way out. And I think it's significant that what they bring with them are tales of what's been going on inside. And that's going to continue over the coming days. As for the aid that Secretary Blinken was just mentioning there, they are -- there are a few trucks going through the Rafah Crossing each day. What we have understood from the time that we have spent up there is that part of the difficulty, what is slowing down the process are the Israeli checks on the other side. That is unlikely to change, Secretary Blinken making clear there that they're going to bring pressure to bear to make sure that more trucks get in. But, just to be clear, the number of trucks that have gotten in now since this conflict began is still fewer trucks than would have gotten in on any day before it did. So that gives you an idea of the huge lack of humanitarian aid and the needs that are inside. There's going to be such a huge shortfall to make up for. And, in the meantime, you're talking about lack of water, lack of food, no sanitation, fairly chaotic conditions. And that is even before you deal with the wounded. The other handful of people who've been allowed out through the Rafah Crossing are some of the most wounded Palestinians. And, as we understand it, there have been several dozen more today. And that also is likely to continue over the coming days, Boris.",

And, in particular, over the last couple of days, much of the world has really been struck by those images of the enormous craters in the Jabalia refugee camp, where Israel says it was targeting, in one case, a senior Hamas commander, in another case, terrorist infrastructure underneath residential buildings. But, in both cases, what we saw were a number of civilian casualties, including women and children. But another focus of this visit, of course, will be the state of Israel's ground offensive. And over the last day, we have learned from the chief of staff of Israel's military that Israeli forces are inside of Gaza City operating in what he described as very significant areas within that city. The day before, we heard that Israeli forces were at the gates of that city, which is Hamas' stronghold here in Northern Gaza. But what's also become clear, particularly to us from our vantage point here with Gaza just right over my shoulder, is the fact that, even as Israeli forces move in on Gaza City, which is south of here, there is still very, very intense fighting ongoing between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, including the city right behind me, Beit Hanoun, which is the northeasternmost city in Gaza City. All throughout the day, we have been hearing artillery fire, mortar rounds going off inside the Gaza Strip, as well as ongoing gun battles between forces. We have been hearing small-arms fire and machine guns throughout the day. And that tells us what you need to know about the danger that those tunnels that Hamas has underground present to Israeli forces entering the Gaza Strip. We know that, last night, overnight, Israeli forces in the north were indeed ambushed by Hamas fighters, most likely using those underground tunnels. And so it's clear that even as Israeli forces move in on Gaza City, they are still dealing with some very intense fighting here in the north and facing the very real danger that Hamas fighters could pop up behind them.",

So, Israel has an obligation, a very clear obligation, to eliminate the threat of Hamas. Number two, there's no question Israel also has an obligation to make sure as best as humanly possible in a war to protect innocent people. That is the secretary's -- what he will -- message he will give. It's what President Biden said last night. And I think it's important for you to understand as well is, what the secretary said on the tarmac just a minute ago at Andrews is, we got to use this opportunity to also be clear, we need a vision of not only to get a two-state solution done, to get a Saudi deal done, to make sure that we're thinking about the next coming weeks.
