The Federal Reserve just moments ago, releasing its autopsy on what caused last month's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Let's get some important insights from the Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi. Mark, grateful for your time today. The Fed just released this autopsy and it says the SVB board management just failed to manage obvious risks. It said there were 31 unaddressed red flags, essentially, safe and soundness supervisory warnings. That's triple the average. They said of the pier banks. That the Fed, though, it also says the Fed has some blame here, did not fully appreciate the vulnerabilities and the Fed. That the Fed insisting that Silicon Valley Bank, Mark, was an outlier. But if the Fed was asleep at the switch, my words, not the autopsy words, do you worry? Is there another one out there, or are they right? It's just Silicon Valley Bank? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well, I think Silicon Valley was an outlier and a number of really key respects, John. I mean, almost all of the deposits that they have are two folks with -- that were large, big companies. They were uninsured deposits, which is very, very unusual for a bank. Also, they invested a lot of those deposits in treasury and mortgage- backed securities that lost a lot of value when interest rates have risen over the past year. And those losses weren't -- are called hedged. They -- it didn't offload any of that risk to the rest of the financial system. And all other banks, most other banks, in fact, do that. So I think there is -- it's fair to say that SVB was kind of out there very, very different from most other banking institutions. Now having said that, you know, there is -- banking system obviously, is under a lot of stress given the run up in interest rates and the losses that that's created for them. And so the system is under, you know, a fair amount of pressure. But I do think SVB is kind of out there.",

And a lot of people on Wall Street, a lot of people in your business are worried that the politicians are worried about politics and not worried about the math, if you will. You just -- your previous reports thought this would be about mid-August by the time we hit crisis time. Now you believe it could be in early June, which is right around the corner.
