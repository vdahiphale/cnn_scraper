I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Donald Trump is indicted again, this time in Georgia. The former president is facing 13 felony charges for trying to overturn his 2020 election laws in the state. 18 co-defendants are also charged, including Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and his former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. They're all facing RICO Racketeering charges, traditionally used to prosecute mafia bosses and gang leaders. Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, ordered Trump and his alleged co-conspirators to turn themselves in by next Friday. This is Trump's 4th criminal indictment. He is now facing a total of 91 charges in Georgia, Florida, New York and Washington, D.C. Here now to discuss is Darryl Cohen, former Fulton County assistant district attorney. Welcome to the program form Atlanta, Darryl. Great to have you on. So, this was a sweeping large indictment here and also narrow in scope. We'll get through to the details in a moment, but it's also something we've been waiting for, for about two years now, from this district attorney. What do you make of the charges and the fact that it's not just Donald Trump but you have 19 included -- including Donald Trump who have been charged?",

The fact thatthere are 19 people helps Fani Willis, who is the elected D.A. in Fulton County, make this a RICO or a Racketeering charge, makes this easier for her to prosecute crimes that took place outside of Atlanta, Fulton County, Georgia but still in the State of Georgia. So, that is not surprising and it gives her the opportunity to go after a lot more people. Now, the fact that there are 19 people indicted tells me they are looking for some throwaways. They are hoping and expecting that one or more of these people will turn states evidence, will testify against a co- defendant, Donald Trump. And the more that they could put pressure on people, the more likely he or she or they will say to themselves, do I really want to put myself in jeopardy, do I really want to put myself in jeopardy of going to prison? The answer is no. So, I will do whatever it takes to keep myself a free person.",

There have been other cases where there have been a couple of others that have been indicted, and the former president in some of these cases is paying for their legal defense. In this case, it would be rather difficult for the former president to pay for all 19 -- or all 18 others that have been charged here.",

You need to change 11,780 votes so I could be the winner of the electoral votes in Georgia and I can be re- elected as president.

That just depends on what the facts are and what we are looking at. But in the state charges, they're very different from the federal charges that Jack Smith is prosecuting but then they're very much the same, saying they're trying to overturn what the public, what the voters, the registered voters did by doing whatever is necessary to keep Donald Trump in the office of the presidency.",

And no, the government of the State of Georgia does not have the power to pardon anyone, it has to be the state border parts and paroles, and I believe it is after five years.

There was hope. Expectations were high. We were cheering in the streets of Kabul. But 20 years later, Afghanistan was basically, you know, given to them.

And Taliban get their power or they find their existence, the movement's existence based on suppression of women, which has no place in Islam or no definition in our culture. And therefore, I think there should be some level of accountability to those who actually commit serious human rights violation, including crimes against humanity and gender apartheid. I think these international organizations should rarely be used. This is the time. If they are not used now as a means of leverage, as a means of pressure.

So, this must continue because people need it. But on the other hand, I mean, Taliban claimed that they have improved the economy, the economic prosperity is there, that there are benchmarks on the fight against corruption. So, why they are not feeding the people of Afghanistan? They have a good division of labor. They want the rest of the world to feed the people of Afghanistan and they want to pay their soldiers money from the money that they claim to increase from domestic revenue. So, I think it's time to hold also Taliban accountable for delivering to the people. If they are a power, if they are de facto authoritarian, if they are claiming that they have increased domestic revenue, that they are signing contracts right and left with neighboring countries who have a different approach in this -- in the whole situation, they need to also, you know, use that money to feed people of Afghanistan. But as I said before, I think without changing the political situation and ensuring that there is a government, which is not only Taliban government, but the government of people, some sort of people's legitimacy is important, inclusion of all segments of society is important, you know, referring to people in terms of what they want is important.

Three and a half years have gone by and the animal or animals from which the virus closelyresembling this may have spilled over haven't been found. The animal hasn't been identified. But to take that as significant or even suspicious requires an ignorance of the history of emerging viruses. As I say in the piece, finding the animal host, the natural animal reservoir of the original SARS virus from 2003, that took 15 years. Marburg virus spilled over into humans back in 1967 and it took 42 years for science to identify the natural host of that, the Egyptian fruit bats. Ebola first filled over -- was recognized in humans in 1976 and we still don't know what the natural host of the Ebola virus is. So, if you are lucky, you can solve that mystery in a short time.

Chinese scientists, some of them, have risked their careers and even their freedom to share information with their western scientific colleagues. But Chinese officialdom has stopped the flow of evidence in a way that has contributed to suspicions about Chinese motives. I point out in the piece, though, that Chinese officialdom would have an incentive to cover-up evidence of a lab leak. But Chinese officialdom would also have incentive, motive to cover-up evidence of a spillover from illegally traded wild animals in the Huanan market in the City of Wuhan.

The authors of that scientific article, EddieHolmes, Kristian Andersen, Robert Garry, Ian Lipkin, and Andrew Rambo were conferring with one another from different parts of the world, trying to figure out what the genome of this virus told them about where it may have come from. And they found two peculiar features, unexpected features. One called a receptor binding domain that allows the virus to latch on to a cell and infect it, and the other is a thing called a furin cleavage site which allows the virus to penetrate the cell, insert its genome. They were unexpected. So, these five fellas were saying, where do these things, these features come from? And a fellow named Jeremy Farrar, a public health official, head of a vast foundation, a health research foundation, Wellcome Trust, convened this phone call, and there were more than a dozen people on this call, including Tony Fauci, including Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, including the scientist I just mentioned and a number of other scientists. So, the arguments about whether these fellows were manipulated, were pressured to call this a natural spillover revolved around that phone call. And I've talked to all five of those scientists about the phone call, I've talked with Tony Fauci about the phone call, I've talked with some other people who were on the phone call. International scientists, such as Christian Drosten in Germany and Marion Koopmans in the Netherlands, and they were discussing this question of where this virus came from, where these two features came from. The critics say that Tony Fauci and Francis Collins pressured these people to say it was a natural spillover and not a lab leak. I don't find that persuasive at all, partly because I don't see how Tony Fauci or Francis Collins are going to pressure an internationally renowned scientist who is British Australian working in Sydney, Australia, Marion Koopmans is in the Netherlands, Christian Drosten is in Germany.
