We know that this is something that prosecutors have looked at in the past. We are now learning, our team, from sources familiar with the matter, that prosecutors have been asking witnesses about this meeting more recently, including Rudy Giuliani.Let's just take a look at some of the folks who were in this December Oval Office meeting. There are people that you might expect to be there, people like Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, people like Pat Cipollone, White House counsel, and then there are people like Patrick Byrne, the former Overstock CEO. Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn, these election deniers. And in this meeting, they are discussing these wild ideas, like using the military to seize voting machines, like imposing martial law, like making Sidney Powell a special counsel. And this meeting was a big focus of the House select committee investigating January 6th. We got some very unvarnished opinions from those committee interviews about what people thought of the meeting. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the question is, were White House lawyers providing legal advice and saying to members of the Trump campaign or the Trump orbit, you can't do that, what you are doing is going to do violate the law.

It was, when I broke the news that it happened the day after it took place, my colleague, Jonathan Swan, wrote the definitive piece about what took place in that meeting a couple of months later. This has been central in part not just because of what was said in the meeting, but it was a few hours before Trump tweeted for people to be in D.C., his supporters, on January 6th, 2021 and said, will be wild.

When there was news that the Russians might be using it admittedly against civilians, your then-press secretary said this might be considered war crimes. What made you change your mind and decide to give them these weapons?JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Two things, Fareed. I know it was a very difficult decision on my part. And, by the way, I discussed this with our allies, I discussed this with our friends up on the Hill, and we are in a situation where Ukraine continues to be brutally attacked across the board by munitions, by these cluster munitions that have dud rates that are very, very low -- I mean, very high, that are dangerous to civilians, number one. Number two, the Ukrainians are running outs of ammunition, the ammunition -- they call them 155 millimeter weapons. This is a war relating to munitions. And they are running out of that ammunition and we are low on it. And so what I finally did, I took the recommendation of the Defense Department to not permanently but to allow for in this transition period where we have more 155 weapons, these shells, for the Ukrainians, to provide them with something that has a low dud rate. It's about -- I think it's 150, which is the least likely to be blowing. And it's not used in civilian air areas that are trying to get through those tranches and those -- and stop those tanks from rolling. And so -- but it was not an easy decision and it's not -- we're not signatories of that agreement, but it took me a while to be convinced to do it. But the main thing is they either have the weapons to stop the Russians now from there -- keeping them from stopping the Ukrainian offensive through these areas, or they don't. And I think they needed them. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It followed months of internal debate here at the White House, among the president's national security team. And, ultimately, that national security team was unanimous in recommending to the president that he take this step. And, clearly, it was a step taken out of necessity because Ukraine is running low on ammunition.Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, today described this as a bridge of supplies while the U.S. continues to ramp up its domestic manufacturing of more conventional artillery shells that it will ultimately provide to Ukraine. But it is a controversial decision, Wolf. More than 100 countries have banned the use of cluster munitions and the president, in fact, needed to make a determination that it was in the vital national security interest of the U.S., because of a U.S. law that prohibits transferring these munitions to other countries. And I asked Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, today about comments made by U.S. officials in the past, including saying that these weapons have no place on the battlefield. Here is part of his response to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you very much.Right now, let's bring in CNN Contributor on Russian Affairs Jill Dougherty and CNN Military Analyst, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, now that Ukraine will be receiving these U.S.-made cluster bombs, how will they leverage those weapons in their counteroffensive right now while limiting serious collateral damage? You can see in this video of a Russian attack on Kharkiv, the bombs don't always detonate immediately. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, that's going to be a big challenge for them, Wolf. But the basic premise behind the Ukrainian effort to get cluster munitions is that they will use them against the trenches that the Russians have drawn up all throughout the eastern front as well as the southern front. So, if they do that and if they limit the target area of those cluster munitions, they might be able to limit the civilian exposure to them once this war is over.",

And then, again, noting that the Ukrainians are using these weapons, this ammunition in Ukraine right now, leaving out the fact that Russia is. So, what they are doing is -- it's obviously part of the propaganda approach and just trying to take advantage of it and make the United States look very bad for making that decision.",

So, this issue of should Sweden join? Obviously, Finland already is. But Sweden is a big issue. And because there are differences in terms of Ukraine, whether Ukraine should ultimately be given any type of promise or indication that it could be a member, that's where the Russians are going to try to exploit as much as possible any type of division.So, what NATO is trying to do, obviously, is figure out how it can give security guarantees to Ukraine, which are crucial, and then how they can present something to Ukraine that would be forward-looking in terms of possible membership.",

That's a little bit lower than it was on the previous month.The industry is that really picked up steam where construction, health care as well, and government. These are the industries I really love the way in terms of these job numbers. But wages, though, Wolf, are still at about 4.4 percent from a year ago. That could be concerning to the Federal Reserve because when people make more in their paychecks they spend more and that could ultimately fuel inflation. But some good news, Wolf, working women labor force participation rate at a record 77.8 percent, there was some concern, Wolf, if you see there, the big dip over the pandemic, as millions of women left the workforce. People were concerned whether they would return. Well, Wolf, they certainly have, and they certainly have come back in greater numbers, Wolf.",
