Plus, more breaking news from our K-FILE. And Mike Huckabee, the man Trump wants to be his next ambassador to Israel. KFILE revealing Huckabee said, quote, there's really no such as a Palestinian. And China and Russia closer than ever and are they on a collision course with the U.S. CNN live in Moscow with the special report. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the breaking news, Trump preparing to oust three and four star generals. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting tonight that Trump's transition team is considering an executive order that would give Trump the power to oust three and four star generals from Vivian Salama at \"The Wall Street Journal\". And according to a draft of this order, which was reviewed by the WSJ, Trump would appoint a so-called \"warrior board\", and that board would have the power to fast track the removal of generals and admirals that are found to be, quote, lacking in requisite leadership qualities. Of course, the U.S. military, the most powerful in the world, is so powerful, in part because decisions about generals are made and promotions by a military structure yes. As the commander in chief, the president has authority to fire any officer at will, but this warrior board would circumvent the Pentagon's system that is already in place. And this talk of Trump ousting the four at will, former five star general -- sorry, three and four-star generals is consistent with what Trump has said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That person is Elon Musk.For the past week, the world's richest man has essentially set up shop inside Mar-a-Lago. According to new reporting from Axios. Musk is one of only a couple of confidants attending Trump's cabinet selection sessions. Trump reportedly embracing Musk's innovative and quirky ideas for restructuring the federal government. Musk is all in, posting online, I'm happy to be first buddy, and he's not just that. He's practically family. Look, he's in a Trump family photo. Also in this photo with Trump's granddaughter who posted Elon achieving uncle status. Of course, Musk's net worth has surged $70 billion in just the one week since Trump won the presidency. And much of Musk's wealth is wrapped in shares of Tesla. Investors are so bullish that Tesla is going to benefit from Musk's support of Trump, and frankly, this could just be the tip of the iceberg. Musk has businesses and electric cars, renewable energy, space travel, tunnels, satellites artificial intelligence, social media. He could be handed billions more in federal contracts. Just take SpaceX and Starlink. SpaceX has already received billions in contracts from the government, and that could grow under Trump. \"Fortune\" magazine reporting that Trump himself suggested awarding Musk's Starlink satellite service hefty contracts to provide new broadband service. And then there's Musk's Boring Company, which is all about building underground tunnels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erin. This is a room that really caters to the president-elect, which means a lot of TV screens and a lot of information. I am told that these are long tables in rooms that have been cordoned off inside Mar-a-Lago with curtains, although I was told by one member they were able to make contact -- eye contact with the former president, President-elect Trump at one point, so maybe not as private as they think.However, they are really giving Donald Trump, as one senior adviser called it a 360 view of every candidate. And there is a reason for that. The reason being that Donald Trump told people around him one, he wants to be completely involved in the process, and two, that there was some embarrassing moments in 2016 and 2017 when he would make a public backing for a particular candidate or a potential pick, and then learned later that this person had said a number of negative things about them, about him behind his back. So they're trying to avoid what one adviser said was any surprises? Donald Trump does not want to have anything that alarms him. So what this room looks like is essentially you have these TV screens that have the pictures, the bios of each of these candidates, but they also are playing tightly edited clips of each of these candidates. One thing that Donald Trump cares a lot about is television presentation. Can this person present in a way that is receptive or able to be received by outsiders, is this somebody who can communicate my message? And that's one thing that they're looking for. And not all of these TV clips or podcast clips are positive. Some of them have the negative things that people have said about Donald Trump or the more critical things, but it is just one indication of just how seriously they are taking this process and just how involved the president elect is this time around compared to what we saw in 2016.",

You heard Kristen's reporting, though, first on Elon Musk and the power that he has been getting increasingly in Trump's inner circle by Trump's side, weighing in on major decisions on that call with Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, which they said was a short social call, but it just shows the influence and the presence that he has. Does that concern you at this time at all? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Look, this is entirely the prerogative of President Trump. The American people elected him. He's responsible to the American people for his performance in office. He has unparalleled power by virtue of the Supreme Court, the Senate and probably the House of Representatives.

He even described the Palestinian identity in one of the clips he found as, quote, a political troll -- tool to try and force land away from Israel. Now, I first obtained these comments. Were about to hear when he ran for president in 2016. Just take a listen to them right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Basically, there really is no such thing as -- I need to be careful saying this, because people will really get upset -- there's really no such thing as a Palestinian. There's not. You have Arabs and Persians. And there's no such complexity in that. But there's really no such thing. That's been a political tool to try to force land away from Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP) BURNETT: Just obviously hugely significant. You're talking about it -- he would, if anything, take land from neighboring countries.

And this is what we got from a statement from Donald Trump. He said, Pete has spent his entire life as a warrior for the troops and for the country. He is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm America's enemies are on notice. Our military will be great again, and America will never back down. Then he goes a little bit into his biography. I will tell you a couple of things. I talked to a number of advisers in the last few minutes as this was unfolding. They said this they said that one, Pete has been an informal adviser to the former president, now president-elect, for a number of years. He did that while he was in office. He did it while he was out of office. The other thing I learned is that he was considered for a number of positions back in 2016, eventually got passed over. Now, obviously, he is going to serve as secretary of defense. This is a critical role for the former president, now president elect in this administration. We know that for example, Mike Waltz, was somebody who was also up for this job. Obviously, he is now going to be the national security adviser.
