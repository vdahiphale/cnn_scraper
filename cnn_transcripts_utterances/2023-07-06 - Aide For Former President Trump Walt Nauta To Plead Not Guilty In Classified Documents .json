Just hours from now Donald Trump's personal aide and alleged co-conspirator Walt Nauta is set to plead not guilty in the classified documents probe.

The second time around bad weather kept him from traveling to south Florida.Now, we expect his appearance in court at his arraignment later this morning to be brief. He is expected to plead not guilty to obstruction charges and to lying to federal investigators. Now, prosecutors say was Nauta who moved dozens of boxes that contained classified documents from a storage room at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort to other parts of the property, and that he lied about the entire thing. Prosecutors say that this was all in an effort to keep one of Trump's attorneys from finding these classified documents that been subpoenaed by a grand jury. Now, the federal government says that they have surveillance video, as you mentioned, of Nauta moving these boxes around the property before the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago for those classified documents. Nauta, who served as Trump's military valet, is his personal aide, and we're told he is expected in federal court in downtown Miami at his arraignment later this morning. In fact, Poppy and Victor, the two of them, the former president Trump as well as Nauta, have been together since essentially Trump's arraignment here in south Florida last month.

Everyone that's watching this space, there have been for the past few days people online trying to decide whether some sightings of a man who may or may not be Prigozhin are, in fact true, whether it was in Saint Petersburg or Moscow. There are some Internet sleuths that suggested they spotted a bodyguard that liked like the man who had always been with Prigozhin up until this mutiny.Listen, I still believe, I would not take out life insurance on this man is something that I said last week, and I stand by that. I don't believe he is long for this world. That doesn't mean he is in imminent danger in the next week or two or month. I think Vladimir Putin still doesn't know what to do with him. He was a huge value, an asset for him with Wagner for all of these years. Now it does seem to appear -- and listen, it doesn't matter whether he is in Belarus or Russia. These two are one and the same and he can extradite to Russia anytime he wanted to. So that wasn't something that I really paid much attention to in terms of where he was geographically. I think for Vladimir Putin, perhaps now is a time where he wants to focus on making Prigozhin irrelevant to the Russian people. What happened last week was a big shock to the system where you saw Russians greeting him and cheering him on as he was leaving Rostov. You saw for a short time his popularity, Prigozhin's actually go up. Since then, since the public speeches that we've heard from Vladimir Putin it has gone back down. And I think what you are seeing with these raids of his buildings and his homes and his office space is all meant to sort of emasculate him and to make him look smaller. They have taken control of Wagner away from him. So maybe now is an opportunity for Russians to perhaps not view him as the hero of war as he was presenting himself to be.",

It was something we gave you.Now it's a matter of time to see where these fighters go, if in fact the offers that Putin gave them, that he stands by them. Did some of these men go home?
