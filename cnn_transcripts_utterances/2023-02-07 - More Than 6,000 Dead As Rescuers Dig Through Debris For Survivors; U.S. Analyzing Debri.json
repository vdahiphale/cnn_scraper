I'm Abby Phillip in Washington.Right now, a desperate search for life, a race against time and an escalating death toll in Turkey and Syria. 41 hours have now passed since a powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake devastated the region. And experts say the critical window to find people alive in this rubble is now closing. More than 6300 people have died in this tragedy. And the scope of the destruction is must terrifying. Take a look at these buildings. They among thousands that have collapsed but amid grave discoveries there is still hope that keeps crews going. This little girl was rescued earlier today after being trapped for more than a day. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh just filed this report from the region. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (on camera): Here in Kahramanmaras, the town closest to the epicenter, there are two simultaneous rescue separations going on as light begins to draw in. In there, a 64-year-old woman. Her son heard her voice, he says, this morning. And he thinks she's in fact still lying in the bed where she was when the earthquake struck but they're patiently digging in there, taking a pillow for comfort. I think you can see over here some emerged, just being retrieved from the wreckage. A scene constantly unfolding around us here because there is a desperate local need for more government help and they're doing a lot of this themselves. The second rescue attempt that's happening is just up there, a 12- year-old boy has been found healthy in the rubble. And the rescuers are having to dig their way in slowly down towards. But let me just show you while we still have light here. Quite how far the devastation is. Very few of the apartment blocks in this area are standing. A building over there seems to have basically split and fallen in two. And here excavators and bare hands in turn being used to try and get to anybody who might still be alive because the hours are running short, the light is running out. It is bitterly cold. And you can see everywhere fires people have already lit to try and keep themselves warm in these conditions. They will just get worse as were the chances of them being able to pull their loved ones out. But it's startling to see people who were living here, quite in peace, just over 24 hours ago. Now one man I just spoke to, a testament to how people having to deal with their tragedies very much themselves, actually showed me the feet of his relative, whose body still trapped in the rubble. They tried to give it some dignity by covering it with a blanket. But stories like that, across the wreckage here. Just a small attempt there by some people to get under the wreckage and try and help somebody, it seems. Extraordinary bravery and persistence despite the lack of resources they all have around here. But just you get a feeling of quite how devastating that earthquake, probably the worst for about 100 years to hit Turkey or the region, the full force of it, taken by this part of this town here, utterly startling devastation.

And now on to the suspected spy balloon or what's left of it. China says that the debris belongs to Beijing and not the United States, even though they violated U.S. airspace. Officials are now analyzing the wreckage that's been fished from the Atlantic Ocean just off of the South Carolina coast but China has hinted that it wants this debris back. CNN's Carlos Suarez is in North Myrtle Beach for us. Carlos, what is the latest on the search that the crews have been undergoing for the last couple of days now? What's been recovered?",

The military earlier today put out several photos showing just some of the debris that's already been located a few miles off the coast of South Carolina.Now we are about 21 miles north of the main debris search site at an area that has become quite clear is being secured, is being prepared for the possibility that what is still out there at sea will most likely be brought to this location. We're talking about a boat ramp and a parking lot that the Navy has been using for the last three days to preposition a lot of their equipment, a lot of their personnel. Earlier today, this morning, we saw them bring out four boats that eventually made their way toward that search site. The crews they all had some pretty heavy equipment as well as some oxygen tanks. Now, in that actual debris site that's about a half-hour drive from where we are, we're told that crews there are using underwater equipment to scan the bottom of the ocean there to get a clearer picture of all of the debris that still remains. They want to get a good sense of what is out there, before they start the difficult process of getting all of that debris up on to a vessel that will either bring it to this location, we believe, or they might go ahead and just take it up to Quantico up in Virginia, where the FBI and other agencies are no doubt going to analyze every single piece of debris associated with this balloon -- Abby.",

      "sentences": "Yes, actually stayed at Camp David a couple hours longer than anybody expected him to. Yesterday, throughout the day today, hasn't had any public events. He's been working through last-minute edits, expected to go through a full rundown -- run-through of the remarks with his staff before he heads over to the Capitol tonight.Look, I think you really hit on a hey point here, and that's the number of people that are watching this. Obviously the in-person audience is 535 members of Congress, the Cabinet, top military officials. The real audience, the audience that the president wants to connect with here both in laying out what he's believes he's accomplished over those first two years in office, particularly on the legislative wins that he's had, but also laying out what he thinks he can accomplish going forward, and where the progress has been and where the job is not done, and why he believes, not just in the next two years, but perhaps the next six years, he's the one to be able to complete that job. Now, look, this will certainly be a speech that includes policy proposals. We can pull a couple of them up right now, talking about making permanent the Child Tax Credit, passing a law to ban certain junk fees. Really critical issues that the president has talked about in the past that probably don't have much of a bipartisan path forward. If you look at who will be joining the first lady to view the State of the Union address, you get another view into some of the critical components of the president's speech. Obviously the mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols as the president will address police reform in his speech. The Ukrainian ambassador who attended last year as well, essential component of the foreign policy elements of the president's speech. The hero in California in one of the latest mass shootings as gun control or the idea of banning assault weapons will be in the president's speech again. But I think it's more about the broader message here. And that, while the thematic consistency will certainly be there, the president attempting to connect about what's been done, what's happening right now, and what's possible going forward, it's the messages we're familiar with, Abby, but I think the broader country, those 30 plus million people I think the president wants to reach tonight, particularly as we wait for a potential reelection announcement in the weeks ahead.",

I mean, often on any given year, the State of the Union has one of the biggest audiences the president will have, certainly as we approach a presidential cycle.Phil, thank you so much for all of that. And let's keep the conversation going now with Geoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor of Georgia, and Nayyera Haq, the former White House senior director under President Obama. So, Nayyera, I wanted to ask you, I mean, Phil was just talking about this balance between the accomplishments, the progress, and what is left to be done. How do you think President Biden is going to tackle that? NAYYERA HAQ, FORMER WHITE HOUSE SENIOR DIRECTOR, 2014-2016: Well, he's certainly going to tout the fact that he is coming into the State of the Union address with a record strong economy, unemployment low across all indicators and for all demographics, but he still has some work that has not been done. He had promised coming in that he would pay particular attention to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Just two weeks ago we saw another black man killed at the hands of police. And we once again saw two black senators, Tim Scott the Republican, Cory Booker the Democrat, talking about the need for comprehensive police reform but they have that sticking point, qualified immunity, that Republicans still haven't been able to move passed. So how is he going to be Biden the uniter, the one who will lead the country forward, the one who has strong relationships with Republicans in the past, while also being a president who can help us heal from racial trauma and division?",

He is in my sense under pressure taking adversarial tone with Biden. I'm curious about what you think we can expect from the kind of tone of the room, the optics of it all.

But the new polling shows just 41 percent of Americans say that they're not as well off as they were before Biden was president. And only 16 percent say that they are better off. So unemployment is down, jobs are up. But are you worried that the Biden's victory tone on those metrics will not address what you're seeing in those poll numbers?",

It's no longer about gas prices, it's about household goods and the fact that the dollar just doesn't simply go as far as it used to. And that people feel that when they do their weekly grocery shopping. That's going to be the challenge that he has managed to so far navigate by his tone, by his compassion, and the personality that he's able to bring to the table and connect with the American public.That's it's not about the numbers, it's about the delivery at that point. And he has also tied that to that broader sense of stability. That coming into this administration it felt like there was chaos. We have now dealt with pandemic issues, we have come out a potential recession, mitigated for that. So what's next? Right? Are we out of this threat to democracy? Is there going to be accountability for an insurrection that we all saw unfold. This is part of the legacy of the Biden administration that he's going to be teeing up for the next two years.",

His approval numbers are still kind of low 40s but it just strikes me, this is sort of the narrative that we had going into the midterm elections and Democrats kind of overperformed.

The performance of what does he actually say. That seems to be pretty predictable, right? I think he's going to talk about his legislative wins, he's going to talk about some of the successes. He's going to maybe take a trip down some fool's gold and talk about how the economy has completely recovered.But the most important part, I think most Americans are going to be watching, is how does he actually perform? Right? Does he walk up to that stage and does he act like a bold confident, young, acting 80- year-old commander in chief? Or is he a weak, tired, worn-out 80-year- old want to be commander-in-chief?

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:22:50] PHILLIP: Happening right now, top aviation officials are testifying over on Capitol Hill.

And the fact that this is happening right on the heels of this near collision on the runway at Austin International Airport on Saturday, when two commercial airliners almost landed on top of each other. This is the issue that keeps coming up during this hearing. And what's so interesting is that we heard from NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy, she says this could have been so close to a yesterday.Yesterday she told me that these two planes came within 100 feet of each other. But she just testified that there's a similarity between this latest case and the incident of three weeks ago when two planes almost hit each other on the runway at JFK, an American airlines flight pulled out in front of a Delta flight and was taking off. The issue in both of these Chair Homendy says is that the cockpit voice recorder times out after two hours leaving investigators without some critical clues that they need in order to piece these two instances together. The NTSB wants that up to 25 hours as a regulation by the FAA but it is not active just yet. I want you to listen to NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy as he describes how critical this would be.

Both we and the NTSB need good data to be able to understand what is happening in these situations and piece together sometimes split-second decisions and the different concerns that play out over those scenarios.We have an extraordinary record of safety in our skies. Most years, even in a country that will see more than 100 people die on our roadways every single day. Something else we're very focused on dealing with. A typical number for passenger airline deaths in many recent years is zero. It takes a lot of work to keep it that way. And we need to make sure that we continue advancing, as we see more and more demand, more and more complexity. More and more technology coming into the national airspace. It's one of the reasons why this year is going to be an especially important year for us to be working with Congress. FAA is coming up for reauthorization. It means there's going to be an opportunity to make sure we have the funding, the people, the organization, the budgeting that is needed to accelerate the kind of modernization that has been under way for a very long time, and frankly needs to be accelerated. And to make sure that we're staying ahead of some of the things that could impact safety in the future.",

He was renominated for the new year. We are hopeful of a Senate hearing and a favorable Senate vote very soon.
