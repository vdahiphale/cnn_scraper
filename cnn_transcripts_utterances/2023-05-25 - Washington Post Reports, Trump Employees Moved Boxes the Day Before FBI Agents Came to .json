Welcome to CNN Tonight. Why was Donald Trump's staff moving boxes of documents around Mar-a- Lago when they knew that the FBI was coming the following day to look for classified documents? The Washington Post reports that investigators consider the timing here a potential sign of obstruction. So, what happens now? Our panel tells us what this means for this investigation. Plus, that 11-year-old Mississippi boy called 911 for help during a domestic disturbance, but when police arrived, as you heard, they shot him. So, we'll give you new developments in this case. And Mike Rowe is here to talk tonight about why college enrollment is at its lowest point in years. But let's begin with the Washington Post reporting on two Trump employees allegedly moving boxes of papers at Mar-a-Lago just one day before FBI agents traveled there to pick up classified documents. And that's not all. The Post reports that investigators have evidence that the former president kept classified documents out in the open in his office and showed them to others. We're going to bring in my panel. We have Errol Louis, political anchor for Spectrum News, also Rachel Nichols of Headliners with Rachel Nichols on Showtime, Republican Strategist Jason Osborne, and CNN Political Commentator S.E. Cupp. But here first to help us break this down this legally is our CNN Chief Legal Analyst Laura Coates. Laura, great to see you. So, tell me what does all these new developments, what are the legal implications here for Donald Trump?",

      "sentences": "Wow, Alisyn, I mean, just think about it. One of the hardest things to do as a prosecutor is to figure out how I'm going to get inside the brain of a potential target. How do I figure out that person's intent? How do I figure out what they really wanted to do? And then you have this reporting that suggests that not just the documents were retained or that they were moved.But the possibility of even a dress rehearsal to figure out what to do when the National Archives came to get the documents or a duly executed subpoena was actually issued and then fulfilled, it really does not bode well for an intended defendant or a target to have this type of information out there because it really confirms the possibility that you do have intent, the intentional act to try to obstruct a lawful investigation. And, remember, this is all falling under the Presidential Records Act, Alisyn. As you well know, these documents don't belong to the former president, Donald Trump. He had advance notice that they did not. Even if it wasn't inadvertent retention of documents, he was certainly, for months, on notice that he was no longer supposed to have them. So, reporting that suggests that there was a plan in place in addition to his own attorney having had to testify in front of a grand jury, Alisyn, and the attorney-client privilege being pierced under the crime fraud exception, this does not bode well for Donald Trump to try to prove that he did not have the level of intent that a prosecutor needs to show.",

I haven't seen him carrying the documents or to have some indication that he himself was alone in this. If he delegated responsibility to somebody else, if that person is involved in this, then there is the potential liability and potential prosecution.However, think about there might be people who are voluntarily or actively cooperating to give the information, to convey that there is likely there was a dress rehearsal or otherwise. And I point again to Evan Corcoran. Remember, he was the attorney for Donald Trump. He tried to suggest he could not tell what may have been instructed to him or otherwise because of obviously the attorney-client privilege. We want any client to be able to be forthright and to be candid with their counsel to get legal advice. And we will shield those communications, Alisyn, except if there's a crime or fraud afoot. And, yes, I said afoot on a Thursday night at 10:00 P.M. But, really, if there was a crime afoot and fraud happening, we don't want to protect that. We don't want to use a shield of an attorney to further a crime. And so a judge has already said you're going to have to testify about what you may have been instructed to in front of a grand jury. And so he apparently had very detailed notes. Whatever was contained in that secret grand jury proceeding will give us more insight as to who else might be liable or at least potentially heading to prosecution.",

I'm not trying to do anything that's improper or illegal.So, the problem for him, of course, is that that doesn't really comport with the law. When the National Archives comes and asks or when a subpoena is executed and the Justice Department shows up, you're supposed to cooperate. And the non-cooperation itself give rise to an offense. So, that even if everything he said was true, if he thought he could magically mentally declassify things, once the DOJ comes and says, we have a subpoena, you have to give this stuff back and you don't do it or you have a rehearsal to sort of pretend you're going to do it, you get into a lot of trouble.

I have to think there were some pretty smart people that came in the new administration, like we're changing everything, so that no matter what was on these documents, it's no longer valid. I also think it's kind of stupid, quite frankly, on Trump's part to say, no, these documents were declassified and there's nothing a big deal about it.

So what's the explanation? Well, Mike Rowe, the man behind Dirty Jobs and the CEO of the Mike Rowe Works Foundation is here to tell us. Mike, great to see you. Mike, as a parent with two seniors who are going off to college in September, it felt as competitive as ever.

I've been, on the other hand, trying to get people to look at all of the options that are available and be really, really honest about the cost. Never has anything in the history of Western civilization gotten more expensive more quickly than a four year degree in the last 30 years. It's exponential, you know, it's increased faster than food, energy, real estate, healthcare, really everything.And so it's got a long tail, this thing, but I think the numbers have finally caught up with a lot of households who have simply said, look, if we can get our kid in a trade school and have him or her, learn a skill that's actually in demand and get out with very little debt, that kid's going to have a colossal head start in the workforce.

She decided to weld instead. She wound up at Joe Gibbs, she's the lead welder there making mid six figures, story after story after story. Welders don't look like the person you're imagining in your mind right now. Not every plumber is 300 pounds with a giant butt crack in a sitcom, right?Those are the stigmas I'm talking about. Those are the perceptions and the misperceptions that a lot of well intended parents have. And look, guidance counselors to this day, in real time as we speak, they're getting boned based on their ability to help a kid get into a four- year school, not into a trade school. So again, it's not this is good and this is bad or this is better and this is worse, but trade jobs are not vocational consolation prizes. And the path to a four-year degree, look, you can look at the numbers, but when you really get down and tell the individual stories, some will break your heart and some will inspire you. But in the end, work ethic still matters, and the willingness to master a skill that's in demand, maybe out of favor a little bit, but nevertheless in demand, that will still get you to a place that looks a lot like prosperity.",
