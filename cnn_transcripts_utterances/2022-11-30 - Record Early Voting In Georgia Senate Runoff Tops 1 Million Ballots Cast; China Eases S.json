Add that to what's at stake, especially for Democrats, who want the real benefits of having 51 seats, instead of 50, and you've got quite a race to follow. More now from CNN's Dianne Gallagher.

The Lieutenant Governor joins us now, along with CNN Political Commentator and former South Carolina Democratic state lawmaker, Bakari Sellers. Lieutenant Governor Duncan, let me start with you. With less than a week left, until Election Day, really six days now, do you think that Herschel Walker has convinced enough Georgians, to send him to the Senate? LT. GOV. GEOFF DUNCAN, (R) GEORGIA: Well, there's a serious imbalance of energy, right now. The Warnock campaign seems to be gaining steam and momentum. And every time you turn on the TV, there's a Warnock ad running. And it's not necessarily the case, at the Walker side, right? I think, as you just mentioned, there was a brief five-day period, where he was kind of absent, from the campaign trail. The ads don't seem to be as numerous. And there does not feel like there's a ton of energy. This all came down to the suburbs.

He's ill-fitted, he's ill-equipped to be a United States Senator. And I think that people are recognizing that. I mean, you also had the level of exhaustion that Georgia voters have. But let's add this up. Let's look at it in the balance and the totality of what it is. Tomorrow, you have Barack Obama, who is, I would say, arguably the most popular, either current-elected or former-elected official out there, on the campaign trail, campaigning for Raphael Warnock. Whereas, you have Donald Trump doing a teleconference, I don't even know what that is, but like a tele rally, for Herschel Walker. And I think that actually goes to the point of momentum. And Raphael Warnock has the momentum going into this. And 51-49 for Democrats is a huge advantage. And we know that. I think people know that. But you don't want to go into somebody's household, saying, \"Please give me 51 votes, for committee assignments.\" I think Geoff Duncan and I will both agree that things like inflation, immigration, crime, et cetera, are the number one issues.

One of the things you heard, in the slogans, in the chanting, this week, was really interesting. People said, \"I want to return to normal life.\" And that doesn't just mean life without COVID. It means the kind of trajectory of China that they knew before. And let's call it what it is, in the years, before Xi Jinping came to power, in 2012, a country that had big technology companies, before Xi Jinping's government pushed out the heads of many of those companies. A place, where Chinese people were traveling abroad, they were going as tourists, they were going to students. These days, John, it's actually very difficult to get a passport in China.

It hasn't been the country they wanted it to be. So, the other thing he can do is make concessions, by another name, essentially begin to recognize. As you mentioned, in the beginning, they are beginning to give some sign that they have to change course on COVID. They're beginning to say, \"We'll do lockdowns, more sporadically. We'll try to figure out, when, we have to do testing more carefully,\" and try to get rid of the arbitrariness.

It started with breaking up those encampments of homeless people, trying to get them the services they need, also stopping people, from sleeping on train. So, this is sort of the next evolution, as he calls it, in that process. But he admits it's an evolution. There needs to be tweaks to that.

Guarded hope, to be sure, but hope all the same.Data from a long-awaited trial, of the experimental drug, Lecanemab, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, shows it has potential, as a treatment, for the disease. That said, the news comes with a long list of ifs and buts and questions to ask, which is why we're glad to be joined tonight by CNN Medical Correspondent, Dr. Tara Narula. Doctor, it's great to see you. So, how significant is this research? And how exactly does this drug work? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: I love that you talked about guarded hope. And that really is where we're at. 6 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, in this country. And for anyone, who's cared for a loved one, or who's watched someone sort of disappear, you feel helpless. And, for so long, in this community, we haven't had a drug, that has shown any ability, to change the progression, or the course, of the disease. In fact, the most recent drug that was approved, last year, Aduhelm, which was the first one, since 2003, was surrounded by controversy. So, existing drugs really targets symptoms. But this drug, Lecanemab, is the first one, to show a slowing of that cognitive decline. It is a monoclonal antibody, similar to Aduhelm that's given as an IV infusion, once every two weeks, and it also targets those amyloid plaques, in the brain, with the hope that by removing them, you can potentially again reduce that decline in cognitive function.",

And that scale goes from zero to 18, with 18 being the worst, and zero being the best. They all started out around a three. The group, that got Lecanemab, their score worsened by about 1.2 points. The placebo group, the score worsened by about 1.6 points. So, you can see John, there's not a huge difference between 1.6 and 1.2.",

Does that one-point difference actually translate into something meaningful, for patients and families? And some might argue, it may, right? Giving somebody one more month, two more months, those are precious time periods, where a person can function, where you can be with them, where they can recognize you. But we're also going to have to see what happens in the real world. Those patients, in the real world, are different from clinical trials. They have other medical issues. They're on different medications. They're not followed as closely. In addition, it may be costly, John. I mean, with Aduhelm, that was about $28,000 a year in cost. And patients have to come in for these infusions. So, it's hard to know what this is going to mean. And again, it may be an individualized decision. I think, big picture, and we talk about this a lot, is we need really a multi-faceted approach, to Alzheimer's, where we're targeting different aspects, of the aging brain, not just the amyloid plaques.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (VIDEO - \"SAY YOU LOVE ME\" - SONG BY CHRISTINE MCVIE AND FLEETWOOD MAC) You woo me until the sun comes up And you say that you love me (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN (voice-over): Killer hooks, sincere lyrics, and a soulful voice. That's how critics have defined Christine McVie's contributions, to the legendary band, Fleetwood Mac, as one of music's great singers and songwriters. Her family said she died at a hospital, after a short illness, and called her an incredible human being, and revered musician. Fleetwood Mac also released a statement. Quote, \"She was truly one-of- a-kind, special and talented beyond measure.\" She was one of the best musicians \"anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life.\" In a statement, bandmate Stevie Nicks called McVie, her \"Best friend.\" Drummer Mick Fleetwood called McVie, a \"Songbird,\" after one of her most famous songs, and said that quote, \"Part of my heart has flown away today.\" McVie was born for music. Her father was a music teacher. And after brief jobs as a teacher herself, and a window dresser, in a department store, she joined a band called Chicken Shack. That band became friends, and would open for a very young, very different-looking Fleetwood Mac. Once that band's legendary guitarist, Peter Green, left, she says the band asked if she would join. Being a fan, she said, yes. That's also where she would meet John McVie, Fleetwood Mac's bassist, and soon to be her husband. Earlier this year, she told \"The Guardian\" that after the wedding, there was no real honeymoon. At one point, they went to the hotel bar, and got plastered, with someone else, who happened to be staying at the hotel, legendary vocalist, Joe Cocker. It would be one of many wild nights, for McVie, and her bandmates. Especially once Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined several years later, a new band was formed, according to McVie, over Mexican food and margaritas. In 1975, they would put out the band's self-titled album, which sold millions. Two years later, came Rumours, which has sold in the tens of millions, and is one of the best-selling albums of all time. It contains one of her best love songs, \"Songbird.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (VIDEO - \"SONGBIRD\" FROM FLEETWOOD MAC'S RUMOURS) For you, there'll be no more crying (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN (voice-over): McVie says it took her only 30 minutes to write, but as she explained in a BBC interview, last year, that was only the half of it.
