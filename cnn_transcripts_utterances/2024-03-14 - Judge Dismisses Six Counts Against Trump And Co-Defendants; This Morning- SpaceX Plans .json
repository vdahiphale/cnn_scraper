Why is he doing this? He told CNN it's a lot more fun to do the Titanic than it is to sit at home and count my money. Similar plans were announced in 2012 and 2018, but none became a reality. Never let go, billionaire -- never let go.The governor of Massachusetts is taking execution action to pardon all convictions for simple marijuana possession. It comes after President Biden took similar action on federal offenses in 2022. It still needs to be approved by the governor's council, a strange body in Massachusetts. Massachusetts residents voted to decriminalize the possession of marijuana back in 2008 and legalize recreational cannabis in 2016. This morning, actress Olivia Munn is crediting an online tool with saving her life. The 43-year-old says her doctor used the tool to calculate her breast cancer risk score. Her score warranted more testing, leading to her diagnosis of luminal B, an aggressive form of breast cancer. She underwent a double mastectomy and is recovering well.

It takes a little bit of burden off the state. It removes some appeal issues. And frankly, you could have moved forward in this case with a much more truncated type of -- type of indictment and criminal charges. So moving ahead is not going to hurt him.

So he or she may say well, you know, we're moving forward just like we have. She may also say you know something? I just have looked at it and I don't think this is appropriate, and I'm going to end the prosecution of the case. So a lot of discretion moves forward if that happens. Now, I do think it's likely that this case will not be heard this year, and I think the judge signaled that in this very recent order he -- when he talked about the ability to appeal. And I also think the further we get into the calendar with all these things that have been happening and these speed bumps that the state has been running into that it's a pretty clear indication that we won't get there before the election.

And as you mentioned, unfortunately, some of these results were temporary but they do show a potential path forward for this technology.Now, as you mentioned, Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer. It affects about 12,000 people who are newly diagnosed each year in the U.S. and it's very difficult to treat. The median survival right now is about 14 months with current treatment, which involves trying to take out the tumor if you can, radiation, and chemotherapy. But we need better options. CAR-T is what's known as a living drug. You're actually taking a patient's cells out of their body and then they're getting reprogrammed to express proteins on their surface that help them hone in on cancer better and to better fight cancer. Then you're multiplying those cells and you're giving them back to the patient. So it's actually their own souped-up cells that's trying to fight cancer. This has been successful for a number of blood cancer. But so far, so- called solid tumors -- things found in the brain or the lung or the breast -- there has not been success with CAR-T there. And so this is a very early-stage study, phase one. We've actually seen three different early-stage trials just published in the last week. Tom Fraser is one patient who participated in a trial at Mass General in Massachusetts. That study was published last night in the New England Journal of Medicine. We've got pictures of him and his wife we can share with you. But also, really excitingly, you can see the pictures of his brain. His tumor was in his brain. He got the CAR-T treatment. Then a couple of days after the treatment they saw that tumor had shrunk by almost 20 percent. Sixty days later it had continued shrinking by 60 percent and continued to improve over six months. Unfortunately, there were two other patients in this trial. Theirs came back within one and two months. So there's a lot more work to do here, John, to try to make sure this can last.",
