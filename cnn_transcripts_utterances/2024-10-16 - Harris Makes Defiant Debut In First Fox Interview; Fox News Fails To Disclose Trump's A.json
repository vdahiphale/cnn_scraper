Harris was pushed, and pushed right back, including a moment about Donald Trump that seemed to set her off. Pete Buttigieg is here with his take. And J.D. Vance finally answered what he would not answer for weeks. No, he says, Donald Trump did not lose the 2020 election, at least not in his words. And an inside source will join me this hour, with what he knows about the battle for the place that could decide this entire election. Pennsylvania. Senator John Fetterman is here. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. With 20 days to go until the election, Vice President Kamala Harris went where she has never gone before, and frankly, where no Democratic nominee has gone, in quite some time. On Fox. The Vice President campaigned for those few persuadable conservative voters, in an interview that was contentious right from the jump. Fox's Bret Baier questioned the Vice President on everything, from immigration, to trans rights, to how she would be different than President Biden. She was interrupted several times, as she was answering those questions. And there were tense exchanges, throughout this entire interview. But it was this moment, maybe, when she was asked about Trump supporters, that things got incredibly heated. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The whole topic there was the fact that a candidate for president, and a former U.S. President, described the American people, the ones he disagreed with, as the enemy. And it's really important not to allow some sidestepping of that. So, she did that. She also made sure to continue to get her point across, even when she was being repeatedly interrupted. As somebody who has a lot of batting practice myself, on that network, really proud of how she represented her views, her values, and this ticket, in front of a conservative audience. Something I might add, by the way, that is a show of strength. That is the exact opposite of the weakness that Donald Trump has demonstrated, by pulling out of going, even on CNBC, which is hardly a liberal bastion, or \"60 Minutes,\" where it's customary for both candidates to go on. He's not prepared to go in front of a skeptical, let alone unfriendly, audience. She demonstrated the opposite. And remember, this is in keeping with her continued outreach to conservatives.

Now that he's given a straight answer, J.D. Vance is officially on the record, as an election-denier, something that is shameful. But also something that, if, certainly, if we look at 2022, and have pretty much anybody who is an election-denier, who is on the ballot, in so many swing states, statewide races lost, I think that's something that that's a setback. Now, he probably has no choice, because Donald Trump has probably demanded that he lie, and that he say that. But look, one of the most profoundly important things, in a democratic process, is that when you lose an election, you say so. I mean, it's one of the most fundamental parts of how democracy works. It's no fun to lose an election. I know what it's like to lose an election. But you do it. It should go without saying. The fact that it didn't go without saying is one of the most disqualifying things that helps to explain why so many conservative Republicans are not just sitting this one out, but campaigning for Kamala Harris, even though they disagree with her on a lot of policies.",

Where I am, I'm going across Pennsylvania, and a lot of the red rooms, and a lot of the red counties, to make the argument why -- I can't imagine why we would want those next four years, with Trump, but why I believe Harris is going to prevail. But it is going to be incredibly close on that. And I wish I had something more comforting for anybody that's watching, to think that there's going to be a breakout, kind of a situation. I would expect everybody that it's going to be really, really close. And to anyone, to anyone that's going to withhold their votes, or to not support Harris?

It was more than two dozen of their family members, their extended family, I should note, that came out and gathered, as you can see here, demanding their release from prison, after more than 30 years, for the murder of their parents. The family is citing new evidence in the case, is the reason why. And the defense attorneys argue that it's corroborating what we heard previously from the brothers, that they were acting in self-defense, after suffering years of physical and sexual abuse from their father. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOAN ANDERSEN VANDERMOLEN, MENENDEZ BROTHERS' AUNT: As details of Lyle and Erik's abuse came to light, it became clear that their actions, while tragic, were the desperate response of two boys trying to survive the unspeakable cruel of their father. BRIAN A. ANDERSEN JR., MENENDEZ BROTHERS' COUSIN: Their father's abuse was dismissed, their trauma ignored, and their truth mocked by millions. KAREN VANDERMOLEN COPLEY, MENENDEZ BROTHERS' COUSIN: They have suffered enough. I ask the district attorneys to take into account the whole truth and nothing but the truth. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
