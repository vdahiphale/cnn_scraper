But of course the attention is very much on the progresses made the last few days of just south of here along the Zaporizhzhia line.Two points in particular, one further to the east with a line that has all the way down to Berdiansk, but it is to the west of that, the point around Robotyne with a line that heads towards Melitopol. That has been the focus of some of these limited successes when you look at it in terms of actual land recaptured but significant, Fredricka, because these advances represent the first breach of what is the first Russian defensive line. There are two further defensive lines beyond it but that initial breach in some parts of that first line clearly a huge step and a glimmer of hope for Ukrainian forces that are seeing a counteroffensive that had made very little progress over the course of the now nearly three months since it began. So that is being seen as something significant. The Ukrainian soldiers are believed to be in some parts on the rear end of that first line. They have two more to cross. Still, the hope is that they will be able to strike further south towards settlements that are down there. We've been hearing from President Zelenskyy also today saying that he's looking ahead to a very productive month of September, in particular in terms of his negotiations with Western partners, with Ukraine asking for more of the weaponry they say they desperately need to try and help this counteroffensive make some further progress, in particular, ammunition, something we're hearing about from commanders on the ground that is in desperate shortage in several parts of the front line, but also land mine clearing equipment in particular. These are the kind of things he's going to be looking to his partners to provide and he said in a post on Telegram that he hopes that some of them will hear these desperate pleas and be more forthcoming than they have. The expectation, the hope is on the Ukrainian side that this momentum that they're seeing at this particular point around the Zaporizhzhia line could give them some hope in the days and weeks to come -- Fredricka.",

I think Monday, tomorrow morning, we're really going to see the first time where all of these multiple trials that the president is going to have, they're going to be unfolding simultaneously.Let's start here in Washington, D.C., where a federal judge is holding a hearing to determine when the former president's trial on the special counsel's election subversion charges, when that trial is going to take place. Now, the special counsel has requested a trial date of January 2nd of next year. That's about four months from now. The former president's lawyers, however, they have a proposed a trial date of April of 2026, which would not be for more than two years. The former president's lawyers, they are arguing that four months is not enough time to prepare for this trial. They also say that the date, it contradicts and gets in the way of the other trials that the former president has. So, that will be -- of course, looming over that is the political calendar, which if there is a trial in January of 2024, it would be happening at the same time as the Republican presidential primaries. Now, in Georgia, Mark Meadows, he is trying to move his case from state to federal court. And this matters for the former president, because 5 of the 19 defendants have already tried to make the same motion to move this case to federal court and the former president, he is expected to do the same thing. Now, why does this matter? This is potentially important because, for one reason, the jury pool of the trial here in Fulton County. And remember, this is the racketeering case that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis brought. If that's tried in state court, the jury pool is just in Fulton County, which is a fairly deep blue population. In federal court, the population of potential jurors, it would be wider in neighboring counties and potentially could include more pro- Trump jurors.

Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning women's team, said he was sorry the Women's World Cup victory was harmed by Rubiales' inappropriate behavior. And during the weekend, Hermoso has gotten support at various football games. At a women's match near Madrid, players held a banner saying, with you Jennifer Hermoso. In men's games in the Spanish Liga, they wore shirts saying, it's over, or carried a banner, we are all Jenni.
