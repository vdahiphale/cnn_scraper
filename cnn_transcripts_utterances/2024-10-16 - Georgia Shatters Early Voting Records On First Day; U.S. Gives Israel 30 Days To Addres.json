He says early voting is fake and drop boxes are fake, that you showed the clip just now its like get out and vote early, vote anyway, you possibly can.So I think both parties are adjusting to this new reality of who are these low propensity voters? It is a key element. Here is something I think the thing I'm watching more now than anything, less about the messaging and more about the get-out-the-vote. Where are the candidates going to try and get these people out to vote? Because I think data to then make the difference, especially in an election, this close, you're not convincing anyone else.

In the meantime, the U.S. is putting Israel on notice, improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza in the next 30 days, or face potential restrictions on military aid. The ultimatum delivered in a letter jointly written by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Among the demands, the U.S. wants Israel to allow at least 350 trucks each day to enter Gaza and pauses in fighting so that aid and vaccines can be delivered what. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, the scale of the attack will also define the scale of the response from Iran as well. So how much this escalates, all that tension in the Middle East and we've also had this letter that you were mentioning from the U.S. to Israel, another big test of whether or not Israel is listening to the United States right now, where there has the power that he should have really considering how much military aid it gives to Israel, right?",

In part to end the heartbreaking loss of Palestinian lives. And they also note that this comes just three weeks, of course, before the election, but this has been a tough thing for Harris to navigate on the one hand, the left of her party, very focused on the devastation in Gaza, but on the other hand, she has been trying to move to the center to appeal to swing voters here in the U.S. at tend to support Israel.",
