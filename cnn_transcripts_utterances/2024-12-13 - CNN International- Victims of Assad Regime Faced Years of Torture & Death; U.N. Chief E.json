Welcome to \"Connect the World\". I'm Omar Jimenez, including an emotional day in Syria with Friday prayers happening for the first time since the ousted of President Bashar Al Assad. Now this is how it looks right now in the capital. You see the amount of people there. And over the past week, displaced Syrians have been returning home and reuniting with loved ones. And imprisoned Syrians have been freed from the fallen regime's notorious jails. Now, the leader of the forces that overthrew the regime has vowed to transition the country peacefully into a new post Assad era. And he offered words of praise today, along with a warning to avoid celebrating with guns after someone in Raqqa fired bullets into the air Thursday, sparking chaos that witnesses say left at least one person dead and 15 injured.

He then travels to Ankara, Turkey, where he met with the President Erdogan, and this morning as well, with the Turkish Foreign Minister. And as you said, he emphasized the need to continue that fight against ISIS, noting that they had put that terrorist group in a box of sorts. They have been able to dismantle its territorial caliphate, and they do not want to risk that returning. And then we arrived here in Baghdad, Iraq about two hours ago for that unannounced meeting with the Iraqi Prime Minister. Of course, they are a key partner in the fight against this terrorist group. There is also a strong Iranian influence. The Iran back militias do have a foothold here in Iran that likely also came up in their conversations as well. Blinken just spoke there at the embassy in Baghdad, and he talked again about the need to ensure that there is a smooth transition, an inclusive transition, a period led transition to a new government there in Damascus, as well as a need to ensure that no terrorist group can take advantage of the instability we are seeing on the ground here, Omar.",

The Iranian axis in the region, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Assad regime in Syria, is essentially faltering. But the tricky part in all this is that America's allies are not united, and so the Arabs have an interest of their own. The Turks a different agenda, the Turks, for example, very much adopting the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, whereas that poses a threat to American allies in Jordan, the Hashemite royal family. And then certainly within Syria, Kurd versus Arabs and various movements and trends within those rebel forces. So, it's a moment where all the spokes end up in Washington, which is the only hub that can bring all these pieces together. And this is why it's so crucial that Secretary Blinken is in the region, that American diplomacy remains engaged.

Now, Iran's so-called Axis of Resistance has allowed it to act militarily through its proxies, providing it the luxury of deniability, however implausible that became. So, we'll start in Gaza, following October 7th, the Israeli response has been overwhelming. Tens of thousands of civilians killed. Much of Gaza lies in ruins, and Hamas itself has been decimated while there are still pockets of fighters. The mastermind of October 7th, Yahya Sinwar was killed, along with most commanders. Ismail Haniyeh, the political head, was assassinated in July while staying in Iran. Next on to Lebanon and Hezbollah was the largest non-state military in the Middle East and considered Iran's last line of defense. It engaged Israel in low level conflict to support Hamas, which eventually spiraled into all-out war. Its leadership has been decapitated. Hassan Nasrallah assassinated, thousands of fighters killed or maimed, along with many Lebanese civilians. Agreeing to a cease fire last month, Hezbollah is far from destroyed, but it has been severely weakened. And now Syria, Syria has toppled its dictator, Bashar Al Assad, a key Iranian ally. Hezbollah's focus on its war with Israel, plus Russia, focusing on its war in Ukraine left Assad without support and exposed. The loss of Syria leaves Hezbollah isolated in Lebanon as it effectively closes the weapons resupply route from Iran to Lebanon. Now, Iranian backed militias in Iraq and Yemen remain largely intact, but they are being repeatedly targeted by the United States and its allies. So, the Biden Administration has said that Iran is looking at a very different Middle East today. The October 7th attacks set off a course of events that have weakened Iran and its regional ambitions of dominance. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Abu Dhabi.",

And prosecutors in New York have started presenting evidence against Mangione to a grand jury there, according to ABC News. We have also learned that Mangione was not insured by United Healthcare, even though he accused of gunning down the company's CEO.

John, can you just give us a sense of where we are right now in this investigation, and maybe what hurdles prosecutors might face in regards to getting them this person back to New York. JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: So, Omar, three basic developments. One, as you reported, the grand jury, which ABC News broke the story on. That is a normal piece of the mechanics to be charged with a felony in New York State, you first must be indicted by a grand jury. So, while he is resisting being extradited from Pennsylvania, they are using that time to present the evidence they have to a grand jury secure that indictment, and within two weeks, they'll be arguing in court for that extradition after the Governor of New York signs the warrant and it's delivered to Pennsylvania. Search warrants, they have obtained three search warrants. This is likely for the computer that he was arrested with. They're going to want to get into that computer and see what was he doing at that table in the back of a McDonald's was he looking up ways to escape the United States? Was he looking at potentially another target? Was he reading about the case to see if they were hot on his trail? They won't know till they figure out how to get into that computer, but first they need that warrant. And of course, the revelation that he was not, and apparently never was a United Healthcare customer that fits into really kind of what he put in his three- page letter that was found on his person, allegedly. Which appears to be a claim of responsibility for this murder, where he cites United Healthcare as the fifth largest company in America, just behind Apple and Google and Wal Mart, and that it keeps growing and growing, and he accuses it of greed and abusing its customers.",

Human Tissue samples called organoids are now in orbit at the International Space Station, and identical samples are back on Earth at Oxford University Space Innovation Lab. This experiment will allow researchers to compare and analyze data from both samples to study the aging process and the impact of micro gravity on it.",
