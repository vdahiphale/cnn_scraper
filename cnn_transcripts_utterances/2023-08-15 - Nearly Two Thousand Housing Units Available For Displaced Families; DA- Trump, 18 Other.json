However, I will say from the point of view of both the prosecutor and defense attorney, it would be inexplicable to me that he cuts some kind of deal to cooperate in the federal case. But yet he's full-blown charged in the state case.I'm not sure what his defense counsel would be up to if that was the situation. I mean, they are very different indictments, even though it's the same set of facts. And in many ways, I think that you know the Georgia indictment is the case that Jack Smith would have brought. He might still bring it if he had more time because it names all these people. And as Joey was pointing out, that can make it a lot more complicated too because there are legitimate reasons why you couldn't get the scheduling together now with this many defendants. And maybe that was part of why the federal strategy was to streamline at more only charging Trump. But as to Meadows, it's very puzzling to me that he's missing from one but fully present in the other.",

First, you can go to redcross.org and make a financial donation there. You can call that number 1-800-RedCross. So, that's 1-800-733-2767, and make a donation there for disaster relief.
