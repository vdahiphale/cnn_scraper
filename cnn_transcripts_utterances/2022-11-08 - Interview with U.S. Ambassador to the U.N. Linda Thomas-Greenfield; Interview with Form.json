A series of high-profile American officials have visited Kyiv these past few days.

When we spoke during her visit to a grain milling plant here in the capital, about ongoing American support for the war effort.

THOMAS-GREENFIELD:  Well, I'm hoping that the deal will be extended. I know that extraordinary efforts are being made by the secretary general and others to negotiate an extension of this deal. The fact that Putin pulled out of the deal temporarily shows that he has no concern about the impact that this is having around the world. He sent shocks around the world when he did this.

THOMAS-GREENFIELD:  I think what we've seen in the security council by the Russians is a total lack of sensitivity. A total lack of cooperation. They have used the security council to push forward their negative and their narrative. There misinformation. Their attacks on the people of Ukraine. We have used the council to isolate them, to condemn them, and taken it as well to the general assembly where they have been roundly condemned.

Consumers are using it to pack restaurants, to pack airplanes, and to buy new cars.

And indeed, an important challenge for the United States is going to be to mount a forward defense of our interests by making sure that the world economy keeps moving together. That goes to climate change. It goes to many other things. Look, I think the challenge we have, Christiane, is that we have massively stimulated demand. That's putting money in people's pockets, that's what leads to those crowded restaurants and those elevated net worth's. But it also means upwards pressure on prices. And when people see inflation, they have a sense that things aren't completely under control. They have a sense that the prosperity is uneasy, and that inflation has been demoralizing to many, many Americans even as the fundamentals are, in many ways, quite strong and have been importantly strengthened by steps the administration has taken like investment in infrastructure.

So, I think themajor investments they've made are very worthwhile. But I don't usually talk partisan. But I have to say that what I've heard from a number of Republicans, including Republican House Leader McCarthy about threatening to not pass the debt limit and send the country into default, is chilling. And to do that with the objective of cutting social security benefits compounds the pain. That is irresponsible and unpatriotic policy that threatens both American strength and threatens the people, none of whom are getting more than $40,000 from social security, who depend on it for a lifeline. So, I've not heard a -- I have to say, a constructive word from those attacking the president about what we can do to contain inflation. There are a set of things we need to do. We need to do more to support the independents of the Federal Reserve. Overtime, we're going to need to bring down budget deficits. We need to increase the flexibility of the economy. Particularly, we need more permitting for energy and energy transmission. We need to reduce tariffs of a kind that actually hurt our competitiveness, because a tariff good like steel is an input to other American producers. And we need, as the president has started to do, to use the government's purchasing power to make things cheaper, as we're doing, for example, with pharmaceuticals. But I don't think any kind of tear the whole place down is appropriate. I think in many ways, President Trump set the stage for the inflation we're discovering, and going back to those policies that talk populist while practicing the art of the deal for what America has that are close to oligarchs.

And again, he -- the IntelligenceCommunity suspects that any day he is going to unleash a nuclear test. It would be the first one in five years. It would be the seventh. I mean, he could well do it during the G20 meeting to say, look, I'm here. You've got to deal with me. He wants something in return, and I think he now wants to be recognized as a nuclear power officially. And that is something that, you know -- what do we do about that?",

And that seems the struggle of the 21st century right now. 60 years or so ago, 80 years ago, we were engaged in another great struggle like that, which was against communism. And we built all sorts of institutions, whether it was NATO and the Marshall Plan and the World Bank and the IMF, in order to contain the spread of communism. Is there something Biden can do that would be bigger and grander as a theory of the case, which is to say, we are now going to rally to protect democracy, that's going to be the goal of our foreign policy?",

How do you make sure that, you know, the European Union, which we've created after World War II, helped create, both economically through Marshall Plan, but also, politically and diplomatically with our engaging and trying to get them to engage so there was not another war in Europe, that we are not seeing the ideas or leadership emerge from any corner? And this, I think, in an era of globalization is where you need, you know, not just one leader or one country, but you need many of them getting together. And there is not the sense of community or urgency in addressing some of these problems. And that is what worries me, that the frame of democracy, the growing appeal of strong men who solve local problems, you know, build railways and, you know, get things going, even if they are deeply corrupt, that we are headed for a period of more fraying. Joe Biden, at this point, you know, he may run again, but, you know, American leadership, by and large, is pretty old. Really, many of them witnessed, you know, World War II or grew up in the immediate aftermath of World War II. And so, the -- I think one of the big questions is, how do we deal with globalization, which emerged in the 20th century, but there were no rules? And we began to see, with supply chain issues and our reliance on microchips, that we weren't very thoughtful about how we did it and we became reliant on countries that either didn't want to engage or would blackmail us effectively in one way or another, because they were making our goods. And I think that is what gave birth to the America first movement. And has led to a lot of questions about, you know, globalization at all. We need to figure out what globalization is because, Walter, as you know, that is the issue of the 21st century. And how we do it, and I think nobody has figured that out yet.",
