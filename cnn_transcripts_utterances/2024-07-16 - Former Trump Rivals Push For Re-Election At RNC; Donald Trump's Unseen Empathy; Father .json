I spoke to one person asking them what they made of the speech. They said, I stopped listening after I heard the word, endorsed. Another senior adviser told me, Ron and Nikki made it clear, it is DJT, Donald Trump Jr.'s -- excuse me, I think Donald John Trump's party.They needed Nikki Haley to come out here and endorse him tonight. Remember this, she only won two primaries, but she continued to get tens of thousands of votes from Republicans even after she had dropped out of the race. Those votes, many of them in critical battleground states, like Arizona, like Pennsylvania. They were thrilled at the fact that she had directly addressed those supporters and that she told them to go vote for Donald Trump. They were thrilled at the fact that she made it a binary choice. That is something Donald Trump and his team have tried to do, and that is something that Nikki Haley did tonight, and that is why they wanted her on that stage tonight.",

      "sentences": "Yes Jake, it was fascinating not just to listen to delegates here on the floor, the audience up in the sands, but also to watch the VIP box where the former president is sitting, and sitting once again next to his vice presidential candidate, J.D. Vance. After Nikki Haley's speech was over, Vance looked over to Trump and said, that was good, you could see him mouth it, and Trump seemed to agree.In the audience, in the crowd, there was some combination of kind of ambivalence and unsure necessarily what to do for at least the opening portion of Ambassador Haley's remarks. But I think there was also a recognition of the importance of the message that she was delivering, that kind of got there towards the end. DeSantis, Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, very different. The crowd response from the very beginning was very enthusiastic. You kind of saw almost the Ron DeSantis before his presidential campaign when he was so central to the Republican Party and its perceived future before the former president steamrolled him in the primary. The former president's face as he stood up to welcome Ron DeSantis in, it changed a pretty wide smile when DeSantis made clear how effusive he planned to praise Trump and the endorsement for that. As you look into the VIP box, I've been going back and forth between delegates, VIP boxes, I sit just under the box, just under you guys, as well as I stare at your back, Jake, is the people that are coming in and out and what they necessarily mean for the inner circle. Trump's obviously sitting next to the vice presidential candidate, J.D. Vance. We've also seen Jim Jordan, his close ally at Capitol Hill, Ben Carson, who's about to speak in just a little bit. As we've seen them kind of cycle in and out, allies, throughout the course of the day, it's very clear unity is the message they wanted to get across. They're definitely doing that, and the former president seems to be welcoming it. Just one last point I want to make. The most interesting thing I've been watching throughout the course of this night, it's a little bit like a Catholic mass in terms of when people are standing and when they are sitting. When the former president stands, everybody in the VIP box stands with him. When he sits down, they all sit down as well. So, if you're wondering with the standing ovation, where it came from, what they're taking their cues from, it's a little bit like a priest in church, it's Donald Trump.",

But this is certainly since he came down the escalator in 2015, the idea of crime, of illegal immigration, a big part of Trump's political DNA.",

I mean, we've seen Daniel Dale talk about that a lot, but they think it's effective.I will say that each day of this, this convention has a theme to it. Obviously, that's the theme for today, but it does seem overshadowed by what else is happening on each of these days. Yesterday, was obviously the Vance pick and seeing Donald Trump walk out with that bandage on his ear. I was just down there. I was by the South Carolina delegation when Ambassador Haley was speaking. I ran over to the Florida delegation when governor DeSantis was speaking. It was interesting to watch. The delegations of these two figures who both castigated Donald Trump said he was unfit for office. Ron DeSantis said he doesn't think that Donald Trump could beat Joe Biden, and then making that argument on stage. And I talked to the governor of South Carolina briefly. He's a big Trump ally. And he was pushing Nikki Haley's speech, saying that he thought that she did a good job of basically trying to invite those Nikki Haley voters into the Trump tent. Do they actually come? Obviously, we know the Biden campaign has been trying to lure them as well, so we'll see.",

And I encourage you to join me in praying each day for his continued protection.You know, our hearts -- our hearts go out to the victims in the audience. Let's also pray for them and their families. These events have brought unusual clarity to the times we are living in. We have all harbored the nagging feeling that everything we love is slipping away. All you have to do is turn on the television. The free press, a pillar of any free society, has abused the public trust and resorted to lies, deception, and disinformation. (BOOING) They divide us along lines of race, class, and gender, rather than uniting us around our shared bond as Americans. Our government has been no better, shredding our constitution and upending the rule of law. We have a wide-open border, a broken education system, and chaos breaking out around the world. And on top of it all, we have a president who, well, if you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all. (APPLAUSE) But ask anyone around the world, what does it mean to be an American? Most will tell you that it means unlimited opportunity, that where you begin in life doesn't dictate where you will end. That's the America I grew up in, and no other country could a poor inner-city kid raised by a single mom make it to an Ivy League school, then to medical school, become a successful neurosurgeon, run for president, and eventually become a member of the president's cabinet. (APPLAUSE) You know, and as a member of his cabinet, I had a chance to work closely with him. And I got to tell you, this is a man who is a gift to us as a nation. He is very gifted, he is very smart, he is very compassionate, he cares about people. And I'll tell you, the first time I met him was before either of us got into the political arena. And someone, we were at Mar-a-Lago, and someone came up to him and said, Mr. Trump, Rod Stewart just walked in. And he said, I don't care, this is Ben Carson. (APPLAUSE) But I feel blessed that I've been able to live the American dream. But my story is moving further out of reach in America today. The lessons my mother taught me, like hard work and the value of well-rounded patriotic education and faith in God above all else, are being forced out of the public square. But we're all here today because we know we can bring these things back. (APPLAUSE) By God's grace, we live in a country where the people rule.",
