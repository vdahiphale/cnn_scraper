Sara and I grieving with the families. He says that the heart of the -- his heart is with all of those watching over this situation. He says that they will return the abductees, all of the hostages both the dead as well as the alive. And he also congratulates the Israeli troops who were able to carry out this operation to successfully return these bodies to Israel.Obviously, sad news that these are dead bodies of hostages and not alive -- hostages who are alive being brought back to their families. But for some of these families, at least it will provide at least a measure of closure. Especially for those who have known that their loved ones were dead, according to the Israeli government, but were not yet able to bury them, to grieve, and to mourn them.",

      "sentences": "And, Jeremy, remind our viewers about this Nova Music Festival where are these three Israeli hostages were simply enjoying some music, enjoying some excitement. This is the Nova Music Festival. It was right near the Gaza Strip, but in Israel. DIAMONDThere were Hamas paragliders who arrived. Others who arrived on -- in pickup trucks firing wildly throughout the crowd. Many Israelis were killed there. Others were taken hostages. And then you have the situation of some of these individuals, including those we're talking about today, Shani Louk, Amit Buskila, and Itshak Gelernter who were killed on that day, but whose bodies were also then taken across to Gaza. Their bodies are held hostages as bargaining chips, which is a tactic that Hamas has been known to employ not only during this conflict but in years prior. But it's so important to note the impact that the Nova Music Festival has had here in Israel. It brought together people who didn't just live in those border communities, but people all across Israel. And I think it really spread the emotion and the sense of connectedness here in Israel to the victims of this attack as well as to the hostages because so many of these people didn't live in those border communities. They lived in Tel Aviv. They lived in northern Israel. They lived all across the country. And that has certainly contributed to the sense of loss, the sense of connectedness, and the sense of pain that so many Israelis have been feeling since October 7 and are certainly feeling today.",

He's speaking over at the National Museum of African American History here in the Nation's Capital as part of a civil rights focus campaign swing this weekend to try to shore up support with black Americans. They certainly helped propel him to victory in 2020 and are obviously very critical in his reelection bid.Let's discuss with CNN political commentator and Democratic Strategist Maria Cardona and CNN political commentator and Republican Strategist Alice Stewart. They're co-hosts by the way of the very popular podcast, \"HOT MICS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.\" Maria, what does the president need to say today?",

But there are some new polls that are just out including in some of these key battleground states, which show Trump winning more than 20 percent of the black vote right now. That was just about six percent in the 2020 election.So, from six percent to more than 20 percent. And if he were to win 20 percent, that would be the highest level of support for any Republican presidential candidate since the 60s and the Civil Rights Act. So, what do you think accounts for this potential shift in the electorate?",

      "sentences": "Look. I think that's a significant number also Biden, right, in that poll at 63 percent. In 2020, exit polls show him with 87 percent of the black vote. And despite what my dear friend Maria says with regard to his message to the African American community, they are not buying what he is selling. He can go to every university, he can go to museums, he can go on black-owned radio stations, and say that things are fine with the African American community under his leadership. They don't feel that way.Bernice King, the daughter of M.L.K. Jr. says black people don't feel as though they're better off under this administration. And look, African Americans are like all Americans. They feel the pain, at the pump, at the grocery store, and interest rates. They're suffering under this economy. And that's a problem. One of the big promises that he could do for African Americans was the Voting Rights Act. He wasn't able to make any progress on that. So, what we're seeing is African Americans deserting President Biden because they feel as though he has abandoned them on the promises he made when he ran for office.",
