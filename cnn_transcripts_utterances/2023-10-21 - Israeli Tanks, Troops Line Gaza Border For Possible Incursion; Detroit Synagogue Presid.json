My colleague Erin Burnett is live in Tel Aviv, Israel.And we have several major developments that we're following right now. A short time ago, Israel's military announced it is increasing air strikes beginning today and says it will launch a ground incursion when conditions are right. This is new CNN video from just outside the Gaza border. Dozens of Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers, even bulldozers are gathered in this area and several other groupings are nearby -- some of the video you're seeing right there. After days of agonizing delays, humanitarian aid has rolled into Gaza for the first time since the war began two weeks ago. The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is closed again, after the 20-truck convoy made its way through. Relief agencies say many more massive shipments of water, fuel, and food are urgently needed and that Gaza's hospital system is teetering on the verge of collapse.",

One that will certainly be costly in terms of the lives of Israeli soldiers. But there is also, of course, the issue of civilian casualties inside of Gaza as we have watched as hundreds of women and children have already been killed in those air strikes, which as Jim just noted are now intensifying ahead of this potential ground invasion. We spoke yesterday with a lieutenant colonel who is commanding a special forces unit, a reconnaissance unit preparing to go into Gaza, and one of the things that he told me was very striking which is that he said, Israel has declared the northern Gaza strip a no-go zone, effectively, telling civilians to move south. And he said that anyone who has chosen to stay there has chosen a side. Now, he did say that his units will still work to minimize civilian casualties, but certainly, if that is the message that Israeli troops are getting, that could potentially lead to a situation where troops going in consider anyone who is moving to be a target, Erin.",

But the crossing between Gaza and Egypt is closed again, and it's not clear when it will reopen.CNN's military analyst, retired Colonel Cedric Leighton, joins me now. Colonel Leighton, great to see you, as always. You know, what do we think about what is going on there at the -- at that Rafah crossing? It is puzzling to me that -- maybe not so puzzling, I suppose, your take on this -- that it would immediately shut down again after these trucks get in. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Jim, that is puzzling. It's not the way I would have envisioned something like this happening, especially when there's such a dire need of supplies by the population in Gaza, especially the folks that are waiting at the border there. So -- you know, obviously, there's a lot of diplomatic machinations going on here. And those machinations are really a problem, because people are suffering, people can potentially die. And the fact of the matter is, is that the diplomatic background that needed to happen for this wasn't completed. In other words, all the spadework that normally gets done in these areas couldn't be done for various reasons. Some of them we probably don't know about. But the basic idea is this, that the Egyptians don't want the refugees. On the other hand, the Israelis don't want supplies to come in that could be used by Hamas. And that is a really big problem. And that was a really, really big problem. And that's part of the reason that these deliveries are limited to 20 trucks at the moment. Hopefully, the gates will open again and some more trucks will come in. But it's far, far less than what's needed on a daily basis to sustain life in Gaza.",

And, Colonel, your sense as to -- I mean, we were talking about this last weekend, the expectation that this ground incursion was going to get going. We've seen hundreds of thousands of Israeli troops amassing at the border. They have bulldozers and that sort of thing standing by, ready to go. What could be holding them back?
