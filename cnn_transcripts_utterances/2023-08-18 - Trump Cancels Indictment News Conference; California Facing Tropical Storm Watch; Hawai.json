The way Maui is geographically is, you have the main island, mass and then West Maui, which juts out. That's where I am right now, where Lahaina is to the south and the towns of Kaanapali all the way up to Napili, where I am now, and Kapalua. Those are the towns that cannot support tourism at this time because of the decimated infrastructure. The rest of the island is welcoming tourists.

Of course, that is part of a broader funding request which already faces an uphill battle. But, at least for FEMA, there is growing concern about what it might mean if these funds are depleted by the end of the month. Already, the federal government has tallied 15 weather-related disasters that funds include over a billion dollars have gone to the assistance and recovery for those disasters, just to give you a sense of just how much funds they have already had to use before the hurricane season has started in earnest. Now, the FEMA administrator told reporters here at the White House this week that they expect to have enough funds for the initial response in Maui, but any delay in further funds could put their recovery into next year.

In their filing, they argue -- quote -- \"The government's objective is clear, to deny President Trump and his counsel a fair ability to prepare for a trial. The court should deny the government's request.\" And, of course, the government is requesting to take this to trial on January 2, 2024. But this is going to be up to the judge, Judge Tanya Chutkan. She has the final say, and she's looking at a calendar that's pretty crowded. You have got the possibility of four criminal trials, in addition to civil matters. And I think there is a legitimate question, could this be the one or one of the trials that happens before the 2024 election?
