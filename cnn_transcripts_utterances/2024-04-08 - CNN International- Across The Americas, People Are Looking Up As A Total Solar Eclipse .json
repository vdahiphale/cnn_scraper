Here is the path of the eclipse, and weather permitting, it should be visible to 32 million people in the so-called path of totality, across more than 10 U.S. states. The next one is due in 2044, two decades from now. Today's is set to become a huge communal event across what can only be described as a bitterly divided country.

And you have a new piece out about artificial intelligence, sayingthat AI could actually help rebuild the middle class. But, before we get to that, let's do a little bit of a walk through history. For a long time, whether it's back in the Luddites in the early 1800s, they felt technology would destroy jobs. The followers of Ned Ludd smashed the looms of England. Has there ever been a case where technology decreases the total number of jobs?",

And the transition from the artisanal era, where people made things by hand with tremendous expertise from start to finish, to the early industrial era was wrenching for labor. It displaced a lot of skilled, valuable skills, people who were tailors and blacksmiths and wheel rights and so on. And a lot -- what we ended up with initially was a lot of unmarried women and children working indentured servitude, in dangerous factories, using very few skills, and getting paid very little. And the first five decades of the Industrial Revolution were not a good time for labor. Wages didn't rise, even though productivity rose. And why was that? Because expertise, what was needed, was not scarce. You just needed people, physical bodies, who could tend (ph) machines. Now, that changed over time as industry advanced. The machines became more complex until the industrial era eventually gave rise to a period of what I'm going to call demand for mass expertise, people who could do those skilled tasks on assembly lines, but also in the offices. Right? You can think of early 20th century offices being like an assembly line for information. And although that set of skills was quite different, not like the artisans, they weren't making cars from end to end, one person at a time, but the ability to operate a lathe or to install a wheel, or to proofread and typeset a document, those were valuable skills. They were made very productive and efficient by automation, by the Industrial Revolution, by this new way of organizing work. And that led to a lot of economic growth, both for consumers and for workers that powered us from really the late 18th century all the way up through the 1980s.",

They were skilled tasks, but they followed well understood rules and procedures. And so, that actually caused this pushing -- workers to be pushed out of middle skilled jobs, out of production jobs, out of office jobs, administrative support, and clerical jobs, and it created a bifurcated labor market. On the one hand, if you're a professional or a technical or a managerial worker, you're a decision maker. And computing is a great input into decision making. It gives you data. It gives you analysis. It gives you all the information you need. You still have to do the hard work of deciding, how do I care for this cancer patient? How do I design a building that people want to live in? How do I architect a piece of software? How do I contract and re-engineer a house, right? So, those are hard decisions. Computing is really valuable. It makes that work better. It makes people more valuable in doing that work. For those people, however, who are not fortunate enough to have a college education, which is more than half of the workforce, many of them as they were moved out of middle skilled jobs, they ended up in services that use relatively generic expertise, food service, cleaning, security, entertainment, recreation, home care. And again, those jobs are socially valuable, but because they don't require specialized skills and expertise, they pay poorly. And so, the computer revolution, it didn't reduce employment. We have high unemployment to population ratios. What it did was it bifurcated the labor force and kind of cut out the middle rungs of the ladder that weakened the middle class, reduced economic mobility, and created a big divide between more educated and less educated workers. And that's really what we'd be contending with for the last four decades. From approximately 1980 to approximately 2020, we've been really feeling the effects of this polarization of employment.",

Artificial intelligence is the opposite. It learns inductively and it learns from examples. It learns from looking at unstructured data and drawing out patterns and recognizing regularities that are useful for making decisions, for predicting what's going to come next. And in fact, it's an irony. It's actually the opposite of traditional computing. If I told you the world's frontier computer technology can't do math and can't keep facts straight, you'd say that sounds doesn't sound like a very advanced technology, but that's what AI is. Right? It's really good at learning from example and extrapolating from example.

But, that scarcity actually is a problem for the rest of us. Right? So, if you and I were professionals, it's great. If we pay for healthcare and it's expensive, we say, well, great, I'm being rewarded well as a professional. Good for me. But, if I'm an auto worker or I work at Walmart, I still pay the same price for healthcare and for education. I'm not on the upside the equation, only the downside. Right? So, if we could actually -- if it was possible to make some of those services less expensive, more accessible, it's true. We made -- the premium salary paid to the mostly professionals may go down a bit. But, if that creates a lot more jobs for others that enables people without as much formal training to still do really good work, I don't mean no training, I just mean the right level. And it lowers the prices of those services for others, makes education more affordable, more accessible, actually more interesting, if it makes healthcare more available to more folks, if it means that -- software is actually less expensive to create. So, you can create customized applications for your business or for your home. Right? There is a lot of benefit to that. So, I'm not arguing that everybody always wins. In all these cases of technological change, they've always created winners and losers. Right? The artisans lost out. It took 50 years for the workers, the industrial-era workers to start to benefit. Computerization benefited professionals a great deal. It really was not good for middle skilled workers. It was not good for office workers. It was not good for production workers. It just made a lot of their skills redundant and increased aggregate wealth. But, the distributional consequences were pretty crappy. Most of the time, technology is good for the elite, and not so good for everybody else.
