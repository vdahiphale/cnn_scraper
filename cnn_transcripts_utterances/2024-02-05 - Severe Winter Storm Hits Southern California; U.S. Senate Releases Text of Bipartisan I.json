There are places with nine inches of rain already on the ground in some of these automated rain gauges, and another three to five inches still possible today.

Speaker Mike Johnson, he called the bill dead on arrival in the House. But here's how Republican Senator James Lankford, who negotiated the bill, responded to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK):  Are we as Republicans going to have press conferences and complain the border is bad and then intentionally leave it open? It's amazing to me, if I go back two months ago and say we have the shot under a Democrat president to dramatically increase detention beds, deportation flights, lock down the border, to be able to change the asylum laws, to be able to accelerate the process, no one would have believed.

Some people say it doesn't go far enough, others say it's on point, and others are still trying to digest the thing because it's so long.But what is means for people here on the border, you've got to think about what Mike Johnson said, that this is dead on arrival. And so what it means for people, for example, here in Eagle Pass, is that razor wire, like the one that you see here, will continue to be in their community, and you've got to think about it like this. If you live in New York, you have Central Park. There are central parks all over the country. We all have our green spaces in the cities where we live. For the people in Eagle Pass, Shelby Park is their central park, and all of a sudden, the state took over the area. They wrapped razor wire around the park, took it over, gates went up, and soldiers with long guns were guarding those gates in Humvees. That was their reality given the border situation. And now if you think I'm away from the border, this doesn't impact me. Well, just this weekend, about a dozen governors joined Governor Greg Abbott here in Shelby Park, here in Eagle Pass, and not only were they supporting Governor Abbott doing all of this, taking over city property without the input of citizens, but they said that they supported states' rights to enforce border security. You've got to think about it like this -- these governors are saying that it's states who should be enforcing immigration law, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has maintained that immigration is a federal function. And the point here being, Poppy and Phil, is that so long as Congress does not act on the border and doesn't fix the issue, states like Texas are going to continue taking matters into their own hands.

There's no question to that. But we've always wondered, well, what is Mexico asking for in exchange? That's what we learned a little more about this weekend in a conversation that happened between President Joe Biden the president of Mexico. And this is according to Mexico's presidency office.And he said that they proposed, Mexicans proposed a multiplatform plan to U.S. diplomats during that meeting, Poppy, that you're mentioning, and that some of those points on that proposal included $20 billion for development in Latin American countries, immigration relief for Mexicans who are already in the United States, and the lifting of sanctions for Cuba and Venezuela, among other things. But the point being here is that Mexico is helping the United States curb illegal immigration, and Mexico is also asking for things in exchange. We're going to have to see how that plays out. but the other thing that the Mexican president say is that so long as the legislation, and he has not commented on the legislation, we're waiting for reaction to that.

You have written several pieces about this which have really both raised interesting points and very real questions about the strategy here. And I want to pull one thing that caught my eye, which is saying, you wrote, \"Given the largely unsuccessful history of such U.S. strikes against Iranian proxy groups in the Middle East, the U.S. response along with any subsequent military action is likely to deter Iranian proxies from further attacks on American targets and shipping in the region.\" You make the case that to tamp down these attacks, the focus needs to be on Gaza.

So you know, none of this is easy, and you're choosing from a menu of least bad options, but I don't think -- you know, we have to be realistic about the kind of war we're actually in. One is, it is a regional war; two, the strikes may not deter Iran; and three, then you have to make very hard decisions about what you do next. One approach with course is, you know, massive cyber warfare against Iranian military command and control that is A., plausibly deniable, and B., does really sort of interfere with our ability to communicate with these proxies. Now, that may even be happening, we don't know. But that is certainly one option that the United States has on the table.

Being sloppy, is not the same as being potentially criminal.And there will be a rush to create an equivalency between former President Trump's conduct and President Biden's conduct and they're just apples and oranges. Number one, upon hearing of the sort of presence of sensitive documents, President Biden and his team immediately moved to bring authorities in and number two didn't obstruct the investigation, allegedly. Now, that's vastly different than former President Trump's conduct. Now, people will see them as one of the same particularly if, as you said, Poppy, those photographs come out, and if you see boxes of photos, boxes of sensitive documents in President Biden's garage or whatever else, I think there'll be a rush to say, well, it's the same as Donald Trump. It simply isn't. It's just not the same under the law.",
