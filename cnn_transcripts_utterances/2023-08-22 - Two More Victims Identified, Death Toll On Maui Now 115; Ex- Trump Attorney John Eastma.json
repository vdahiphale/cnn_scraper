And still, even with those identifications, a very tough reality is setting in for the community, which is many of the missing may never be found.About 850 people are still unaccounted for. The death toll now stands at 115 people killed. Officials now say they have been able to search all single-story residential buildings which then leads to another phase, combing through the commercial and multi-story properties destroyed by the flames. CNN's Kayla Tausche joins us now for more. Kayla, the president, and the first lady, they visited yesterday. What are you hearing from the White House, from the president, from -- what are you hearing from the White House about what the president's takeaway was from this visit?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate. On that visit, President Biden and the first lady were able to see firsthand the destruction of the land on Maui. The devastation of the people. They saw that fire-ravaged area by air in Marine One, by land in the president's motorcade, and by foot touring some of the rubble with local officials and with search dogs that are committed to that recovery effort.And President Biden sought burned-out buildings. He saw burned-out cars. He asked questions about why some land was more susceptible to burning than other parts of the land. And he was given very frank assessments by those local officials about how Maui got to this position and what is going to be needed from the government to rebuild from here. But President Biden also learned that there's still a good bit of animosity that remains on the island. When he arrived at the airport, the crowd that was gathered had some messages that were peppered with very angry posters, middle fingers, and one poster that said no comment, which was a reference to the remarks that Biden made just a couple of weeks ago in the immediate aftermath of the fire while he was on vacation. But when he took the podium to deliver a message directly to the Hawaiian people, directly to the American people, he had a relatively light-hearted tone, but he also wove in some personal touchstones of his own experience with grief and loss. And he said that the federal government is going to be committed to helping Maui rebuild. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Meyer ended up dying the day after police executed that raid of her home. Her son believes stress from the raid contributed to her death. Computers, phones, and other items are taken from the home but have since been returned. The newspaper became nationally known after an uproar over police raiding the newspaper's offices. Meyer's son, who co-owns the paper says the raid was prompted in retaliation for a story the paper publicized about a local business owner. Police have said they did nothing wrong. And they said they were investigating what they termed identity theft. But prosecutors have ordered the police to return all of the items that they seized from those offices. Now, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation is looking into the case and the actions of the police. Kate. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
