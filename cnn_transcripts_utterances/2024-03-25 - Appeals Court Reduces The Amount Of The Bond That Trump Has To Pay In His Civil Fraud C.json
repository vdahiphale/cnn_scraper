      "sentences": "All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. My colleague, Bianna Golodryga is off today. You areindeed watching \"One World\". This is a major day for former President Donald Trump and, of course, all of his legal problems. Just a short time ago, he got a major win from the New York Appeals Court. The Appeals Court has dramatically reduced the amount of the bond that Trump has to pay in his civil fraud case. He now needs to pay just about $175 million, not the nearly half billion dollars that his lawyers said that he simply could not pay. The Appeals Court is also giving him 10 more days, so a little bit more additional time here, to make that payment. Today had been the deadline to pay that bond, and the New York Attorney General could have begun to seize Donald Trump's bank accounts, to freeze the bank accounts, and to seize his assets, his properties, if he missed the deadline. He now, of course, has an extension, and the amount has been significantly reduced. Trump is also in court today for an important hearing in his New York hush money case. That case is due to start in exactly one month, but the judge is considering at this point in time whether or not to set a new trial date. Donald Trump's lawyers are trying to delay it at issue today. It's a dispute over document discovery that has already delayed the case once. The judge has seemed somewhat skeptical of Trump's lawyers' arguments thus far, and commented that their legal filing on the issue went far afield. He also scolded Trump's lawyers for accusing prosecutors of misconduct without presenting any evidence to back that up. We'll be covering the story from, of course, a variety of angles. There's so much to get through today, but let's start with CNN's Alayna Treene. So, Alayna, a huge victory just going back to the reduction of this bond amount by more than half -- $175 million is what Donald Trump has to come up with in the next 10 days or so. A huge victory for him, but he just came out of the courtroom moments ago still criticizing Judge Engoron. Just walk us through what happened there.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's exactly what he was most worried about, Zain. You're completely right. Donald Trump -- he had been tangled in legal issues forseveral years. Even long before he became President of the United States, he had been caught up in many legal battles regarding his properties, regarding money. And so far, he's been able to successfully avoid what he was potentially facing today with that bond deadline and the seizing -- potential seizing, I should say, of assets and properties. And the problem there is, one, it does strike to the core of who he is, that case. You know, he's a wealthy businessman. He was a businessman before he became a politician. And it's something he wants the country and his voters to see him as. The other thing is, again, the public perception around the idea that he might not have as much cash as he claims. And, so that's where a lot of this comes in. And again, as I mentioned, it is a lifeline for Donald Trump, this Appeals Court decision. It really does allow him to avoid the embarrassment of not being able to post the bond in that judgment. And so that's really where it comes down to. I will say, however, that with all of his four criminal indictments, as well as the charges in the trial we saw with the New York civil fraud trial, Donald Trump and his campaign have successfully used that to their advantage. They have successfully been able to fundraise a ton of money, raise a lot of donations off of these different trials and court appearances, as well as really galvanize the Republican base around him. But the big question now is, as we look ahead to his other future potential trials, we look at this, you know, squabble over the bond, is how will it play with general election voters? And that is still something that I know from my conversations with the Trump campaign. They're not entirely sure how that will play out. And it's something that they are very much concerned about and trying to deal with behind the scenes as they plan for what's going to be a very aggressive and busy campaign cycle and him being on the campaign trail, while also having to potentially be in court for this New York hush money case, as well as potentially if there's other trials that he faces before the November election.

As Alayna was just saying, the hush money case is, of course, important, sure. But the bond case, the financial fraud case, really strikes at the core of who Donald Trump is, his reputation, his identity, dare I say it, his ego, as well. Just in terms of what happens next, obviously this idea of him having to only pay $175 million or come up with $175 million is a huge win for him. But the big question is whether or not bond underwriters would be able to cover that amount -- would be willing to cover that amount. What happens if they don't? Just walk us through what the next steps are in terms of what we can expect over the next 10 days.",

But if he cannot receive a bond or a company to underwrite that amount of money, which I think the general amount that is able to be done in most business transactions and what he did put in his papers is about $100 million. So, he has 10 days to post that bond. If he's unable to do it for some reason, then we would go back to where we were before. The process of the file judgment and the potential liens on properties and seizure of assets could be done. Now, it seems like they're pretty confident because of these public statements. And I've gone through all the filings that $175 million is feasible. But look, it's still a feat to be done. And we'll have to wait until the expiration of the 10 days to see if it's actually accomplished.",

There are a lot of legalhurdles to overcome in New York State and protections in New York State. So, on one hand, as you pointed out, these companies are not just owned by Donald Trump. They're owned by LLCs. They're part of a trust. There's mortgages, there's lenders, there's banks, there's taxes. There's all sorts of issue involved in the very complicated corporate structure of every single one of these properties and of these entities and of all of the potential assets that could be subject to seizure and ultimately subject to satisfying that judgment. So it's a long process. The first step would be potentially to find any bank accounts. That's maybe the most clear cut and easy to identify bank accounts and go to those bank accounts and present that warrant that comes with the execution of a judgment. With respect to properties, it's a bit more complicated because of that complicated corporate structure. There's going to be a lot of legal issues to actually move forward and actually seizing the companies, which would then result in a sale and then that money would go to satisfying the judgments. You're talking years and years down the road and a unique analysis with respect to each property, if it were to get to that point where the attorney general is actually seizing the properties to satisfy the judgment. Right now, though, we're on pause, right? The appellate process will play out. You know, the 175 million will be there. And then after the appellate process plays out, will he owe the rest of it? Will it be less? Will it be the same? We can't possibly tell at this point.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. So, there's -- there's an issue with respect to discovery. The discovery process is where documents and information areturned over by the prosecutors to the defense. What happened in this case is back in July, a whole host of documents were turned over by the district attorney's office. There's what's called an open records discovery process with the D.A., which basically means that every single piece of paper, every single piece of information in their possession is turned over. That was back in July of last year. Now, come January of this year, Trump's legal team actually serves subpoenas on the Southern District, New York, and they serve that for documents and information relating to Michael Cohen, who is a central witness in the Hush Money case that we're going to see in a New York courtroom. So, there's a really long period of time before Donald Trump's team even tries to get additional documents. So that's just in January. Now, those documents have been received. You know, there's hundreds -- there's over one hundred thousand documents. That's a lot of documents. Initially, a 30 day delay was agreed upon. But upon review of the documents, what the state district attorney is saying, a lot of these are either not relevant or duplicative. They already had them. So, there's only a couple hundred that really matter to the case. And because of that, we can get this trial underway much faster. So, it's not really about the amount of documents. It's about the content. What are they and what do they mean as far as the discovery process? So, that's at the heart of the dispute. And again, Trump's team is saying that there was prosecutorial misconduct. You know, the judge in the courtroom today, very, very skeptical of that, saying that they were holding these back, these documents purposefully.

I think that, you know, they had secured really a small victory initially when the judge agreed to give them a 30- day delay from the trial, pushing it from March 25th to the earliest date being April 15th or 30 days later. And so, they had that small victory. But today, they are going to be moving forward with an April 15th trial.

It is the same type of rhetoric that Donald Trump uses to rail against all of the legal battles that he is facing. We've heard him time and again describe every single indictment that has been brought against him as being political, as being election interference. Now, I will say him giving these remarks now, and we do believe he may be giving remarks in New York later today, as well, to speak with the media. It's very clear that he is using this as a campaign stop in itself. Yes, it's going to be very difficult for Donald Trump to run the type of normal presidential general election campaign while he has this trial ongoing at a very key pivotal point in 2024, a very big election year. But he's going to continue to do these types of stops and speaking with the media while outside court, wherever he can, to try and take advantage of the media narrative. And I will say they've been able to do that so far to great effect. We've seen them successfully be able to fundraise off of all of the charges that he is facing, as well as galvanize voters around him. But you can tell definitely he is very angry about this. And I do just want to point out he addressed the bond deadline today, as well as the appeals court decision, which lowered that bond by around $300 million, making it far easier for Donald Trump and his team to pay that bond. But that and this trial date and the hearing in his New York hush money case, those are two things happening on the same day in the same city.

This is a way for the Israeli Prime Minister to voice his growing frustration with the United States, growing criticism of the way that Israel is conducting this war, is U.S. concerns about a potential ground offensive in Rafah and ultimately culminating in the U.S. allowing this U.N. Security Council resolution to actually pass via an abstention rather than vetoing that resolution altogether. The Israeli Prime Minister stated reasons for canceling this is because he says, according to his office, that this resolution does not demand -- does not link the release of the hostages to an immediate ceasefire. But we should note that the text of this resolution does indeed demand both. It calls for an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan, and it also says that it, quote, \"demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\". That apparently wasn't enough for the Israeli Prime Minister, who canceled this visit by Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel's National Security Adviser, and Ron Dermer, one of the Israeli Prime Minister's closest advisers and a member of the war cabinet. Both men were scheduled to leave tonight for Washington to discuss this potential ground offensive in Rafah. And what the U.S. wants to discuss, which is alternatives to that ground offensive. But we should note that this visit, despite the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister had agreed to send some of his top advisers to hear out U.S. alternatives to this ground offensive, he has repeatedly telegraphed over the course of this last week that there was no alternative that he would accept, saying that he believed that a ground offensive in Rafah is the only way to achieve his goals of dismantling Hamas, and in this case, dismantling what he has described as Hamas' last bastion in Rafah. But certainly, something that could potentially increase the tensions in this relationship between the United States and Israel. Although, of course, as it relates to Israel actually accepting any U.S. alternatives, this visit probably wasn't going to change that anyways. Zain.",

      "sentences": "Right. And I, as well. Great to see you and talk with you, Zain. Look, Donald Trump looks at this muchdifferently than -- than many other people, and his base believes exactly what he's saying on this issue. And what he's doing, whether we're talking about the two cases today, one being the hush money case in New York where the judge has just issued an April 15th date for that court, that trial to start. Needless to say, Donald Trump was frustrated with that. The other issue being that the Appeals Court has ruled in New York that the -- the fine he had to pay was one hundred seventy five million as opposed to half a billion. And they're giving him 10 extra days. That's a relief for Donald Trump in terms of he can come up with that kind of money and also has a little bit more time to do so. That being said, Donald Trump lumps these two cases as well, as the other two cases with the exact same vein, and that these all are instances where the legal system, liberal justices are going after him and targeting him because they see him as a threat to Donald Trump. They look at this. He says this is a witch hunt. He says this is prosecutorial misconduct. And as he said just recently, when the trial date was set just a few moments ago, Zain, he said that this is election interference and they're trying to keep him from being out on the campaign trail because they see him as a threat to Joe Biden. Look, most rational people, Zain, see that all of these cases are different. There are different charges in each separate case and they should be looked at differently and separately. And he should face the consequences if there is wrongdoing. But what he's doing is appealing to his base, putting him as a victim here. As he walked into court earlier today, he told the press this was a hoax. And he doesn't look at these cases individually, whether it's -- whether we're talking about Fani Willis, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Jack Smith, each of those involved in these cases, he's not looking at them from that standpoint. He says these are all Biden trials -- all Biden trials to go after him because he is a threat to Joe Biden. Look, that's not the case, but that's how he's appealing to his base. But Zain, the problem is right now, this is a game of addition. He not -- doesn't need to just energize his base. He needs to broaden the electorate in the general election if he wants to -- to do well in November. And putting himself as the victim here isn't the way to go about it. I think he needs to get on the campaign trail and talk about issues that voters care about, which are inflation, immigration and national security. Well, his ability to campaign is going to be interrupted, isn't it, this year because of the trial. But just in terms of what you're saying there, I mean, obviously, yes, it does help him with his base. This idea of, you know, look, I told you, see, they're all out to get me. They're all out to get me. I told you. But the independent voters in this country, they see this. They see a former president on trial in an election year. And they think, what? I mean, you've got to remember, this is more to our international audience, that independent voters in America, they're the ones who actually decide elections in this country. So, what are they going to make of this? That's the key point, Zain, is that the independent voters or what we call the mushy middle, they're the ones that move a general election one way or the other. Look, Donald Trump's voters and his base are going to come out for him. President Biden's base will come out for him. But the larger sector of American voters are these independents. And the key right now is we're seeing a lot of polling right now. They're looking at these legal issues and saying this is a concern. But many of them also say if he's convicted in any of these cases before November, they're not going to vote for him. So, that's the concern for the Trump campaign is these independent voters are actually waiting to see what happens with these legal cases. And if they go and if he's convicted, that could turn a lot of these voters away. And that should be a -- that is a huge concern. That's why they continue to try and delay these cases or certainly request for them to be dropped. But because they know that this is a real liability with independent voters.",

Trump's media company just announced its shares will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Shareholders voted last week to take the company public with the merger closing in the past hour. CNN's Matt Egan joins us live now. I mean, people had been wondering, they had sort of been speculating whether Donald Trump could sell his shares, perhaps, and raise enough money to cover the bond in this New York fraud judgment case. But it's a lot more complicated than that because there is a lockout period. So, you can't immediately sell his shares or get loans based on their valuation. Just walk us through that.",

This is a big financial win for the former president, but it's not one that he's going tobe immediately able to monetize, which, of course, is really what he needs. But just to go back to the news that really just came in the last few minutes, Digital World Acquisition Corporation, that is the publicly traded Shell company, they announced that they have closed this merger with Truth Social owner Trump Media and trading is expected to begin tomorrow under the ticker symbol DJT on the Nasdaq. And so, this sets the stage for the former president to own a dominant stake in the new company. The SEC filings call for Trump to own 79 million shares of this company. And Digital World stock has gone up significantly, 26 percent higher at last check, 25 percent. And so, the higher this stock goes, the richer that Trump is, at least on paper, because that stake is now worth more than three billion dollars. But to your point, Zain, he can't immediately get at that money because there are these lock-up restrictions, right. I mean, insiders are generally prevented from immediately hitting the exit as soon as the ink dries on a deal. And I think that's for good reason, right? It doesn't usually look good, but it would look particularly bad here because Trump is -- he's not just the face of the company. You know, he's arguably the product itself. And so experts have told me that in all likelihood, these restrictions would prevent Trump from immediately selling or even borrowing against the value, the rising value of that stake. Of course, those restrictions in theory could get waived. We haven't gotten any word that that's the case here. But there's another big concern and big issue here with this company and this merger, and that's the valuation. Experts tell me that the market has a very, very high valuation right now on Trump media that doesn't really make any sense when you look at the fundamentals, right? I mean, this is a company that has been burning cash. It's piling up losses. Truth Social itself is losing users. The company has generated very little revenue, and yet the market is valuing this company in the billions of dollars. One professor told me that this stock is clearly a bubble. Another told me that it's basically a meme stock. So, we're going to have to watch very carefully what happens, because Zain, you know, as well as I do, that as soon as this starts trading tomorrow, you're going to have a lot of real people start to go into the stock, whether or not it makes sense.",
