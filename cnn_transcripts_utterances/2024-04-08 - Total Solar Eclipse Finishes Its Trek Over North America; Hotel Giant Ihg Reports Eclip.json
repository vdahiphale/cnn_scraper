Totality has crossed over at the Atlantic. Live from New York, it is Monday, April 8th. I am Julia Chatterley and this is this is CNN NEWSROOM. And good evening once again, eclipse day across North America. We've been getting some truly stunning images from inside the Path of Totality. Those places as the name implies, saw a total solar eclipse lasting for just a few magical minutes. Millions of people traveled inside the path to view the rare spectacle. Totality has just moved over the Atlantic Ocean. As I mentioned, many people are still seeing a partial solar eclipse, however. Now the watching party started on Mexico's Pacific shoreline, Mazatlan was in a total eclipse shortly after 11:00 AM local time, and then it was the city of Torreon's turn. Just take a look at this.

People were looking lovingly into each other's eyes and you can feel that difference and they were quiet. There are soaking in that moment as couples in that moment because they had just gotten married. So it was a beautiful moment and such a different experience and what I heard my colleagues like Ed Lavandera and Rosa Flores in Texas, I could hear them and I could hear all the cheering that was happening there, very different here in Arkansas. And we thought we were going to get some rain, and that cleared out. We just had a beautiful blue sky, Julia. We were able to see the sky and it was that -- you know, there were a lot of diamond rings that were given out today, but there was also a very clear view with your naked eye of the ring around the moon and it was just stellar, completely stellar.",

It was an amazing feeling and then we got some clouds in Kerrville, Texas, not a great shot there, but you could kind of see it. It broke out for Dallas, Texas and all the way up through Arkansas and even into Indianapolis. And then we had a live shot from Buffalo, New York, my hometown that didn't work out. That was just a misty mess near Niagara Falls, and then we have Derek Van Dam up in Vermont. It was just really amazing. But you talked about how the weather does cool down and yes, it does. That sunshine warms the ground. The ground radiates the heat and the thermometers feel it, and we definitely had a dip there across parts of the eclipse. Now, also something else we have going on across the eclipse is the potential for severe weather. All of these people who aren't from this area are now going to be feeling the effects of the threat of severe weather, large hail, the possibility and maybe even of a tornado and flash flooding. So yes, we see the stripe and think, oh, everyone must live in there. No, no. Millions of people drove to that stripe from other places across the country. So we will have to keep watching that. If you're listening to us either on XM or whatever it might be, make sure as you drive the car home tonight, you know what county that you're in because that is how the warning this will come out or have the GPS turned on your phone. That means the phone knows where it is and the phone will know if severe weather pops up in your near location. So yes, we had some clouds, but I will tell you what, Julia, it could have been a lot worse. I mean, we were thinking we were thinking 10 days ago that it could be 80 percent cloud cover for 80 percent of the people, and that just didn't happen. So really, a lot of very happy people here. I think the shows went well, and Stephanie Elam, if you're still listening, please get me a CD from that Beatles cover band because they were so amazing. They even looked the part. They had the bowl cuts around their head and everything is like, wait, that's really them isn't it? They sounded so fantastic.

It is only happening on the very sunset and it is all gone. And then I can't see it because it eclipses too late. So Cleveland, you're going to be a hundred percent and you were all of a sudden, your temperatures went from the 60s down into the 50s, and it is going to be a night that I think people are going to remember for their entire lifetime. If you really got to totality and my son got to totality in Indianapolis. He said it was just an unbelievable event.

But we also tried to deliver on those prices and make sure that our guests had some very good experiences, whether that be igloos in Cleveland, you know the igloos that have the kind of canopy that you can rent out with their own special menus. Or just free breakfast and a bottle of champagne and a blanket in Niagara Falls where it might still be a bit chilly. So we activated really well and I think that is how we are in that business.

The IDF didn't say what that operation was, but it certainly gives the political space for the Prime Minister to say, or to imply that these forces or others with them could be going into Rafah. Now, the fact that he says he's set a date, and the fact that he has a negotiating team that's trying to negotiate with Hamas at the moment, and Hamas that seems to be holding out on some -- on a precondition that Israel has. This is the sticking point of how many people from the South of Gaza can return to their homes in the north of Gaza. Israel wants a level of control over it in terms of numbers, in terms of inspections of people doing that. And going back, and Hamas wants to have freedom of movement for all Gaza residents if they want to go back to the north on day one of a ceasefire, then so be it. They should be able to do that. That's Hamas's view and that's where the gap is. So, you know, in terms of negotiation, the prime minister has a strong hand it would seem by threatening the possibility of a military operation in Rafah, this is something the White House doesn't want. However, when the prime minister announced the pulling out of troops from Khan Yunis, hardline members, Ben -- Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister said that if we did that and didn't go to war and get the final Hamas battalions in Rafah, then he wouldn't have a mandate to be prime minister. So, internal pressures on the prime minister. This does seem to be at the moment, the prime minister on the one hand placating his international pressures. On the other hand, placating his domestic pressures, and on the other hand, putting pressure on Hamas to come to a negotiated agreement to release the hostages.",

So, the Biden administration has really been focused on trying to grow the U.S. manufacturing of these advanced semiconductors, this $6.6 billion investment will go a long way in terms of doing that. TSMC had already been in the process of building two fabrication plants in Arizona. Now, it says it will build a third, bringing its total investment in the U.S. to $65 billion. As she said there, one question that I have, Julia, though, is how TSMC is going to find the workforce to staff these plants? These three fabrication plants in Arizona are expected to create around 6,000 high-paying tech jobs. But these semiconductor manufacturing roles are highly specialized.
