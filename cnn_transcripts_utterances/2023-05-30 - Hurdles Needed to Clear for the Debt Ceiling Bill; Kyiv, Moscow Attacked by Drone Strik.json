But House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says he's not worried about that committee. Both Republican and Democratic leaders are facing revolts from within their ranks by members who think their side gave up too much in the negotiations. But the U.S. President is optimistic. The deal will make it across the finish line. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: You know, I never say I'm confident with the Congress going to do it, but I feel very good about it. There is no reason why it shouldn't get done by the fifth. I'm confident that we'll get a vote in both houses and we'll see. (END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK: Well, many members of Congress are falling in line, realizing it's either the deal on the table or a financial crisis that was entirely preventable. But not everyone is in a mood to compromise despite the risk of default. Some lawmakers in both parties say the deal is unacceptable. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY): I'm saying I'm still undecided because we are still reviewing the bill. We've been talking a lot about spending, but we're not talking about revenue. These so-called cuts that Republicans want to make. They're making these cuts while not being open or willing to discuss, making sure the wealthy pay their fair share. REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): I certainly hope that there won't be Republican support for it. I hope that we can kill it, whether it's in the Rules Committee or whether in the Republican Conference before we bring it to the floor, and go back to a bill that will actually cut our spending, reform our Congress so that we can save our country fiscally.

And that's what Republicans wanted. For Republicans, they did get some concessions. There is essentially a freeze on spending for about a year, and then it will only go up incrementally. They also got some concessions with respect to requiring people who receive certain benefits to work a certain number of hours. So there's a little bit in here for everyone, but on the whole, I think, It's better for Democrats, but still, people say they had to go to the table at all, and President Biden said, I won't negotiate.

This might be a distant memory. Now, if, in fact, this deal falls through, if, in fact, we do default on the debt and there is almost guaranteed economic catastrophe, people will blame those in power. They will obviously blame the president, but I think that they will also blame the Speaker of the House as well. So in terms of how that would play for the next election, it really depends who people want to place the most blame on their feet.

What will that mean for us internationally? What will that mean for us domestically? And people tend to feel really removed from the federal government that would change if the federal government stops being able to make payments and people will feel all the ways that the federal government affects our lives.

So I think the American economy is for sure cheering this outcome. Did Republicans get as much as they want? For sure, they were much more aggressive in their early asks, but equally, they don't control the Senate, they don't control the White House. It's kind of crazy that they got anything out of this at all.And Democrats, particularly on the left, we're very disappointed that there was work requirements put in for food stamps. There's no evidence these work requirements help anyone work. It's just a way of being a little harsher on those who maybe really need help. So Democrats, I think, will be somewhat disappointed by that. But, you know, so there's the ideological push and pull.

Uganda is very dependent on support from the European Union and the U.S. for both humanitarian aid and, in the U.S. case, military support. But he has stood firm and says this law should be put forward and these punishments should be meted out.Now, despite the talk of sovereignty, there is a growing body of evidence that U.S. groups were certainly involved in helping Ugandan lawmakers push through this law, the conservative groups, and the same is the case in Ghana, where a similar law is being proposed.

The three crew members on board the craft are set to man China's space station, taking over from the previous Shenzhou-15 astronauts. Let's get you more on these developments.

      "sentences": "Yeah, Laila, this really marks another incremental but major step forward in the Chinese space program and really ushering this phase of routine operations for the self-made space station of the country, the Tiangong. Now, let's not forget the core module of this space station entered orbit only back in 2021. And by the end of last year, they had already completed construction of this T-shaped three module structure.And now, there's already talk about further expanding this into a cross shaped structure to extend research capabilities. And when the spacecraft actually docks with the Tiangong in the coming hour, we are going to see six Chinese astronauts in this structure. And that is really quite a feat considering this country's first manned space mission was only launched 20 years ago, back in 2003. Now this latest crew, of course, the three astronauts, they're going to conduct a series of experiments and research doing their five months stay in space, but also, of course, installing, testing new equipment and conducting spacewalks, all of that has become increasingly common. Now, one of the most fascinating aspects about this latest crew, as you mentioned, is it's the first time China is sending a civilian into space, a professor from a very prestigious aeronautics university here in Beijing. And he is a payload expert and not a pilot, but he still went through very rigorous training here on the ground before being selected. And of course, the fact it's noteworthy is because all previous astronauts in China, from China have been military personnel. And that, of course, very much pointing to the military driven and military run nature of the space program here which is really at the foundation of its success not only in manned space missions, but also unmanned missions including lunar and Mars probes. But of course that's also been a source of controversy which is also why the U.S. Congress has largely banned space cooperation between the two countries. Laila.",
