Now lots to get into this hour includingNetanyahu's next move, pressure growing on the Israeli Prime Minister's intentions to scrap his highly controversial judicial overhaul amid widespread protests and strikes the Israeli President again urging Netanyahu to change course, we'll have the latest from Israel coming up just ahead. Plus, Cook's confidence Apple CEO hails China's importance to his firm during the visit to Beijing soothing words amid the upsurge in tech tensions between China and the U.S also Alibaba's Jack Ma returning to Mainland China after a year-long absence. What does all this mean for China's tech sector and we'll have a live report coming up. Now on financial markets, U.S. futures and European stocks are on the rise of selling pressure in the banking sector eases shares of Deutsche Bank which fell as much as 13 percent on fresh banking uncertainties on Friday are up some 4 percent in European trading. Right now, as you can see, it's green across the board as well in the U.S. and in Europe much more on the financial sector, including a multibillion dollar deal for the assets of Silicon Valley Bank coming up in just a moment. But first, Israel as a standstill, historic protests taking place in an effort to end Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial plans to overhaul the judicial system. The country's largest trade union, calling on a general strike and workers and other sectors joining in including nurses, Israel's main airports, shopping malls, and even McDonald's are also affected by the strike. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu is calling on demonstrators to \"Behave responsibly and not to act violently\". Barak Ravid is live in Tel Aviv with the latest for us. Unprecedented images, we're seeing unprecedented strike action shutting down of major entry points into Israel. And then importantly, it seems that there is some kind of coordinated action we understand between the unions and the private sector. Could you give me a sense of the situation that's playing out on the ground right now?",

And again, the major change today was this general strike that was announced and it's pretty unprecedented. I don't think that anybody remembers when there was a general strike not in one sector in the country, but in every sector, including the airport, in the seaports. And even again, there, I think most of the shopping malls in Israel are closed because of that, because of this coordination between the unions and the private sector, which is, as you said, quite unprecedented.",

We have Iran that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just last week said that they are potentially two weeks away from nuclear fuel, and a few months away from a nuclear bomb. We have serious security concerns. I can say from my former positions, and from my former understanding, when the Defense Ministry talks, the people listen, and this is when we saw hundreds of thousands of people coming out last night. Now they were already in their pajamas, ready to call it a night, and this happened and hundreds of thousands of people came out to say you cannot let our security, our defense be left for narrow political needs.

Look, it's impossible to know if he hadn't said it, would it still have collapsed? But the timing was difficult coming off the back of the Silicon Valley Bank demise in the United States. All the scrutiny of the banking sector, it was a real trigger point for the markets.

But it's also affected schools, transport and every aspect of the economy going back to the first major demonstrations, which were in the middle of January, but Macron has said he's not returning. He has been trying indeed to get his government to broaden its coalition within the National Assembly and meetings today. And he shows every intent to try to weather this storm as his opponents continue to expand the scale of the storm. And the issue really is how violent it's going to get over the weekend. There were very violent clashes associated with a separate subject, an ecological demonstration against some plans to build some reservoirs for farmers. That turned very, very violent indeed, with police vehicles being destroyed and burned. At least one demonstrator currently in a critical condition in hospital following alleged beating by police a number of injuries among the police and there are reports are certainly concerns that those same groups that were violently clashing with the police over the weekend.

His visit though came a day after the CEO of TikTok made a high profile appearance in front of a congressional committee in Washington D.C. Of course, TikTok being a Chinese made app in which the CEO face some strong grilling about national security concerns. Yet we have Tim Cook in China celebrating Apple's success in China. Obviously, Apple has a large retail presence in China, but it also has a lot of manufacturing, and it has helped the company grow. That's not to say there haven't been challenges. China obviously was under a very long COVID lockdown that impacted the supply chain of Apple products. It has seen some labor tension at the world's largest iPhone manufacturing facility in China, which is operated by Foxconn. So he's had to contend with that and that's not to say that Apple hasn't looked outside of China.

So perhaps this was calculated to have Jack Ma make an appearance at a time when China wants to appeal to the West, appeal to be a friendly business environment.

But 24 hours later, the defense minister was fired. Massive protests were then sparked throughout Israel, especially in Tel Aviv; they went late into the night. And they actually, I have to say that they were angrier and more violent than protests we've seen over these last 12 weeks or so against this massive overhaul. Now to remind you, this judicial overhaul would essentially place much more power into the hands of the Israeli parliament into the politicians from everything from how judges are selected to even potentially the ability to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. Earlier today, Israel's largest trade union announced a massive strike. This is the largest strike in Israeli history. It's affecting everything from universities, to nurses, to the shopping malls, even the ports. The Israeli airport at some point, even McDonald's has been shut down as a result of this massive strike. And instead, people are taking to the streets. Now Benjamin Netanyahu was largely expected according to the Israeli media reports to make a statement earlier this morning announcing that he was going to actually hold the legislation essentially heeding the call from a growing and growing chorus of people across the country, but so far, we have not heard from him. All we have heard from him is a tweet where he called on demonstrators in Jerusalem on the right and the left; he said to behave responsibly and not to act violently. We are brotherly people. There are fears Eleni that this divisiveness what we're seeing on the streets that it could lead to potential bloodshed.

As part of this announcement about this next generationtechnology, Zipline also signed a big new partnership with our first country ever, which was Rwanda. There, we're expanding to serve every hospital and health facility in the country, including the facilities that are in urban parts of the country, like in Kigali, which we couldn't serve before. We've also expanded into animal health care, more broadly into childhood malnutrition, and even e-commerce and General Logistics in the country. So that partnership has grown very, very fast. But also we start to, we're starting to see health systems in countries like the U.S. or Japan start to say, hey, we're seeing this technology, saving money and saving lives and other parts of the world. We want to use it to do the same here. And so Zipline has partnerships in the U.S., for example, with multi-care, Intermountain Healthcare in a Michigan medicine, a number of other large healthcare systems that are wanting to use instant logistics, automated logistics to treat patients closer to where they live, save money and provide new paradigms of care that can be particularly impactful for people who have a hard time accessing that normal healthcare system today.",

And also, it's televised and not normally is these court cases televised. So, we saw Gwyneth Paltrow take the stand on Friday.

You know, like Taylor Swift, the reason that she brought up Taylor Swift's name was because Taylor Swift sued the DJ a few years ago claiming that he groped her and she sued him for $1. It was symbolic and damages. She won. Gwyneth Paltrow was countersuing Terry Sanderson for $1. And that's where the attorney got that. So, we expect that Terry Sanderson might be taking the stand today, like you said, and then we might be hearing from Gwyneth Paltrow's children this week. But we do expect things to wrap up later on this week. And we'll see who the jury believes because all we have are testimonies from both sides. There's no you know, video evidence from that day. So, it's really going to come down to who the jury believes more.",
