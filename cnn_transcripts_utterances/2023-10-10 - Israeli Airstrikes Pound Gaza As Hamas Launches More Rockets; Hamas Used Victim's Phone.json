      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper.The dysfunction among Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives has now taken on global significance because of the crisis in the Middle East. So, we are in this hour, we're going to focus a bit on House Republicans meeting at this hour, they are hoping to get one step closer to deciding who will become their next speaker, the individual who runs the House of Representatives. Without a speaker, no legislation can be passed, including any legislation that might address the growing crisis on the ground in Israel. So we are following that story. But we are going to begin today in the Middle East where at least 1000 people have been killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel, most of them civilians. President Biden confirming today that 14 of them were Americans. The White House says 20 additional Americans are still missing. And that number might not necessarily reflect the number of American hostages. It's just 20 Americans who are not accounted for right now. Today Israel is carrying out airstrikes on the Gaza port in retaliation as we're learning. Israel, perhaps the only missed signs of an attack they may have been tricked. Reuters is reporting that for two years, Hamas went to great lengths to try to convince Israel and Hamas was so tired of war that it would be placated by economic incentives to Gazan workers. But according to the report, it was all an elaborate front. Behind the scenes, the group's fighters are being trained and drilled for this extensive attack. A modern day version of the Haversack Ruse during the Brits Palestine campaign of World War I where the British dropped a sack filled with fake plans meant to deceive the Turks into believing that Gaza was its main target when it was not, considered one of the greatest wartime deceptions in military history, and then a lesson apparently not learned well enough. But the images coming out of Israel today do not show a typical war, they show potential war crimes. This is what Hamas did to the small town of Kfar Aza, one IDF official telling CNN that they slaughtered Israeli civilians, they beheaded people. A grim reminder of the last time this many Jews were killed in a single day. That was during the Holocaust. This story is now just beginning. And while we do not know how it will end the world can see of what Hamas is capable whether it is in that small town or at that music festival where attendees were hiding in bomb shelters where they were executed by hand grenades and guns. CNN's Erin Burnett just arrived in Tel Aviv this morning. And Erin, back and forth strikes have led to another night of unease across Israel and Gaza. Ashkelon was a major target of Hamas today and now we're learning rockets were launched tonight from Syria into Israeli territory, which of course is just adding to the already volatile situation.",

And it is, you know, something we hear again and again. So that's certainly the attitude and the feeling. It is interesting when you look at President Biden's comments, of course, you notice, right, he talked about what Hamas did is sheer evil, pure, unadulterated evil, right? Those are words that are exactly the words you hear, hear.That is exactly what they want to hear. That is what they believe is happening. And he was very clear in how he described things. He was very clear. Karine Jean-Pierre, as you know, later saying, let's be clear, there are no two sides to this issue. So all of that, obviously very important here. But also, Jake, just on the practical level, I know that there's a real push up by the Biden administration to quickly rush in aid. But when you just look at the barrage of rockets that continually keep coming in here, it's not just a matter of whether they overwhelmed, excuse me, the Iron Dome in one onslaught, right? It's just the overall draw down of what they do to Israeli capability. So that there is a need, they're very clear that there is a need and it's at least at this point, nothing but thanks to the United States for how the Biden administration is handling.",

And just right now Steve Scalise, the House majority leader and the House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan walked in behind closed doors to talk -- meet with the full 221 member conference to make their pitch. We expect them to make their speeches tonight about why they deserve to be elected speaker. Each man will have five minutes to make their case. And then they will open up to questions, any member can ask any round of questions, you can go as long as possible, and then ultimately they'll close out for today.Tomorrow is the key day. That is a leadership election. Right now under current conference rules, a majority of the conference, 112 members is enough, 111 members is enough to nominate the next Speaker of the House. But there is a dispute and a debate and something that Jim Jordan is pushing specifically to make sure that whoever gets the nomination actually can get 217 votes. Why? To avoid the long drawn out process on the House floor like we saw back in January when McCarthy went 15 rounds to be ultimately elected speaker. But there's a problem with that, Jake, there is not consensus yet between for either man, both men recognize that they are going to fall short of 217 votes. So the process behind closed doors could last some time. And, Jake, Kevin McCarthy himself, even as he is facing a push from some of his supporters to potentially run again, told his colleagues not to nominate him for the speakership in today's closed door meeting. So we'll see ultimately how that plays out. But Jake, also some of the detractors, the people who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy, the eight Republicans are here in the room. One of them Congressman Matt Gaetz said he had not yet made up his mind. Another one, Congressman Nancy Mays walked in with the letter A on her shirt as she walked into closed doors. She was asked by our colleague Anne Grier (ph), what that was about she said it was a scarlet letter. Jake.",

I talked to an American -- a Palestinian American woman in Gaza right now who said that that's not really possible. And she went to the border crossing, the only open border crossing in Gaza right now between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and Israel, as you know, has been pummeling it with rockets all day. This even came up at the White House briefing today.Obviously, there are more than 2 million Palestinians live in Gaza. And I'm sure you don't want to hurt the innocent ones.

Sadly, the enemies that we're fighting are cowards and they use civilian infrastructure in order to -- for their military purposes.And if you walk around the Gaza Strip, I don't think that you will find even one sign on a building that says this is the Hamas headquarters for producing rockets or gathering intelligence, it simply doesn't exist. And they use all the civilian infrastructure for their military purposes. I mentioned this because the footage running on the screen is what looks like a civilian building. But in fact, these are military targets used by Hamas for their military purposes. And as such, they are qualified military targets. You ask what we do in order to minimize the risk for non-combatants, we do a lot. We are still in a stage and we will continue to be in the stage where we abide by the law of international warfare. And we do not wish to harm the civilians. It is extremely unfortunate that they are caught in between Hamas and ourselves. Unfortunately, Hamas leaves us no other option.

And they don't want anything to happen to people in Gaza like it happens to a brother, and I'm sure he wouldn't have any, either. So that's my call to my government stop killing innocent people. And that's not the way that brings us peace and security to people in Israel.",

This is a superseding indictment, Jake, that was just announced by the Justice Department filed in district court in New York and according to this release, he was charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements, falsification of records, aggravated identity theft and credit card fraud.Now this indictment just in seal will have to go through all the details and the allegations they're in. But undoubtedly this will put pressure on Republicans to take action on George Santos. So far they have left it to the House Ethics Committee to come down and recommend any actions on Santos. So far, the Ethics Committee has not yet done that as it continues to investigate how will they proceed and how will so Santos proceed tomorrow. He is still expected to vote in the secret ballot election tomorrow to vote for a candidate for speaker here as Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise are behind closed doors in the room behind me trying to lock down the votes. So at the moment, Jake, George Santos has indicated that he would not resign. Will this change? There'll be one question here that will pose to him and some of his members, colleagues that they believe it's time for him to step aside, Jake.",

And the question Jake is can either Jordan or Scalise get the expectation is that they can will simply ultimately can't.",
