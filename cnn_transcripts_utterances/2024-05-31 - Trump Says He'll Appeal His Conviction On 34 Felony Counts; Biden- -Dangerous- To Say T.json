Well, Donald Trump's legal team says it will appeal the New York jury's verdict that found Trump guilty, those 34 counts of falsifying business records. So what exactly with that process look like? Well, first, Donald Trump has to wait for his sentencing, which is scheduled for July 11. Within 30 days of that sentencing, Trump has to file a notice of appeal and then Trump's team has six months to submit his appeal, and other relevant trial documents. A process called perfecting the appeal. Trump's team would have six months to do this. Now, the case will then go before five judge appeals panel, which will decide whether to uphold or overturn Trump's conviction. If the panel upholds the jury's verdict, Trump can seek permission to have New York's highest court consider his appeal. This court can decide to hear the case or forego it all together. With me to discuss all of this and more, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor for the Manhattan D.A.'s office, Jeremy Saland, trial attorney Misty Marris, and criminal defense attorney Bernarda Villalona. Guys, thanks so much. There's a lot of politics. There's no question about that. We want to talk about the legal here. And I want to start with what Todd Blanche said about the appeals process. He said that he's going to try and file motions before a formal appeal. What does that mean? What does it look like? Can it work?",

So this is Judge Merchan and say that this verdict was what's called against the weight of the evidence, basically says the jury got it wrong, that there was not enough evidence for the jury to convict. They asked the judge to overturn the verdict. That's the first avenue. It's very unlikely for that to succeed. Almost always that motion gets denied unless there's a very extreme situation. Then the next step, as you said, is to go to the appellate division. The appellate division looks at the case, looks at the record and we'll make a determination about whether or not there were errors of law. They don't question the jury. The jury is the finder of fact. They say, was there something that was overly prejudicial, should evidence have come into the courtroom that didn't or did something come in that shouldn't have. Were the jury instructions proper? Those are all the issues that the appellate court will look at. So, it's two different aspects. And it is routine for defense attorneys to go both routes.",

I'm going to lose giving that preemptory. I'm the victim here and they already started that. Now, they're going to file within that timeframe and it could take certainly well more than a year on appeal and they're going to lose. This isn't new law. It's unique in the sense that it involves the former president. It's unique in the sense that maybe were dealing with federal election law, but it's not -- falsifying business records is as old as the penal law, relatively speaking, but this is not something that's fresh and like, wow, we need a new look at this.

I don't particularly think that holds water. We're talking about making a change of venue argument based on just the makeup of the political spectrum in New York. That is not a basis. There has to be something that is reasonably likely to lead to a biased jury. It's just not going to hold water in this case. So that's one avenue. You know, but he's going to say that there are a bunch of evidentiary decisions that went against Donald Trump. That's what his job is to do in the appellate process. I actually think there is one appellant issue. I just want to flag it. Whether or not a New York state election law could be the predicate crime for this because he was running for federal office. I think that's the primary appellant issue that doesn't really gets into the weeds of the case, doesn't really get into the evidentiary decisions, but it would be a novel issue for the court to decide.",

It's an appellate lawyer who's skilled in the appellate work to look through that transcript and find things that maybe the trial attorney did not see or was unaware of. So and also, you don't want to be looking at your own potential errors and mistakes. You want a fresh set of eyes to do so. But to the point here, I pulled out a few things. First of all, its not we it's -- were indicted. It was Donald Trump was indicted by a grand jury. Conduct in '16 and '17, it's called the statute of limitations and you failed on that front. So the statue of limitations had not run. By his conclusion, meaning Blanche, if this was an Alabama, therefore, and it was a Democrat, would he say the same thing was unfair? The bottom line is with all due respect to Mr. Blanche, he did a poor job on cross-examination. He poorly prepared or prepped or was ready for Bob Costello, who I wouldn't just say drop the ball, was a potential double or triple, maybe not a home run, but he couldn't get on base because its misconduct in the way he behaved was out of line. You think things like the gloat -- comparing Michael Cohen who really did a terrific job and that's credit to Steinglass and that team, as sort of the Michael Jordan of lies. What did that get them? To be cute and funny. It wasn't -- it didn't do anything. The prosecution was methodical. They were deliberate, boring at times, but they did their job. And unfortunately for Mr. Blanche, he was meandering. His - he says closing was eh, and when he -- when he across examined Michael Cohen, his last question, I won't pull it up, gave Michael Cohen the ability to sort of build themselves right back up. He left the question out there that was open-ended. You did not direct what you do in leading as a defense attorney and gave him the power to rehabilitate himself. He failed.",

We have a contrast between the four years of Joe Biden where we saw our border completely devastated with 90 executive orders in the first hundred days, to make our border insecure, unsafe and wide-open, leading to the deaths of 70,000 Americans and a 10 million person illegal immigration invasion. We saw a great strong, healthy economy with 1.4 percent inflation go to over 9 percent. We saw the average families spend more than a thousand dollars extra a month for the same things. And the last point, Phil, is that we saw violet spread in the poorest communities, devastating people like me, you grew up in those poor communities, and that's one of the multiple reasons why a strong proponent for four more years of Donald Trump.",

Second thing is clear. I love the passion I'm seeing from the American people because they're harnessing it. You don't see any riots in the streets like you did a few years ago during the summer of the riots, largest riots in the history of our country with more property damage. That's -- you don't see that today. What you see is a focus, a determination to make sure that we the people are heard and seen on November the 5th. That's good news for the country. And frankly, it restores more confidence that conservatives when in leadership, you won't see that kind of violence in the streets because we like the outcome. We have this outcome. (CROSSTALK)",

It only happened because Donald Trump is Biden's political opponent. They send the number three person for Department of Justice down who prosecuted this guy. Everybody was biased. The judge was anti-Trump. This was -- this is just political persecution of the never one Biden opponent. This has got to stop. It's a sad day for this country. We need to rally behind Donald Trump.

Israel here is still talking about negotiating that permanent ceasefire during the first phase of this agreement. So there's certainly some sort cause for optimism here, but its clear that there are still, there's still a lot more for these two sides to work out.

And that if they did so, he would begin withholding certain U.S. munitions from Israel.And while we have the satellite imagery now showing Israeli forces in central Rafah, something that they have conceded themselves, in the satellite imagery, you can see Israeli tanks and armored vehicles in central Rafah in positions that are established by the Israeli military, bulldozed with berms to protect those vehicles from Hamas attacks. And so we are witnessing Israeli forces deeper into Rafah than they ever have been. And yet the U.S. administration right now is saying this doesn't cross the presidents red line because the way that they've defined it after the presidents interview with our Erin Burnett was to say, its not just about going into the population centers, it's about a kind of all out military offensive with tens of thousands of troops that would result in enormous death and destruction. And while it is clear that there is still a lot of death and destruction in Gaza as a result of those Israeli military operations, there is also some indication that the Israelis have listened to the us, that they're carrying this operation in central Rafah in a much more strategic and pinpointed manner than they did in northern Gaza, and in places like Khan Younis -- Phil.",
