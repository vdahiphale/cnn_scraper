I don't think Sam Altman was against that they didn't like the creation of a platform, essentially. He had announced an app store so that lots of developers could get on it. He was leaning into the relationship with Microsoft, they felt like this should not be a for profit, in that regard, although it was.And so they had a thing that they called misalignment, that there wasn't alignment on how to develop this technology, and who should be able to commercialize it, which what's ironic here is now this group is going to Microsoft to do just that. And so they created instead of working together to figure out some alignment, I guess, they're now create, they've now created a giant competitor and a giant company that could do whatever it wants, in this case, and it's not under the strictures of these people. So they have an idea that that AI is going to kill us. I think that's if you want to like put it simply.",

This is about the gag order put in place against former President Trump in the federal election subversion case. Trump's team says it violates that gag order, violates his first amendment rights and hurts his ability to campaign for reelection for president. The judge overseeing his case, though, however, has argued that Trump does not have the right to say anything he wants, especially when it comes to publicly targeting court staff witnesses and Special Counsel Jack Smith.

Should he be looked at as you or I should be if we're charged with the crime and our right to speak our mind and share our truths, whatever that may be.And even if we don't like what he has to say, he has a right to say them. Now how does that coincide with a campaign? How does that coincide with him being the former president? So it's a really interesting issue.

What I expect you're going to hear a lot from these three judge panel, two of them, appointed by former President Obama, one of them are appointed by President Biden is whether the fact that Trump is a candidate for presidency, whether that means he needs to be treated differently from pretty much any other defendant in this federal court.Look, I mean, judges put restrictions on what defendants can say all the time. They restrict comments on certain -- on the case in part to protect the jury pool, for instance, right, to make sure the jury pool can be seen as fair. And so the question is whether Donald Trump, the fact that he is running for president means that he is free to criticize everybody. Right now, Judge Chutkan says, look, you can't criticize the court, personnel. You can't criticize the special counsel and his family, certainly. And the question is whether that restriction infringes on Donald Trump's of freedom, his first amendment rights, and whether the fact that he's a presidential candidate means anything at all to this court.

And there is a rule in that district court. It's rule 577, which in in criminal proceedings, a judge can say that you're right to say certain things that are limited. She has that right.So there's a balance here. And there's many different cases up in the Supreme Court that predate obviously what we're hearing today, that rule of what is that test. How do we make that determination? Is it immediately inciting unlawfulness? Is there an alternative to restrict that type of speech that doesn't require a gag order? So there's a lot of competing views and competing voices to make this decision.

They say shows two Hamas hostages arriving in Al-Shifa on October 7th, the day of the terror attacks. The IDF also took CNN to the tunnel shaft they say proves Hamas was running operations under the hospital. But first CNN's Eleni Giokos joins us from Cairo with more on the babies now safe from the war but still in a fight for their lives. Eleni, what are you learning this hour? ELENI GIOKOS, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes, look, we have been tracking the story for over a week now when the Egyptian Health Minister had told us that they were anticipating 36 neonatal babies. They were waiting every single day last week with ambulances, with incubators, with various equipments and doctors and personnel and everyday disappointed. Today, finally, 28 neonatal babies crossing that Rafah border after a very treacherous trip down from Northern Gaza from Al-Shifa Hospital where we know the IDF raided last week, and we know that was more raging. We heard about the stories of just minimal supplies, lack of oxygen, lack of incubators, no fuel to get those incubators going and of course, no real communication. They went down to the Emirati Hospital yesterday after the safe passage was created. And then we saw those images of the baby's crying and intervention from the medical staff there. And also a big fear that they might also run out of fuel today this morning, finally through that Rafah border, where we had seen ambulances and staff as well as the ministry on the ground there to take them on. We have to remember that 11 of those babies were in critical condition according to the World Health Organization, all of them fighting infection. And this just is basically an indication of just what kind of conditions they were treated in at Al-Shifa. Now over in Egypt, they're going to be sent to various hospitals depending on their condition. We hear from officials and they tell me that so many of them are underweight. [0915:17] Now, why only 28, we know from Al-Shifa doctors, that some of them died at the hospital over the past week because of the conditions there. Some were reunited with their families. But importantly, of the 28 that arrived here in Egypt, only four mothers crossed the border, only four parents. And really think about that, what happens to -- what happened to the rest of their family members? Are they alive? Are they able to really be reunited down the line? And then six nurses were also accompanying them, but the big priority here is to try and get them healthy, to stabilize them and to deal with the issue at hand. Various tests have been run on the babies. And of course, intervention is absolutely pivotal right now. The Health Minister tells us that he's happy and his relieved they finally are in Egypt.",

We entered in at 9 o'clock at night and didn't come out until 3Our goal was to see what we could of the newly exposed tunnel shaft that the IDF had discovered and revealed only a day or two earlier. From our own eyes, it was quite clear that there was a substantial structure there, made of concrete with what looked to be the central shaft of a spiral staircase. But at night and with a little light we were allowed to use for our own safety reasons. There was little we could see into the shaft itself. But the IDF lowered a camera with a special asset into the tunnel, and we geo located this video and were able to see that it was the location where we had seen and that revealed a shaft that went down, the spiral staircase that looked like it was there and then the tunnel going quite a distance there. According to the IDF, it went from 55 meters or more than 150 feet or so and it's end a metal door. The IDF says they have not opened that door because they fear it may be booby trap. It is the strongest evidence yet or the strongest imagery yet that that backs up what the case that the IDF is trying to build that there is Hamas infrastructure underneath the hospital itself. That is the argument they have made. They have asserted in the -- in not only the past weeks, but in the past years that Hamas has used the hospital above as cover for what it calls as terror infrastructure below. They have not been able to prove that conclusively yet. But this and what we saw as part of building that case.",

And obviously, that's good. They are concerned that the details of how this happens could unwind it. The hostages would not be all released at once. They would probably come out in some number of batches. And of course, this five day or so pause in the fighting is sort of the key element for both sides. Israel is very worried that once the five days begins, they'll be under great pressure not to resume the attacks on Hamas. That, you know, they're viewing this not as a ceasefire, but a pause. Hamas by releasing just 50 hostages, we'll be left with 200 or so, we don't -- we're not certain that the exact numbers, it would probably be a little bit under 200.
