Southwest Airlines passengers who've seen their travel plans disrupted for days are looking at thousands more cancellations in the day ahead. We'll have the latest on when customers could see relief.Plus, the snowfall has finally stopped in Buffalo but the work is just getting started for the rescue crews who are still finding victims of the blizzard. And new COVID Travel requirements for those coming from China. I'll talk with a doctor about these restrictions and whether they can be effective. After days of delays and cancellations, Southwest Airlines slowly but surely seems to be working its way back to normal, but it won't get there right away. A representative for the pilots' union says it looks like the flight schedule will be mostly full by Friday. The airline has canceled more than 2300 flights for the coming day. But that number drops to only 39 cancellations by Friday. Airports are filled with long lines of Southwest passengers trying to rebook as piles of luggage continued to grow, while other airlines recovered from last week's winter storm fairly quickly Southwest has not. On Tuesday, southwest accounted for 84 percent of cancellations among all airlines in the U.S. On Wednesday, that number jumped to 91 percent and for Thursday, it's a whopping 99 percent. More now from CNN's Gabe Cohen reporting from Baltimore.

Airline industry analysts Robert Mann says this. You're looking at a million customers. If an average ticket is 250 to $300, that suggests the upper limit is 250 to $300 million in terms of absolute value.

Obviously, several decades ago, but there were class action lawsuits filed against the carriers that were involved.And eventually, the passengers were able to recover in a settlement did not go to trial, but a settlement about $2,500 per passenger aggrieved. And of course, it doesn't sound like much if it's ruined your vacation or your job or your work, and you're in an airport without your medicine. But that was at least something that the airline had to pay. And by the way, in that case, the government did very little. It was private litigation that delivered that result to passengers.

The U.S. will require all travelers from China to show a negative COVID test result before flying to the U.S. Before we got this official announcement, Beijing responded to potential travel restrictions from the U.S. by defending its COVID policy accusing Western media for hyping up China's COVID policy change and by urging countries to work together.This is what else the Ministry of Affairs spokesperson had to say, \"China has always believed that the measures taken by countries to prevent the epidemic should be scientific and moderate and should not affect normal people to people exchanges.\" Now the irony here is that since the start of the pandemic, China has had some of the strictest border controls in the world. But now that the country is finally easing up and cases are surging, other countries are getting nervous. In addition to the U.S., Japan, India, Taiwan have put COVID testing requirements in place. In fact, Taiwan and Japan say if the traveler from China tests positive for COVID upon arrival, they'll have to quarantine for several days. Now China has stopped reporting daily COVID cases on a national level, it severely narrowed its definition of COVID deaths, only reporting a handful of COVID deaths for the entire month. But Beijing says look, everything is under control. Yet we know that hospitals are overflowing with elderly patients and crematoriums across the country are overwhelmed. Fever and cold medicine are scarce. The big concern from some countries like the U.S. is the lack of data from China that could help detect new variants, just aid, the global consortium that maintains a database of COVID sequences have said however, that China has ramped up the amount of data it's submitting, and that all the genome sequences shared so far closely resemble the variants already circulating in other parts of the world since July. But the U.S. says the data shared from China isn't enough. And look, it's not as if China has totally thrown open its own borders. China's border still remains largely close to foreigners, apart from a limited number of business or family visits. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing.",

But every infection can create a new mutation and at the rate that it's going, you know, I joke that China's not Vegas, and what happens in China does not stay in China, and it will spread throughout the world.

Listen, there were two planes last week in Milan that came from China, one of them 38 percent of the people that were tested were COVID positive, the other one was upwards of 50 percent.So, the numbers could be astronomical. So, if we're really going to get serious about trying to slow down, not stop, but slow down the increase of cases coming from China the people have to be tested when they arrive and isolated if they're positive -- they're positive.

Upper Midwest, Ontario, but of course, we've all been focusing on areas such as Buffalo.A year ago, 9.3 inches were on the ground, they picked up 100 this year, that's six feet above average. There is definitely going to be some flooding going on in this massive melt. Earlier today it's what it looked like in Watertown. One of the better cleared areas, but when authorities say watch your sewer drains on your roads, keep them from getting ice jams. Well, how can you find them? This is looking pretty good. But in most locations, the plows have pushed the snow up five, six, even seven feet high. Some areas that can't even find their car, and then you throw rain into the forecast not only does that aid the melting process, it accelerates it. Average high in Buffalo's 34 degrees. Look, they're 20 degrees above average by say seven, got up above freezing or -- and everybody is earlier today every city pretty much in North -- or in the U.S. except for mine at North Dakota was above freezing. Temperatures won't only be above average, they'll be much above 20, maybe 25 degrees warmer than normal. Here's the warm front. But mountain snow is the first in a series of storms have moved in, see the water vapor, this fire hose we're talking about, this atmospheric river. The winds will also accompany this. They weren't only category one winds, they were category two knocking out power, hundreds of thousands and parts of Oregon to upstate New York or Washington state that is. So that system has moved into the desert southwest and the watches and the warnings are in place. But now it really starts to kick in. Here we go with a series of storms that are moving in. The first one that already moved in, there comes the second one. This is Thursday into Friday. We've got another one Friday into Saturday, a fire hose into San Francisco, maybe 10 inches of rain through all of this. Here comes the next one. That's Monday into Tuesday. And there's another one back behind that. So massive flash flooding, landslide threat. This atmospheric river is going to cause not only heavy mountain snow and travel problems, but I think we're going to see unbelievable amounts of rain in parts of California.

Now, the Ukrainians don't say they have hit that base. But it was widely assumed that it was hit by Ukrainian missiles or drones causing some damage there and disruption to the Russian air defenses. So, it was anticipated that something was going to happen in revenge for the attack on the Engels 2 Airbase in Russia, and it appears that this is the case. So, this seems to be an ongoing missile strike -- across missile strikes across the country, not just focused in particular areas. And as Clare was saying, there have been emergency -- they're -- basically, they are cutting the electricity in some parts of the country to avoid damage to the system in the event some of these missiles actually do get through.",

Along with the photo, she wrote this, these moments are hard to explain. Sometimes, there is a lot of sadness and helplessness. Others, we laugh and talk of funny memories. And what we learned the most from all of this is that we must look for each other and keep close. That is the only way it's all worth it with everyone together. The family spent Christmas in the hospital after Pele was admitted last month for a respiratory infection and a reevaluation of his chemotherapy for colon cancer.

Benjamin Netanyahu's stunning political comeback in Israel culminates on Thursday when he will be formally sworn in as prime minister for a record sixth time.

Analysts expect it to be the most right-wing government in Israeli history.Let's bring in Elliott Gotkine. He's covering this for us and joins us from Jerusalem.

So, it's kind of almost more of the same in that respect.In terms of some of the personalities we have been talking about since the election on November the 1st, you have got, you know, the Jewish power party led by one Itamar Ben-Gvir who has been convicted in the past of incitement to racial hatred and supporting terrorism. You've got the self-professed homophobe Bezalel Smotrich as the head of the religious Zionism Party. He is set to be finance minister for the next couple of years. And also, have a new role where he's in charge of the civil administration in the West Bank. And, of course, there are other controversial figures as well, Aryeh Deri the head of the Shas Party. They passed a specific law to enable him to be a minister this time around because he was convicted earlier this year of tax fraud. He's going to be the finance minister after a couple of years as well. So, those are some of the personalities. In terms of the agenda, the punitive new government laid out its plans yesterday. And there are a couple of controversial elements in there as well, one is, for example, to promote and develop all parts of the land of Israel, in their words. And they specified the Galilee in the north, the Negev in the south, and also, Judea and Samaria, which is what they called the West Bank. So, obviously there is a resurgence of a settlement building in the West Bank. That is something that is labeled to cause controversy, particularly among Israel's allies, and perhaps other countries in the region that Israel would like, eventually, to sign peace agreements with as well. Another plan to restore, in their words, the proper balance between the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. There are concerns that they planned -- this basically means, the Knesset, the parliament will have the power to override decisions by the high court, which, where in the past, it might have struck outlaws that it deemed were unconstitutional effectively. What they want to do is to be able to have the Knesset lawmakers to overturn such decisions. There are concerns that it will dilute any checks and balances that there are going to be on this new government. But one thing they did put in this agenda which was perhaps designed to lay concerns is, in their words, the status quo of religion and state will be preserved including, they specify, for the holy places. You may recall there were concerns that we had caused in the past from Itamar Ben-Gvir who was set to be interior minister to change the status quo on Temple Mount as it's known to Jews, and Haram al Sharif as it's known to Muslims, to enable jews to pray there. That, according to this agenda, is not going to happen. Ultimately, Alison, Netanyahu says, the battle (ph) will stop with him.",
