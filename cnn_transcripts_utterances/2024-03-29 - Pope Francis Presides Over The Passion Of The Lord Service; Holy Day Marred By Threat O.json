Pope Francis, as we can just see, has arrived in St. Peter's Basilica for the Good Friday Passion service. It's a long and intense service. Francis, who has been battling some health difficulties, does seem to be much better and is participating fully in the Holy Week liturgies. Yesterday, he was at a female prison in Rome where he washed the feet of 12 female inmates, the first time that a Pope has only washed the feet of female inmates at this service. And at that liturgy, he emphasized the importance of service and humility. Today, we have the recalling of Jesus' death and resurrection -- death and suffering, which takes place at this service that we're seeing, but also later tonight at the Colosseum, we will have the Stations of the Cross service. The Pope has written the reflections for that liturgy, which is quite unusual, and he has covered a whole range of topics in those meditations, including online hatred, injustices against women. So, Francis, as always, trying to take this message of Easter, the message of the days before Easter, out to the world to try and connect it with as many people as possible, despite suffering from bouts of ill health, despite his lack of mobility, the Pope seems determined to keep going.",

That route along the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem's Old City also leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, said to be the holiest site in the world for Christians. Meantime, in Gaza, today's Holy Day is being marred by the very real threat of starvation. The International Court of Justice saying, quote, \"Famine is setting in and the World Court is calling on Israel to let more humanitarian aid into the enclave.\" Israel responding, saying, it wishes, in its words, \"No harm to the civilian population of Gaza.\" Prime Minister Netanyahu has given his approval for Israeli negotiators to restart hostage talks in the coming days.

The little girl was airlifted to the hospital with, as you can imagine, quite serious injuries. The cause of the crash at this point is still under investigation.

If you look behind me in the distance,you can actually see that crane, that first one to arrive, standing up there in the river. Two more cranes are currently on their way as we speak, according to the Transportation Secretary. And an officer at the command center tells me they're hoping this first crane can begin its work, start clearing debris a little bit later today. But right now, engineers are still trying to figure out how they are going to safely and effectively cut those pieces of the bridge into smaller chunks to be able to remove them. And bear in mind, it is going to be not just a complicated operation, but they're also going to be doing it in a very deliberate and sensitive way because there's concern that those four missing construction workers are buried under that rubble and they still want to send in divers once this operation is complete to recover those four men and offer closure to their families. But look, this is going to take time. We expect days, potentially weeks, which is a difficult pill to swallow for people here in Baltimore because the port of Baltimore is still basically shut down today. Thousands of jobs are at risk, millions of dollars in lost salaries and business operations. So, they really want to get this channel reopened. But in order to clear that much steel -- and if you look again at that bridge, what is so striking is that it seems fair -- I should say the crane, it seems fairly small to be the largest crane vessel on the East Coast. And that is because it pales in comparison to the size of that ship, nearly the size of the Eiffel Tower, as you mentioned, plus the massive sections of the bridge, all of that steel and concrete, and so much of it is below the surface of the water, Zain. So, in getting that cleared in that safe and effective manner is going to take a long time. And that's something that officials are navigating right now as they get ready to start the work with those cranes.",

I mean, we as friends can certainly advocate for Evan, but they are the ones who are talking to him, who are keeping him or doing their best to keep him safe and keep him informed from the world here at home. And so, I think he's really drawing a strength from his family and also the knowledge that, you know, his cause is one for journalism more generally, that, you know, not that he wants to be in a prison cell, but that people are taking up the mantle for press freedom for him. And I think that is a source of strength for him. He's also reading. He's learning. He's watching Russian television and he's still practicing the Russian language. Like these are things that he went over to Russia as a reporter to do. And I think those are the things that keep him keep his spirits up while he's in there.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, it makes me a little emotional talking about it. Look, Evan was not naive to the risks of his reporting in Russia. He informed usof those risks. All that being said, I don't think he ever thought it would rise to this level. And we certainly never thought it did. One year ago, you know, I'm a late riser. And so, I was in bed around eight o'clock in the morning. I got a push alert on my phone. I believe it was from \"The New York Times\" that said a reporter had been detained in Russia. Obviously, you know, your brain goes to the worst place ever. And I had just seen Evan two months before that. And we were talking, you know, over Twitter D.M. about a week before so it seemed quite unreal. I rushed over. I turned on the news and, you know, this image is seared into my mind. There's Evan. He's wearing a yellow hood. There's a gloved hand on the back of his head, kind of like this. He's getting shuffled into a police car. You know, I thought I was still dreaming. And then all of a sudden, you know, everyone who knows me that knows that Evan and I are very close. And so, my phone started blowing up. They said, is this really Evan? What's going on? Can you tell me what's going on? What's happening? And so, you know, that was a very chaotic morning, a very chaotic day. And, you know, it's not about me. And I don't say this lightly, but, you know, my life has been different ever since. You know, I think about him every single day.",
