Jurors are about to have a long weekend to think back on Michael Cohen's cross examination and one potentially pivotal moment when the defense attorney Todd Blanche got Cohen to admit he didn't fully remember a key phone call that directly tied Donald Trump to a hush money payment made to Stormy Daniels.Michael Cohen is going to be back on the stand Monday morning when cross-examination continues.

It is a day you should remember because if -- if Donald Trump, the former president is acquitted, the history books may well point to Michael Cohen's testimony today as the biggest reason. Cohen's cross-examination will resume next week, we're told after he endured hours of brutal questioning on the stand today, Trump's defense attorney Todd Blanche laid out Cohen's past lies under oath, and then introduced evidence claiming that Cohen has also lied in this trial under oath. Cohen previously testified on Tuesday, I believe, about a key October 2016 phone call he says he had with Donald Trump about the hush money reimbursement. But Todd Blanche today revealed text messages and a call log from that day that threatened to destroy Cohen's credibility about that testimony from two days ago. The defense suggested that Cohen's October 2016 phone call was not about the Stormy Daniels deal at all. We'll tell you more about that in a second. Sources also tells CNN that as we've been reporting, all day, the defense may, in fact, call Michael Cohen's former attorney, Robert Costello, as a witness. This after Costello testified to House lawmakers yesterday about his former clients saying, quote, virtually every statement of Cohen has made about him on the stand during this trial has been a a lie. Let's begin with CNN's Paula Reid, who's outside the court. Paula, walk us through what the defense and Michael Cohen said today in the courts specifically about this October 24, 2016 phone call.",

      "sentences": "Well, today, Trump's attorney Todd Blanche successfully undercut several key pieces of Michael Cohen's testimony for prosecutors. The most significant one though, was this all you just mentioned. This is a call on October 24, 2016 where Michael Cohen reached out to Keith Schiller, Trump's body man. Now, when he was on the stand, prosecutors asked Cohen, why did you need to speak with Mr. Trump at that point on the evening of October 24th? And he says it was to discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it. And prosecutors asked, and did you have an understanding about whether during that conversation that you were moving forward to fund the deal? And Cohen said yes.And, Jake, the reason this was so significant for prosecutors is because it's showing the jury that Michael Cohen is establishing that Trump was looped in on this alleged conspiracy to con -- to conceal this hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. But then when it was the defense's turn today, they too wanted to talk about this call and they introduced new evidence that suggests that at the same time Michael Cohen testified that he was having this call about Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen had actually texted Keith Schiller about prank phone calls that he was getting from a 14-year-old. And then several minutes later, Schiller asked Cohen to call him and then Cohen right in the same minute called Schiller and they had a 90-second phone call. So, of course, the defense is asking, are you sure that that call was about Stormy Daniels and not about this teen prankster. And today Cohen testified that in fact, part of the call was about the 14-year- old, but I know that Keith was with Trump at the time and there was potentially more than this in that call. Blanche said that was a lie? You did not talk to President Trump. You talk to Keith Schiller. You can admit it. Cohen says, no, sir. I don't know that is accurate. So here documents, receipts appearing to undercut whether Cohen actually spoke with Trump about Stormy Daniels at this specific time. And when he was pressed repeatedly by Blanche, Cohen started to sort of lean back on that, I don't exactly recall. Now the other thing that Blanche was able to highlight, Jake, is the fact that this is the first time that Cohen and all these years he's been talking about this case, has ever mentioned this call. So, in the minds of the jury, this is something that could instill some serious doubt in Michael Cohen's credibility about this instance.",

But yesterday, Bob Costello, a long time Trump aligned attorney who for quite some time represented Rudy Giuliani, and for a brief time represented Michael Cohen, he testified up on Capitol Hill really trying to just shred Michael Cohen's credibility most importantly, saying that when he represented Michael Cohen, Cohen repeatedly told him that he had no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump. Now, he also outlines several other lies that he says Cohen has said publicly and on the stand. But we were told that there has some who subsequently been outreach to Costello since that appearance, there have been ongoing conversations about possibly calling him, but at this point, Jake, it's not clear that he will be called as of now. All we know that the defense is going to do for their case is put on at least one expert witness briefly. And again, it's unclear if their client will testify, but there is a possible so ability they might call Costello if they feel that they need to further undermine Michael Cohen's credibility.",

I'm starting with number eight here, Robert Costello, Bob Costello, who offered, according to Michael Cohen, back channel community occasion to Trump, using Rudy Giuliani as a middleman. Cohen is saying that Costello's emails and outreach were part of a pressure campaign to make sure that he stayed loyal to Trump. But yesterday, Costello testified before the Republican led House committee on the weaponization of the federal government and what he said yesterday may provide some insights into what he may say. If Donald Trump's defense team does call him as a witness, which Paula Reid is suggesting might happen. So, let's run a little bit of what Robert Costello, what Bob Costello told the committee yesterday under oath.

And even when he cited, for example, our colleague Jeff Zeleny, it is true that Jeff said he has heard from voters out there who are disgusted and tired of this whole affair. You can find those voters anywhere. What is not nearly as clear is how many voters are disgusted and tired of it, because they think Donald Trump shouldn't be charged. And how many maybe disgusted entirety of it because they're disgusted entirely with Donald Trump.

There's more than 20 jurors in the grand jury. They vote on whether there's probable cause to bring a crime. So it was interesting, I -- there's a tie back with Trump's statement just now to the press switch was exceptionally long, which to me shows that he thinks he had an excellent day in court because the better he does, the longer he speaks. But he is relishing in the fact that he can use the opportunity after court to clean up his image of what went on inside. And again, it's a repeat. We've heard it all before, although today it really went out there about how this is a political witch-hunt and the trials moving so quickly. I can tell you I've tried cases in that court in Manhattan court for more than 20 years. They all go quickly. This is New York City. Everything is on an expedited basis. The judges all move the cases along quickly. When you walk in that courthouse, there's not one discussion about anything political going on there, like even his statement. This is Alvin Bragg. It's a political mechanism for Alvin Bragg to promote himself. Alvin Bragg didn't indict Donald Trump. He brought an indictment before a grand jury and those people decided, based on what they heard in that secret hearing, that there was enough evidenced to hands -- hands up an indictment.

And then when asked about it, he tried to -- tried to explain -- well, it was this persons fault and that persons fault. So, here is how Todd Blanche went at him. Blanche: You blame a lot of people over the years for conduct that you were convicted of. Cohen: I blame people, yes. Blanche: You blame your accountant? Cohen: Correct. Blanche At times, you blame the bank? Cohen: Correct. Blanche: You blame federal prosecutors? Cohen: Yes, sir. Blanche added judges and Donald Trump to which Cohen also responded yes. How do you think this landed with the jury, Alyssa?",

WILL SCHARF (R), MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think certainly looking at all the testimony and evidence that's come into this trial, so far, I think this is an open and shut case for a directed verdict. I think the prosecution hasn't come close to meeting their evidentiary burden on crucial elements of the charge defenses and for that that reason, I don't think we should even get to the defenses case because I think any fair judge would enter a directed verdict here.

JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): But this idea that the special counsel can interview the president of the United States, use that excerpt from that in his report and then our president can then claim executive privilege to prevent the complete report from being released, strikes me as an abuse of power and just bizarre exercise and control. REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA): Donald Trump's prosecutor said that Joe Biden did nothing wrong, release the transcripts. That also showed that the prosecutor said he had a photographic memory.
