In just minutes, the House will gavel, open the floor proceedings, and we will find out if Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio has the votes to take that gavel permanently. His ascendance to the brink of the speakership marks a real departure for the House GOP conference.Jordan for one is a 2020 election denier. He is someone about whom former House Republican Vice Chair Liz Cheney warns is an enemy of democracy, and enemy of the U.S. Constitution. To win, Congressman Jordan needs to stay on the right side of a very thin Republican majority margin. He just hit a magic -- he must hit rather a magic number of 217 votes to win the job if everyone we expect to vote votes, which means Mr. Jordan can only lose three House Republicans in the vote. But heading into this final tally or first tally, we already know of six Republicans who have said they will reject Jordan's bid for Speaker. He can't afford to lose six Republicans. So, if that happens, if all states voted against him, history and -- histrionics rather, might repeat themselves and thrust the House into another drawn-out floor mess just like what we watched play out in January when it took Kevin McCarthy 15 rounds to win the job. The consequences of chaos are even more pronounced. Now, a leaderless House means that the legislative branch of Congress cannot pass an aid package for Israel at war. We're going to check in with CNN's Sara Sidner in Tel Aviv, as rockets shoot through the sky there. But first here at home, CNN's Capitol Hill team is tracking all the closed-door cajoling and the fluid fast- moving mission to cement Jordan's bid for the gavel. We're going to start with CNN's Manu Raju. And, Manu, you just caught up with Congressman Jordan. What does he have to say?",

And that's the message that I'm hearing from sources that are familiar with the matter that Congressman Jordan, even if he does not get 217 votes in this first ballot, in which he's not expected to get the magic number in this first ballot, that he was willing to fight it out on the House floor. Potentially ballot after ballot, maybe perhaps as long as Kevin McCarthy went back in January.But this source we spoke to believes that they're closer than Kevin McCarthy was on the first ballot back in January. Remember that time, Kevin McCarthy was down 19 votes? They believe there'll be closer to that in this -- in this vote and the -- that we'll see in a matter of moments. We do know that at least six Republicans are no's -- are no votes against McCarthy. There are expected to be at least perhaps six more who have leaning no. We'll see how they ultimately come down. And then there are a whole bunch of other members who simply have not said how they will vote. So, the key question that we will see at the moment is not necessarily whether Jordan get -- does he get 217? No one expects that in this first vote. It's how many members are voting no. And what are their concerns? A number of them simply are concerned about the -- everything that has happened in the last two weeks, the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, and they don't want to reward those hardliners who pushed out McCarthy by elevating their choice, who's Jim Jordan. Others simply have concerns about some of the things that Jim Jordan said including Congressman Ken Buck who was concerned that Jordan has not explicitly said that the 2020 election was not stolen. I asked Jordan about that too, just moments ago why he has not said that. He didn't respond to that question. But those are the among the issues, Jake, that are still percolating out there. The question too is when these members vote against Jordan. How long will they withstand the pressure? Will they continue to vote no ballot after ballot? Jordan's team is getting -- is make -- taking the calculation that ultimately, they will come to his side and that he will be elected Speaker of the House as soon as tonight. But get ready for a drawn-out fight between some of the more moderate members, some of the more established members, and Congressman Jim Jordan if he tries to get the speakership tonight. Jake.",

This is what he put himself up in a secret ballot election to replace Kevin McCarthy.He lost that secret ballot election to Steve Scalise who ultimately bowed out, did not want to go to the floor because he didn't have the votes. Jordan, however, change his approach. This has decided he wants to try to force this and ultimately get these members to come along to his side. So that is the question, will they ultimately do that? Or they stand firm against Jim Jordan and push for another candidate here? And can another candidate get 217 votes? That is still a huge question.

But they hope that they can eventually get these members by tonight to come their way and perhaps that pressure campaign, they believe will get them to come to their site.

I spoke to one of the Republican lawmakers who was a holdout, one of those who is having one-on-one meetings with Jim Jordan, as Jordan tries to get votes one by one.And the ask by this member who I spoke to, was really simple. Will you go out and say publicly that Donald Trump lost the election? And Jim Jordan could not say, yes, I will do that. And that's an example of some of these conversations again, so fundamental, that are happening behind the scenes. Yes, there are lots of different factors in some of the holdouts, most of them are moderates. Most of them are those who come from Biden districts, meaning districts where Joe Biden won in 2020, and they are Republicans who are trying to grapple with the notion of being very vulnerable in the general election, but maybe vulnerable in the short- term if they don't vote for Jim Jordan, and a potential primary. But of all of those aspects and all of those factors, one of those fundamentals, that is in 2023, still something that Jim Jordan won't say, which is that Donald Trump lost more than three years ago, is a factor that we should keep in mind.

Now he is, of course, House judiciary chairman. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTORYou see in Jordan, he comes in, the tea party starts, getting traction, he becomes a co-founder of the Freedom Caucus. He is a thorn in Boehner side. Obviously, Trump's arrival in the party and take over the party, gives Jim Jordan and the likes of Jim Jordan more fuel. And look at what Kevin McCarthy did to become speaker.

That's actually a good sound in Israel because it means that the rockets have been taken out and render them not dangerous anymore.We also heard today from the first family who has seen a video of their daughter who was now a hostage in Gaza. It was the very first time that they found out that she was alive when Hamas put that video out on social media. And that was a very tearful, difficult moment for everyone to witness, a mother mourning or watching -- mourning her daughter really because her daughter is in pain.

Also, I want to bring in our CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He is in Jerusalem for us. Jeremy, President Biden is leaving for Israel today. We saw Secretary of State Blinken here also trying to make maneuvers to try and help those in Gaza, the civilians who are stuck. It's going to be a really tough task for President Biden as well.

He is a messaging guy. That's what he does. And he does it on television. And he is one of the most on message people. So, it's changing the nature of the job.

It's not false for Democrats to say that he is the extreme MAGA candidate. And will he govern in that way? And if so, in 2024, it does make it easier for Democrats to potentially get back some of those seats because that's not what Americans want right now. They're frustrated with the nonsense here in Capitol Hill.",

And he said that he believes that he should. And he believes that he should continue to fight it out. He says that, essentially that, you know, this is different than January because the rules have changed and the like.So, he thinks that he can actually get there by fighting it out on the House floor. He also indicated that he is encouraging his supporters to actually vote for Jim Jordan here in just a matter of moments because we do expect that a handful of members will vote for McCarthy here on the floor of the House. There's some hope among those handful of McCarthy supporters in the Republican conference that he could actually make a comeback, but actually could try to run again, if Jordan falters, I tried to ask him about that. He didn't exactly address that question. McCarthy is endorsing Jim Jordan. But if you were to mount a comeback, then if Jordan falls short of the 217 votes he's needed. McCarthy himself is also short of those 217 votes because of what we've seen over the last two weeks, those eight Republicans have vote to doused him. And they're showing no signs of reinstating him into that position here. But with the moment, McCarthy encouraging Jordan to fight it out. And what we're hearing from our sources, and that's exactly what Jim Jordan is willing to do, fight ballot after ballot. Hope he gets there today. The question is, will those Republicans who are voting for Kevin McCarthy, will they ultimately vote for Jim Jordan? We don't know the answer to that quite yet. But that's what will play out here in just a matter of minutes.",

Congressman, I really want to get your thoughts on this notion of Jim Jordan potentially going to be the 56th speaker of the House of Representatives by the end of the day. You are not a big fan of Jim Jordan. I think that's probably fair to say.But talk about it from your perspective as one of two Republicans on the January 6 select committee, in particular given, I don't know if you've heard my reporting earlier, but one of the holdouts, Republican holdout asked him to publicly say that Donald Trump lost the election in 2020, and he declined to do so.",
