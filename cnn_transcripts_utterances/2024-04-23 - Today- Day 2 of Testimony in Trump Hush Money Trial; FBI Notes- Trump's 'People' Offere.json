That may come with its own challenges. But after Trump's gag order hearing this morning, jurors will return to the courtroom for day two of testimony. David Pecker, the former publisher of \"The National Enquirer,\" will be back on the stand. He's a critical piece of the prosecution's plan to try to prove that Trump acted with criminal intent when he tried to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 election. Our panel is here, former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi; chief national affairs correspondent, Jeff Zeleny. Jonah Goldberg, he's co- founder and editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" And \"New York Times\" journalist Lulu Garcia-Navarro. Welcome to all of you. Gene, let me start with you on this gag order question, because I have to say that \"The Wall Street Journal,\" their lead editorial tries to make a distinction between the jurors in the case, regular Americans who have to make a decision here, and someone like Michael Cohen. Because let's show everyone what Michael Cohen had to say on Twitter back to Donald Trump. I'm not going to read it just because, you know, our discourses is what it is. I'm not going to read the beginning of it. He just says, \"Your attacks on me stink of desperation.\" You can read the rest of it. \"We're all hoping that you take the stand in your defense.\" It does seem like there should be a difference between Michael Cohen and the jury pool in terms of what Trump is allowed to do, perhaps; because Cohen is already someone who has been dragged into this very publicly the entire time. Do you see a distinction? And how do you think the judge is going to handle it?",

Every criminal case has rallied his base and his supporters.So he's saying out in the hallway, the courtroom, I could be in Florida or Georgia. The reality is, he doesn't campaign during the week anyway. I cannot recall a time where there's been a Monday campaign rally or a Tuesday campaign rally. So he usually campaigns on weekends. There's no doubt this is, you know, cutting into his campaign time to an extent. But the bigger thing is he's just trying to, again, show that he is being persecuted. But what we don't know is there's a different audience now. The general election audience is different than the primary audience. So I was watching a lot of the coverage of this yesterday on television and watching it on FOX a lot. And they barely talking about it. So Donald Trump's supporters are going to hear one thing. And that is his hallway press conference. They are not going to likely hear a lot of the rest of it. So at the end of the day, we do not know what the politics of this is going to be for him. But he clearly is growing agitated. And this is just David Pecker. Never mind the other witnesses who are coming this week. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Can I just argue something, though? When you see this image of him coming out of the courtroom, I don't think this is a good image for him. I mean, this is a drab building. It's going to be repetitive in terms of the kinds of visuals that you have. It's always the same thing with him standing in the hallway and him looking agitated, angry, and frankly, saying the same things over and over again. I mean, I don't think that this is actually going to help him. Some people argue that this is going to rally his base further. We've seen evidence of that, but I just don't think that it's going to do him any favors in the long term.",
