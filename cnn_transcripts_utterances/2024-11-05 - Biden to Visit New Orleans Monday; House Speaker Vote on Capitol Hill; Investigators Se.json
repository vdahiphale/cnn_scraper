So, from a council perspective, we're dealing with the obviously troubling revelations on the infrastructure stuff, because that is local and that is in our purview. But we don't have answers yet on why this wasn't identified.If this person's using social media, if American citizens, we all, give up our rights to privacy so that people can use algorithms and information and fact finding to neutralize threats before they happen, this guy was on social media saying exactly what he was going to do and how he was going to do it and nothing happened.",

So, it's very troubling, A, that this was identified a significant amount of time ago. It's troubling, B, that with the Super Bowl being awarded to the city that this was not prioritized immediately to get done.And as we stand now, as this council is collecting information from the contractors and the parties involved in the installation of those bollards, we're getting to the bottom of what happened? Because right now there was a problem. It was identified by people higher up in the administration. And obviously, what was done to address this problem before this attack was beyond insufficient. So, we're engaged in that fact-finding. It was delayed slightly because, as you know, with a terrorist attack, the FBI, the federal government really controls the scene to a certain point. But we're in the middle of getting into that, and we're going to be transparent and we're going to find the answers to those questions.",

      "sentences": "It certainly should not be necessary, although there is a near tie in the House of Representatives between the two parties, and that's what makes this a special circumstance. But you would think an incoming president could quietly let certain members know of his views, wouldn't even have to post, wouldn't have to go on Truth Social, and that would be enough. And particularly an incumbent speaker who, while he has upset some people at sometimes, which speaker doesn't, he hasn't been terribly controversial as some prior Republican speakers have been.So, it is remarkable, and Trump has had to weigh in over and over and over again using Capital that I'm sure he would rather spend on his first proposals. But, you know, Jim, what's really revealing, and I do think Johnson will get it in the end because of a lack of alternatives, look at the other leadership members. They've all got enemies. So, you know, who -- of course, they don't need a speaker from Congress. They could get someone outside Congress, but I don't think Jesus Christ is available and he's pretty liberal if you read his words. So, they're stuck with him. And they -- most of them are reasonably satisfied with him. But what this really tells us is it's going to be a massive struggle for Trump and the new administration to get lots of things passed and quickly. They have factions just like the Democrats do. And you could argue that the Republican factions right now, since they've had so much victory, are tougher and more quarrelsome than the Democratic factions.",

And you know, it seems to me going into this next Congress, Larry, that Mike Johnson is going to have just zero wiggle room when it comes to getting legislation passed. As you were just saying a few moments ago, Trump is claiming he has this large mandate, which obviously is not the case if you look at the numbers from the last election, but if he wants to get an ambitious agenda passed through the Congress, it's going to have to go through that House of Representatives and there just doesn't seem to be a lot of a lot of room there to get big pieces of legislation passed that, you know, adhere to the MAGA agenda.",

They can manage to do it, but how many times can they manage to do it? And how are they going to rely on any Democratic votes?Last time, the Democrats did help Johnson out.
