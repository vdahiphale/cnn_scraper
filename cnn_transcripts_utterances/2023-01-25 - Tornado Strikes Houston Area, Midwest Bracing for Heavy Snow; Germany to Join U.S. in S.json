This is where it all started. This is the intersection that police say that Tyre Nichols was first stopped by police and then he ran. There was a pursuit along this road here all the way -- just about under a mile near where his mother lives, and that is where ultimately he would die, where investigators say police wind up catching up to him and then something happened. And according to the family, which has viewed body camera footage, they say that he was beaten in that location, ultimately was taken to the hospital where he died. Now, Don, most of what we know about what happened here is not coming from the police. They have refused to release any information, basic questions to the police about were these officers in uniform? What time exactly was Tyre Nichols taken to the hospital? All those questions have remained unanswered by the police. As we know five officers were fired, two EMTs here were placed on leave as a result of this incident. And now we wait.

Is it possible to prosecute a former president, like what is the sort of standard, what are the venues where that is possible? We don't have an answer to that yet. But we do know that Georgia is important to watch because there's specific crime, there are statutes that you can look at and say this was violated.We have this phone call that the president made that was very straightforward and they were able to do things that the January 6th committee couldn't do. The people who blew off testimony, all of a sudden, they had to sit in that room before the grand jury. It's a different ball game. And that's why this thing is important. I don't know if we need to see that report before they hand down their indictments but this is a different case to look at.",

They're saying she could bring racketeering charges potentially.",

But it does speak to the idea that the former president did not act alone in his activities around the 2020 election.And I think one other thing I want to mention is the atmosphere in Georgia politically is very different, the lieutenant governor can speak to this. Brian Kemp very much was not going down the road of election denialism. So, I think that there is this kind of leeway where if someone is doing an objective, it's a not political process, it's like this criminal process that I think the public will have a slightly different view of it.

Most focus on the phone call, the dreaded phone call that was just cringe worthy with Brad Raffensperger. But there's also this whole basket of conspiracy theories and this deluge of misinformation. And if they're going to use the racketeering charge, they're going to be able to see was it an intentional, coordinated effort to mislead the population to try to re-steer the election.
