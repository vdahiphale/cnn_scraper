      "sentences": "Good morning and happy holidays. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. Tough couple of weeks for former President Donald Trump just got even worse. There was the controversy over dining with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes. Then his family business was convicted on all 17 counts of criminal tax fraud.His final handpick 2022 candidate Herschel Walker lost and distanced himself from Trump's attack on the Constitution. And Trump's own legal team found more classified documents he still had squirreled away near Mar-a-Lago. Trump's now raising money by selling online NFT cards of himself as a superhero. Although I have to say the cards sold out in 24 hours and the price skyrocketed from 99 bucks to 1000s. Still no wonder that polls show him trailing Ron DeSantis in a hypothetical one on one 2024 matchup. And now comes word that on Monday, the House Select Committee investigating January 6, whose final report will be released next week. We'll ask the Justice Department to pursue multiple charges against Trump. The charges being considered they include insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. The final committee report could include additional proposed charges for Trump based on its findings. A Trump spokesman Steven Cheung criticized the committee in a statement as a, quote, Kangaroo court that held show trials by Never Trump partisans who are a stain on this country's history. What impact such House referrals could have remains unclear since DOJ Special Counsel Jack Smith's January 6th probe is already examining Donald Trump's role? I want to know what you think, go to smerconish.com and answer this week's poll question. \"Does Donald Trump rebound politically from his recent setbacks?\" Joining us now is Renato Mariotti, former federal prosecutor, co-host of the podcast, \"It's Complicated,\" and legal affairs columnist for Politico. Renato, nice to see you. I get that the referral is of no legal significance. But does it nonetheless increase pressure on Jack Smith in his role as special counsel?",

Friday, a federal appeals court rejected a bid by several Republican led states to keep in place the Trump era rule that used pandemic restrictions to turn away thousands of migrants. So the rule known as Title 42 will expire this coming Wednesday.As a Homeland Security Intelligence memo reviewed by CNN puts it this change will, quote, likely increase migration flows immediately. DHS has previously projected between 9,000 to 14,000 migrants arriving a day, more than double the current number of people crossing. The border town of El Paso, Texas already has over 2,000 migrants arriving daily. In a statement Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas blamed inaction for the crisis saying, quote, despite our efforts, our outdated immigration system is under strain in the absence of congressional action to reform the immigration and asylum systems. A significant increase in migrant encounters will strain our system even further. The DHS has unveiled an emergency six-point plan, including the hiring of nearly 1,000 Border Patrol crossing coordinators and 2,500 additional contractors and personnel from government agencies. Joining me now is Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents approximately 16,000 Border Patrol agents of whom 14,000 are on the southern border.

And when they gave those carve outs, that encourage more people to cross.So when you look at Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, when you look at people from all of these different countries, we're not expelling them.

That's why the cartels are able to generate a profit that we've never seen before. And as they're generating that profit, as they're flooding our resources with illegal border crossings as it takes our agents out of the field, that's when they create gaps in our coverage.

But according to the National Park Service, about 100 make their home in the Santa Monica Mountains. Local residents are often surprised by these Cougars on hikes or even in their yards.And this week, perhaps the most infamous, an 11-year-old male known as P-22, was captured south of his home range of Griffith Park after having attacked and killed a pet Chihuahua being walked on a leash back in November. P-22 had previously been suspected in the killing of a koala at the LA zoo in 2016. The lion became iconic after a National Geographic photographer, check that picture out. Snap that image of him near the Hollywood sign back in 2012. Love that. He has his own mountain line of Hollywood Facebook page with 19,000 followers and there's an annual P-22 day festival and videos of hikes retracing his steps. His journey to Griffith Park is itself remarkable if you know the topography of Los Angeles. Because for him to have gotten from the Santa Monica Mountains in the West to Griffith Park in the east, he would have had to cross two major freeways, the 405 and 101. These big cats survived despite fragmentation of their habitat by roads and other developments, which also lead to vehicle collisions and inbreeding. P-22 was the face for the campaign for the Wallace Annenberg wildlife crossing, which is now under construction, costing an estimated $90 million. This overpass 200 feet above the busy 10 lanes of the 101 will be the longest wildlife crossing in the world. Completion expected in 2025. The issue now is what to do with P-22. After capture, he was transferred to a wild animal care facility for evaluation. He's severely underweight and suffering from an eye injury. The Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Department issued a statement saying that they will work together to find the most humane option available for the lion and the community in which he lives. So what does that look like? Well, joining me now is Beth Pratt, Regional Executive Director of the California National Wildlife Federation. Beth also leads the hashtag Save LA Cougars. She's been following P-22 for the last 10 years. What is it, Beth, about P-22 that captivates so many of us? I'm in this category. I follow that Facebook page.",

Here's this beautiful, magnificent animal who, like you said, you know, caught did the impossible. I can't even drive on the 405 without feeling like I'm not going to make it as I'm sure you do to find a home in Griffith Park, which is the most improbable of places. There's the Hollywood sign as the observatory. So to me, it's the typical underdog story, right? We love underdogs in Hollywood and he's no exception. I will say though, I think it's something deeper. I think, the connection to wildness in Los Angeles that we thought was lost. I think he brings us that and I think that's why he's resonated with so many people when he has so many people not just in L.A. but around the world really rooting for him.",

Ultimate, they got a state law changed, or as the \"New York Times\" put it, they fought the lawn, and the lawn's done.Lawns like everything else have lately become a polarizing issue in America. Where traditionalists see beloved green grass, environmentalists see ecological deserts that devour too much water and pesticides. For two decades, Janet and Jeff Crouch lived happily on a quiet cul- de-sac in Columbia, Maryland. Instead of grass they opted for a more ecological pollinator meadow, planting native plants to attract wildlife all without pesticides. Their garden brought hummingbirds and butterflies, bumblebees and goldfinches. It's all part of a national movement. According to the National Wildlife Federation in 2020, there was a 50 percent increase in people creating wildlife gardens. The \"Times\" quotes ecologist Douglas Tallamy, author of \"Nature's Best Hope\" who urges homeowners to make their land conservation corridors -- quote -- \"This idea that humans and nature cannot coexist is destroying the entire planet, which in turn is destroying humans.\" The only way forward is to coexist, he says. But their next door neighbor began to complain saying, the Crouch's yard was -- quote -- \"a mess of a jungle.\" He claimed that it was overgrown with weeds, figurines and rain water barrels attracting rodents, deer, snakes, bats. And like 74 other -- million other Americans they reside in a community with a homeowners association. And in the fall of 2017 a lawyer for the HOA sent the Crouches a letter. It said that their plantings not only violated the bylaws but were eye sores that hurt property values. The Crouches were told, your yard is not a place for such a habitat. And they were given 10 days to rip it all up and put down grass. Jeff and Janet Crouch join me to talk more about it. So, Janet, some look at your yard, they see this environmentally-sound pollinator meadow, I guess, is the way I'm supposed to describe it, and then there are people like your neighbor who see is a -- quote -- unquote -- \"mess of a jungle.\" To those detractors what do you say?",
