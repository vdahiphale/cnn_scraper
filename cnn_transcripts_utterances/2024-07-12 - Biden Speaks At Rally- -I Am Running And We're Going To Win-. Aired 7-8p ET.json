      "sentences": "And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.And OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, you see on your screen right now, a stage in Michigan, that's where President Biden is about to speak any moment at a rally, a state his campaign admits is crucial, is key, as must win to their path to victory in November. Biden is trying to steady his campaign. He's trying to shift the national attention back to Trump. We're going to be taking this rally live here. We do anticipate in walking up there any second. Biden's rally in Michigan does follow some welcome news for the president today. According to a new poll, Biden is statistically tied with Trump actually up 50, 50 to 48 percent. Now that is statistical tie, although he's the one directionally up there. And that is the same exact margin that Biden had before the debate. A poll is a poll, it's a moment in time, it is a poll. It is still something to consider, and it is not stopping for new Democratic House members though today from calling for Biden to step aside. The total number right now tonight of those making that call of the president is 19. Also tonight, a group of 20 for former Democratic lawmakers are now calling for an open convention for the Democrats. I want to get straight to Arlette Saenz. She's with the president in Detroit and as I said, he's going to be walking out there and that screen a moment. We're going to listen to him when he does. Arlette, though, as he is preparing to walk out, he did make a few unplanned and impromptu stops before this event. And, you know, they were not -- they were not at the schedule. But you were able to observe and he's clearly trying to take the advice of some of his critics and do these impromptu events.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, he really is, Erin. President Biden is expected to take the stage any minute now, here at this high school in Detroit, Michigan, but before he came to this high school, he made about 15 minute stop at a local restaurant with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She is among those who has urged President Biden really to hold these more impromptu, unscripted type of events to show voters he is up for a second term.The presidents spent 15 minutes in that room walking around, holding a microphone without any teleprompter in sight? As he tried to make his case to these voters, and he very explicitly tried to assure these voters about his candidacy, saying, I promise you I'm okay. It comes as there is major anxiety within the Democratic Party, something that Biden's advisers have acknowledged, but they are trying to set up this, these types of moments -- these trips across the country to show voters that he is up for a second term in office. Now, one thing that President Biden is expected to do tonight in his remarks here in Detroit, is really trying to lean into drawing a contrast with former President Donald Trump when it pertains to policy. The president is quite eager to tie Trump to Project 2025. That is that conservative policy blueprints that Trump has tried to distance himself, but Democrats are very eager to continue hammering away at Trump at, as they believe it would pose significant threats to the rights and freedoms of Americans in this country. The president in his remarks is expected to really portray Project 2025 and Trump's presidency as dead -- deadly serious at this moment. Now, President Biden really wants to try to refocus the conversation in this debate to be on Donald Trump, instead of the issues that he is having within his own campaign. But we have increasingly seen these Democratic lawmakers openly express their concerns about Biden staying in this race, close to 20 now saying that she needs to step aside. So Biden and his team are really hoping that events like this will help get his candidacy back on track, putting him in front of voters, having them see him perform day-to-day as he's looking to make his case that he is up for a second term.",

      "sentences": "Erin, it's been an extraordinary really another day, 15 days now since that debate performance. And where things stand at the end of this Friday in Washington are a mess, quite frankly, in the words of one Democratic operative, this is a circular firing squad and they do not see a way out. Several things happen here before the president flew to Michigan, he had a meeting last evening with Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House leader. And I am told that there was no implicit endorsement and that was clear from the statement he put out today.He said he shared candid views. But when you stop and think about the House Democratic leader going for a one-on-one meeting with the president, perhaps a couple of aides were also in the room without endorsing him. Erin, that tells you what you need to know about the views of Democratic members of Congress. They're worried about their own elections and even more of them came out today urging the president to step aside. However, the president is taking this to the people. We saw him campaigning in Michigan this afternoon will see him at this rally tonight. I am struck right now by this ironic moment. In March of 2020, Joe Biden stood in this exact same high school gymnasium right before the Michigan primary. And this is where he said he would be a bridge to the future. It was in this very high school auditorium. In fact, I was there just a couple of months ago talking to some young voters about what they think of President Biden and him being a bridge. He was asked about that last evening and he said one of the reasons he is staying in this race is because of how serious things became the administration with COVID, with the economy. But it will be interesting tonight to see if the president references that bridge remark. He was standing at that moment by -- flanked by Kamala Harris, Senator Cory Booker, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. He was presenting himself as the bridge to the future of the party. And now, of course, he is running for reelection and it is so controversial among Democrats themselves. So, the moment he finds its himself here is the one of crisis, but he's surrounded by supporters as you can see in that gymnasium. So this could give him some life to go another day -- Erin.",

And, of course, you know, he will point to and ironically, right, the polls, second polls since the debate to show no change statistically tied, but with Biden up to important. I do -- I do note the irony of a president who has disdain for the polls recently and has made no, no, no bones about that.But in Michigan and you mentioned having been in that very auditorium or gym where he's going to appear in just a moment, Jeff, it is the latest that we understand from the Biden campaign, right? That any path to victory to 270 electoral votes go through Michigan, goes through Michigan, a state that even prior to this, had challenges for him, given what's going on in Israel with the war in Gaza. So, what does Michigan look like right now for Biden?",

There is no path to reelection for Joe Biden without winning Michigan or Wisconsin, or Pennsylvania. This is central for all to his path. So yes, he's trying to make thiscase there, but it is a more difficult case than it was even before the debate. It was complicated for him. But some new comments coming in this evening from the head of the UAW, Shawn Fain, really raising some pointed observations about President Biden. Listen to what he said just a little while ago.

I did mention though the Democratic lawmakers today, who have -- you've got a few more coming out against the candidacy. Obviously, the poll coming out showing Biden no change since before the debate itself. Let's go to Sunlen Serfaty because she's on Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "Well, Erin, they're certainly has been a drip, drip, drip of a handful of additional lawmakers today calling for President Biden to step aside. But behind the scenes, we are hearing that there are many others who are in essence waiting in the wings. Two lawmakers telling CNN today that there is a group of additional lawmakers that very likely could come out and call for him to step aside.But the feeling is that a lot of people are waiting to see this consistent action from President Biden while out on the campaign trail, consistency is the key here, according to many who are watching this. Now, we know that President Biden and his team has really ramped up the congressional outreach today. I'm holding in a series of call with specific groups here in Congress, many of whom have been behind the scenes critical. He talked to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. He will speak tomorrow to two similar groups that -- progressive caucus as well. So, very clear that they understand it. They've got to keep up this outreach especially ads and notably as members head back to their districts, lawmakers went back to their home districts late last night. There'll be there for recess all next week, and it's very clear that lawmakers are taking in the opinions of many of their constituents that hearing it out while they're out in their districts. In many of the statements that lawmakers this week issue, they say, we heard from our constituents. This is what I heard and that factored into my decision. Congressman Cori Bush, notably earlier today, she's a member of the Congressional Black Caucus so far has stood by President Biden. She is not publicly said whether she's with him or not. But she said 100 percent of the calls coming into our office are calling for him to step aside -- Erin.",

Then meeting with people on an overflow room as Arlette just reported, and now on a photo line and we'll see when he comes out.In the meantime, though, I know, Jeff Zeleny, you we talk about what were going to hear from him and what he actually said that at that impromptu campaign stop where he did talk about the debate, he talked about how it was bad. He talked about how he is confident. He says that he can serve another four more years. Are we going to see a shift from him? I know you've got -- just gotten off the phone with some sources on sort of what we expect to hear from the president.",

      "sentences": "Erin, one thing we know President Biden is going to do is try and shift the conversation to Donald Trump. That is the biggest worry of Democrats overall that 15 days have been spent talking about Joe Biden's condition, whether people think he is strong enough to run or not?This was an election about strength in the first place. It was as -- it was designed by the Biden campaigns view, at least to be a referendum on Donald Trump. So he's going to try and turn the conversation back, of course, to the Trump campaign. But that is not going to quiet the concerns. But, Erin, I was struck last evening watching the final moments of that news this conference and talking to advisers today, they said he did indeed strike a new tone, not nearly as combative or defiant. And in fact, he's listening more and needs to show people that he hears their concerns. So you heard him joking this afternoon as he made a stop in a diner. He was talking about his age in a joking way. So I expect him to do a bit more of that tonight. But, Erin, someone else who is not on stage there tonight is Governor Gretchen Whitmer. She had a previously scheduled event, but also the Senate candidates. Michigan is also home of one of the most competitive Senate races in the country. So that also is the backdrop to so much of this just yesterday afternoon, we saw a western Michigan member of Congress, Congresswoman Hillary Scholten, said she believes the president should step down, said she's been hearing from her constituents. Yes, he's width Debbie Dingell. We can see him walking out here now into this a high school gymnasium. Motown is Joe town. He certainly hopes that is the case, but it is not the people in the audience there he needs to convince. It's his own fellow Democrats, of course, as well as voters across Michigan, and indeed that blue wall. We can't say this enough. He cannot win reelection without winning Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. But so striking how he's here again trying to make his case to Michigan voters, Erin.",

And this is whySo they've been sort of serving as a sounding board, but Nancy Pelosi has been much more out front about this. We remember her comments from Wednesday, of course, saying that this decision has not been made. She opened the door to the very idea that the president may still be deciding what he's going to do. In fact, he had already decided that he's in the race. So the Obama or Pelosi connection here when the history books of this are written, many Democrats, I believe, who I've been speaking with say that it will show that they are trying to guide this discussion. Now, President Obama, for his part, is trying not to be heavy-handed here. No one can tell President Biden what to do they're trying to give him the space to make that decision. But you can just hear the applause there and hear the support. This is going to definitely boost and elevate President Biden without question.",
