Of course, the location where she's going to make those remarks is significant because former President Donald Trump, of course, deliver that fiery address on January 6, here where the -- which sparked his supporters going and attacking the U.S. Capitol but her advisers also pick this location because they wanted the gravity of the moment to come through and also the visual as you can see, the White House is right behind me. In fact, the oval office, which is what the vice president is seeking is 500 yards from here. So they are trying to paint that contrast, and also a broader vision.

It's made a lot of people I know scared. It's -- one thing that people are worried about is if the election does go to Trump, the trans people will be blamed for this outcome.",

Every Republican state has passed bills, has passed laws to ban trans girls from participating in school sports. But then what has happened is they've then gone a step further in almost every one of those states to then banned health care for trans kids, to then restrict health care for trans adults, to then affect how trans people as a whole can exist in society.So it's clear that this is more of a Trojan horse issue than actually Republicans pretending to care about fairness in sports. And one other point on that is that, you know, when -- when you're talking to girl -- about trans girls participating in grade school and high school sports, for the most part, sports is where people come together to form a community, to play with her friends and these -- these laws, the pushing to divide, divide trans people out of this is essentially saying you don't belong, you're okay to bully. You're okay to exclude. And I think that that's shameful.",

The IDF says it was targeting Hamas militants or terrorists.CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more from Israel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): These men aren't looking for survivors. Amid a rubble of another Israeli airstrike, they are here for the bodies. After all, how could anyone survived destruction on this scale? More than 90 people were killed in this Israeli strike in northern Gaza early Tuesday morning, including 25 children, according to the Palestinian ministry of health an Israeli military spokesman said the military was targeting a suspected terrorists in the area and did not intend to collapse the building. But the bodies have not yet all been counted as this man can attest. Here's a body, and here's another and another he says, pointing out there locations. And then there are the bodies of this boy's uncle and cousin, wedged between two slabs of concrete. Her feet is all that is visible. Gaza's rescue workers cannot reach this part of northern Gaza which has been besieged by the Israeli military for nearly a month. That means no heavy machinery, just bare hands sifting through the rubble. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya is one of just two doctors here, and he's growing desperate, calling for a humanitarian corridor to bring surgical teams to his hospital. There are children with bones protruding from their bodies needing orthopedic surgery. There are brain injuries that require neurosurgeons he says. But Israel's parliaments may make matters worse. In an overwhelming vote, Israeli lawmakers move to ban UNRWA, the main U.N. agency aiding Palestinians from operating in Israel or engaging with Israeli officials. Israel accuses UNRWA of ties to Hamas after linking a handful of its thousands of employees to the October 7th attacks, a blanket charge UNRWA vehemently denies. It's a move the U.S. says could not come at a worse time.",
