      "sentences": "Moments ago, John Durham, the special counsel who investigated the investigators behind the Trump Russia probe, arrived on Capitol Hill. He's meeting with the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors ahead of a public Judiciary Committee meeting tomorrow.Last month, Durham concluded that the FBI never should have launched a full probe into alleged connections between Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. CNN's Zach Cohen is live on Capitol Hill for us. So, Zach, what do we know about this meeting? ZACH COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yeah, Boris, it's important to remember that John Durham was appointed when former President Donald Trump was still in office over four years ago. And that investigation led to the report that he released last month. And now, today, for the first time, Democrats and Republicans will have a chance to sit in-person and ask questions of John Durham about his investigation. Now, John Durham's report was pretty polarizing based on the interpretations and the responses that we've seen from Republicans and Democrats. Republicans, you know, view it as a compelling and damning account of the FBI's shortcomings when it comes to their decision to launch an investigation into Donald Trump and his connections with Russia, where Democrats see it more as a, you know, reiteration of the same criticisms of the FBI that we've seen from the Inspector General previously. Now, Durham's going to have a chance to answer questions from both parties ahead of tomorrow's public hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee. Now, the House Intelligence Committee is notoriously -- has been preaching a message of bipartisanship, but the House Judiciary Committee a little bit more politicized since its formation, with its chairman, Jim Jordan running the show tomorrow. There could be some political fireworks because of that. But both sides really gearing up for the first chance to talk to John Durham in -person since his report was released last month.",

The former president falsely claimed his predecessors left office with copious quantities of classified materials, like when he baselessly accused former President Obama of taking more than 30 million records. That one prompted the National Archives to issue a statement debunking the claim. Then, in January, Trump claimed that he merely kept empty folders that were labeled classified as a keepsake.

They want it to go to trial fast, and nobody has come into court yet to argue.Actually, we need more time to either take care of classified records issues or to take care of other issues that might arise because it's a pretty complex case.

It's a big chunk of flesh that is missing. And the judges, with North Carolina's Big Rock Blue Marlin tournament disqualified the team because they said the fish was mutilated, likely by a shark, and that is against the rules. The team says they won fair and square, and they have filed a formal protest of the decision.Some Nashville parents whose children were killed during the shooting at the Covenant School in March are trying to block the release of the dead gunman's writings. They have asked the court to deny the media's request to review them, and they've expressed concerns that their children would be forced to suffer additional trauma. A brief filed by the local media cites the First Amendment and calls the documents public records. And it took 60 plus years but a terrible wrong has been rectified for a 75-year-old Eagle Scout. When Sam Jones was 15, he was not allowed to participate in the Eagle Scout badge ceremony. His White Scout leader at the time said Jones did not come from a model African American home because Jones was raised in public housing by a single mother. But that has changed. Jones, who, by the way, is a Vietnam veteran, finally received that long denied badge of honor during a ceremony yesterday in Washington State. Long overdue, Jim.",

Long a top target of the right.And Republicans are alleging that Hunter Biden got special treatment here, even though we should point out this was a Trump appointed judge overseeing the case, and even though most people are not charged with lying on firearm forms. So legal experts say this is actually a pretty harsh penalty given what Hunter Biden admitted to in this plea deal. And Republicans are also trying to falsely equate this case with the case the federal criminal indictment of Donald Trump over the mishandling of classified documents and allegedly obstructing justice, even though those are two very different cases. Let's take a listen to Speaker Kevin McCarthy and what he told reporters a little bit earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER: My first reaction is that he continues to show the two-tier system in America. If you were the President who's leading political opponents, the DOJ tries to literally put you in jail and give you prison time. If you are the President's son, you get a sweetheart deal. Now, this does nothing to our investigation.
