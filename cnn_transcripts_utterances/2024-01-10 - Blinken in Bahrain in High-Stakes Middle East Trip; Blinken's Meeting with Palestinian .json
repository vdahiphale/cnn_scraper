Bahrain in 2020 normalized ties with Israel. Earlier in the West Bank, Blinken met with the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas. He reiterated U.S. support for a Palestinian state. They also talked about minimizing harm to civilians and increasing aid to Gaza. Delivering some of that aid has been challenging. The U.N. says Israel has repeatedly blocked efforts to bring medical supplies to one hospital in northern Gaza to fuel, water and sanitation facilities there. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv where Antony Blinken will return in a few hours. Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon. Natasha, I'll come to you momentarily because it's important for us to understand why secretary of state Antony Blinken is in Bahrain and what is going on in the Red Sea. Let's start with you, Jeremy. What do we understand Antony Blinken to have achieved on this trip? This is a multistop tour; very specifically he was with the war cabinet and Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday in Tel Aviv. The understanding is there is a lot of pressure coming from the State Department and the top diplomat from the U.S. on Israel to protect civilians and ensure more humanitarian aid is brought into Gaza. What has he achieved at this point?",

It's one of the four countries who have recently normalized relations with Israel. It's also, of course, home to the U.S. 5th Fleet. So a number of reasons why perhaps we can understand why Antony Blinken is in Bahrain it today. And we know that the escalation of this conflict is something that is really concerning to the Biden administration at this point. What are you hearing there?",

They don't want to upset a very delicate truce and peace that has been brokered by the U.S. and U.N. inside Yemen last year. I should say in 2022, something the U.S. is very proud of and doesn't want to upend. The Houthis are testing that proposition every day. The U.S. of course responded by shooting down over a dozen, roughly 21 missiles and drones, launched by the Houthis overnight against Red Sea targets. The U.K. also helped to shoot those down and is one of the largest attacks that we've seen against the Red Sea, targets of the Red Sea since all of this kind of began. The U.S. is now likely going to feel like it is having to respond, especially because the U.S. and the coalition, about 13 other countries, they released a statement earlier this month, saying that, essentially, it was the last warning to the Houthis that if they don't stop these attacks they're going to bear the consequences. The U.S. as of right, now they've been examining options to strike the Houthis inside Yemen. We previously reported that the president has been given options to potentially strike certain infrastructure as well as targets that the Houthis have been using to launch these missiles and drones from. But again, this is not something the U.S. has been eager to, do they may be given no choice at this point because the Houthis have continued their attacks but it remains to be seen whether they are going to take that very dramatic next step, Becky.",

Antony Blinken making a real effort to try to bring on board Arab allies around the region for what is known as a sort of day-after plan for Gaza. Earlier, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas told Mr. Blinken that his government would reject any attempt by Israel to relocate Palestinians from Gaza. On Tuesday, Blinken said he had received renewed assurances from Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel will not forcibly remove Palestinian civilians from Gaza, despite comments made to the contrary by far-right members of Mr. Netanyahu's cabinet. Take a listen at a U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow. They must not be pressed to leave Gaza. As I told the prime minister, the United States unequivocally rejects any proposals advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza.

They have to retain that right. So we have to start thinking and documenting the amount of damage. Numbers say that 88 percent of the houses in the north have been destroyed. And the rest of the country 85. So yes, we have to start documenting, asking people about their willingness to return, if they feel safe, if they're willing to take back their lives, as I bet they want to. But obviously different conditions have to be given. Safety is the first one. And conditions are not there yet. We don't see safety conditions yet for the moment. But temporary housing can be made.

The House subpoenaed Hunter Biden come and testify. He initially arrived on Capitol Hill on that date and time and didn't testify and now showing up that hearing where he was going to be held in contempt. One of the things that his lawyers know very well is that the House and Congress don't have a lot of ways to enforce a subpoena quickly, to compel someone to show up in front of them and to answer questions. One of the things that made it even harder for them to enforce a subpoena like that and force the questions is if the person is right there in front of them or even responds in some way through their attorneys. So Hunter Biden's team is essentially calling the bluff of Congress, of this House committee, led by Republicans right now. And on top of that, something to remember is that, when he got that subpoena a few weeks ago from the House, it was before he was facing two separate sets of criminal charges, federal criminal charges, that are quite serious. And that Hunter Biden and his team have vowed to take to trial. Just tomorrow, Hunter is set to be in California, in Los Angeles, in a federal courtroom, responding to some very serious and lengthy tax related allegations, entering a pleading of not guilty. So there is really a possibility that, even if he were responding to the subpoena in Congress, just as they had asked originally, he wouldn't even be able to answer questions because he might want to take the 5th.
