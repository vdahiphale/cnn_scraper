A lot of people were worried about localized flooding.We haven't seen any of that in the Glynn County area. I started the day in Brunswick, the same thing. The story of the day really in Glynn County, Brunswick, and St. Simons Island where I am right now, has really been the wind. There has been a steady wind going from 20 to 30 knots up to 50 to 60 knots. And I'm in an area of St. Simons Island that has a lot of trees. So, I just want to show you guys what the wind has been doing to this area. We haven't seen very many down-to-tree limbs or trees, but you can see that there is quite a bit of debris that is Meadow Drive here in St. Simons Island. And this is Broadway Street. Again, we can take a look down this street, not very much debris, not very many trees down until we get a report about this. A massive oak tree that has fallen on power lines. And you can see that it is being held up by those power lines. I actually spoke to the homeowner in the house to our left just now. He said that this tree fell down at around 11:00. And thankfully, they still have power on this particular block. But suffice it to say that this is the type of issue that this area will be experiencing as of course we know there is a high water table in the southeast Florida and northern Georgia. And if we take a look at the base of this tree, it did not break. It actually came up from the root, which means that the ground is soft, and the high winds that have been blowing through this area for the last couple of days is what caused this massive tree again to topple over on the power lines. Now, again, the homeowner told me that this happened around 11:00. City works came out and actually put these cones here to block the road. The fire department also came out to assess the situation with city workers and homeowners. We're not given a timetable as of yet as to when this massive tree will be removed from the power lines. The same homeowner that gave me this information told me also that over the last hour, they have seen the power lines that this tree is being held up by begin to sag by about a foot. So, again, the story of the day really here in Southeast Georgia has been the wind. It's not really a water storm. It is more of a windstorm. As I'm sure you can hear the wind blowing through the trees. Again, we're going to be out here covering this for the rest of the day. But again, this is really more of a windstorm than it is a water storm. And we'll continue to have updates when available. Guys, back to you.",

It's a very serious thing.And with the storm's worst impacts now making their way across Southeast Georgia, coastal communities are bracing for Idalia.

What's been very interesting specifically here with Crystal River is the fact that we're seeing these rescues by boat.About an hour and a half ago, we saw two fire rescue boats from Citrus County come out and perform at least two separate rescues of groups. And as I'm speaking, I can still hear that buzzing of the boat going around these nearby neighborhoods. But that's how deep the water here has gotten. And this high tide is concerning as well. Now, I mentioned those two groups that were rescued. one of them groups rescued with all their belongings, rescued alongside their dog as well then take into Highway 19 behind me where it's a lot more shallow. And if you can hear that noise ramping up, that's the noise of a boat that is approaching, a Fire Rescue boat. I'll step out so you can take a look. This is a group here that appears to be rescued yet again by Citrus County Fire Rescue. They've been performing these rescues now for several hours. And you can see just how much more shallow it is on this side. Again, we've been seeing this happen over and over again. One of the rescues even evolved the massive birdcage that these fire rescue teams were able to take out of one of these homes. So, once they're able to get them out of their home, which probably they were hunkered in to see out the storm, they take them there which is shallow, and then emergency crews will assess them, assist them with anything that they may need and then they're able to escape. But many of these people have been waiting for hours now at this point, especially this last group getting rescued here just to be able to get out of their own homes. It takes us back to that conversation of those who were able to evacuate, chose to evacuate and those who decided to stay behind, we heard from officials none of this that we're seeing here is necessarily surprising, but the images are shocking.",

The problem we see right now, our flash flood problems.We've had nine inches of rainfall in one county in southern Georgia, just over the past eight hours. So, that's obviously the problem. These areas that are still in red, yes, they're still 75-mile-per-hour winds, bringing down trees and some power lines. But that threat of 13o, 140 miles per hour, that's all gone. All we're seeing now is the threats of some tornadoes that could come down, and also the very, very heavy rainfall that's yet to hit Charleston, yet to really hit Savannah, but it's on its way. And then of course, that tornado threat as waterspouts coming on short. Anytime you have a big cell in a rotating system like this, any of these cells could actually rotate themselves and so therefore put down a potential tornado. But there's the very, very heavy rainfall, Valdosta just your West. Some spots there, eight inches of rain on the ground already. And also southeast of Valdosta, the same story. So, flash flood warnings, and even some flash flooding emergencies are likely today. Look at all the power outages. I just checked Google Earth maps for the I-10. It is shut down for miles and miles and miles with all the signs saying debris, debris, debris all across Interstate-10. No travel going through there. Some of the smaller highways are open. But if you take a look at all these red lines that are the highway's traffic flow, there's just no reason to go east or west across northern Florida today. It will be a very big nightmare with all of those trees that we showed everywhere, you see -- every picture we see of a live shot, there's either a tree or a branch or something down. That's what all the Florida -- the northern part of Florida and now southern Georgia is dealing with. But it's the heavy rainfall. That's the next real threat here. It's the flash flooding. If you're in a flood-prone area, you already probably know it here across the Carolinas and into Georgia. And that flooding will be going all day long.",
