There were three other individuals at the residence, including a minor inside the home who were able to hide and avoid being shot by Gordon as he went through the house searching for them.Following the shootings, at approximately 09:01 a.m. Gordon drove to the unit block of Edgewood Lane, Levittown, where he forcibly broke into a residence after which he shot and killed 25-year-old, with whom he has two children. Following the shooting, he fled the scene. At the time of the shooting, there were four other individuals present inside that home, one of which was injured after being bludgeoned by Gordon with the assault rifle. She was transported to Jefferson campus for her injuries. At approximately 09:13 a.m., Gordon committed a carjacking at gunpoint of a 44-year-old man from Morrisville at the parking lot of the Dollar General on Bristol Pike and Morrisville. The operator of the vehicle did not suffer any injuries. Gordon is believed to currently be homeless and has ties to the Trenton area. At approximately 11:38 a.m., the Honda CRV that was the carjacking victim's vehicle from Bucks County was located unoccupied and the 100 block of Miller Street in Trenton, New Jersey. At approximately 12:22 p.m., we received information that Gordon is currently barricaded in New Jersey with hostages. He's inside the residence on the 100 block of Phillips Street in Trenton. We are referring all information regarding that aspect of the investigation to the Trenton police department. At approximately 12:25 p.m. we lifted our shelter in place. I will answer the questions that we're able to answer at this juncture. And I'll turn it over some -- excuse me for one second. I'm going to -- I'm going to turn it over -- that's OK, Joe. I'm going to turn it over to Chief Whitney for a few additional remarks, thanking the resources, the tremendous resources that have been devoted to investigating and preventing further criminal acts from this individual.

The first thing if you have the opportunity to do it, and it looks from this compelling video that they had the chance to and took advantage of it, you want to get as many potential hostages, residents, or actual hostages out on, out of that building and off the scene to safety as you possibly can.And what you're seeing there is a very careful, incredibly dangerous, risky move, but one that successfully evacuated a number of those hostages. Every time you have a hostage leave the set, the level of risk and danger reduces somewhat. And that is really the thing that law enforcement is focused on going forward. As everybody thinks about hostage situations in terms of a tactical entry where a tactical team or a SWAT team goes in and confronts the offender or the hostage taker, in reality, that is the -- that's the option of last resort. It's incredibly dangerous for the law enforcement folks involved and for anybody who is in the house. And so unless people are in imminent danger of serious injury or death, you're going to put that tactical entry off as long as you possibly can. And if you can put it off by engaging with the hostage taker, talking to them, negotiating with them, striking deals for things like food or communications or access to talk to other people, you're going to do that as long as you possibly can. So these things can typically really drag out. If it starts to drag out like that, that's a sign that they do not believe that anyone inside is an imminent danger of death or injury.",

How big is it? How many rooms? What's the layout? They also want to know if it has been combined with any of the structures that are adjacent to it, because that would give your subject the ability to move surreptitiously to a different location. So they're going to be doing that in the background.Upfront, as they determine it's safe to do so, they're going to probably an interact with each one of those adjacent residents, each one of those structures on that block. And if they can, they want to get those people out of there, evacuate them, take them to a place of safety where they can be cared for and catered to until this is all over. That's not always as easy as it sounds. Sometimes you have -- you have homes with people who have medical conditions or mobility issues, and they can't be evacuated quickly and easily.

I would expect that the New Jersey officials have done the same thing. As you mentioned, there is an interstate element to this crime. It started in Pennsylvania, now seems to be centered in Jersey. That's certainly a source of jurisdiction, although I should say carjacking is generally -- there's a federal offense for carjacking because of the mobility involved with carjackings. So there's plenty of federal nexus here to involve the resources from the FBI and other agencies. [14Oftentimes in smaller, more rural spots, your federal partners can bring tools and capabilities to a situation like this that you might, the local agencies might not have, like hostage negotiators, or high- tech surveillance capabilities that can actually give you eyes and ears inside the hostage location.

So now you have someone who is going through an emotionally -- is emotionally disturbed and has weaponry to harm. He's already harmed other people.

And if they want go out in a blaze of glory, they're going to take everybody else with them. It seems that's how the day started. We're just hoping that the day doesn't end that way.So again, the idea here is to try to reason with someone who is -- who may be still somewhat unreasonable. And de-escalation tactics are of paramount importance here. And its not an easy thing to do. Usually after everyone is kind of in a place where they're stationary and they don't feel like they're sort of, for lack of a better term, under the gun to hide somewhere else or to carjack somebody else and flee or whatever it may be, then things start to naturally calm down a little bit. If there's something that they feel that they can use that this suspect might want, then that's -- you try to find something, some sort of common ground, right, to establish that link to try to bring that person to a much more reasonable place, and then, as was mentioned before, to get these other people out there, which they've already done. So that's the good part about this is that no one is an imminent danger at this point, except maybe the suspect himself.",

This is as close as we can take you right now, the yellow tape set up in this Trenton neighborhood. The home that you just showed our viewers is actually about a block just down on this street beyond the second yellow tape. And then where you see that ambulance staged as well as other emergency personnel, you take a left and that's where the home is. In fact, just a few moments ago, emergency personnel, law enforcement here on the scene actually deploying a police drone to try to get a birds-eye view of the home where they say Gordon is essentially barricaded.And we've seen these pretty powerful, dramatic images of individuals actually evacuating that second floor of the home. And that is why authorities do not believe that there is nobody else inside that house except for the suspect. That's clearly an advantage for law enforcement are right now as they can strategize right now before they proceed and they move forward. What's important to also keep in mind is all of this sorted about a 15-mile drive -- 15-minute drive south of here in a Philadelphia suburb, which is where Gordon is believed, according to police, to have shot and killed two individuals before he then proceeded to second home where he shot and killed a third individual there. People found hiding in both of those houses, which is absolutely just an incredible detail here to here from investigators, before eventually committing that carjacking in a parking lot. And that is what eventually brings him to this neighborhood in Trenton, New Jersey, where he abandoned the vehicle actually not far from where I'm standing, and then according to police, eventually made his way to that house. All of this, again, starting at about 09:00 a.m. this morning. Here we are hours later, and now investigators are hoping to bring this to a peaceful end. I can tell you that this has been anything but a peaceful, quiet Saturday for people, not just here in this neighborhood, but also where those shootings happened as shelter in place orders, temporary ones, were issued, even forcing the cancellation of a parade in one of those communities. Fortunately, though, again, investigators, police have now contained that to this particular stretch of road and Trenton as they hope to bring this situation to a peaceful end and bring 26-year-old Andre Gordon under custody.

SANDOVALsaying that at this point they do believe that he had family ties to that residence. We do understand that Bucks County district attorney's office also released the identities of some of those victims that were related to Gordon. In terms of the suspect at this point, they say they did have what they described as minor contacts with him before today, but nothing that would lead investigators to believe that this was an a horizon, this horrible incident would happen today. In terms of a weapon that he is believed to have used according to investigators during these initial shootings, they say that he was armed, likely with a long rifle, possibly an AR style rifle, according to the Bucks County investigators, and also potentially other weapons as well. It's important also to keep in mind here, Fred, that even before that alleged carjacking took place, that Gordon is believed to have driven a stolen vehicle to that very first scene. So now as we get a better idea of the events that transpired this morning, it seems that he drove, according to police, a stolen vehicle to the first location, proceeded to the second one, and then eventually carjacks an individual, does not harm them, fortunately, and then makes his way here about seven miles away from that -- from one of the shooting locations where it ends in this standoff.",

Police were then able to surround this residence where they were safely able to help evacuate other residents who were in the home. It was reported earlier that he had hostages, and so we've only heard from police at their calling them residents who were safely evacuated from this duplex.You're seeing images from earlier today where you saw law enforcement who put a ladder and able to get to the second level burst through a window, were able to escort at least one person that you see right now in this imagery, who then was able to descend and walked down that ladder safely. But the situation is ongoing. Hostage negotiators are presumably negotiating and talking with the suspect to try to end this safely. Here's the suspect, 26 year-old Andre Gordon. With me right now, Cully Stimson. He was assistant an assistant U.S. attorney for violent crime the Washington, D.C. U.S. attorney's office, and prosecuted homicides in D.C. and Maryland. I'm so glad that you're able to be with us now to just give us some familiarity about how negotiations will be ongoing now. Apparently, all the hostages or residents of that duplex have now been evacuated safely. That's great news. But negotiations continue possibly with the suspect. How do you envision that as happening? How are they communicating with the suspect? By what means? And what do you believe is possibly being said to an individual who has it was being accused of a sequence of erratic behavior? CHARLES \"CULLY\" STIMSON, SENIOR FELLOW, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Yes, I think, as your previous guests said, the goal here is to dial the temperature down, speak in a calm, cool, and collected way. His family has probably provided the law enforcement his cell phone numbers, or they're using bull horns or some other means of communication and trying to get the guy to engage and try to rationalize with him that it's in his best interest to turn himself in. Things will be fine. But I mean, when you kill three people and you still two cars and you sprint across state lines, this is not a rational human being. So it's really up to him of whether or not he dials the temperature down and accepts their invitation to turn himself in. One way or the other, Fredricka, this is going to end. It's probably going to end before it gets dark, because once it gets dark, things get a little more dangerous. And it's either going to end with him taking his own life, sadly, or he's going to turn himself in, and hopefully no law enforcement officers get injured. And then the hard work of putting a case together starts. And I suspect they're already starting that in Bucks County where this case will ultimately be tried.",
