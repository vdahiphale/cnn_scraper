      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.Breaking news, from the Detroit News, apparent recordings of Donald Trump himself, in 2020, allegedly pressuring two election officials, in Michigan, not to sign the certification, of Joe Biden's victory. Plus, the Special Counsel strikes back, urging the Supreme Court to immediately consider Trump's immunity claims. As his former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, files for bankruptcy, hours after being ordered to pay two election workers, for costly lies, he told for Trump. Will he pay up? Giuliani's attorneys are here. And even more accusations of plagiarism, against Harvard's embattled president. The two student journalists, who broke the story join us, this hour. Kaitlan Collins is off tonight. I am Brianna Keilar. And this is THE SOURCE. And we begin with our breaking news. There is brand-new reporting, on yet another recording, of a phone call, allegedly made by Donald Trump, in 2020, pressuring local election officials. This time, in Michigan, on November 17, 2020, two weeks after he had lost the presidential election, in that state, by more than 100,000 votes. CNN has not heard the recording of this phone call. But the Detroit News says it has. And it reports then-President Trump personally pressured two Republican members, of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, not to sign the certification of the election, and allegedly told them they'd look, quote, \"Terrible,\" if they did. CNN spoke with one of the journalists, who says he listened to audio, of this conversation, a short while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOICE OF CRAIG MAUGER, THE DETROIT NEWS: What I heard, listening to the audio, of this conversation, was the then-President of the United States, encouraging, pressuring, contending, arguing in favor of these two Republican county canvassers, not signing the certification, of the 2020 election, for Wayne County. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also, reportedly on this call was RNC Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, who also allegedly told those officials, not to sign the certification and, quote, \"We will get you attorneys.\" McDaniel's response tonight, quote, \"What I said publicly and repeatedly at the time, as referenced in my letter on Nov. 21, 2020, is that there was ample evidence that warranted an audit.\" And I'm joined now by Maggie Haberman, Senior Political Correspondent for The New York Times, and CNN Political Analyst. Maggie, thanks for being with us, on this. The then-President, on the phone, with county canvassers. Take us back to his mindset, at this point, in November 2020 that would prompt this extraordinary overture.",

And this is part of that effort. He started telling people, and I reported this previously, that he wasn't going to leave. Why would you leave if you lost an election? And so, it's not surprising, again, to hear -- it is surprising that the President of the United States was doing this. It is not surprising that this particular president was doing it, because we know that he has made up -- he made other efforts, to try to plead with state officials, obviously, in Georgia, is the most well-known case. But this adds to evidence, Brianna. This adds to -- and I've not heard this tape, to be clear. But if it is, as described, this would add to the evidence, amassed, suggesting that Trump was of a certain mindset that he had been told repeatedly that he had lost. And yet, he was intent on making sure the election was not certified in Joe Biden's favor.",

And joining us now with more, on the former President's legal troubles, is the Founder of the 14th Amendment Center for Law &amp; Democracy, Sherrilyn Ifill. She is also the former President and Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Sherrilyn, thanks for taking the time, tonight. We mentioned this Colorado case, where Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is disqualified, from the primary ballot, because of the insurrection, his role in it, and what the 14th Amendment says, about that. You've written extensively about state and federal courts, shying away from taking on 14th Amendment cases, like this one. Why do they shy away from it? SHERRILYN IFILL, FOUNDER, 14TH AMENDMENT CENTER FOR LAW &amp; DEMOCRACY, FORMER PRESIDENT AND DIRECTOR-COUNSEL OF THE NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE FUND, VERNON JORDAN CHAIR IN CIVIL RIGHTS AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW: Well, I will say -- and thank you so much, Brianna. There's no case quite like this one, because we have never, in the history of this country, had a president, who participated in insurrection or rebellion. But it is true that the 14th Amendment is a very clear and, I think, read on its terms, radical provision of the Constitution, that courts try to elide, in some way. And we saw it with the Colorado District Court, the trial court in this case, who while she agreed that Trump had participated in insurrection, did not feel comfortable saying he had to be removed from the ballot. I'm gratified that the Colorado Supreme Court showed strength, and courage, and affiliation with the law, and with the Constitution, in making their ruling. The words of Section 3 are very clear that the Reconstruction Congress understood that the spirit of insurrection was dangerous, to the future of the country. They also understood that it would not be short-lived. And they created a provision, to allow us to be able to protect our democracy, against insurrectionists, seeking to do, as they said, by politics, what they could not do in the field. KEILAR: It sounds, listening to legal experts, the prevailing expectation here, is that the court will dispense with this issue, the Supreme Court, one way or another. The Colorado Supreme Court will not prevail. Is that your read on this?",

This is unprecedented. I think it's dangerous. I also think that we cannot avoid recognizing the racial targeting. I have not heard anyone combing through the records of the other individuals, and university leaders, who testified along with President Gay. It is ugly. It is clearly a laid-out plan, by Chris Rufo, who has made clear his plan, to have us do exactly what we're doing now, be talking about the qualifications of this President. He has been pushing this anti-DEI, anti-diversity effort. But I think it's actually targeted at the independence of institutions of higher learning of universities. We've seen it in Florida, with Cruz -- Chris Rufo, taking over a new college. And universities are important civic institutions of democracy. When you challenge the independence of private institutions, you are challenging a core element of our democracy. We should be on alert. If Harvard wants to do its own investigation, it is free to do so. But for members of Congress, to decide that they want to meddle, into the private affairs, of a private institution, in order to make -- score political points, and to target a Black president, is incredibly dangerous. We should be wary of it. We should see what is happening. And we should not be sucked into believing that this is an appropriate use of government resources.",

And as you cited, Brianna, you're talking 10,000 to 12,000 persons a day, the numbers have been the largest ever in U.S. history. This year alone, 2.1 million, 2.2 million people have crossed the border. And that's not counting the so-called gotaways. And then when you look, dig deeper into those numbers, you see that you have people, thousands from China, hundreds from Iran, from Russia, all types of countries, we have no idea who they are coming in. And many, I think, last year's count was 20,000 had some type of criminal records. So, there's a lot of concern about what's happening on the border.

Harvard University President, Claudine Gay, is asking to make additional corrections, to her academic publications, as allegations of plagiarism pile up, and a House committee announced it's investigating.Gay first came under fire, after she, and other university presidents, failed, during a congressional hearing, to explicitly say that calling for the genocide of Jews would violate their school codes of conduct. They say it would depend on the circumstances or conduct. Gay survived calls for her resignation that followed. But now she is facing scrutiny, after alleged instances of plagiarism, in her past work, came to light. Last week, Gay made corrections to two academic papers. Now, she's submitting corrections to the dissertation that she wrote, as a PhD student, back in the 1990s. In response, a university spokesperson told CNN, \"The members of the subcommittee and the Corporation,\" which is the university's top governing board, \"concluded that Gay's inadequate citations, while regrettable, did not constitute research misconduct.\" Harvard officials did not refer to Gay's actions as plagiarism. The Harvard Crimson, which is the school's student paper, first broke this news, about Gay's dissertation. And those student journalists, Tilly Robinson, and Neil Shah, are with us now, to talk about that. Neil, in the course of reporting on this story, you have reviewed the Harvard committee's findings. You've looked at pieces of Claudine Gay's work. One of the examples that you've reported on, includes Gay's 2001 article, where she's describing a study, by two researchers. You can see. And we have a graphic of this. When you put up the colors here, you can look at these different colors here, the language that she used in, compared, it was nearly identical to the 1990 study. And though she cited these authors, in the previous passage, she didn't directly quote them. How bad is this, do you think, as you looked into different levels of plagiarism, in your reporting?",

So, there definitely is a lot of variance, in the various allegations. That being said, our review did find that, they do violate or -- they do appear to violate the stated policy for citations and plagiarism that Harvard has, on its website. And, from our understanding, the summary that was presented to us, by Harvard, the Subcommittee of the Corporation, and the independent panel they appointed, seemed to have also agreed that they -- there were instances of inadequate citation. That being said, they did say that Gay's work did not constitute research misconduct, as you said earlier. To clarify on that right -- research misconduct, according to Harvard's policies, to find that, you need to show that it's intentional or knowing or reckless.

But when you compare it to, say, a country like ours, it's pretty restrictive. I mean, you have to have training. You can have not a single criminal record. You have to have a mental health screening. And you have to do like sort of a registration effort.

So, response and communication are often things that can save people's lives, because they know what's going on. And they're able either, in the best-case scenario to run, or hide. And, we're obviously also curious about what kind of gun he had. If it was not -- if it was, say, a handgun, that means he had a lot of time, to kill that many people.
