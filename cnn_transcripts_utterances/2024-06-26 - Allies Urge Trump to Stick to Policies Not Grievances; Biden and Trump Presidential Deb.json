But they're also talking about ways for Donald Trump to pivot back to those three core issues. Now, Donald Trump himself has been going on doing interviews saying that is part of his debate prep. Here's one clip from an interview last night talking about his preparation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I think I've been preparing for it for my whole life, if you want to know the truth. And I'm not sure you can lock yourself into a room for two weeks or one week or two days and really learn what you have to know. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But one thing to note is that we had spoken to senior advisers who said that part of the reason they began tempering expectations after months of saying that Biden was incompetent, that he couldn't string a sentence together, starting saying things like Biden was a formidable opponent was because of that intensive debate prep that Biden was doing. Now, we're talking to senior advisers who say they think that he could show up on Thursday.Now, of course, the big question is going to be what version of Donald Trump shows up on Thursday. And I don't think there's anyone -- they say that he understands the gravity of the moment and they are hoping he stays on message.",

It all comes as they're not just trying to highlight these democracy issues, but they are also trying to make efforts to appeal to anti- Trump Republicans, people who might have been turned off by the president's time in office by his actions relating to January 6th. And so, these are all messages the campaign is hoping to carry into tomorrow's debate and beyond into November.",

This focuses -- this ad focuses on inflation.As you have -- as I have noted, Donald Trump's team thinks that one of the most important issues that Trump can continue to hammer home as well as his allies is this issue of the economy and inflation. So, this is just the beginning of what you are likely to see over the next several months. But obviously, today, targeting Georgia, since that's where the debate will be on Thursday.",

He also looks maybe a little thinner than before. \"The Journal\" and the U.S. government does strongly deny the charges and have condemned this hearing. CNN's Hadas Gold is covering the story for us. Hadas, Gershkovich's family just released a new statement. Obviously, looking at that video, it's very disturbing what he's going through.

So, it's a very expensive market, but still it was extremely expensive. The number of ads, the mailers in indoors.What was interesting about those ads, though, they didn't talk about Gaza and Israel and Bowman's take on all of that, they were about who could work better with Joe Biden. It's not something you hear in a lot of races. During their concession and their victory speeches last night, here's what the candidates said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMAAL BOWMAN (D-NY):  And God help us. God help us build a better world where everyone understands when we say free Palestine, it is not antisemitic. GEORGE LATIMER (D-NY), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Tonight, we turn a page and we say that we believe in inclusion of everybody in our representation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A lot of New Yorkers, a lot of Jewish New Yorkers would agree that they don't like what's happening in Gaza. They don't like Netanyahu's conduct of the war, but that he called for a ceasefire so early. He called it 75 years of occupation. He called it a genocide regularly. He called it -- he said that -- he denied that the rapes and the beheadings happened early on and denied some of the worst parts of what Hamas did. All of that set him on a course that was just far outside where the district is right now. And you know, he opened the door to where we are today. Jim.",
