      "sentences": "All right. Joining us now, Punchbowl News co- founder, John Bresnahan is with us. Thank you so much for being here, John. Lots to talk about.You have some new reporting about the fight over funding the government. And I guess my question to you is from what you can tell at this point, should Americans be worried, should Ukrainians be worried, should Israelis be worried that they are not going to get the funding that they want and need from the United States? JOHN BRESNAHAN, CO-FOUNDER, PUNCHBOWL NEWS: Yes. I think -- in the case of Ukraine, I think it's a really serious issue right now. As you guys reported, and we scooped this morning, these talks broke down. There were some bipartisan Senate talks on trying to do something about the U.S.-Mexico border. And Republicans were trying to attach that to any Ukraine funding saying, we're not going to vote for Ukraine money unless we get this border money. That's -- they made a very explicit link between these two. And that broke down. There's been growing sentiment among especially House Republicans in opposition to Ukrainian funding. You can see a majority -- probably a majority of House Republicans are opposed to any more money from Ukraine, that we've given 60 billion-plus to Ukraine. They say that's enough. We've got to secure the American -- U.S. border. So, there's growing opposition to that. That's also growing in the Senate. There's still a majority for Ukraine in Congress. The issue is that Republicans control the House. And as Speaker Johnson said, he's not going anywhere unless he gets some border security money. This is something that Democrats -- the proposal that the Republicans are calling for basically going back to the Trump era, that's not something they're going to agree to. Yes, I think it's a very serious problem right now. I do think Israel's money would pass easily. But again, House Republicans passed a bill for -- to give $14 billion to Israel, but they attached it to IRS spending cuts that the Democrats are not going to agree to. So, we've got some real political maneuvering here. We got 2024 is just around the corner. Is this -- these are very, very serious issues.",

On the campaign trail, we've heard Donald Trump, who himself has been accused twice -- not once, but twice in court of subverting democracy. Trump's now accusing Joe Biden of being the destroyer, as he put it, of democracy. His comments, however, are coming after a lot of people are weighing in here and some Republicans, including longtime conservative, Republican Liz Cheney. She's got words from her book that are extremely strong. Let's listen to a little bit of what she says is the biggest threat.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: People who say, well, if he's elected, it's not that dangerous because we have all of these checks and balances, don't fully understand the extent to which the Republicans in Congress today have been co-opted. One of the things that we see happening today is a sort of sleepwalking into dictatorship. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, it represents a major case for the FBI which has been investigating Victor Manuel Rocha since 2022, when they received the tip that he was an agent of the foreign -- of the -- of a foreign government, in this case, specifically the Cuban government.And he served as an ambassador from 1999 to 2002. U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia. You can see there some of his resume. He is retired. More recently has been working at a law firm in Miami. But according to prosecutors here in this -- in this court document, Rocha was -- they did an outreach pretending to be someone who was connected to the U.S. -- to the Cuban government. He was an intelligence person reaching out to him. And that's where this investigation picks up. According to prosecutors, he had a meeting with this person who he believed was working for the Cuban government, and agreed to help provide information to the Cuban government, according to prosecutors. Again, right now he is charged with acting as an agent of a foreign government, a couple of other legal violations. We expect that he is going to be appearing in a federal court in Miami in the next couple of hours, Kate, and then we'll see what happens to him after this. But this is an extraordinary case certainly for the FBI. It appears, they believe, that he was doing this for many, many, many years during his many diplomatic posts, including the Dominican Republic. He worked in the Cuban intersection in Havana for some time in the previous years. And so, it was after he -- they received the tip that he was doing this, that they decided to introduce an undercover agent. Kate.",
