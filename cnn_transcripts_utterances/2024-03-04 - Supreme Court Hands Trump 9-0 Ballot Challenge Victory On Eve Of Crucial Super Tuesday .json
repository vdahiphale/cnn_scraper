The High Court says he can stay on Colorado's ballot and every other states, too.Also tonight, with most Americans saying Joe Biden's too old to serve four more years, we'll talk to a reporter who spoke at length with the President and he'll detail the Biden he saw. And later, some rare reporting from inside Haiti where armed gangs rule the streets and civil society is coming apart at the seams. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for your time. John King sitting in for Anderson tonight. We begin with one certain thing. Donald J. Trump will be on the ballot in all 50 states. The Supreme Court today making it a reality and making history, settling an issue that's been unclear since Reconstruction. All nine justices deciding that neither Colorado nor any other state can bar him under the 14th Amendment Section 3 insurrection language. Quoting from the opinion: \"We conclude that states may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office. But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency.\" The opinion was per curiam, meaning not attributed to any specific justice. However, in a concurrence that you might say reads more like a dissent, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson take issue with the ruling's broadness, which they suggest is to \"insulate this Court and petitioner from future controversy.\" The petitioner, of course, being Donald Trump. As for him, he praised the ruling, then pivoted to the court's next big decision on presidential immunity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Yes, it's the first week of March, early in the primary season, but the path of those primaries so far, plus some new polling over the weekend and into this new week, are turning the conversation already more and more to the likelihood of a Biden-Trump fall rematch. Let's look at where we are and then some of the numbers.Number one, some contests over the weekend as well, now have the former president, 247 delegates. Takes 1,200 plus, 1,215 to win, but he is on a path right there. You see the light gray states? Those are all the Super Tuesday states tomorrow. A lot more primaries. Donald Trump can't mathematically clinch tomorrow, but he can get really close by the end of tomorrow night if he continues his big run. The Democrats also are voting. Let me just bring this up here and show this as well to bring up the Democratic side of this in Super Tuesday, we'll flip it over here to the primaries like this. President Biden, 206, two uncommitted delegates so far. He is also on a path to re- nomination, and will get very close tomorrow night as all those delegates come in, which brings in now, where are we? Assuming Trump and Biden continue their path to the nomination, where are we? This is our CNN poll of polls. Forgive me for turning my back. I just want to bring this up a little larger, 48 percent for Trump, 46 percent for Biden. That is no clear leader. If you look at some of the late individual polls that go into this average, Trump has been running a little bit stronger, but if you average them all together, which is the smart thing to do, don't overinvest in any one poll. No clear leader, but Trump has clearly been gaining a little bit of steam as we go forward. Why is he gaining steam? Well, these are the numbers that are troubling for the President. Here's one from The New York Times-Siena College poll, is President Biden too old to be an effective president? Among all voters, 73 percent say yes, 25 percent say no. Here's the troubling part. Even in his own party, the President needs big Democratic turnout in the fall. More than half, 56 percent of Democrats say they think he's too old to be an effective president, 43 percent say no. So that is one challenge for the President as he runs out the primary season, as he gives that big speech Thursday night - address that. The problems are deeper for the President. Again, he is the incumbent president, 24 percent of Americans say the country's on the right track. Two-thirds say it is not, 65 percent say the country is on the wrong track as the President prepares to deliver his State of the Union address. One more, incumbents are often judged by their approval rating. You start to get eight months out from an election, that's a problem. That's a problem. That's the number the President has to change, 36 percent approve of his performance right now in office, 61 percent disapprove. That means a lot of Democrats. If 61 percent disapprove, that means Democrats as well. So let's have a conversation about where we are in the primary calendar, State of the Union and beyond. Let's bring in our CNN Political Commentators Van Jones and Margaret Hoover. Also joining us, the former Democratic presidential candidate, Democratic National Committee chairman and the governor of Vermont, Howard Dean. Governor, I want to start with you. You know what it's like to give a state address, you know the President's weaknesses and you understand campaigns, what does the President - if you could tell the President to do one thing right now, whether it's address the age issue or the wrong track issue, what would you do? HOWARD DEAN, (D) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I joke about the age issue when I talk about his unbelievable record. This is a guy who's got the strongest domestic policy record since Lyndon Johnson. And ironically, most of the jobs he's created are going to the very states in the rural states that vote against him, which is insane to me. I think he just has to do a very good job and give a very good speech, and he's more than capable of doing that.",

The prices are coming down on everything but food and housing. So he's got to show he's willing to fight on the food price. He's got to fight the grocers, tell them to quit gouging the American people at the cash register. He's got to push on the Fed to get these housing prices down, to get the interest rates down.

You cannot talk about Joe Biden right now and his state of mind without thinking about Trump. Look, on a physical level, he is slower and his movements and his gestures. No question about it. His mind seemed unchanged to me. He didn't bungle a date or a name or anything like that. I was looking to see any signs of that.

You have a wide-ranging conversation with democratic strategists and other experts around there.You talk about the first thing he did to show you where Donald Trump watched January 6th. So they believe democracy -- Trump and democracy, Trump and democracy, Trump and democracy. That's what they believe inside the White House. Your article went to print before this latest New York Times/Siena poll, but you've seen the polling. You know, the president's job performance is way underwater. Views on the economy, right track, wrong track, are very bad for an incumbent president. So how does what he says square with those numbers? Or does he just think they're not real? OSNOS: On some level, there is a lot of suspicion in the White House about polling. I think there is a feeling that over the last few years, even going back to 2016  that polls have shown themselves to be unreliable, partly in the age of the cell phone. Look, it tends to be that candidates who are not leading in the polls tend to question the polls. There is more specificity to their concerns. Jen O'Malley Dillon, who is an influential aid around the president working for the campaign. She says, we don't believe that these favorability polls line up exactly with what people actually do in the ballot box. Look, that's a controversial statement, John. You know, some Democrats will disagree with that. Some will agree with it. What's interesting is that that's what they believe. If you're trying to understand their strategy, that's one of the insights that gives you a feel for why they are not more ruffled than other Democrats may be.",

There were moments of that still there, but there is a sense of conviction that he's doing something that is very personal for him.
