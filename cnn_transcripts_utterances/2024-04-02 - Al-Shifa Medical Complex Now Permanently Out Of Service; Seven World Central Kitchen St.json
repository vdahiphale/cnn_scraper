I've been an aid worker in many war zones, and we had a system in Afghanistan with U.S. military when the U.S. was there in the Afghan military high command, and that worked pretty well. We had even in the 2006 war in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, we had U.S. military UN staff in the Israeli high command. We haven't had that in the Gaza war. And partly, therefore, I think there hasn't been a deconfliction system, a notification system that has protected aid workers. However, we need really more than anything else, a ceasefire so that this senseless blood shedding can stop.

They jam it by radio frequencies so they lose connection with the ground. They jam it by jamming the GPS that they use either through disrupting the signals from the satellites, disrupting the signals from ground stations. But this is new tech that's being put to use here. It's a A.I. tech, right? So, we know it's going to get better. We know there'll be more of it. And the drones get a certain distance with the traditional navigation. And then they switch to basically muscle memory or machine memory, if you will. They switch to an internal understanding of the ground underneath them that the drone has effectively memorized. It doesn't need to know where it is. It knows where it is. It can see where it is. And that's why they can be so effective hitting specific parts of these refineries. The -- some of the most, you know, vulnerable parts of the refineries, specifically parts of the refineries that will need Western tech to help put them right. This is a vulnerability of Russia at the moment, not just the output and production and the money it gets from its oil, but how to replace and repair those particular facilities.

And if it's a standalone issue, it generally goes in their favor. And let me just say this from many Republicans and those in the pro-life community. The first ruling from the Florida Supreme Court upholding the Florida ban, many in the pro-life community view that as a victory for fetus, fetal babies that can feel pain and have a heartbeat, and protecting and saving those lives. But the order from the court to put this back on the ballot, that is a real political battle for Republicans because they realize this is going to galvanize Republican voters and galvanize even some Republicans and certainly independent voters who want to protect the pro-choice issue. And, look, Republicans are going to have to really work hard on taking some of the focus in Florida off of the abortion issue and putting it on other issues in Florida, like the economy and immigration and national security. And they're banking on what we're seeing in a lot of these state-by-state polls that while abortion is a big issue and sometimes a single issue for some voters, higher on the list are these economic and pocketbook issues.

Trump, in the past, has said that he isn't sure or he hasn't decided whether or not to support a national 15-week abortion ban. Obviously, he's going to continue to get asked about the six-week ban in Florida between now and November. He knows that this issue could cost him politically. I mean, where do you think he's going to go just in terms of how he's expected to respond to this? Do you expect him to continue to be mute on this and not say anything? What is the smart way strategically to handle this?",

I mean,she was the one who came out and laid out exactly where she stood on what issues instead of going back and forth and vacillating the way the former president has, on the one hand, embracing that Roe was overturned because of him, but at the same time distancing himself from any rulings that are viewed as far too extreme. Let me ask you, Alice, about how this impacts Florida, because there was a time when Florida was seen as a potential place where Democrats stood a chance, perhaps a purple state many years ago that doesn't seem to be the trajectory or the case right now. But given the court's ruling, the Biden campaign's own spokespeople say that this perhaps is an opening for them, that Florida can now be in play. What are you hearing from Republicans? Are they worried?",

But what Donald Trump and Republicans have in their favor going into this election is the key issues that galvanize voters, again, as we've talked about, the economy, inflation, immigration, and national security. These are important issues for the state of Florida, not to mention the fact that Joe Biden --President Biden, is losing a tremendous amount of support from Hispanics and African Americans. There's a large Hispanic community in Florida. They are frustrated with the policies of the Biden administration, not the least of which is on immigration. So, Republicans are banking on the fact that the low approval rating for President Biden, the fact that he's losing amongst the key voting electorate in Florida, and the economy not doing as well as they say, Republicans are banking on those to help push Donald Trump across the finish line.",

The classmate and the boy has now been remanded in custody, but he will be questioned by social services rather than the police, given the age of the boy in question. It is not clear just yet what exactly the motive is behind this, and the police are still trying to establish that. The Finnish prime minister, who spoke publicly about this particular incident, described it as being deeply shocking, and that the authorities are still working to determine the story behind this tragic event. But he also acknowledged that one incident is one incident too many, even in a country like Finland, which is incredibly rarely sees incidents like this compared to other nations in the world, such as the United States. Finland's last school attack or school shooting of this type came in 2008, where a student who was slightly older turned a weapon on his other classmates. This, though, seems to be very much an open case at the moment and a deeply shocking and disturbing one, particularly as children were returning to school after the long Easter holiday break.
