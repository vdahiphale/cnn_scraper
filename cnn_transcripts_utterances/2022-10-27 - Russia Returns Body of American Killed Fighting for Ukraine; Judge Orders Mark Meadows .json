In fact, OPEC+ slashed its oil production by 2 million barrels per day. Joining me now with his reporting is Washington Investigative Correspondent at The New York Times Mark Mazzetti. Mark, thank you so much for joining me this morning. Now, in this reporting with you and your colleagues, you say that this wasn't an explicit agreement.

So, the arrangement that got worked out, in the view of the U.S., was an acceleration of oil production over several months. And the critical acceleration would be September through December, 200,000 barrels per day increase. And this would have the effect, they thought, they believed, lowering gas prices. And elements after the trip of this deal actually were followed through on. The Saudis began increasing oil in the summer. But then, as you said, the critical OPEC meeting a couple weeks ago, they did the opposite of what they said. They said, we never had a firm commitment.
