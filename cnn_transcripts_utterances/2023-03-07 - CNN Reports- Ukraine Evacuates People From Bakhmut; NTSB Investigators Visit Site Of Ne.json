More than 4,000 civilians remain trapped there with nowhere to go.CNN's Alex Marquardt reports on the evacuations underway. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Racing into the war zone, a white-knuckle drive towards the middle of Bakhmut. This is the last successful emergency evacuation mission by the Bakhmut police. \"We need to go faster,\" an officer says. \"The Russians can clearly see us.\" This team, called the White Angels, grabs civilians who have been trapped, throwing belongings in the back. There's a cat; someone else with a guitar. The fighting raging nearby. The residents told to hurry up and get in and sit anywhere they can. As they hold on tight the rescue mission speeds away from the smoldering city. Ahead there's smoke from a Russian strike. Getting dropped off safely, Leonade (PH) tells the officer that everything is blown up in Bakhmut, even inside his apartment. They've survived months of brutally intense assaults. Russia has made gains trying to encircle Bakhmut and surrounding it on three sides as Ukraine desperately tries to fend them off. Today we met Bakhmut's deputy mayor in a city nearby at a makeshift aid center for Bakhmut evacuees.",

More than three hours away in East Palestine, Ohio the cleanup continues as contaminated water and soil are being removed, though heavy rains have caused some delays. There, a faulty wheel bearing overheated causing a fire that was caught on camera miles before the train derailed. The subsequent toxic spill forced many from their homes and is still causing health concerns. SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH):  The railroads continue to enrich their executives at the expense of public safety and public health, and lay off workers, and compromise on safety. So the fact Ohio's now had four derailments as of yesterday -- four derailments in the last five months. East Palestine was the most serious but we still have questions about these other derailments, too. CARROLL (voice-over):  Norfolk Southern says safety is of the utmost importance and today announced a six-point plan that includes installing more temperature sensors -- the first near East Palestine. This, as the investigation continues into what caused the derailment here in Springfield. CARROLL (on camera):  When the rail car is still on its side, investigators will get that up and moving as soon as they can.

That they're going to keep looking at the information and come out showing that inflation is trending towards target. Until we start seeing that it's very difficult for the Fed to do anything other than continue on.

That's how it's phrased, meaning low inflation. It's also targeting, at the same time, maximum employment.So there's been this narrative that unemployment has been very low and that's a bad thing. It's actually not the case. It's fine to have low unemployment or a very strong labor market if wage inflation is low. And I think what the Fed is going to try to target is getting overall prices down with little impact to total employment numbers as possible and get wage inflation down but try and keep people in jobs at the same time.",
