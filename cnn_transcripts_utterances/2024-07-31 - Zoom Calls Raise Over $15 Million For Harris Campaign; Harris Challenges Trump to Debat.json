This morning, Hamas and much of the Arab world are accusing Israel of assassinating the group's political leader. Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an airstrike during a visit to Tehran. Iran's supreme leader now is vowing revenge -- quote -- \"You killed our dear guest in our house and now have paved the way for your harsh punishment. We consider it our duty to ask for the blood of our dear guest.\" The Israeli military said it is not responding to reports about the attack and the U.S. says it will defend Israel if it's attacked, but hopes the sky-high tensions in the region can be defused.

We're going to work hard to make sure that we're doing things to help take the temperature down and address issues through diplomatic means. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The blast killed the top Hezbollah military leader, whom Israel blames for the weekend attack that killed 12 children in the Golan Heights.We're covering all the angles, including an Al-Jazeera crew killed in a reported strike while filming near Haniyeh's home in Gaza. Jeremy Diamond is in Northern Israel, Alex Marquardt here in Washington, and Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon. So much going on, Jeremy. I want to start with you. How significant is this strike in Iran, we will start there, both in terms of the target and the fact that it happened on Iranian soil?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, Pam, we know that Israel has carried out assassinations on Israel -- on Iranian soil in the past, but none quite as significant as this one, none happening at such a critical moment in time as this one did.And because of all of those reasons, this assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, which Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its role in, is going to have enormous implications for a region that was already teetering on the brink of war. Part of that is not only because of the significance of the target, because it happened in the Iranian capital, but also because it is the second major Israeli strike against senior leaders of two Iranian proxies in just the last 24 hours. In addition to that strike, as you mentioned, there was also a strike in the Lebanese capital, which took out Hezbollah's senior-most military commander, a senior adviser to Hezbollah, chief Hassan Nasrallah. And so, because of all of that, we are anticipating that there will be some kind of response, as Iran's supreme leader vows revenge, and as we are also hearing similar words from Hamas, as well as Hezbollah. We don't yet know the manner and timing of the response or what form it will take, but there's no question that the risk of escalation is very, very real at this moment. And in addition to all of that, we now have the fact that the cease-fire and hostage deal negotiations that have been ongoing for weeks now, where we had seen some progress, we had seen some momentum, it is very hard to imagine those negotiations moving forward at this stage, at least in the short term. Part of that has to do with the fact that Ismail Haniyeh was not only a key interlocutor in those negotiations. He was also viewed as one of the pragmatic voices within Hamas as it related to those negotiations, somebody who was pushing the talks forward. And now, obviously, he is very much out of the picture. And amid all of this, we are hearing from the Qatari prime minister, who says: \"Political assassinations and continue targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?\" Qatar, of course, a key mediator in these ongoing negotiations. And so, right now, we seem further away from a potential cease-fire agreement and far closer to the prospect of war -- Pam.",

Would it come from Iran itself or the variety of proxies around the region? We simply don't know. We have to wait and see. The Houthis, Hezbollah, countless proxies in Iran and Syria could all take place, certainly major concern about what's going to come next. And we should note that there are a lot of Americans in the region as well, not just citizens living in those countries, but American service members, who have been targeted by Iran's proxy groups.

So obviously we can take some cues from what happened in April, when Iran, of course, attacked Israel with a barrage of missiles and drones.The U.S. took a very active role in defending Israel at that point, using, for example, Navy warships to help take down a lot of those ballistic missiles and drones over the course of that event. So you can see the U.S. taking on that kind of role again if Iran were to attack Israel over this latest assassination. Secretary Austin actually hinted at this in remarks earlier today.

They have an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, all positioned so that, if things continue to spiral, the U.S. military can be prepared to respond and to help people get out if that becomes necessary. Now, we are told that at this point, of course, the U.S. military is planning for all possible contingencies. They are planning for the possibility that some kind of evacuation might be necessary. But, for now, they are just engaging in very intensive diplomacy to try to ratchet down tensions. Secretary Austin, he did speak to his Israeli counterpart earlier today to try to get a handle, of course, on everything that's going on, Pam.",

What hasn't happened yet is any formal interviews, though those are expected to be conducted this week. As to who is on the short list, you see them there, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. Now, they have been asked about this over the course of the week. They haven't shed any light as to where they stand, but, certainly, this is a very condensed timeline for the campaign to be working on to find her a running mate, but they are certainly preparing for her to be on the trail with whoever her running mate is next week, hitting the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada. Pamela, what's important to note about these states is that all of them, aside from North Carolina, are ones that President Biden narrowly won in 2020. The campaign wants to keep them in play. They're hoping they can build on their momentum next week by visiting all of them within the course of a week.",

And so I don't know that he really wants to do that. If I'm his campaign, I'm thinking twice about it. The problem is, he gets called a chicken, basically.

How do we get people more wealth, start more businesses, community development, financial institutions, these CDFIs that are kind of an arcane language, but really how do we get people more wealth and how do we make sure they get more wages? We have seen wages grow over the course of the Biden/Harris administration. She's also talked about health care and childcare, because one of the things for families today that matters is that, if you're sick, if your parents are sick, your kids are sick, it's hard for you to work. You can't get that extra shift. Also, if you don't have childcare, you can't afford childcare, if you're starting to start -- if you're trying to start a company, if you're trying to get an extra shift at work, if you can't figure out how to get your kid taken care of after 3:00, that has a direct impact on how much money you can make.

So, right now, she's got a -- they don't even have e-mail addresses, right? The e-mail addresses are still JoeBiden.com. They have got to figure a lot of things out. She's got to pick out a candidate, pick out a running mate. She's got to make sure that all the talking points work. She's got to figure out her travel schedule. I mean, I can't imagine the number of things they're trying to balance right now. And so I imagine when they started looking at the schedule, something's got to give, because the one thing you can't make more of in the midst of a campaign is the candidate's time, right? You can raise more money. You can hire more staff. You can get more lawn signs. You can't get more time on the candidate's schedule. So they have got to figure out how to use that time most efficiently. And that's probably, in fact, frankly, a place where this NABJ conference, traveling to that conference just took a hit.

And what we found out is that, over the course of her getting private sector involved down there and making sure they're focused on the economy and violence, now we have seen a drop of 200,000 arrests at the border from people from those countries. So she had an impact when it came to the questions that she was asked to pursue from the president. But the fact is, the Republicans were on the verge of actually helping to pass a bill that would do something about this. And Donald Trump said no because he thought it would help him politically. He ought to take the weight for that.
