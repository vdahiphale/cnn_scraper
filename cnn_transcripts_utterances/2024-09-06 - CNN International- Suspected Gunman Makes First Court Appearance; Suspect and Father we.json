It's 09:00 a.m. in Winder in Georgia, it's 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi in the UAE. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching \"Connect the World\". And in the next hour, we expect to see Donald Trump off the campaign trail and back in a court in New York. Lawyers for Donald Trump and E. Jean Carroll will square off today in Lower Manhattan. More on that as we get it. Plus, CNN speaks with Ukraine's Army Chief in a world exclusive what he told us about Kyiv's surprise cross border incursion into Russia. Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. We've just had the latest U.S. Jobs Report drop in the last half hour, and the August numbers have picked up. Employers added 142,000 jobs that is an improvement on less than 90,000 new jobs in July. The futures markets are indicating a slightly lower open. This will provide a little bit of confusion, perhaps for investors who, of course, banking on a rate cut in the September Federal Reserve -- Federal Open Market Committee Meeting. I should think that they are probably not convinced, necessarily, that these -- this latest data is going to prevent that from happening, but obviously not quite sure where they are at as these markets are set to open. We'll revisit the New York Stock Exchange at 09:30 a Eastern Time. Well in Georgia, 14-year-old high school shooting suspect Colt Gray made his first appearance in court a short time ago. He is charged with four counts of felony murder. Investigators say that he killed four people and injured nine others at his high school in the City of Winder on Wednesday using an AR style rifle. He will be tried as an adult. Now his father has also been taken into custody, charged in those killings, and he is expected to appear in court later this hour. Let's get you straight back to that court stand by.",

And we have just heard the judge clearly answering a question put either by Colt Gray himself, the accused, or by his lawyer. We got to a little late. I'm not quite sure who it was who had actually posed that question. But just clarifying what is the maximum penalty, or the penalty for these crimes that he is alleged to have committed, even though, let's be quite frankly about this, he has admitted to the crimes. Just bring us up to speed on what we've learned this morning, as we have seen Colt Gray in the Barrow Courthouse for the first time since this terrible, terrible event, 48 hours or so ago?",

More than likely, it was either the defense attorney or the prosecutor that actually raised that issue. Because of his age, 14, he is not eligible for the death penalty. However, he is still eligible for life without parole or life with parole, and that needed to be made clear to the defendant, and that's why the second appearance took place. This 14-year-old has been, by all indications, cooperating with investigators. Has admitted to committing the homicides and aggravated assaults on others at the school. Now the father will appear for his preliminary hearing. He's being charged based on the negligence that he showed in providing a firearm for the 14- year-old not keeping it secured. I mean, this is an individual who had been informed by law enforcement that there was an allegation that a threat had been made online by his son threatening a school shooting. And even though the boy denied it, and even though the father pretty much didn't believe it was possible, I mean, to go out and then purchase an assault rifle for the young man, and on top of that, not properly secure it at all in the home. So, he had access to it. Is the reason why he is and- in-my-opinion rightfully charged in this particular case.",

His arms were shackled and he was wearing a green top and tan pants. He replied to questions by the judge by saying yes, sir, in a respectful manner as he was informed of his rights under the law and the charges and that he faces. And here Becky, I have to say that there was a little bit of a change from the judge. Originally, he had said that the teenager was eligible for the death penalty, something that was corrected, clarified later, because he is a minor, he is not eligible for the death penalty, but he is eligible for a life sentence. And let's remember that he has been charged as an adult with four counts of felony murder. Some of the victim's families were attending the hearing as well, which made it very, very emotional and solemn at the same time. Judge Mingledroff was making the defendant aware of his rights. He was reading his rights and also asking him whether he understood English. And all this is going on Becky, as the father, is set to appear in the very same courtroom this hour. As for the father, he's expected to also be charged as a result of this horrific shooting here in Winder. And for the first time, Becky, we're taking a look at the arrest warrant for 54-year- old Colin Gray, the father of the alleged shooter at the Apalachee High School here in Winder, Georgia. The arrest warrant reads in part, and here I'm quoting Becky. Colin Gray did cause the death of a redacted name, a child under the age of 18 years, irrespective of malice, by providing a firearm to Colt Gray with knowledge that he was a threat to himself and others of very serious charges here. And that language mirrors what Chris Hosey, the Director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, said last night about the reasons why they finally decided to arrest the father. The Director said that the father was charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder, and eight counts of cruelty to children. Mr. Gray he said these charges stand for Mr. Gray knowingly allowing his son, Colt to possess a weapon. So very, very serious charges. And we have also learned that both the father and the son were on law enforcement radar Becky, because guns were confiscated from the family as far back as 2022 Becky.",

The judge reminded him that he is being charged with two counts of felony murder in the second degree, charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and eight counts of felony cruelty to children. Now this is very important, Becky, the judge was enumerating every single possible penalty for each one of those charges. And at the very end, he said that it was up to 180 years behind bars. So, if he is found guilty, we're looking at a potentially what would be equivalent to a life sentence here. Again, this is only the beginning. This is all very preliminary.

I don't know whether or not he's going to request a jury trial, or whether or not this will be a bench trial or trial just before a judge. But in my opinion, the charges that he's facing are appropriate again there's a high degree of negligence in this case. And I think it's very important that we remember that this -- that this individual had been warned, in a sense, that there were at least threats being made by his son. He denied it, but there were tips that came in to the FBI passed along to the sheriff's department. So, he was put on notice that -- and then to turn around and buy an assault weapon and not secure it, even though Georgia has no safe storage gun laws, just common sense would tell you that you just would not allow a child to have access to a weapon like that.

The only thing he's not subject to is the death penalty because of his age, but the seriousness of the crimes, and my understanding is that he's cooperated with investigators and actually admitted to the killings.

So, they're just continuing to gather evidence so that they have a solid case to present for trial.

And that marks a rebound from a month earlier, but still below analysts' expectations these numbers come less than two months before the presidential election, where, of course, the economy is a top issue, and less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve moves on interest rates, if indeed it does. Well, Julia Chatterley of CNN's \"First Move\" joining me with more. Couple of things to discuss there, but we should just start with you breaking down these numbers for us, if you will, Julia.",

Theless good news is, I don't think it underlines or addresses the question of whether the Federal Reserve ends up going a quarter of a percentage point or half a percentage point, as some would like. Becky, to your point, the numbers, the U.S. economy adding 142,000 jobs net in August, it was weaker than expected. The good news, though, is that the fear factor from July, that was the unemployment rise that we saw, actually came back to 4.2 percent. So, a lot of the people that were on temporary layoff now back into the workforce. Then it gets a little clear -- unclear, because we got revisions to July and we got revisions to June, and they both came down. So, the broader picture is the jobs market overall is weaker than we thought even a month ago, but we did appear to see a little bit of a bounce back in the number of jobs created in August. The underlying message in this people are still hiring, employers are still selectively hiring people, and wages actually saw a bit of a pop higher on the month as well. I'll boldly say, Becky, I think that they will cut a quarter of a percentage point on September 18, but there's going to be people calling for more.",

It's the longest run we've had in decades of job gains for the Trump campaign, he can say, look, the economy's slowing and it shouldn't be. We know what he's like when he tries to make these kinds of points. I think bottom line Becky, who it benefits most, perhaps, is the White House and the Harris campaign. Because what we are expecting, as you quite rightly said, is for the Federal Reserve to be cutting rates, and for borrowers across America that have struggled with mortgage rates going up with credit cards being more expensive. That gives them a little bit of hope in the sort of few weeks that we've got left till the elections.",
