      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead, with just 15 days to go, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are on a campaign blitz through the battleground states, hoping to pick up the support they need to pull ahead in the race.Israel launches a wave of airstrikes across Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah-affiliated financial institutions. And Oscar hammers Cuba, complicating efforts to restore power on the island after three days in the dark. We start with breaking news coming to us from Kyiv. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital. This follows a meeting in Brussels last week with his counterparts in NATO. High on the agenda, questions from allies about the upcoming election and how it might impact Ukraine aid. Specifically concerns that a potential Trump victory could jeopardize future USAID to Ukraine. Sources familiar with the meeting tell us Austin said that while he can't predict the future, there is still bipartisan support for Ukraine in Congress. NATO officials say they are preparing for the U.S. to take on a lesser role. Well, CNN's Natasha Bertrand is traveling with the Defense Secretary and joins us now on the phone. So Natasha, what is the significance of this visit? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Yeah, Rosemary. I mean, this is probably most likely the final time that a senior U.S. official is going to be visiting Ukraine before the election, which of course is in just over two weeks. And so this is really an opportunity for the Secretary of Defense to meet with his counterparts, including President Zelenskyy and Defense Minister Umarov, to get a better sense of what they will need not only right now in terms of fighting the Russians, but more importantly, through the next year, how the U.S. can continue to kind of funnel supplies to them and help to best achieve their war aims. Now, of course, one of the biggest questions but paying over all of this is whether any of that is even going to be relevant in a few months' time because there could very well be a new administration and Donald Trump had questioned openly whether the U.S. should continue supporting Ukraine, he recently called President Zelenskyy a salesman and that Zelenskyy should never have let the war start. Of course, we know that it was Russia that invaded Ukraine. And so, there's a lot of anxiety, of course, here in Kyiv about just what comes next, what is going to happen in the next year. But particularly, you know, heading into the brutal winter months when, you know, Russia is bound to start attacking critical infrastructure in Ukraine, the efforts to shore up those power grids are happening right now. And the U.S. has already started shipping winter weather gear, for example, to Ukrainian soldiers. And so this meeting is going to be a chance for Secretary Austin to kind of, you know, go over the arc of the relationship between Ukraine and the U.S. over the last two plus years of war, and also, you know, kind of try to reassure them that U.S. support is going to continue. However, it is anyone's guess just how robust that support is going to be over the next -- over next year.",

Let's turn to U.S. politics now and Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have 15 days left to convince voters they are the right choice to lead the U.S. for the next four years. And the candidates are hitting the campaign trail hard, trading barbs and sometimes personal attacks as they look to pick up the support, they each need to pull ahead in the extremely tight race.The entire election is expected to come down to just a few battleground states. And that's where Harris and Trump will be focusing their attention in the time that remains. Trump will spend Monday traveling in North Carolina, making an appearance in the storm- ravaged town of Asheville, and holding a campaign rally in Greenville. Harris will be joined by former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney on a swing through the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin where the Vice President will speak to Republican-leaning voters. Donald Trump spent Sunday on the stump in Pennsylvania and after making headlines on Saturday with a meandering story about Arnold Palmer that included a vulgar reference to the golf legend's genitals, the former president kept it more low-key, this time focusing mostly on attacking his opponent.

The event was even shorter than normal. And it certainly seemed like the former ESPN host who moderated the event, plus the campaign-selected voters, who asked the candidate questions really were able to keep former President Donald Trump more on track throughout the evening.He emphasized his proposals on the economy, including no taxes on tips and overtime, talked about supporting fracking, and of course he mostly railed against the Biden administration when it comes to immigration. Now, there were of course several exaggerations when it came to the subjects of the economy, immigration and crime, and there were some of his normal asides. He spoke about bragging about his poll numbers. He also aired some of his grievances against ABC News for the last presidential debate, but there was nothing particularly vulgar or odd like we saw at Saturday evening's rally in Western Pennsylvania, for example, that odd Arnold Palmer story. Trump did, however, continue to boost his new campaign surrogate, Elon Musk, the billionaire who has been stumping for him in Pennsylvania over the course of the weekend, in fact, even including offering a raffle of a million dollars to supporters who signed a petition to get into some of the events which some Legal experts tell CNN it might be illegal, but take a listen to what the former president said this evening about both Harris and Elon Musk.

Trump has changed his tune for obvious reasons, because he needs those votes and wants to get people out.And some people just can't get out on one particular day, Election Day, November 5th. So you want to have more flexibility. Trump is trying now to change gears and move to an encouraging of his voters to get out and vote early. Generally speaking, if past is prelude, early voting tends to favor Democrats. It's probably going to favor Democrats again this time around, but maybe not as much, by not as much. And so Donald Trump is trying to close that gap and in a race that's going to be decided by one, two, three tenths of a point, that could be the difference in winning and losing a state.",

He's mentioned California's candidate for Senate, Adam Schiff.And so he's putting names to these folks who are the -- he calls the enemies. What happens if Trump loses? Will his base be so outraged, so enraged that they take up violence, that they start to break the windows and start smashing in the doors, as they did January 6 when they had a treasonous violent insurrection against the Capitol where people died. And so we know that violence is a possibility and so that's probably one of the most nightmarish scenarios post-election that we might very well face. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This video, geolocated by CNN, captures the moment a strike hit a building near Beirut's International Airport on Sunday, sending it crumbling to the ground on Sunday. And you can see the airport in the background of another video with plumes of smoke rising from a building in front.The Israeli military says it targeting financial institutions linked to Hezbollah. The Lebanese Health Ministry says more than 1,800 people have been killed since Israel ramped up attacks on the Iran-backed militant group last month. The IDF is vowing to continue defending the Israeli people, saying Hezbollah fired about 200 projectiles into Israel on Sunday. Well Gaza's health ministry says at least 87 people, including children, were killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Saturday. CNN's Matthew Chance has more from Tel Aviv. But a warning, some of the images in this report are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDETAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Israeli forces patrolling the labyrinth of narrow streets in the central Gaza Strip. These latest images from the Israeli military, what they say is their continued activity amid the devastation to dismantle Hamas. To the south in Rafah, where the Hamas leader was recently killed, drone footage of strikes in what Israel says are more Hamas fighters and infrastructure. While across Gaza, civilians are paying a heavy price. At this hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip, an influx of casualties from a new Israeli strike at Bet Lahia where Palestinian health officials say dozens of people, including women and children, were killed. Among the shrouded bodies of her family, this woman calls her father to grieve their loss. I swear, Dad, nobody is left, she sobs. Israel says the casualty figures are exaggerated and that they operate against Hamas in a precise and targeted manner. But eyewitnesses at the scene say the Israeli airstrikes felt like an earthquake. It was just Wednesday when an Israeli drone captured the final moments of the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's life. His killing fueling hopes of a hostage release, even a ceasefire in Gaza and beyond. In fact, the region seems to be plunging further into chaos, with Israel stepping up strikes, and pressing deeper into neighboring Lebanon, hitting what it says are strongholds of Iranian-backed Hezbollah, like here, the town of Nabatiyeh, in southern Lebanon. Back in Israel, Hezbollah rockets have been striking the country's north. One drone even hitting near the Israeli Prime Minister's private house in the coastal town of Caesarea. He called it an assassination attempt by agents of Iran, vowing to press ahead with military action. Iran denies involvement and Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility.",

Look, Trump is talking about restoring law and order. And I'm telling you, you can mock it. People in the media can mock it, but that resonates with the American people.

The portion of her answer on \"60 Minutes\" was more succinct, allowing more time for other subjects in a wide-ranging 21-minute long segment.

We later see people by the shore trying to rescue those who had fallen into the water. What we know is that the gangway collapsed this shortly before 4:00 in the afternoon on Saturday, as crowds gathered on Sapelo Island for a celebration of the Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants. According to Walter Raven, the commissioner of Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the gangway that led from the dark to the ferry collapsed when about 40 people were on it. Commissioner Raven said that there was a significant increase in the number of people visiting on Saturday, although he doesn't yet know if that was a factor in the gangway's collapse.",

Officials also said there are three other people in critical condition. President Biden also reacted to the news saying that he and the first lady are heartbroken to learn about the ferry dock walkway collapse on Georgia's Sapelo Island. What should have been a joyous celebration of Gullah-Geechee culture and history instead turned into tragedy and devastation, the president said. Sapelo Island is a barrier island off the coast of Georgia, accessible only by boat. It's home to about 70 full-time residents and most of them are descendants from slaves who worked on plantations.
