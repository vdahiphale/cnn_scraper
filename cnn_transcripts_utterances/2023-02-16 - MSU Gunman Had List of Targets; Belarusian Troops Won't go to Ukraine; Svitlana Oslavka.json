Also in that note, the 43-year-old shooter, who died by suicide, targets other businesses. We're not naming those businesses. We know he targeted a warehouse, an employment agency, a discount store, a church, and a fast-food restaurant. We're learning this information less than 24 hours after more than 2,000 people at least gathered on campus last night to hold vigil. We're talking about students, people from the community, faculty, professors and, of course, the state's governor.And the big question on many people's minds who have spoken with us, many of them students who barely spoke above a whisper when they were at that vigil last night, said they want to know why. They are also hoping to get more answers from law enforcement officials in regards to how that 43-year-old shooter, who police say had no ties to MSU, obtained the gun.

Presumably the government would continue to pay interest on our debt, right, so that you wouldn't have a default of that magnitude but that would mean IOUs for the 2.1 active duty military members, it could mean 67 million people who receive some sort of a Social Security payment would also receive an IOU. This could throw the economy overnight into a recession. So, you've got a situation where this debt ceiling needs to be raised.Longer term you have another situation, and that is the CBO is saying that higher interest rates, the - just the growing number of people relying more on health care and more on Social Security, those higher costs are going to mean that the national debt will rise another $19 trillion over the next decade. So, there's a short-term problem here, which is paying for the bills that have already been spent, right, and not causing a crisis this summer over the debt ceiling, and then there's the longer term discussion about how you're going to get your financial house in order.

When the Fed sees a report like this from the CBO that says, hey, if these rate hikes continue, economic growth is going to zero out, does the Fed says, hmm, maybe we should hold back a little bit here? Yes, get inflation under control, but we don't want to go too far because zero economic growth is a bad thing.",

What this - what the - what the Fed is trying to do right now is get inflation under control. We saw this morning another I would say warm inflation report from Producer Prices, up 6 percent. We also saw a job market -- layoffs that were very, very low. And yesterday I told you, as you know, retail sales were very, very strong.So, the Fed is trying to - try to - try to kill inflation here at this point because that is the near-term problem that is the most - the most dangerous. And so I think, just taking over the last three or four days, you're pretty much going to see more interest rate hikes ahead. And you're right, Jim, those higher interest rates mean it costs more to service the debt we already have and can slow the economy further out.
