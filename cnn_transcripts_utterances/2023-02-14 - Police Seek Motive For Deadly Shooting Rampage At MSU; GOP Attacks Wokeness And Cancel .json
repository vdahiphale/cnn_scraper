So, it might be -- that might he a murder suicide or a domestic violence or gangs or drugs.But the ones that, you know, we are dealing with today, this situation, the Parkland situation five years ago, Northern Illinois University exactly 15 years ago today, five killed, 17 injured, those types of shootings, you are right, those are here in our face and we are like why are we not able to combat that. You know, I have maybe a somewhat controversial view about it but having worked on this for so long, you know, the answer is that we as citizens are not willing to accept our responsibility for it, and that's kind of frustrating. The individuals are out there. They're conducting themselves in the same way, and we are not choosing to accept to see what they are doing in preparation for these kinds of killings.",

We are their social structure. You know, our family members and our work mates and our, you know, siblings and parents and neighbors. And we are not taking on that responsibility. I think the way that we did after 9/11 where we said, say something, say something, no terrorist is going to attack my town again, we've done a great job of that when it comes to international terrorists.

The shooter killed his mother first, right? Ten percent of these situations, they kill a family member before they go out and commit the act of violence.It is kind of a -- it takes a village kind of concept, right? Even though this individual wasn't part of our Spartan community, this individual was part of other communities, whether that was in the neighborhood or work situation. Most of these people do work. And you are absolutely right about what the Sandy Hook parents told you. It is so true to form. FBI research showed that the concerning behaviors, because that is what we are looking for, concerning behaviors, concerning behaviors force students -- force school shooters who are students. Ninety-two percent of those students telegraphed. They leaked by words. They leaked what they were going to do to somebody. But it did not get back to the right authorities. I think that I would just follow one other thing about that. The thing is that everybody wants to say, I don't think he meant it, I don't know what is the big deal, he is kind of a grouchy guy, he is always like that, he has always been a crab (ph) at work, all those excuses, those are excuses that we give ourselves to not report something. And what I would say to everybody who might know about somebody that they are concerned about because their behaviors have changed or they have -- they have heightened concerns about them, if you have Spidey sense that's sort of telling you this guy is just or gal, but most of them are guys, this guy is just not -- he is not right and there is something bad, report it. Report it to a tip line because you don't know -- in Michigan, that would be safe to tell. Other states have different ones. FBI has a tip line.

The ATF, the Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, should focus on firearms crimes placed in that agency with more agents to do more enforcement. More regulation, more enforcement, and that may not solve the problem, but if that agency also studies the specific examples that we've seen across the country, they can also make school safer.

And exactly what Katherine, the FBI agent that you interviewed, mentioned, that when there is -- you see something, you should say something. And what this app does is it allows you anonymously say something. Only 7% of schools have downloaded and are using this regularly. They said that it has prevented 13 planned school shootings, 406 children contemplating suicide to receive help. I think that is a big thing that proactively can be done pretty easily.",

That is an area where I think there is promise that we, all of us, not just Congress, can get involved in. There are states, not all of them, but states that do have these red flag laws. And now, the issue, as Carrie correctly pointed out, is how are they implemented? The people are learning mostly through failure, as we saw in Colorado, the club shooting there. I mean, there are red flag laws in place that have not worked yet, but you can tweak them and make them better.

And so, I don't think we've ever seen it quantified before, the numbers of how vast this problem is. But since Columbine, \"The Washington Post\" looked at how many kids have been at school when there was a school shooting and have the residual effect of it. So, in 2018, that's the date of the Parkland shooting, there were 187,000 kids in America who had been at school during a school shooting.

They have to deal with entanglements from wayward or what we call ghost nets. They have to deal with the ingestion of plastics. And in some cases, there could be disease. The latest whale to wash up, I believe, was a 35 foot in length female, which tells me that length, she's probably a subadult or juvenile.
