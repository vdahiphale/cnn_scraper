From a political standpoint, you say that Republicans are scared to death of this IVF ruling in Alabama. What do you think they're afraid of? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Well, I am somebody -- I'm not going to get into the personal details of what I did do and where it went, but who went through trying to get pregnant. You don't know how hard it is or a woman that wants to have a child, a family, the men and woman, the husband and the wife, wanting to have a child. So, when you suddenly see the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, our own speaker of the House saying that they support IVF. They understand what they've done to women. It is the starkest and clearest example that the federal government is trying to get into a woman's personal health care and the decisions she has to make with her doctor, her family, and her religion. And they know that there are a lot of people, who like for me that want to get pregnant, what desperately to have a child, and they're going to take away one of the best hopes they have.",

So, they're -- they are worried about what they have to do to make sure that they can protect their rights in all ways.

But people are still interested in experiencing luxury in stores. And that's why they're going to be investing in Bloomingdales and Bluemercury. But, of course, when you talk about store closures, you talk about job losses. And Macy's last month announced it was laying off more than 2,300 employees.On the flip side, a little bit of good news. Macy's is opening 30 smaller Macy's stores. But, of course, that's a smaller footprint, fewer employees.
