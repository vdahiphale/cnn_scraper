      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, a historic deal or a drop in the ocean. What experts make of the COP climate deal that promises a transition away from fossil fuels.Plus, misery in Gaza as heavy rains threaten to make life even harder for the enclaves 1.8 million displaced people. And then Ukraine walks away with, well, almost empty handed after President Zelenskyy fails to persuade U.S. Congress members to break its deadlock. A historic deal has been reached at the COP28 climate conference that calls for transitioning away from fossil fuels blamed for global warming. Many country delegates celebrated the agreement as a significant step forward. But the deal reached earlier today in Dubai falls short of calling on the world to phase out oil, coal and gas altogether. Instead, it presents a series of options for countries to reduce carbon pollution so as to achieve net zero by 2050. Many climate experts cautiously welcome the agreement, but point to weaknesses such as leaving the door open for fossil fuel expansion. For more on this, let's bring in CNN's David McKenzie in Johannesburg. How historic actually is this?",

Well, if not unanimously, certainly by consensus.Now, some of the key points of the deal is that it's looking for explicitly transitioning away from fossil fuels. It's asking for countries to get to net zero by 2050, or at least by 2050, tripling the renewable energy capacity by 2030, and to help poorer nations to adapt with climate finance. Now, some of the loopholes that experts say are important to pay attention to are things like carbon credits as well as carbon capture, which is seen as an expensive alternative to just transitioning away to renewable energy. The COP president said that there were negotiations well into the night, and he said that this is an important moment to recognize. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's no mechanism to allow for policing of it.

Some of the hardest rainfall that I've ever seen and hail. And it was hard not to think or try to imagine how these hundreds of thousands of people are coping.Humanitarian officials believe that almost the entire Gaza Strip has been displaced, 1.9 million people out of a total population of 2.2. So many of them have fled to the southern part of the Gaza Strip to get away from that fierce fighting. There is not nearly enough aid. And when we see those aid trucks coming in, we have seen Gazans swarming them because they are so desperate for food, for water, for medicine, for shelter. Medical officials have warned that this is a breeding ground for epidemics. And then you just add this horrible weather into the mix as well. Those official shelters that are managed by the U.N. and other aid groups are bursting at the seams. So people are sleeping out in the streets, they're sleeping in whatever makeshift tents they can make. And then you have these flash floods and torrential downpours that just make the situation all the more miserable. Max, you and I spoke yesterday when I was at the Kerem Shalom crossing and it really highlighted the fact that all of the aid is still coming in through Egypt. And that bottleneck there at the Rafah crossing is really limiting the amount of aid that can get in on top of the fact that there is such chaos on the other side. So now we see the U.S. very publicly, the White House openly speaking directly to CNN, saying that Israel needs to open up that Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel to allow more aid to directly go into Gaza.

So it really underscores the fact that there is still fierce fighting going on in northern Gaza, that Israel doesn't have full control there as they do focus on the south. There are two main pockets of resistance, as the IDF has called it, the Jabalia refugee camp and Shazia.And the incident that you're referring to is one of the deadliest incidents that the IDF has experienced since this war began. Nine soldiers killed in a single incident. They are members of the famed Golani Brigade. One was a battalion commander, a young lieutenant colonel. There was an additional IDF soldier killed. So on Tuesday, 10 were -- the fallen were numbered 10 overall. The IDF has lost some 115 soldiers. On the other side, the IDF says some 7,000 militants have been taken off the battlefield. And then one final figure, Max, the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza says that since the war broke out on October 7th, some 18,400 Palestinians have lost their lives. Max?",

Israel says it was conducting counterterrorism activities and it used drones to strike people attacking the Israeli soldiers. The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues on his mission to get more aid for Kyiv. He's just arrived in Oslo for a meeting with Nordic leaders. His visit coming ahead of a key European Council meeting that begins on Thursday. His pleas for more war funding from Washington may go unanswered. Congress is divided on an aid package with Republicans saying they'll only pass one if it's tied to U.S. border security changes. U.S. President Joe Biden says letting Ukraine run out of aid would be, quote, \"the greatest Christmas gift for Vladimir Putin\". Natasha Bertrand joins us now from Washington, D.C.

COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber called the agreement historic. But the deal includes some vague language that some climate advocates say doesn't reflect the growing urgency of the climate crisis. In fact, the deal doesn't require countries to phase out oil, coal and gas, but calls on countries to, quote, \"contribute to reducing carbon pollution to achieve net zero by 2050\". This comes at the end of the year, which scientists say is on track to become the hottest on record and is being defined by natural disasters across the globe. So will the new deal be enough to fight global warming? Let's bring in our Chief Climate Change Correspondent, Bill Weir, who's the man to answer whether or not this indeed was historic. Bill?",

And over almost 200 countries agreeing that they should be phased down, they should be contributed. But that phased down language was stripped away by OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia and Iraq and Kuwait, resisting an all-out drop of fossil fuels.So instead, what we have is sort of a choose your own adventure for the countries of the world. Eight different options of things that they can do, including transitioning away from fossil fuels, accelerating this action by the middle of this century, by 2050, tripling renewable energies and doubling energy efficiency, phasing down unabated coal, ramping up carbon capture and bridge fuels. So called methane gas is the way that is often referenced there, which is disappointing to many over 100 countries who say the end of methane needs to be imminent for any hope at containing global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. And as for finance, this is a real sticking one, Max. Imagine a country in Africa that has maybe a lot of fossil fuels and a lot of wind and sun and a lot of debt. They're pumping oil to service their debt with no money left over to transition to renewables. There was much hope that rich countries would be sort of encouraged to give more to those developing countries. There's no specific language on that.",

Argentina set to devalue the peso by more than 50 percent as part of emergency reforms to fight hyperinflation and boost its struggling economy. The conversion rate changes from 365 pesos to 800 per dollar, it was announced on Tuesday, along with cuts to public works, projects and energy subsidies. The sweeping reforms come just days into the term of the new president, Javier Milei, who campaigned on a pledge to get rid of the peso and replace it with the dollar. The president said during his inauguration on Sunday the country will have to endure a period of hardship before it can move forward. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says he'll sit down with the president of neighboring Guyana on Thursday to discuss a growing territorial dispute.
