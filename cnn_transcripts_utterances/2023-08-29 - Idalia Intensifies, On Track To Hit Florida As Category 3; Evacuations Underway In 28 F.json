It's starting to hit Florida. And I'm Abby Phillip.Idalia packing winds of more than 100 miles an hour is currently a Category 2 storm, but it is projected to make landfall and to slam into the coast at a Category 3. That is just three hours from now. Now, evacuations are underway in at least 28 counties. Mayors, officials, the governor, all warning people in those target zones to take cover or leave immediately, and that includes people in Cedar Key and Big Bend. One of the greatest threats, of course, is the storm surge. It's expected to reach once in a lifetime levels for this part of Florida. CNN is live up and down the coast, including in Tampa and Steinhatchee. We'll speak live with some storm chasers who are in the heart of that bull's eye, as well as officials who are warning people that time is now running out to evacuate. But, first, let's get straight to Chad Myers. He's over in the CNN Weather Center with this new forecast. Chad, what is the path of Hurricane Idalia right now at this hour?",

But now, the Hurricane Center will be putting out updates once per hour, not every three hours. So, that is some excellent news for us here in the news business. Up to 110 miles per hour, 111 is a Category 3. So, we're right there on the cusp.And we've been seeing this eye develop for about the past two or three hours. We haven't had an eye for really most of the storm. But that eye is very indicative of what we expect this storm to do, increase in intensity. An eye means that the storm is breathing in its eye wall, sinking air in its eye, and then all of a sudden things begin to go bump in the night. We're also seeing now the lightning pick up with this eye wall as well. There goes the storm. You ask where it goes. Believe it or not, there are hurricane warnings in Georgia. Even though the storm is going to land in Florida, it will still be a hurricane as it goes over the state line. This is going to be a quick moving storm by the time it gets there, taking all of the water that this bubble of storm now is collecting. Think about like a coffee cup. When you blow your coffee cup in the morning and you kind of try to cool it off, all of those little waves go to the far side. Well, now, all of the waves are doing the same thing, but not at two or three miles per hour, like your breath, at a 100 miles per hour, pushing that water up to a collection point, which won't let it go any farther than that right there. There is the storm at this point in time moving onshore, again, somewhere probably around 8:00 in the morning for the eye wall. But things are going to start to go downhill with winds and everything else rather quickly right now.",

And if the eye wall doesn't cross here exactly, this is still the area where they are expecting 10 to 15 feet of storm surge.About 45 minutes out here, Cedar Key, the mayor told his people that they simply can't be helped if they stay. Get out. This could be unsurvivable. Let me explain why. So I'm on a deck right now at a marina, the Sea Hag Marina, which is normally a bustling place. I can see the bar right here, where at this time of night, it would normally be filled with people. Hurricane Hermine in 2016 was a Category 1. It has storm surge of six feet. When that came in here, and that did come in here, that filled the water up to about here on this deck where I am right now. A storm surge of six feet went up to about here. So, imagine what 10 feet would be and then 15 feet. Well over my head, twice as high as I am right now. That's what it could be like here in eight hours, which is why people have been told to leave. Sheriff's deputies have been going door-to-door to houses here to get people to go. As Chad was saying, there's not a ton of people who live here. It's not a very populated area, only a population of 500 to 1,000 people, depending on the time of the year. And many people have left, but a few haven't. The people who own the Sea Hag Marina, where I am right now, they've chosen to stay. Their house is a few feet higher in elevation. They think they can ride it out. They just don't feel safe leaving this behind, but they know they're taking a risk and they're scared. They're scared because they lived through Hermine at six feet of storm surge, and they're nervous what 15 feet could do, Abby.",

They can't come and help you, and that's what the winds, with the storm surge, if the storm surge inundates this area and goes in, as Chad was saying. I'm 500 yards, maybe, from the Gulf of Mexico here, but if you go inland more, as Chad was saying, it's flat for miles and miles and miles. If this is covered with water, they're going to have to be able to do water rescues if they can in some areas that they can't reach. And it's a very small police department. They were telling us, normally, it's only a handful of sheriff's deputies who were on duty in this county ever normally at one time. They actually had to call in the state police to help them because there are so few of them there to monitor it.

About half an hour ago, we started seeing a line of thunderstorms associated with this hurricane make its way across Hillsborough County. We expect this bad weather to continue into the night and into tomorrow, which is when we might start seeing some of this storm surge associated with this hurricane.That is the biggest concern from emergency officials at this hour. They are worried that this storm, which is going to pass Hillsborough County and Pinellas County, the Tampa Bay area, as well as Clearwater and St. Pete, they're worried that because this storm is not going to hit this part of Florida directly, that folks might become a little bit complacent tomorrow. But, again, once that storm makes its way past, that is when we expect to not only see more of this rain, more of this wind, but then, at some point, all of that water is going to be pushed into the Tampa Bay. And then once you have all of that together, you add in high tide, as Chad laid, out king tide. And that is the concern moving forward over the next 12 to 24 hours, is that we're going to see some significant flooding when it comes to this storm surge. At this hour, the forecasting model is calling for anywhere between two to four, six, even seven feet of a storm surge. And so right now, Abby, the concern is for residents that decided not to seek higher ground, at least in these low lying areas, that they are in a safe place and they're worried that just folks are going to go out and about tomorrow with their day and might get caught up in some of these flooding.",

CNN Correspondent Gloria Pazmino is in Clearwater, just west of Tampa for us. So, Gloria, you're starting to see, I can see there in your shot, some rain, some wind.

      "sentences": "Yeah. That is going to be the big story of this storm along with these winds that are picking up as the storm gets stronger. Thank you, Gloria, and stay safe tonight. For a closer look at the conditions there on the ground. I want to bring in AccuWeather Network Extreme Meteorologist Reed Timmer. Reed, you're over there in Cedar Key, Florida, which is just right where perhaps this storm is gonna make landfall. What are you seeing right now and what are you expecting in the hours ahead? REED TIMMER, ACCUWEATHER NETWORK EXTREME METEOROLOGISTwinds have been gradually increasing throughout the evening and they've been getting steadily and more steadily stronger. And we've even seen some thunderstorms move by that had some lowerings that looked like they have water potential as well. And we do expect the tornado threat to really ramp up as we get into the overnight hours, as well. We're going to be in the front right quadrant tropical cyclone. So, we do expect big time tornado potential, as well. But back here in Cedar Key, the big concern is the storm surge and this is an island that sticks out a little bit to the north of Tampa. We do expect landfall a little bit to the west now, slowly starting to trend a bit west but it doesn't mean you're not gonna have a catastrophic storm surge here because the landfall, the hurricane is anywhere after the west. We have that powerful onshore flow that's gonna pile up the water into town here. We expect a 10 to 15-foot storm surge with waves on top of that and winds gusting the triple digits up over a hundred miles an hour so it's going to be very life-threatening here and that's why there's also mandatory evacuations for this zone as well. But there are about a hundred people that ever made behind and there are some higher areas here at Cedar Key up above 20 feet up at the water tower in the school and people are stashing their vehicles up there because all of this behind me is going to be flooded out for several blocks near the Gulf of Mexico shoreline.",

And so, an unprecedented storm like this will have unprecedented impacts. And you just don't know exactly what to expect. And that's a scary thing, even for a storm chaser that has seen over 50 or 60 hurricanes so far, you just don't know what the impacts are going to be. You're not as familiar with the shoreline and the terrain and you know, it's very low-lying here, as well.So, the storm surge is going to penetrate several miles inland. It's likely going to knock out a lot of bridges, as well. And so definitely the concavity of the shoreline is something that's also very scary for a storm surge because it's very conducive for the piling up of that water with the onshore flow here and anywhere to the right of the center.",

So, we take a lot of precautions to prepare these facilities that are maybe more near to the coast than other facilities. And once incident -- one incidence, we put a barrier up around a facility to protect it from flooding in there.So, we go through steps to prepare each of the facilities for days leading up to this. That's the key for us, is having the preparedness, bringing all of our leadership and all of our staff together to ensure that our facility is ready for any type of wind damage that could occur or any localized flooding that may occur. Truly our goal is to care for our patients during normal times as well as adversity like this. Here at the Enterprise Command Center, as our facilities are preparing to care for those patients, we mobilize resources based out of Nashville's coordination center to go in and support our facilities so that they can focus on the patients and we focus on supporting our facilities in those zones.",
