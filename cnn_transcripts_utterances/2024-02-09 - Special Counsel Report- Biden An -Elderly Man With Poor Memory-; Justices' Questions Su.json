It is just before 5That, right there, was President Biden sparring with reporters yesterday as he defended himself in the wake of a report from special counsel Robert Hur about his mishandling of classified documents. Though the report announced that Biden wouldn't face any legal repercussions, it did seem to deal the president a significant political blow. In the report, Hur said that he made the decision not to bring criminal charges -- in part, because Biden would appear to a jury as a quote \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur also said the president had quote \"diminished faculties and faulty memory,\" alleging that he could not recall what year his son Beau died during an interview with the FBI.

What were you hearing about what their response was and what they were trying to accomplish by putting the president out there? CATHERINE LUCEY, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, this was a hastily called news conference last night, Kasie, and we weren't -- you don't usually see the president at this hour. This was put together quickly -- limited notice for reporters. It was a small group that was brought in. And it was clear that the president wanted to send a message. He was very combative, as you can see in those clips. He was angry. Particularly, he was visibly angry when he spoke about his son Beau and the questions about the timing of Beau's death. He got very emotional then. But he was combative, sparring with reporters after he made his opening remark. He clearly wanted to send a message in response to the commentary in the report about his memory because there is an awareness that this is a vulnerability for his campaign and for his political future. But obviously, as you said, this report raises real things. I mean, the voters are really concerned about this issue. This is a key vulnerability for him and it's -- I don't think the appearance last night is going to make that go away. I mean, it's just something they're going to continue to have to grapple with.",

Let's talk about the other major -- you know, we saw these just historic arguments before the Supreme Court yesterday about whether Trump should be allowed to be taken off the Colorado ballot. It seems like -- you know, as I was talking to some of the experts that were sitting around or table -- we were listening to the arguments -- the sense was that, in some ways, to protect the court that they could make this decision to leave him on the Colorado ballot. That certainly seemed to be the way that they were leaning -- and not just the conservative justices.But then also, they have to consider this question of whether he's immune from prosecution in the election subversion case. There is some thinking that they could either decline to take that up entirely or take it up and declare him not immune there. And in that way, they would be potentially washing their own hands of it. What do you make of that kind of thinking and what we heard from the court yesterday?",

There's movement throughout the country with many states considering the notion of whether he should be put on the ballot -- that is, the former president. And in the event that he's excluded, what would be the legal basis?So I think the court was very mindful in their questioning that while this decision affected the Supreme Court of Colorado and their decision to reject Trump from being on the ballot that we're speaking to everyone else in the country. And in doing that, it seemed that the justices were pretty uniform in answering that question, at least it did to me -- that they would reject the Colorado decision and therefore allow him to be on the ballot. Why? There were questions from a liberal justice, Ms. Jackson, regarding listen, does it even apply to the president? And in doing that, Kasie, they assess what's called the intent, right? The intention of when the 14 Amendment, Section 3 was passed. Was it really designed for the president, and if it was, why did it not say so? You look at things from conservatives, like Kavanaugh, which would suggest that hey, we'd be disenfranchising way too many voters.
