First off, we heard from Jessica Tisch, the New York City Police Commissioner, yesterday. And she said that authorities had gathered a huge amount of evidence in the way of DNA evidence and forensics fingerprints. Also, you have the suspect's image, his face, on a surveillance camera. But we don't have the suspect's identity yet. How critical is this piece of information? And do you expect that we'll get that soon?",

So, maybe they do have a tentative ID, but it doesn't sound like it because, you know, it's been what, three days now, at least, since this took place.

What we thought initially was a jam was him pulling back the bolt to put another round in the chamber to fire. And so, when you look at it that way, and it does have a silencer on it intentionally, because you don't want to disturb other animals if you're killing one of the animals for whatever reason.And so, it's very, so he's trying not to draw attention to himself beyond what he has to at the time he actually commits the homicide. And so, it would make a lot of sense when you stop and think about it, but they won't be able to know for certain until they recover that weapon. Central Park does have bodies of water in it. He could have thrown it in the water. It could be in the backpack. I doubt if he's got it on his person because he's shedding evidence.

We know also that ahead of the ceremonies here at Notre Dame, President Zelensky will be meeting with the French President as well at the Elysee Palace. What's unclear for now is whether President-elect Donald Trump and President Zelensky will have a chance to meet, or they will be in quick succession within the French Presidential Palace later today ahead of these opening ceremonies. And of course, given the presence of those two leaders, particularly here in Paris, there will be a lot of attention on Ukraine throughout the day and what those meetings mean. As you mentioned, it was with President Macron, arguably the president-elect Donald Trump, when he was in his first term, had struck up the strongest relationship amongst European leaders. And so, this, his first return to the world stage since his re-election, an important moment for the French President as well, under a great deal of trouble here domestically, politically. This is a moment for him to shine on the world stage. But again, we'll be looking very closely to see what any of those leaders have to say about Ukraine, even before they're joined by others here at Notre Dame to celebrate what will be, promises to be, an extraordinary ceremony again amongst around this five-year long waited reopening of Notre Dame which promises to be pretty spectacular.

I think the quote was that he seemed thirsty for a pardon. Was it -- it was in the Rolling Stone report.You know, Eric Adams is somebody who, you know, when he was elected, when he first won the primary, he came out as the more moderate candidate, and he would kind of position himself all over the spectrum. He also said that he was a progressive, but he claimed his version of politics were progressivism. You know, we've seen him kind of shift where the power momentum has been in American politics early in President Biden's term, when he was having some of his bipartisan legislation get passed, you saw Eric Adams declare himself to be the Biden of Brooklyn and meet with him. You know, now we have an incoming Trump administration. Eric Adams has a pardon on the table that he might be seeking from an incoming president, and we're seeing him see more favorable and seeking a meeting with this incoming administration.",

This is not going to be like a return to spring, if that's what you were hoping for.But yes, we've still got the cold temperatures out there, especially in the Midwest and the South and the eastern portion of the country, but we are going to start to see that gradual change in the next 24 hours. Now, until it's gone, it's still helping to push a lot of that lake effect snow across states like Michigan as well as New York. So, you're still going to get several inches expected on top of what you already have as we go through the rest of the day today. But here again, you can see all of those warmer temperatures, the green, the yellow color really kind of overtaking more of that blue, especially into the extreme eastern portion of the country once we get to Sunday and in some cases, by Monday. Here's a look at that change. Again, look, Nashville, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., you still have at least one more day of those temperatures below average, but then we start to see that swing to the opposite direction. In fact, take Houston for example, going from 14 degrees below normal today to 14 degrees above normal by the time we get to Monday. However, as we mentioned, it's going to come right back down. We've got a cold front that's going to make its way through and bring some pretty deep some pretty decent amount of rain, especially to the southeast and along that Gulf Coast region. So, New Orleans, for example, those temperatures spike up for several days, also when we see the rain, but once that cold front comes through, notice that big dip right back down again. And it's not just for areas along the Gulf Coast. Nashville, also seeing the temperatures rise, but coming right back down again by the end of the week.",
