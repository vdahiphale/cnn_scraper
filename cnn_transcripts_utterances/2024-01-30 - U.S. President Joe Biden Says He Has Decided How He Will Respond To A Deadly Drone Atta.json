So, how will he deter Iran while avoiding further escalation? Also ahead, undercover Israeli agent. Some disguise as medical staff carry out a rare and risky raid in the West Bank. Details on what they went after coming up. And neither Nicolas Maduro nor supreme court ban will deter her. Maria Corina Machado says she will not give up chasing the Venezuelan presidency, as the U.S. warns Venezuela to let her run. My interview with Venezuela's main opposition leader coming up. But first, tonight, we still don't know the where, the when or the how? But Joe Biden says he has decided on a response to the deadliest attack on U.S. forces in the Middle East in years. The U.S. President blames Iranian- backed militias operating in Syria and Iraq for Sunday's drone strike that killed three U.S. soldiers at a remote military outpost. He essentially has to thread the needle with a response strong enough to deter future similar attacks, but not enough to trigger full-blown regional war. Mr. Biden is under pressure for -- over pressure, I should say, from Republicans at home too in an election year to hit back hard. Some saying his policy of deterrence against Iran has quote, \"failed miserably\". All this taking place, of course, in the context of Israel-U.S. backed war on Hamas, which is already spread beyond Gaza's borders. (AUDIO GAP: 14:02:17-14:03:17]",

This is an exceedingly potent argument in the United States. Going right back to Barack Obama's victory in 2008, which was largely based on opposition to the Iraq war.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEFANO POZZEBON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It seemed a rare victory for diplomacy in a year of conflict. October last year, the Venezuelan government and the opposition signing a deal that opened the door to a peaceful transition and brought hopes of an end to years of political crisis in the South American country. Authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro, pledging to release political prisoners and allow free and fair elections. In the United States, assisting the opposition, offering to lift the sanctions in exchange for a return to democracy. Five days later, an opposition primary with more than 2 million votes selected Maria Corina Machado to challenge Maduro for the presidency as a unitary candidate. Then in December, a prisoner swap brought home 10 U.S. citizens detained in Venezuela in exchange for a closed ally and alleged personal financier of Maduro himself. National Security Adviser Juan Gonzalez, showing cautious optimism that Venezuela could finally turn on the page. JUAN GONZALEZ, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUREAU OF WESTERN HEMISPHERE AFFAIRS (through translator): Part of the deal was releasing U.S. prisoners and Venezuelan political prisoners. They are respecting the deal and doing even more. We know this is a long process, but we are committed step by step with democracy in Venezuela. POZZEBON (voice-over): But with the new year, things started to sour. NICOLAS MADURO, VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Nothing will stop me. I will keep campaigning and protecting the people and just so it hurts them the most. I will keep ruling this country. POZZEBON (voice-over): Until Friday, when the Supreme Court stacked with government allies ruled that Machado is banned from holding public office on corruption charges. Machado denies the charges as well as accusations that she conspired to forcefully remove Maduro from power. Instead, she accuses Maduro of breaking his word and called on the support of the International Community. Republicans in the U.S. urging President Biden to restore the sanctions lifted last year, including oil sanctions which could impact gas prices back home.
