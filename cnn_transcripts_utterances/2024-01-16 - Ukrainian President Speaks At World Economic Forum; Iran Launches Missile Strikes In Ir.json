      "sentences": "Well, Becky, he spoke behind me about an hour ago in the room behind me, an urgency was reallyfront and center where you just saw some agitation in his words as well. I would sum it up with that one line where he said, I'm grateful, but. Clearly, this was a tight balancing act for him to once again, thank the West and its partners who have supplied Ukraine for now two years with financial assets, with weaponry. And, of course, as you noted, given everything else what's going around, going on in the world given the U.S. elections, given the crisis in the Middle East, he does not want Ukraine to be lost in the shuffle, which is why he once again reiterated that Putin's war will not stop at Ukraine's borders, which he noted Ukraine had been violated, not just on a full scale level two years ago, but its been nearly 10 years since Russia illegally annexed Crimea and the Donbas in eastern Europe. And he went on to say that strengthening our economy will strengthen your security. Ukraine, highlighting that they're appreciative of the E.U. accession talks that have the gun and obviously their ultimate goal once this war is over, is full membership in the E.U. and NATO. But he also acknowledged knowledge what many are stating right now, maybe where this war ends in that is at a freeze, at a stalemate. However, you describe it, here's what he said: Freezing war to its end, nothing will happen with that. Any frozen conflict can reignite, especially with Vladimir Putin in Russia. He said the man will never change, making it clear that he knows him best its better than anyone else. He also stated, one man has stolen at least 13 years of peace, replacing it with pain, pain, pain, and crisis. And, Becky, also, you can since the agitation that over $100 billion in aid, that's a combination from the E.U. and the U.S. has been stalled given Hungary's standing in the way in Europe and the United States, a rather vocal minority of Republicans hopefully as President Biden and other Democrats said something can be passed in the weeks to come, but every day that goes by, he sees more and more Ukrainian soldiers killed in the fighting, and he's also stressing that despite this term stands stalemate being thrown around, there are victories being made each and every day. Just earlier this week, Ukraine shot down a Russian spy plane and he stated that the economy though taking a big hit, especially at 40 percent, but in the first-year of wards expected to grow some four-and-a-half percent this year. So the big message is don't give up on Ukraine because if you go give up on Ukraine, the West is next -- Becky.",

I see thathe shook hands with Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, who said, God bless you, Mr. Zelensky. Look, he's clearly here looking to drum up support, not just from governments that he has concerns about at this point, not least the U.S., in providing more aid also concerns about where that aid might come from and what it might look like from the West going forward. But also Bianna from some of these key finance titans as Zelensky looks for further support. What could Donald Trump victory, Bianna, which is looking certainly very more likely as far as him being the Republican contender is concerned after Iowa and possibly as a matchup against Joe Biden polls suggesting that he could win, what would that mean for Zelensky and Ukraine?",

I mean, Becky, you can insert any global hotspot and when it comes toPresident Trump, that former President Trump's take, I mean, you could say the same thing about ending the war in Gaza in the Middle East. And so, a lot of concern among the Ukrainians about what a Trump presidency would mean. They are paying close attention to this election, of course, and even Joe Biden's words. Remember, Becky, he was saying for a long time that the U.S. will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. That changed a little bit in the last few weeks. And he said, as long as the U.S. can, and that didn't fall on deaf ears in Ukraine.",

Thank you.Well, Israel accusing Hamas of psychological torture after multiple videos of these Israeli hostages were released over 24 hours by the militant groups. CNN will not be sharing the videos, but footage in one released on Monday appears to show to male hostages killed. Israel believes hundred and 32 hostages are still alive and held in Gaza within the enclave, the U.N. head of relief says hundreds of thousands are now starving, facing a famine that came on with, quote, incredible speed. Keep in mind, Israel has enforced a blockade of Gaza with full control of what can get in. Elsewhere in the region, condemnation against Iran. The U.S. criticizing what it calls reckless missiles strikes by the country in both northern Iraq and northern Syria. Iran claims it destroyed what it called an Israeli spy base in Irbil in Iraq. A lot happening in the region, a lot to unpack. Let's break it all down. Paula Hancocks is with us out of Abu Dhabi. And those strikes in Irbil. What do we know about them? We certainly heard, you know, sort of outright condemnation in region from many parties and from the U.S., and I'm Western leaders. What's the latest?",

And from the Iranian sites, they claim that the Revolutionary Guards launched a missile to strike and destroy what they called one of the main espionage headquarters of Israel, claiming that that is where Mossad had one of its bases. Now from Iran side, they say that the reason they have done this is in retaliation for Israeli attacks which have killed some Iranian commanders in recent times. Now, when it comes to what happened in Syria, we understand that they targeted an element which they said was an anti-Iran terror group but specifying that this was to do with that deadly twin bombing just a couple of weeks ago in Kerman, which killed dozens of people. Now, we understand that the ISIS claimed responsibility for that, but that is the reasoning Iran has given -- Becky.",

But the real energy and we saw this in Iowa, the energy behind his support is loyal, devoted supporters. It has to do with a sense of grievance and anger and resentment that has been building for some time going all the way back to the bailout, and they blame both parties, the mainstream parties, for it.
