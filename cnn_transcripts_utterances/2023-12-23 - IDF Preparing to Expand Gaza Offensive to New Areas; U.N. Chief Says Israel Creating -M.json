Now, of course, fears that that ground offensive could also intensify across southern Gaza. We've already seen the ground offensive in Khan Yunis, the largest city of southern Gaza. Important to underscore that this region is an area where many have flocked to in search of safety, where many are taking shelter in temporary tent cities that have been established in response to that evacuation order by the Israeli military. Now we have seen continued bombardment of central Gaza today and, of course, yesterday. And we have heard those warnings from the Israeli military now telling civilians in central Gaza directly to evacuate. But the question, of course, is where do these civilians go? They have been told previously to move southwards. Now we're hearing warnings from the south. We'll see intense focus when it comes to the ground incursion and also, of course, with regards to the airstrikes that continue across the Gaza Strip. And, of course, it's important to note that southern Gaza has now been a crucial gateway for aid to get in via the Rafah border crossing.

We have a fabulous board of directors and some very, very loyal and generous donors.They really stuck with us through the COVID period and really hung in there with us, which was super, super helpful. And then, coming out of COVID, I do think it took a while for people to feel comfortable being in the company of others inside of a theater. It has been a bit of an evolution. I think people have really realized what they have been missing and are really relishing being in a communal setting and enjoying performing arts again. We also have our 70th anniversary that we're celebrating this year. That enabled us to really do some very special things this year. It's given us a lot of momentum and attention.",

But it is definitely a challenge, a challenge all the time, every year. You start over from zero every year. There is a lot of money to raise to make all of this work. So I would say that the up side, in a way, is that I know that other models in Europe, where there has been more public support but now it is kind of pulling back, that is a challenge, too, if you have really been reliant on one major source. So we do have the advantage of having lots of different sources to draw from. So it is definitely, definitely challenging.",

Now the government is looking to crack down even further.According to a proposed draft, new regulations place restrictions and limits when it comes to the money changing hands in video games, for example. Something like rewards for logging in could be banned, as well as large tips to players, who livestream their games. The government wants to reverse what it sees as a growing trend of game addiction among young people. Looking back to August of 2021, people under 18 were banned from playing video games during the week and could play for just three hours on most weekends. We've also seen the government clamp down on big businesses, such as the tech sector. But there are some signs of a possible change in an effort to help the economy. And while young people may not be happy about this, some of the big gaming companies here in China saw very steep declines -- Marc Stewart, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
