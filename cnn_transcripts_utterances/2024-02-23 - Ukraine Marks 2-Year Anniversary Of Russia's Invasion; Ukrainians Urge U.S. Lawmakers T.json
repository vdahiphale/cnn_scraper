Two years ago,Russian troops marched across the border into Ukraine, beginning the full- scale invasion that had been feared for so long, February 24th, 2022, was really a day that shook West to its very core, ripping up decades of relative peace in Europe and reshaping the modern balance of power. Few would have predicted it would last this long, but two years into the war, we are seeing an emboldened Vladimir Putin; the Russian leader shows no signs he will back away from this conflict. And recent Russian gains on the battlefield suggests Ukraine may be on the back-foot. Tonight, as we mark the sober anniversary, we will take a step back from the daily news cycle to look at the political challenges, the military realities as well as the enduring impact this war has had on Ukrainians, for those who are still there, and of course, for those who've had to flee.

Satellite imagery taken the day Ukraine pulled out, revealing the extent of the damage to the hospital and surrounding area. Compare that to just a few months before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. (on camera):  Well, in the context of this 1,000 kilometer frontline of Avdiivka doesn't actually change much. In fact, the whole second year of the war barely changed this picture. Russia, of course, captured Bakhmut up in May and Ukraine, you can see here in yellow, that's string of villages that it managed to take in western Zaporizhzhia as part of this counteroffensive. But this was ultimately a year when neither side was able to gain an advantage. (voice-over):  Russia now might be. This video posted on February 12th, which CNN has geo-located to the area around that Avdiivka hospital purportedly shows Russian strikes using massive half-ton glide bombs. These are known to be increasingly and used on the battlefield and capable of evading Ukrainian air defenses. The satellite image shows several very large craters near the hospital, unlikely to be the result of artillery strikes, weapons experts say. F-16 fighter jets would help combat these bombs, but Ukraine's pilots are not yet ready to fly them.",

And Article 5 is being implemented in any occasion for any country that could be attacked. That being said, it's clear that the member states of European Union have unequal levels of military spending. But since 2014, when Putin invaded Ukraine, this military spending has been increasing quite quickly. It's still not where it should be, but you know, you cannot do it overnight. From 2014, the Europeans have restarted the process of re- armament at different page, different space by different members. And we have to continue with that. And me as high representative for the security and defense policy of the European Union, I am doing everything I could in order to push for member states altogether to spend better.

What's happening in Ukraine and the support given to the Ukrainian people to defend themselves from the Russia aggression depends on the migratory policy at the Mexican border. I think it's a very bad approach. And as President Zelenskyy has said, and many other members of the European Union, this is highly regrettable, this game of politics among the Republicans and the Democrats. And I am strongly -- criticism of this saying of, oh, I compare what's happening at the Mexican border, which at the end is the migration pressure with what's happened in Ukraine, which is military aggression by one of the most powerful countries in the world against its neighbor.

I think it's important that we show viewers really where we are on where we started really in the last two years. So, this is where we are right now in terms of the Russian troop presence and what has been re-gained by Ukraine. You see some of the yellow dots here. This is regained by Ukraine. If we take a step back and look at Ukraine in 2022, this is what the Russian troop presence here was. As we can outline here, it seems that Ukraine has taken back or recouped all these areas here at the top, right? But the south critically is really where we have seen the biggest push by Russia -- if I just  outline here the key areas, this is where we've seen in the eastern, in the Donetsk, the whole Donetsk region. It's where I've seen the biggest push really. I was reading today that former U.S. Defense Secretary told the \"Washington Post\" that this is no longer a stalemate, this moment here.

But so far, everything that he has telegraphed is that the Senate bill, which was passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support, you had 20 Republicans backing it, that that bill is dead on arrival in the House of Representatives. And that has really raised the question, is more aid ever going to get to Ukraine? I think right now that's still really an open question and potentially not going to happen, given the dynamics within the Republican Conference, given the fact that Johnson has such a narrow majority, and any one Republican member at any point, if they are frustrated with the Speaker of the House, can bring emotion to try and get him out of that job to take away the Speaker's gavel. And that really is looming large in these dynamics as he makes a decision moving forward. Now there's a government funding deadline next week. It's potentially possible that after that, Republicans will come to some kind of place where they may be willing to move some package that looks different than that Senate package. But right now it's really hard to imagine what that formula looks like that enables Mike Johnson to both keep his job and put additional Ukraine aid on the floor, because there are so many members in the Republican Party who have warned him that this could be a fireable offense if he decides to move forward.",

Gaza's civil administration would run by local Palestinians, not linked to, \"countries or entities that support terrorism.\" The Palestinian authorities say the plan amounts to reoccupation, demanding an independent Palestinian state instead.

And that clearly flies in the face of everything that we've been hearing from the European Union, from the United States, who've been saying part of the day after situation in Gaza has to be one that embraces that concept, gives it a real pathway forward. And that's the way to get buy-in from other parties in the region. And principal -- one of the principal players of that would be Saudi Arabia. Now, in that plan, Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to think that there will be countries in the region who will step in and help pay for and help support setting up whatever this authority or individuals or groups of individuals who will run Gaza in essence. But again, that flies in the face of everything that we've been hearing, that -- for that to happen, for those countries to have buy-in, they have to see a pathway to a Palestinian state, and the Prime Minister seems to reject that. There are other things there within his plan about de- radicalizing in the welfare system and in the schools and the universities inside Gaza. That's something Prime Minister Netanyahu said would have to happen before the situation in Gaza could go back to anything like it was before, for any kind of independent, if you will, Palestinian administration, whatever that may look like, and the details are really very, very scant there. That -- when Israel says that it wants to dictate that there should be de- radicalization within these institutions, that does not sound, to Palestinians or people in the region, that there is, in any sense here, an independent Palestinian state, that the people of Gaza could aspire to even get on a pathway to. So I think there's a lot here that's going to cause consternation.

They remain determined on their side. And the Israelis had said only last week in response to the latest Hamas plan over a 4 1/2 month pause in the fighting with the possibility of exchanges of hostages for prisoners, the Israelis had described their plan as delusional. So, they are still vastly opposed in terms of the concrete steps that each are requiring that progress can be made. And yet here they all are in Paris. So, you have the CIA head Bill Burns, he's here. You have the director of Mossad. You have the heads of the heads of Egyptian and Qatari intelligence as well. And they've gathered here in the hope that some progress can be made on that question of a pause in the hostilities and some kind of exchange of at least a few of the hostage in -- hostages in return for the prisoners. Now, I think what has changed over the course of the last week when the talks last collapsed in Cairo is what you've just been hearing about with Nic there, the fact of this maximalist proposal being put on the table by Israelis. And of course, they're going to be seeking buy-in to any talks that might follow with regard to that plan. Despite its controversy, their hope will be that talks can begin along the basis of that. And I think the other thing that mattered from the point of view of the Israelis was that the French initiative to get the medication to the most chronically ill hostages appear to have borne fruit and it was only once they'd received note, word, that the medication had reached those Israeli hostages that they agreed to get back around the table. It also mattered, of course, that the talks that took place in Cairo over the course of the last couple of days with their political head of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh might have led to indications from Egyptian negotiators that there might be some room for compromise. And so at the very least, here they all are in Paris, Isa, to talk about the possibility of what kind of pause in the fighting there might be and what kind of exchange between hostages and prisoners they might be. And of course, that is something, even if they remain very far apart. And for now, the French have been very tight-lipped about what is likely to emerge or what is even happening within these negotiations. We've been given no access, and the Quai d'Orsay, the French Foreign Ministry, being cautiously optimistic about the fact that these talks are happening, but very unwilling to give any further access or comment as to the likelihood that they will succeed, Isa.",
