So that suggests that we might see a bit of a repeat of what we saw last time when Trump was essentially campaigning from the witness stand, criticizing the New York attorney general who was sitting in that room, and also criticizing a judge who was sitting just a few feet to his right. Trump, though, at that time did actually acknowledge that he had a role in the financial statements. He said that the banks did rely on them, but he said that he relied on the accountants to make sure that the numbers were right.So we can expect it to be pretty long day on Monday and probably with a lot of activity. You may remember the last time the judge had even told Trump's lawyers they needed to control their client or he would control him, essentially remove him from the witness stand. So you can expect the tensions to be high in the courtroom because the stakes are high for the former president with his reputation as a wealthy businessman and the future of his business in New York.

The entire edition of \"The Atlantic\" is dedicated to the danger of a future Trump presidency. Tom, help us decipher the rhetoric versus the reality here when it comes specifically to the military.TOM NICHOLS, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\":  Trump makes a great show of venerating the military in public. He talks about how much he loves the military and talks about his generals when, in fact, he actually has a deep disrespect for the military, as I point out in the piece. This is a guy who referred to the -- to America's war dead as losers and suckers. And he doesn't really understand, as John Kelly, four-star marine general, as John Kelly later said, doesn't understand anyone who has served their country honorably. What he does understand is the pomp and the parades and the salutes and sir, and he wants to use that force as his personal muscle. We know this. This isn't hypothetical. And I think one of the things to point out about all of the articles in this special issue of \"The Atlantic\" is that these were carefully written and fact checked articles based heavily upon Trump's said and done already. So the distance between his rhetoric and his actions when it comes to the military or anything else is getting really vanishingly small considering that he has already tried to do a lot of the things that we talk about. He has already tried to use the U.S. military against its own citizens. He talked about how he wishes that America's generals were as loyal to him as the Wehrmacht's officers were to Hitler. He really isn't kidding. As my colleague David Graham points out, he is not bluffing. And there are plans to gut any of the civilian civil service guardrails that are inside the Defense Department and the Justice Department and the rest of the government. So, in tandem, these are really dangerous things, and I think he is quite serious about not making the same mistakes twice.",

And then the constant idea that they are going to impeach the President but can't even elucidate what their case is or what their evidence is against President Biden is concerning. And I think that's something that we saw again and again and again during the Trump administration, and I think when people go to the ballot to make a choice, do they want to return to that kind of chaos, that kind of undermining of democracy, or do they want to move forward with a President who works incredibly hard to make sure America has the opportunity, that our standing in the world is strong.
