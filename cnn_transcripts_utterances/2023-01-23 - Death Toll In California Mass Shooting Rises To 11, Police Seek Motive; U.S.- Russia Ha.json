A young Chinese woman who took on the country's strict COVID policies posted video, if you are seeing this, I've already been taken by police, and now she is missing. There are other fears that other young women may also be targeted. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, 42 rounds. That is how many shots were fired in the Monterey Park mass shooting that left 11 dead inside a dance studio, according to a press conference that just wrapped up moments ago. The L.A. County sheriff was there and answered questions about the motive behind the horrific attack, including rumors that it was committed due to jealous, relationship issues. Here's what he said.

But what he was doing there was reporting allegations of fraud, theftand poisoning involving his family that are allegations from 10 to 20 years ago.

He says Florida's current standards for teaching black history are, quote, cut and dried history, and that multiple lessons in that particular course go too far.Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  We want education, not indoctrination. This course on Black history, what's one of the lessons about? Queer theory. Now who would say that an important part of Black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids. And so, when you look to see they have stuff about intersectionality, abolishing prisons, that's a political agenda. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's going to include not just history, but also art and humanities and politics and geography. So it's going to include a lot of topics that you would expect. We took a look at the syllabus. And there are things on it that you could expect in a course like this like civil war and Black communities, Black suffrage and women's rights, and civil rights leaders.It also includes exposing kids to things that they might not have had a chance to learn previously, like western African empires and black musical innovation. But there is a number of topics in the final section that the DeSantis administration has raised objections to, and this includes the topics that are things like Black feminism, Black queer studies, and reparations movement. And the DeSantis administration says the concepts and the writings in these sections overlap and intersect with critical race theory, which as you know has been banned in Florida, and also may violate a new state law which says you cannot teach that someone might be oppressed or privileged based on their race or color. So that's a small section of the course. Actually, just six topics in a course that's going to cover more than 100 topics over the course of a year, Erin.",

I would say the king of rock 'n roll, Little Richard was a Black gay man. I would say that the architect of the march on Washington, Bayard Rustin, a Black gay man.I would say one of the greatest minds of our generation, of our lifetime, James Baldwin, he was once asked by a reporter about the challenges he faced in his career growing up Black, impoverished and gay. And James Baldwin laughed and said \"I hit the jackpot.\" So the type of ignorance he is doing is nothing more, excuse me, than a political ploy. In my heart, Erin, it infuriates me because I have to defend my blackness. I have to defend my blackness to a very small man who ran great campaigns to be governor of Florida. I have to defend my blackness and my being. And that frustrates me. And the audacity of someone like Governor DeSantis, to come out and tell me what my history is and what can be taught to my children I believe is wholly unacceptable, but this is where we are, and these culture wars is where we are in American politics. BURNETT:  Well, and, Erick, that is something that DeSantis is well aware of, right? And making these sorts of statements and doing these sorts of things has worked for him. That's certainly what he is thinking it will now. ERICK ERICKSON, HOST, \"THE ERICK ERICKSON SHOW\":  Right. Keep in mind, so this is a draft program. This isn't the final program. The state of Georgia, where I am, has decided they're going to take a wait and see approach. If these remain in, they may not accept the program themselves. This is DeSantis. If they take these out, he gets a win with the right, another win. If not, he gets a win with the right for standing up to what more and people say see as a liberal agenda infiltrating schools. And he does this now before we have some sort of economic recession when he gets to pivot to the economy for general election voters, but he is locking in Republican votes against Trump right now.",

We can't lay down on these issues.We don't have to wade into every culture war, though, to answer your question. DeSantis is a very little man. Not literally, but figuratively as well. One of the things that we have to realize is right now he is waging a battle against Donald Trump. He is trying to win over these primary votes, as Erick said. But the unique thing about this party and what they're doing now is you're not hearing Ron DeSantis talk about pocketbook issues. You're not hearing him talk about inflation. You're not hearing him talk about conservative policies of a day that's gone by. Instead all he does is hit the same note. The problem is that Republicans have not proved themselves to be able to pivot back to these moderate voters in general elections. And that's the challenge he'll have.",

And DeSantis, behind the scenes, is already saying to people look at these things I got done, including against Tony Fauci who Donald Trump elevated, causing people to shift.

Behind closed doors, members can review classified documents, that of course in secured settings. And according to Dick Durbin, that occurs in settings that are overseen by someone who takes that document away after the senator has reviewed them. Bob Menendez, who chairs the foreign relations committee, another committee that Biden once ran when he was a senator, said the same thing to me. It's unclear how the president could have had that from his time in the office. So a lot of questions here about exactly what happened here.

House Oversight Chairman James Comer has asked for information from the archives, asking from the White House and today asking from the Secret Service to provide visitor logs of people who came to Joe Biden's house in Wilmington from the time of 2017 up until now. But the Secret Service did not actively monitor his house in the middle of 2017 when he was no longer in office. They did later when he became the presumptive Democratic nominee in 2020. They say they don't have those visitor logs, and the Justice Department not yet providing the information that they want about the special counsel that was appointed in this case.
