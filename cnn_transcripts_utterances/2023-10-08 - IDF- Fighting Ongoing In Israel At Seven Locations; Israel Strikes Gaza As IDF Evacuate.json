In the meantime, Israel has conducted series of strikes overnight on close to 500 targets in Gaza now, according to Israeli authorities.And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing that this is a war that Israel will win and saying that the enemy will pay an unprecedented price. Quite what that war looks like going forward and what the price will be in terms of further lives lost will only become apparent in the hours ahead. What is clear at this point is that there are dozens of Israelis -- and the IDF will not put a precise figure on it as they try and establish exact numbers. But dozens of Israelis, men, women, children, the elderly, they say rounded up in Israel and taken into Gaza as hostages.

Israel, obviously, will very actively be pursuing the return of their citizens. And this may be, Victor, a way in which we begin the process of negotiating on a broader set of issues. Because ultimately, I think this is a challenge both for the Palestinians, the Israelis and, obviously, American leadership to find a way forward here. This is a moment of momentous transformation.

They are going to work hand in glove over the course of the next several days, weeks, months, if necessary, in terms of supplying Israel what it needs and figuring out a path forward.

That would matter because that would make it easier to overwhelm Israel's missile defense system, the Iron Dome system, and make sure that some got through even if many were stopped. More importantly, by doing this, all indications are that laid the groundwork for what came next. At 7:40, an hour and 10 minutes later, that's when armed soldiers, fighters started coming out of Gaza into Israel. Some by knocking down walls and barriers here. Some coming in by air with powered parachutes, some by boats going around here. This was something, again, that indicated it was a very planned attack. And soon you saw people with rocket launchers and rifles running in the streets. They even went and engaged military bases where you would think they would expect the most opposition, gives an idea of their degree of planning and confidence as they went in to attack the Israelis. And, of course, we have seen those videos of the towns that have been raided near that area where we had reports of people being taken hostage and other people being killed.

And it is really an area where you can't go anywhere.So, even though the Israelis have different warnings to people, the area is basically blocked off. You know, some people call it an open- aired prison. And that is kind of what we have. We have a big refugee camp, big Palestinian refugee camp in Gaza. And that is a place where nobody can leave basically. And that is a difficult, difficult situation. People can't go anywhere, and the IDF is going to be forced to deal with people who are in essence cornered. And of course, cornered people are very dangerous. They fight back.

We call for an immediate cessation of senseless attacks and violence, which will only further increase tensions on the ground and seriously undermine Palestinian people's aspirations for peace. Now, on the regional front, there have also been a unified cause for a de-escalation to the violence. We've heard from the Turkish government, which has called for an end to the violence, but has also said that it stands ready to support any efforts to bring about peace and to ease tensions.

We know, of course, that the King of Jordan has been in touch with President Biden to discuss the ongoing situation.
