      "sentences": "Well, the Federal Reserve just slashed interest rates by a quarter of a point. This was the third straight interest rate cut and it was widely expected. This means that the Fed's key borrowing rate is now a full percentage point lower so than where it was back in September.And for borrowers, this is good news, right? Because it's going to be a little bit cheaper if you're carrying credit card debt, you're trying to get a car loan or perhaps even lower mortgage rates as well. But the bad news here is the Fed is signaling that they want to tap the brakes on interest rate cuts next year. That's because Fed officials just put out new projections where they are now penciling in only two interest rate cuts for 2025. That is down from the four cuts that they had been signaling back in September. So that means, yes, borrowing costs could still go lower, but perhaps not dramatically. So there was also some new language that was inserted into the Fed statement that signals that they may want to pause here because Fed officials now say that they will consider the, quote, \"Extent and timing of future rate adjustments\". In other words, don't just assume there's going to be another interest rate cut in January. Now, there's also some significant changes to the projections that were also just released that do help explain this thinking. Specifically, the Fed is now bracing for a little bit hotter inflation next year than in the past. They're now penciling in and projecting 2.5% inflation at the end of 2025. That is up from 2.1% that they had been expecting back in September. And that does help explain why the Fed is signaling they may want to pause here. There's also the fact that the economy continues to grow at a significant pace and the unemployment does remain low. There's also so much uncertainty about the agenda from the incoming Trump administration and whether or not tariffs and potentially deportations could actually make prices go higher. Later this hour, we expect to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell where he's going to take questions and he could drop some more clues about what's ahead next when it comes to interest rates.",

When I asked Powell back in September about this very issue, he pointed out that central banks around the world that are independent from the influence of politicians, they actually have lower inflation. So we should expect Powell to reiterate the importance of Fed independence and that they don't take orders from politicians.And he's made clear in the past that he would not step down even if the President Elect asked him to. Of course, the President Elect has also said in recent weeks that he expects that Powell will be able to serve out his term. Of course, a lot can happen over the next few months when it comes to how financial markets are going to react to the latest Fed moves, to the latest inflation readings and of course, the incoming policy changes from this administration.

Harry, this report is alleging witness tampering by Liz Cheney with star witness in the January six hearing, Cassidy Hutchinson. Is there any merit to their claim here? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: None that I can see. This is really brass knuckles stuff, Brianna. All they have is there were communications between Cheney over a signal line so they don't know the content. And Cassidy Hutchinson, that happens with witnesses in every hearing. And what happened here, if you may remember, is that she, Hutchinson initially had a lawyer paid for by the Trump Organization who had told her in her account not to be forthcoming. And then she got another lawyer and gave all kinds of details about January 6th about Mark Meadows and the like. So the idea here is that she was lying the second time when she gave the fuller account and that Congresswoman Cheney somehow was corruptly persuading her to do that. It's something that no self-respecting prosecutor would think about at the DOJ. But we have the full on Orwellian nightmare possibly that it's referring over and a Trump Bondi DOJ decides, well, maybe we will look into it and if nothing else make a lot of trouble for Liz Cheney.

So I think if they decided they want to do it, there would not be a legal impediment.It's really down the middle of the things we are afraid of now that the department is going to be taken over by loyalists to Trump who want to go after people who they thought were disloyal to him last time around, like Liz Cheney.",

Could they, however, investigate in a way to make trouble, make her pay a lot of money? That's always a secondary agenda that they can try to implement. And the answer there is they could.But yes, at the end of the day, this won't go anywhere. There's no chance she will be convicted of this charge, which requires that she somehow be trying to make Cassidy Hutchinson lie. So it's not going anywhere. But in the interim, could they make trouble expense for her dirtier up in the public? Yes, possibly.

It's a huge department that oversees Medicare, Medicaid, the CDC, the FDA and a number of other agencies.RFK Jr. told reporters that he'll be pressing Democratic senators for their support of his confirmation. He's been meeting with Republican senators this week and faced questions about several of his controversial positions. A known vaccine skeptic, Kennedy has also challenged Big Pharma and the corporate agriculture industry. Joining me now is Dr. Deborah Birx, who served as the coronavirus response coordinator in the first Trump White House. She is now a senior fellow at the Bush Institute and a professor at the Texas Tech University health Science Center. Dr. Birx, thank you so much for being with us. You've heard RFK Jr. He says here recently that he's all for polio vaccines, but the issue is really one, not just a being for a vaccine, but whether you believe it should be required. And a mandate is something that President Elect Trump has made clear he has issues with. And there's also this issue of where RFK Jr may stand on other vaccines. Do you have concerns about how much influence RFK Jr may have on public health policy based on his own beliefs? DEBORAH BIRX, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 RESPONSE COORDINATOR: Well, let's separate the two issues. Let's separate childhood vaccines from adult vaccines, because I think childhood vaccines has really proven how critically important they have been. In fact, many children today do not get a smallpox vaccine because through vaccination, we were actually able to eradicate smallpox. And that's what we were on our road to do with polio. And that's why they switched the polio vaccine from a live attenuated vaccine to a whole killed vaccine. And that is part of the controversy. But we're on our way, hopefully, to actually remove polio as an issue, and then we remove those vaccines when it's no longer an infectious disease threat. I think what President Trump and Robert Kennedy are speaking to about relevant to mandates is the whole issue of the mandate around the COVID vaccine. And I was really intrigued by Harry Enten's data that really showed how much hesitancy has gone up just in the last four years related to that mandate. And I worked epidemics all over the world. It's much more important to educate and listen to communities than it is to mandate, particularly around adult issues.",
