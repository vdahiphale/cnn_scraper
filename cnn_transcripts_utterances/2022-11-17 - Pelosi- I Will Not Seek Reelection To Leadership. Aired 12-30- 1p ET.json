      "sentences": "Yes, a really, a major moment here in American political history. Someone of course, who was the first woman to lead this institution, she did it twice, she won the majority once. She lost the majority, she won it back, they just lost the majority again, she decided here that it was time for her to step aside, as she said here, passing on the baton to the new generation, another and will undoubtedly set off a scramble about what the future direction of the Democratic Party will look like.And she didn't endorse any specific candidate to replace her. That will be one of the questions going forward as we start to assess what her departure will mean for her party. Now, we do expect probably as soon as today, that leadership race to kick off in earnest. It has been happening behind the scenes for some time, because there has been some expectation that this would be it for her, Pelosi, in order to secure the speakership a few years ago, had to cut a deal. She said that 2022 will be our last time at the end of that year, this year will be our last time as the -- leading her caucus, he never formally shut the door. She'd been lobbied by people like the president of the United States to continue staying on as leader she probably would have had the votes to stay on if she decided to do so. But there has been an expectation that it was time for her that she would ultimately step aside. So behind the scenes, people like Hakeem Jeffries, the New York Democrat has been talking to members, has been starting to secure some commitments for the job. He does have the support of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus. There's also the -- what happens to Pelosi's current number two, Steny Hoyer, someone who has been waiting in the wings for a couple of decades, waiting to take the reins. He has very close connection to the moderates in the Democratic caucus. But does he have the support? He's in his 80s. There are a lot of younger members who are looking for younger, new generation to take the torch. Now, it is also possible, John, we could see a top three, brand new top three in the Democratic caucus, beyond Hakeem Jeffries and number two Katherine Clark from Massachusetts, she is someone who's seen as a likely person to candidate run for the whip position. Also, Pete Aguilar, who's a member of the -- from California, those three members are seen as sort of a team that may run as sort of a block if you will. They have been talking to members seeing if they can get the support to eventually move up. But what happens to Steny Hoyer, what happens to Jim Clyburn who's currently a member of leadership. Clyburn told me earlier this week that he would not run for the top position, but once a position in leadership. So what does that mean for the other positions here? So it is not just a game of chess, it is also significant because the people in power will drive their strategy, their party, and their policy priorities, and could potentially bring them back to power in 2024 when Democrats will have a shot to regain the majority. But this moment, historic, the first woman house speaker stepping aside after two decades as the most prominent most dominant figure in our party but deciding now's the time to go.",

And it is a reminder, you're watching the, A, the diversity of the Democratic Party right before your eyes here, young and old, black, white and brown. But now Speaker Pelosi and her speech, Melanie noted that when she came to Congress in 1987, there were 12 women in the Democratic caucus, there are now more than 90, she said and she got a good laugh when she said and we want more.",

And the mark that she has left on the Democratic Party on all of Congress being the first female to lead either party is going to stay with her. I mean, I think we've talked a lot about the implications of what it means for the leadership if she leaves, but we should also talk about the implications of her staying on as a member of Congress and what that means. She's going to be an advisor.Obviously, we know Nancy Pelosi is a master tactician, and that's going to be hugely important for Democrats when they have a very small majority in the Republican House. They can have a lot of power. They can make Kevin McCarthy's life pretty miserable if they stick together. We expect that Nancy Pelosi will still be advising, you know, informally behind the scenes. And also if she had stepped aside completely, it would have meant there was a temporary vacancy with her seat and that would have made Kevin McCarthy's life a little bit easier in terms of getting the speakership and votes until that seat was filled. And then finally there was also the question of who would replace her. Christine Pelosi, her daughter is someone who is rumored to want to replace her in that seat if she had to do a special election. No less time to get her together. But she'll have now theoretically two years to mount a full out campaign, so just a ton of implications but a historic moment for Democrats here, John.",

I mean, we associate her with San Francisco liberalism, that's the image that she has in national politics. Her roots are in the Democratic Party of the New Deal era, when the core of the Democratic Party were blue collar workers, most of them white, many of them Catholic in urban centers, you know, it predates even the shift of African American voters predominantly, the Democratic Party.And her career has spanned the evolution of the party from that coalition to the one that she talked about, you know, that is more diverse than ever, with women with people of color, LGBTQ and, of course, more dependent on suburbs. So in many ways, she is kind of a living expression of how the Democratic Party has changed over the past 50 years roots in one era, you know, leaving at a moment when the other era is increasingly expressing itself. To that point, she said she was six years old when she first visited the House, that would be 1946 and talked about the New Deal era Democrats. And she talked about how she saw the dome and had the wow moment. And to this day, she says it's the most beautiful building to her in the world, not just because of how it looks but for what it represents. And then she made a point of noting, Audie, our democracy is majestic, but fragile. Even on the way out, she wanted to make sure she listed a few, make a few marks, if you will.",

And it's to your point about the idea of, can you manage the changes in your party? Can you figure out how to corral people in the big tent?

What happens to Jim Clyburn, a distinguished member of the Black Caucus, a man who is very close to the President of the United States, helped him very much in the 2020 primaries? So do you have a full generational shift in the Democratic Party? Or do you have a partial shift? That jockeying is just to begin. I just want to show our viewers, three leading contenders to move up now that Nancy Pelosi is stepping aside in the leadership.Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who has been a key Pelosi deputy, Katherine Clark, another key Pelosi deputy and friend, Pete Aguilar, one of the members of the California delegation for whom Nancy Pelosi is the both a leader and an example. The question is the Republicans are going to have, we don't know the final numbers, the Republicans are going to have a very small majority, perhaps three or four or five seats at the most. So there's an opportunity to get the majority back just two years down the road of the next election. So you're going to have new leaders who have to, A, on a policy and a political and an investigative level deal with a very aggressive House Republican majority, but also try to delay the building blocks of the next campaign.",

I mean, their strength is among Gen Z and millennials who passed the baby boomers and older in 2020, as a share of eligible voters for the first time. And in 2024, it will pass them in all likelihood as a chair of actual voters.

And Nancy Pelosi did beat him for it would very much like to have it. But the question is whether he's going to actually go for it and make that fight. If it looks like the majority of the caucus is going in a different direction. And there is a real hunger. The thing that's so interesting, though, is you know, because the three of them have been at the top for so long, she really is the fulcrum. It's kind of difficult to imagine the two of them, Hoyer and Clyburn, figuring out a way to stay on in the senior roles without her kind of holding things together, because the skill sets are just not the same, right?I mean, she did a lot of whipping. Clyburn is the whip but she did -- Nancy Pelosi did a lot of the whipping, you know, Steny Hoyer is the majority leader, leader, she did a lot of the mechanics of running the House that a majority -- not that they didn't do their jobs, but it was very much a team operation. And it's a little bit difficult to imagine how you take off the top member of that team and it stays intact. KING: Right, to that point, Manu Raju, if you're still with us, you mentioned at the top of the program, your conversation with the chairwoman of the Black Caucus in the House, who said that I wanted to out of respect wait to see what Nancy Pelosi said, but believe that every member of the Black Caucus would vote for Hakeem Jeffries? Do I read into that? I assume that James Clyburn, who has incredible influence among the fellow members of the Black Caucus had given his blessing to that. The question is, does he stay, you know, does he tried to stay as the number three? Or is he part of the transition?",

But it was definitely this week when I asked Clyburn, that question. And he said he hadn't this, he had not made a decision yet about whether to what position within leadership to seek. Now there is some expectation that perhaps that there could be some sort of ceremonial roles, some advisory role that Leader Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi have created in the system. Speaker role for him was essentially the number three position within the Democratic leadership. He's of course the Democratic whip.They'll -- whether there can be some sort of role like that an assistant leader position, we'll see. But we do -- it is it safe to say that those three members that you showed up on your screen, John, Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, Pete Aguilar are head and shoulders, the favorites to become the next, the next top three members of this Democratic caucus. That is the expectation among members. It's hard to see that changing even though they may have a challenge. And of course, there's a secret ballot election that will occur on November 30th.

Now, we will see whether President Biden will offer a more fulsome statement in the coming hours.But just a few weeks ago, he did hail Speaker Pelosi as quote the single best speaker, I think, in American history. And that is really also based on this relationship that you've seen between President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It's a relationship that they've cultivated for more than three decades serving alongside each other in the House and Senate. And then when Biden was vice president under President Obama, she served as house speaker and then once again, when he became president here. She has helped usher in so many pieces of legislation that have been critical to President Biden's agenda and also dating back to the Obama administration, if you remember her critical role when it came to the Affordable Care Act. So certainly, this is a bittersweet moment also for President Biden personally. They share so many common traits, both being Institutionalists. Also devout Roman Catholics, they were on hand together at the Capitol when Pope Francis visited back in 2015.

Well, we knew this was likely to happen today. We weren't sure how it was going to turn out. But we knew the speech was likely to happen.And to me the connective tissue in her career as children and China in the sense that she has always pushed programs to help children whether education programs, health programs that you heard her talk about as a mother and a grandmother and as a daughter of a politician.
