That was a standard procedure that was in place for the FBI search of that property, nothing out of the normal. It was even used in the search of Joe Biden's own home in Delaware. So, the prosecutors, they want this gag order on Donald Trump. Trump, his team says it's a violation of his rights. They're going to be arguing against it before Judge Cannon.

Secondly, the group that really matters is people in the middle who are unfavorable to both of them. Nothing is now new about Donald Trump. The verdict didn't bring out any new facts that anyone didn't know. So, if you're already unfavorable to him, you knew these things. But it does give him a rallying cry.

So, he's got to be -- I think he has to be restrained, as he has been throughout this process.But I would disagree with Brad in that I actually think this presents an opportunity for Biden. I think for these for these swing voters who are not going to be able to stomach the idea of voting for a convicted felon, for Biden to drive effectively, that this is somebody who has broken the law has been found guilty by a jury of his peers and use that to paint a bigger picture about Donald Trump and the fact that he only cares about himself, that he's willing to lie and cheat and steal to get what he wants that he cares about him. He doesn't care about you. I think Biden can use that as he's making this broader message.

Whether he needs to stay silent, you know -- obviously he's a candidate for president. So, the likelihood of him staying silent outside the courtroom is one thing.My concern more is him staying silent inside the courtroom. Because when he goes back on July 11th, the judge is going to say, before I sentence you, do you have anything to say? And I would hope I would recommend him to say, I rely upon the words of my attorney here.

And that was on purpose. That was who she was. She was a south sider. She was a Midwesterner. She didn't believe in putting on airs. And her real presence was felt, obviously, in the lives of her grandchildren and her daughter and her son-in-law. And that was the purpose for her coming down here, right, in Washington and coming from the south side of Chicago to make sure that those girls had a connection to Chicago and to sort of Midwestern values, to humility. You know. Oftentimes, you hear Michelle Obama impart lessons about motherhood that she learned from her mother. I would always think, you know, that I would love for Michelle Obama to write a book about the sort of wit and witticism that she learned from her mother about parenting young girls, particularly young girls who were in the spotlight. You know, she talked about this idea that she wanted her girls to know that they were special to her, to their families and to their friends, but they weren't special just because they were the daughters of a president. So, I think it's a little sort of down home African-American family values that resonated with so many Americans that Mrs. Robinson obviously brought to Washington, brought to the White House and brought to those girls' lives. I mean, this, I'm sure, is heartbreaking for Mrs. Obama, for her daughters, who are now women, and who owe a lot of their learning and the way in which they've navigated the world, not only to their mother, but certainly to their grandmother as well.
