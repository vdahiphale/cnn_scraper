Just into CNN, the jury in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting trial has reached a verdict on the question of whether the convicted gunman is eligible for the death penalty.Let's get right to CNN's Danny Freeman. He is outside Pittsburgh. Danny, can you tell us what the verdict is in the first phase -- a first of the sentencing phase?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, in the past 20 minutes or so, the jury came in, the judge read the verdict, and the -- and when it comes to this first part of the eligibility phase, Bowers -- Robert Bowers, 50-year-old, he is determined to be eligible to face the death penalty, that was the verdict that was handed down by this jury. It was unanimous.And I want to just breakdown exactly what we're talking about here. Normally, this whole sentencing phase is done in one part, because we've already seen that Robert Bowers was convicted of killing all those 11 congregants in the Tree of Life synagogue back in 2018, that happened a couple of weeks ago. Normally, this sentencing phase though, as I said though, takes one part. But the defense petitioned to have it split up into two parts, which is an eligibility phase and then a sentence selection phase. Well, this eligibility phase was all about three things, it was all about age. Is Robert Bowers over the age of 18, thus making him eligible for the death penalty? Were there aggravating factors in the shooting? Basically, did he kill someone who was either develop mentally challenged or elderly or other aggravating factors like that? And then the final part of this eligibility phase was this question of intent. Now, the defense was not going to contest ever that Robert Bowers was not over 18 years old. And the defense wasn't even going to contest that Robert Bowers committed crimes that were aggravating, that had these aggravating factors. They aimed, try and poke holes in this question of intent, and they did it by calling a number of witnesses over the past 11 days or so. Specifically arguing that Bowers was delusional, and that he had abnormalities in his brain. And those are reasons why he potentially went into that synagogue to committed this atrocity. While the prosecution said, no way Bowers did not suffer from delusions at all. He just believes repugnant things. And at this point, it appears that the jury agreed with the prosecution. So, now, Sara, we're going to be moving into the sentence selection phase. The jury has said that Bowers is eligible to receive the death penalty. Now, we're going to hear more likely victim impact statements, we're going to hear more witnesses to see whether or not the jury will ultimately decide to sentence Bowers to death. This trial, Sara, not over just yet. But again, five years in the making for this first part of the sentencing phase to be over at this point. Sara.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly what President Putin said that he didn't want to happen, and it's happened. And the unity of NATO if you hold, you know, a comparison between NATO and the other side of the border with Russia, Russia has cracks appearing.You had the mutiny under Prigozhin, the mercenary boss just a few weeks ago. You have a top Russian general apparently, it seems, relieved of duties in Ukraine after criticizing the military leadership in Russia for the way they are fighting war. Don't have the reparation, don't have the ammunition, don't have the counter- artillery battery, all that sort of thing. So, you really have this very strong juxtaposition. I think, there's also another very interesting, sort of, narrative that's going on here that perhaps wasn't quite intentional, but it emerge, that tension, obviously, where President Zelenskyy wanted more but didn't get it. Also, how upset President Biden and put him in a position where he can very well show and display to the world that he is not the one that's trying to push weapons into Ukraine. In fact, he is one of the voices that's perhaps slowing things up a little bit at NATO. And when the United States is sending its top diplomats, Janet Yellen just a couple of days ago. Secretary Blinken right now meeting with his Chinese counterpart, was in China a month -- in the last month. This narrative that the United States is not forcing this war. That the United States is not trying to rush weapons into Ukraine, which is what Russia is saying, this narrative in the conversation with China is hugely important as the United States tries to build more support for its position with the global south and with China. And convince China to -- ensure economically because that's a way to cut Russia off from its war in Ukraine. So, I think that that piece of the puzzle here is a very intriguing piece at a time when President Biden tries to deal with multiple threats around the world.",

Today, I took up the negotiations of our defense cooperation agreement. We are going to continue our security discussion by that. And that is of vitally importance to Finland. In the same time also Sweden and Denmark are having similar discussions, and at the end, it seems that all of the five Nordic countries will have a bilateral agreement with USA. Technology is one of the key words for the future. There are elements like artificial intelligence, quantum technology, sky technology. All that is leading our way to the future, and we have to make sure that it's leading our way in a very secure way, and that demands responsibility of those who know how and that is why it is very important to coordinate and to cooperate with our knowledge and resources forward in this sector. We also had discussion on our neighbor, and I think that we both share similar views. The war in Ukraine was also discussed. We both see that we will continue support to Ukraine, which is defending not only ourselves, but also all of the values we represent in the western World. We also had a meeting with the Nordic family. It is a tradition which start during President Obama's time and it has been a very valuable tool for us to get even better understand each other.
