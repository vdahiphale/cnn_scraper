The 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman appeared in a Boston Federal courtroom this morning. He has now been charged with allegedly being behind that massive leak of classified military documents. According to new detail from court this morning, Teixeira allegedly began posting the documents around December of last year.Teixeira was an IT specialist. And he entered the Air National Guard in September of 2019 and was recently promoted to the rank of Airman First Class. Let's get to the courthouse and find out what happened inside outside the courthouse is Jason Carroll for us in Boston. What are you -- what happened in court, Jason?",

As we headed down the street, I repeatedly asked if they had any comments at all about what it just happened with Jack Teixeira.They refuse to comment, kept walking down the street to find their car. In terms of what happened inside court. This was Jack Teixeira's first initial court appearance, appeared in front of the federal judge where he was read the charges that he's now faces including unauthorized retention and transmission of National Defense Information 793 under the Espionage Act, also number two unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and or material. Again, this happened during his initial court appearance. The judge overseeing the proceeding asked him if he understood the charges that he was facing very softly. He said yes. Also, we should just point out that during this, the affidavit with this particular case was unsealed as well, where we learned more information. Teixeira apparently holds the top secret security clearance that he was granted back in 2021. He had access to quote, highly classified programs since 2021. And this alleges that he began posting classified documents starting in 2022. And apparently he used a government computer to search a database using the term leak looking for that term. That was on April 6th, of course, after it became known in the public that someone was leaking classified documents. Throughout the proceeding, there was a section set up for family members, few people sitting there, two women, one of them were in purple, who you also saw exiting the courtroom who we were shouting questions at. At one point she was praying during the proceeding. She was crying during the proceeding as well. As it ended during its conclusion, a man also sitting in the front row shouted out, we love you Jack, love you jack. And then the defendant in this case, Jack Teixeira, did not look back that said, you too, dad. At that point, the judge in the case set a detention hearing. That's going to be for next Wednesday. But again, some dramatic moments inside court but even more dramatic moments outside court as these two women were leaving and lots of questions, shouted to them about if they had any comment about Jack Teixeira. They had none.",

You can't get into the building where he works without a secret or top secret clearance. Number two, the what he does, what he does is he's a cyber transport engineer. Basically, in English outside of the military nomenclature, that means he's a network engineer. So in this classified facility that's launching drones, conducting surveillance and overseas theaters, supporting soldiers Special Operations Unit, back in this base where kids are sitting, you know, I used to call them kids, were 20 something year old soldiers are sitting in dark rooms controlling these drones. There are a team of people who keep those systems running. And because of that, they need access wide access to those systems. If there's a glitch, they have to go in and straighten it out.

Was he working for a Foreign Intelligence Service, things like that, you know, that took a few more days for them to do.

We saw car sales, down 1.6 percent. Year over year, just up a little bit.We saw electronics on the decline down 2.1 percent, year over year, down 10.3 percent. That's significant year over year. And then groceries, this is where people really feel it day to day. Groceries down point 1 percent, that's good. But year over year, still spending a little more than they are used to or are comfortable with. Gas prices also on the decline month over month and year over year, partly because gas prices have fallen over the last year. And this is the one place where we really saw a jump in spending by consumers, food services and drinking places. This is a sign that people really still want to go out. This is where they want to put their money, their spending up about 0.1 percent month over month, and up 13 percent year over year. People want to spend to go out. And this is coming on the heels of two inflation reports that we saw this week, consumer spending and producer prices. Those were down. This all put together these retail sales and those two reports signify that maybe just maybe the Federal Reserve is sort of hovering over the territory of a soft landing. That's their goal.

I mean, state budgets, our country budgets are under pressure in a lot of different places. And baby boomers who are ready to retire want their piece of the pie.
