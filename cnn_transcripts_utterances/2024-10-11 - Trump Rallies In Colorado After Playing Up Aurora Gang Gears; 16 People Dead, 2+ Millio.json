      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.Only 25 days until Election Day, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are out west, making pitches to voters in this excruciatingly tight race. Trump right now is speaking at a rally in Aurora, Colorado, making immigration his number one issue, Trump, just last Sunday told the Wisconsin rally crowd that even though polls suggest that the economy is the number one issue for voters he disagrees, he thinks the number one issue is border security. And today's rally location, Aurora, Colorado, is quite intentional. He's there to amplify the debunked internet rumor that claims violent Venezuelan migrant gangs have taken over the town of Aurora. Now to get you up to speed on the reality, footage from August at an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado showed men carrying guns, walking down hallways, followed by several women and small children. This image spread on social media with Trump supporters claiming it showed Venezuelan gangs taking over an entire apartment complex. Now the buildings owner appeared to verify that then the city said that in fact, it was the substandard housing conditions maintained by that landlord that were to blame, not the migrants themselves. Local police in aurora have encountered gang activity tied to a Venezuelan gang, but they have rejected theories that gangs have taken over any city buildings, much less the entire city of Aurora. Even the city's Republican mayor and former Congressman Mike Coffman says, quote, the overstated claims are simply not true. Coffman tells CNN that 10 men associated with this Venezuelan gang have been identified and all but one of them has been arrested separately. He says six armed men seen in a viral video have all been identified and one has been arrested. We have asked the city to find out the immigration status of those individuals. We do not know as of now. Trump, of course, has been leaning into other dark immigration rhetoric. This campaign, including the outrageous lies about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, which has been completely debunked by the governor the mayor, the member of congress, and many, many others in Springfield, Ohio. CNN's Kristen Holmes is at the Trump rally in Aurora, Colorado, for us. Kristen, what is Trump saying about all of this today? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jake, you're saying exactly what we expected them to. This rally is all about the fact that he wants to shine light on Aurora, Colorado, and the fact that it has been a city that has been overtaken by Venezuelan gangs. Of course, as you mentioned, we've heard pushback from lawmakers, the governor, the mayor, all saying that this is a gross exaggeration of what happened. But here's what Donald Trump said when he opened up his rally just a few moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: In Aurora, multiple apartment complex flexes have been taken over by the savage Venezuela prison gang known as Tren de Aragua. Your law enforcement and law enforcement all over the world, they know them all over the world. They're savage gang. One of the worst in the world, and they're getting bigger all the time because of our stupidity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Not surprise -- this won't be the last time he does. He'll pick another city. I do want to point out where he's doing it though. He's not doing it in battleground states, though. He does it in Ohio. He does it in Colorado. And that's strategic because he knows how much attention is being placed in battleground states and voters would push back on that, but presidential campaigns are not really have a large -- having a large footprint in Ohio or in Colorado. But there is a Senate race in Ohio that he's hoping will go against the Democrat. So he is there team is very strategic on this, but it is a dishonest attempts.",

BRYAN LANZA, SENIOR ADVISER TO TRUMP 2024 CAMPAIGN: Listen, he's never lost sight of the advantages of legal immigration. Trump's complaint has always been about illegal immigration.
