It's the latest high profile appearance as he works to reassert his authority after last weekend's rebellion by Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.On Wednesday, Mr. Putin visited the Dagestan region in southern Russia where supporters gave him an enthusiastic welcome during the uprising. Meanwhile, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports Yevgeny Prigozhin had plans to capture Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Army General Valeriy Gerazimov. But he abandoned the idea after Russia's Federal Security Service found out and decided to march on Moscow. A European intelligence official tells CNN there were hints that the Russian military or security services knew about the planned revolt and might have wanted it to succeed. More now from CNN's Alex Marquardt. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN SR. U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: With Yevgeny Prigozhin now believed to be in Belarus, questions still remain about what his ultimate goals were when he undertook his insurrection over the weekend. A U.S. official tells CNN that the Biden administration does not have a clear understanding of what Prigozhin's real intentions were. This after CNN reported that U.S. intelligence did assess that Prigozhin was going to mount a rebellion after moving troops, equipment and weapons. On Wednesday, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that as part of his insurrection, Prigozhin had intended to capture the defense minister Sergei Shoigu and the top general Valeriy Gerasimov, whom he'd been railing against for months. The Russian internal security services, the FSB, reportedly picked up on his plans and they were foiled. So, Prigozhin launched his mutiny early, first taking over the military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, and then his troops continued their march towards Moscow. Now, a senior European official tells me that Prigozhin did seem to be targeting Shoigu and Gerasimov, but that still does not explain Prigozhin's continued march on Moscow when that plan failed, nor his sudden turnaround on Saturday. There is speculation that Prigozhin thought that some in the Russian military and security services would join his rebellion, but that didn't happen, nor did much Russian military resistance materialize before Prigozhin struck a deal and agreed to go to Belarus. was averted, many questions remain unanswered.

He holds  virtual meetings. You'll remember that extra long table from the days of the COVID-19 pandemic. So seeing him there in his shirt sleeves, shaking hands, getting among the people was pretty unusual.Clearly, I think, another sort of sign of the length the Kremlin is going to reassert his authority, but also perhaps a bit of counter- pro- programming to the support that we saw in Rostov for those Wagner fighters as they left that city. [03:05:17] Putin perhaps trying to garner some of that sort of populist fervor show that he is in amongst the people and can just like people like Prigozhin, perhaps even President Zelenskyy of Ukraine also be someone approachable to his population. That's part of it. Dagestan perhaps also carefully chosen. This is a city, an area of Russia where we saw quite a lot of protests, particularly to the partial mobilization of Russian civilians, reservists back in the autumn. So perhaps he's chosen that to try and regain some support from there. I think though you can't assume even with events over the weekend that he has lost a lot of support. Frankly in Russia, the people don't have a clear alternative and if he is able to bring back even an element of stability he will be able to regain a fair amount of support among his people.",

I think two things. One, that shows that there was perhaps an element of chaos in the way this whole thing was conducted from Prigozhin's side, that he had to change his plans, that things weren't quite executed as he had wanted. And I think, secondly, the suggestion that we're getting from the speeches and comments from Vladimir Putin and those around him is that he is not over this yet, despite officially Russia having dropped the charges of rebellion against the Wagner group that he may be looking for a way to make someone pay for this.

And Putin's got more tools in his toolkit to keep that circle small and keep Prigozhin sidelined.So Prigozhin is gonna have to figure out how to pick up the pieces now that his Wagner group is going to be dismantled and reassembled in other ways and that his enterprise, that's one of his most lucrative sources of income now is going to dry up. He's going to have to figure out how to proceed without being able to lean on his enterprises in St. Petersburg. And also he may be facing some corruption charges that Putin may be lining up for him in the future. So, Prigozhin's future is very cloudy and very limited, but I think his days of being a major actor and being able to wield any political influence is going to be fairly limited. Lukashenko, I think, comes out to be somewhat of a winner in this. He was in the right spot at the right time, was able to communicate with Putin and Prigozhin and potentially he may have helped both sides come to an agreement that avoided a major bloodbath that would have been bad for Russia, would have been bad for both parties and let Putin save a little bit of face and deal with Prigozhin later without having to kill a whole lot of Russians.",

According to French authorities, dozens of buildings, including schools, were set on fire. Dozens of cars were set alight and at least 24 police officers were injured. French authorities responded by arresting at least 150 people. But today there are more events planned, including a march for justice that's been called by the victims family. The 17 year old boy Nile, who was shot by police officers, his mother has called for this planned rally to take place today. I want to take a step back though, Rosemary, and just remind people here of the wider context. Yes, there have been repeated calls for calm from the French president. He has described the shooting death of this 17-year-old boy at the hands of police officers at this traffic stop. Of course, with that very dramatic social media video, the French president has described that as unjustifiable. He has called for calm in order for justice to take place. But French police have long been accused, particularly by communities of color, of systemic racism, of bias and discrimination, particularly when it comes to traffic stops, rights groups have many cases and many examples and have published many times about this issue, about the issue of ethnic profiling by police during traffic stops. So the death of this 17-year-old boy is absolutely not in isolation. It is within the wider context of these longstanding tensions and just calls for calm and calls for justice might not be enough to satisfy those demonstrators on the streets.",

But as the accumulation of heat in your body increases, as the amount of time you spend on the heat increases, you can actually develop heat stroke, which can be fatal.Heat can affect cardiovascular issues. It can affect respiratory issues like asthma. It can even bring on preterm labor in pregnant people. So there are a number of different health effects that we see, but heat can also affect things like our infrastructure. Rails for railroads, for example, can deform or buckle when it's extremely hot. Planes can't take off when it's extremely hot. And outdoor workers who keep our societies running with construction projects and maintenance could be particularly affected by the heat. So it's a number of different things that we worry about when we see heat waves like we're experiencing right now in the Southern U.S. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just after sunrise in the Japanese countryside. No alarm clock needed. The Yokobori family feeds their flock of chickens, feeding themselves freshly laid eggs. French toast for breakfast, bread baked on a wood burning stove. Wood they chopped from cedar forests surrounding their home. 10 years ago, Miho was an office worker in Tokyo. Today, she's a homemaker. Former graphic designer, Hirohito, now a woodworker. The couple runs a small bed and breakfast. For them, city life lost its luster in 2011. Japan's massive earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown paralyze Tokyo.

Nearly every local government in Japan predicts a lower population and higher average age by 2045. Entire villages on the verge of extinction.
