I mean, Melissa, we were - we were looking at this yesterday. We were looking at what Macron has been saying. He's essentially arguing that it's going to be worth it. That if -- he is going to shoulder this unpopularity. What are people on the streets saying about his comments?",

Emanuel Macron, the French government, making it clear that for reasons of public finances, this is a necessary move.But people out there are still pretty upset by it. It is more than 70 percent of French population that are against it. The unions are united. We're expecting huge crowds on the streets of Paris. But also across the country. And what we've seen these last few weeks, Kaitlan, there are sometimes more than a million people taking to the streets to make their displeasure known. It's, of course, nationwide strikes once again. There are images this morning coming from Charles de Gaulle Airport showing the blockage there. They've taken to the oil refineries and already what we're starting to see is people running out of petrol at the gas pumps, queues forming there as well. And it is these nationwide strikes with which the unions intend to really make France as ungovernable as they can for the coming future. As far as the law itself goes, Kaitlan, it's going through. It only has to pass one last constitutional hurdle, and that is that the constitutional council, which will rule on its constitutionality, but it has been pushed through parliament without a vote. And beyond the fact of the unhappiness that's out there about the raising of the age from 62 to 64, there's the question of how it's been pushed through parliament. And I think that's really finished to make people quite angry. And so we expect huge crowds on the streets of Paris and across the country once again today, Kaitlan.",

This is just part of the fallout from overturning Roe versus Wade and the Supreme Court's lurched to the right. So, how did we get here? Or senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic, has the inside story in her new book, \"Nine Black Robes.\" For five years she's been working on this, looking at Donald Trump's impact on the high court, three appointments in just four years. She talked to more than 100 insiders, including most of the justices themselves. Here's one big scoop in the book that has led to a lingering distrust among the justices. Chief Justice John Roberts' administrative team ordered the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg's office cleared out within days of her memorial service, and that is not how it usually works. She also reports that RBG's death had an impact on virtually every major legal issue that this court has heard since. Joan is here. Before we talk, Joan, congrats on the book. Just incredibly rave reviews. All right, let me just read some. Court watchers and civil rights activists alike will find this essential -- and disturbing - reading. Another review saying, it is an up-to-the-minute laser focused examination of the court -- devoted court watchers will devour this behind the scenes expose. I can tell you, I did, too. I got an early copy with a million notes in its. It's fascinating. Joan, congratulations.",
