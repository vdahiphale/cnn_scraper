Officials say this is what happened on the north side of Lafayette Square at 16th Street. That's part -- that part is directly across -- that park is directly across from the White House. During a search of that truck, officials found a flag that appears to show a swastika. They also found a backpack and duct tape among other items. Officials say the man was arrested on several charges, including threatening to kill, kidnap or inflict harm on a president, vice president or family member. Much more to come on this. John.",

The company filed a federal lawsuit over Montana's new law that would ban the Chinese-owned app. TikTok says, among other things, the move violates the U.S. Constitution, including the First Amendment. Starting in 2024, the law would impose a fine of $10,000 per day on TikTok or app stores that make it available to personal devices within that state. Supporters are worried that the Chinese government could use the app for spying purposes. Legal and technology experts say there are challenges for Montana or any state to enforce such a ban, even a law -- if the law is allowed to stand. The way the internet functions, the way that this stuff works is it makes it impossible to keep TikTok out of the hands of users.So, this morning, a new warning from the surgeon general that social media creates a, quote, profound risk of harm for children. Those stark words come in a 25-page advisory that examines the mental health impact of social media. CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell is with us now. Profound risk of harm. Those are pretty - pretty stark words.",

He said basically parents are looking for answers here and there's not enough data to say this is safe for kids.And it's scary when you think about the ubiquity of social media among kids and teenagers. Ninety-five percent of kids age 13 to 17 say they use social media. And even through 13 is the minimum age to get on many of these platforms, the study says that 40 percent of kids down to age eight are using social media. And so while they do say there are some benefits like creating communities, particularly for marginalized kids, they point to a lot more potential risks, like anxiety and depression. Kids not getting enough sleep, experiencing abuse or harassment online and, of course, low self-esteem where we've seen a lot of studies as well. So, they're calling on policymakers and technology companies to step up here more. And particularly for the tech companies to share more data about what they're seeing.",

Here we're going to show you -- we're going to put it up full to make sure you can see it and we're spotlighting it there. You can see a child being pushed over the wall, hanging on for a moment, and then falling to the ground. Another child then tries to help and - help them up. Then another individual climbs over and picks the child up. But there's a lot more here. Let's go to CNN's Rosa Flores. She has much more on this.

So much so that U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air Marines operation, they responded via helicopter to provide cover while these first responders were trying to render aid to this child. Now, we don't have a lot of details about this four-year-old other than from a tweet. The Border Patrol chief saying that this child is OK, but, of course, we've asked about the condition of the child and also the location of the child to see if there were any updates. And there are no updates at this point, Kate. But we do know that Customs and Border Protection continue to investigate with the help of Mexico. Mexico is also investigating because the gunfire was coming from the Mexican side. Kate.",

Now, Kate, that's about a 70 percent drop from the 10,000 migrant encounters that they were seeing in the lead up to the end of Title 42.Now, of course, the big question is why. Why are these numbers still dropping? And what I'm hearing from sources and contacts, there's a few things. First, that the Mexican law enforcement has upped enforcement in Mexico. They're returning migrants deeper into Mexico. I'm also hearing that migrants are still waiting on the Mexican side. A lot of them waiting for that CBP 1 app, to get an opportunity to go into a port of entry. And also that there is a spread on social media of the kind -- legal consequences of crossing the border. And, Kate, you and I have discussed this, that includes a five-year bar of re-entry into the country. And so the big takeaway here, Kate, is, will we see more of these cases of more extreme risks taken by migrants.",

And according to the ministry, he fell ill on a plane flight Saturday and died. His family said that his death may have been related to a heart condition, but an autopsy is scheduled for tomorrow. A journalist who says that he'd been in touch with the minister, though, says that the minister feared for his safety in Russia and that he called the war in Ukraine a, quote, fascist invasion. He was returning from a business trip to Cuba at the time of his death.UNICEF says that more than 1.9 million children are at risk of dying from severe malnutrition in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. The United Nations - the U.N. agency says that it is an unprecedented large-scale crisis of hunger that is unfolding before our eyes. And it also claims that the climate crisis is making the situation worse as these areas have suffered one of the worst droughts in 40 years. Now, millions of people in Mexico, they are keeping a very wary eye to the sky because of this. They may be forced to evacuate as the country's most dangerous active volcano roars back to life once again. The volcano, which is in the central part of the country, has been spewing ash over several nearby towns since last week. And the ash has caused flight delays in Mexico City and caused authorities to close schools in dozens of towns. About 25 million people live in a 60-mile radius of the volcano. John.",

And also just about a month ago his appeal to serve this pretrial detention time at home, on house arrest, was rejected by the court. And so that's why he has been in jail. What we're watching for today is to see what kind of access journalists are given to this court trial. We don't know if there are going to be journalists who are allowed inside. Last time cameras were allowed inside so they could see him. We could see him speaking. We could see him actually understanding the Russian saying he didn't need translation because he's fluent in Russian. And the other thing we'll be watching for is if they allow the U.S. diplomats to be in the courtroom as well. We know they'll try and show up, but there hasn't been, obviously, much of a great relationship between Russia and these diplomats in recent weeks and there's a lot of tension there. U.S. officials really pushing to have access to Evan Gershkovich. And then you have Paul Whelan, that other American who's wrongfully detained in Russia, he just spoke exclusively earlier this week on the phone with CNN, and he said that he's confident that U.S. officials are pushing for his release but he is really asking them to push along more quickly because he wants a deal to secure his release and, of course, Evan Gershkovich's release as well.",
