Most of the time we see candidates do these announcements in their hometowns or somewhere else of political significance. But he will be joining Elon Musk in a Twitter Spaces chat. We have been told this will be unscripted and there will be a Q&amp;A and an opportunity to sort of engage with the audience. And then from there DeSantis will speak on FOX News later tonight.

June 1st, Janet Yellen's earliest estimate, you just heard from Mark Zandi at Moody's and many others who say there is no reason to disagree with her. That's the earliest possible date that the U.S. bank account goes below zero. Moody's has a scenario that's more like June 8th because of tax receipts that could be coming in and maybe some more moving of money around that the treasury can do until then. The best case scenario, August 8th.So what's the problem here? We are running out of money pretty quickly. A year ago, that cash balance was more like 800 to $900 billion. Right now it's sitting at $68 billion. And $68 billion, keep that in the back of your mind, June 1st we have Medicare payment of $47 billion and on the 2nd we have a $25 billion Social Security payment. That's $72 billion. I can add more here. We have another $2 billion for Medicaid and we'd have another $12 billion for veterans benefits. All of that will be going out the door the first two days of the month. So that's the kind of math that we're facing here. You are going to get tax receipts on the 15th but that's on the 15th. That's why so many people are worried about the first week in June, you guys.",

We don't know for sure because California, Alabama, and Georgia tax collection there has been delayed because of bad weather and natural disasters. You have got corporate money coming in. So maybe that gives you a chance to get to June 30th. What happens on June 30th? There are more extraordinary measures thetreasury secretary can do, if you can get that long, and that is the spending investments into some federal retirement accounts. That could free up maybe $145 billion. But on June 30th you have $98 billion in payments due, including $12 billion in interest. You cannot miss that payment. That's how you can squeak by, by finding every nickel in the couch cushions until you get there. If everything absolutely goes right, maybe, maybe there is a one percent chance you could get to early August. This is why the June 1st deadline is so important. It is prudent to plan for running out of money at that time. That's when the treasury has to decide whether to prioritize paying its bills, whether to delay paying Social Security recipients, whether to delay playing military contractors, maybe who is going to feel the pain first.

They tweeted about that photo, and they said this happened yesterday, but they're just now tweeting it out this morning. This man was from Florida, 32 years old. He was found trespassing on preschool grounds in McLean, Virginia that is only about a mile away from the CIA.This man as name is Eric Sandow said that he was -- he was -- he told police he was headed to the CIA and so Fairfax County Police they arrested him and detained him. Execute a search warrant on his car and that is when they found those weapons. You can see an AK-47, a smaller handgun and tons of ammunition. Truly, truly frightening here, to know this man really was only a few minutes from the CIA. But also, he was on the grounds of a preschool and given, you know, the number of terrible gun violence incidents in America over the years. This is just truly chilling. Poppy, Kaitlan?",

      "sentences": "No, it certainly isn't. And I think this is a day that many of the family members here, you know, have been dreading, have said that it's going to be a tough day, a day where it brings them back to what happened here a year ago. And part of what makes it so difficult for them is that they haven't had any kind of closure. So many questions still remain, so much of the accountability that should have already occurred, has not occurred.And at every turn, they're just stonewalled, or they're told, we're still investigating. And we still don't have answers for you. And just a couple of days ago, some of the family members of the children who died, the parents and other family members came here to go inside the school for the first time since this happened. And they described just a very sterile kind of scene, and much of the rooms have been cleaned out, a lot of the desks are gone, and many of the places in these rooms where their kids took their last breaths. They were able to stand there and just think about their kids and what their kids went through. They still don't exactly know what happened in those moments. But for today, many of them, it'll be a way to have some unity where we don't see that in this community. This is a community that is very much divided over what should be -- what people should be doing, whether or not to move on, whether or not to keep remembering this. So, for many of the family members certainly, this is going to be a day where they're going to try to have some kind of moment together, it's kind of reflect on their loved ones and those that they've lost. But obviously, moving on and having any kind of closure, we're nowhere, nowhere near that.",
