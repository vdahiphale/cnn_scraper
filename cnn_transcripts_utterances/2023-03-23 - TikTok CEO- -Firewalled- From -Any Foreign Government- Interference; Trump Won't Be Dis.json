They have been really grilling the CEO about privacy concerns, data protection concerns and, of course, about the concerns about ByteDance, which is the parent company, the Chinese parent company of TikTok.But look, the CEO made a lot of points there to try to rebut these national security concerns. And chief among them is what he described as a project called Project Texas. Now, that has been TikTok's main apparatus through which they have tried to convince lawmakers and the American public writ large that the user data that TikTok is collecting on U.S. users will not be routed outside the United States. And what he said is that TikTok has built a firewall to shield U.S. user data from unauthorized foreign access. And that that data is now being stored on servers in the United States hosted by Oracle, which is an American company. And so, basically what he is saying is that U.S. user data is going to be stored by default and currently is on U.S. servers on U.S. soil. And that that data is essentially under lock and key by an American company hosted by American employees. And so, that is his main argument here with regard to the national security concerns the privacy concerns. However, the Democratic Ranking Member of the committee said, just in response to those comments that he does not believe that that is going to go far enough. Now, he did not explain why he thinks that storing U.S. data on U.S. servers is going to prevent -- is not going to prevent American data from being sold to the Chinese or access to the Chinese, for example. But there seems to be some kind of, you know, in this sense on this committee that TikTok is not going far enough to protect American user data and that it could pose a serious national security threat, given that ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance. Now, of course, he's still trying to alleviate those concerns, but it does not seem like lawmakers, right now, anyway, are buying it.",

But it does mean that the next time that this grand jury sits is Monday, and that is when they -- it's possible they will hear more testimony. Sources have told us that the D.A.'s office is considering bringing in another witness. And it's also the first time this grand jury, if the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, decides to move forward with an indictment would be able to vote on that indictment. So, it's going to be quiet down here the next couple of days. But then back on Monday, we'll be back on grand jury watch and looking to see if there is another witness.

He also says that the proper place for this to be challenged, if Donald Trump is charged, is in the courts. Not through Trump's allies in Congress.So, a pretty starkly worded letter pushing back. But he does say, look, we will meet and confer with you and get to the bottom of what it is the committee wants to look at. And he's saying he wants to, you know, offer the opportunity if they have a real legislative purpose and asking for information.

There were those that Donald Trump may have been the one who fanned the flames here. Who said that there could be an indictment earlier this week, that doesn't look like it's going to happen. They won't meet again. The grand jury on Trump until Monday. How do you read this? MICHAEL MOORE, PARTNER, MOORE HALL IN ATLANTA AND FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, I'm glad to be with both of you. It looks to me like this just gives Trump an extra few days to operate the cash register. He's using this to make money. He's using these threats to reach out to donors. He's already, you know, cloaking himself in the -- as the martyr in the case. And so, it's just more time. You know, there's nothing particularly unusual about a grand jury taking some period of time. And this may simply be a scheduling matter. This could be a witness that couldn't be available or a lawyer representing a witness that had another court appearance and didn't come today but could come next week. Nothing particularly odd in that, you know. I'm more concerned, more interested in, sort of, the leaks of when it may happen and how it may happen and what they're considering. I think that plays into Trump's hand a little bit, and I'd like to see it just sort of everything on the on the quiet and then suddenly that they're going to pop up with an indictment. Let them do it. But again, nothing particularly odd about needing to reschedule, except that it does give more time for Trump and his representatives and his team to continue to make this out as if somehow, you know, he's being victimized, and so he would -- he needs to be supported. He's just talking on the megaphone that he's been handed.",

So, when we're looking at the classified documents probe here, the fact that a judge has now ordered -- has said, yes. In fact, Evan Corcoran, you do -- the president's attorney. You do have to, former presidents attorney, you have to testify tomorrow now that attorney-client privilege is waived here. This is, by my understanding, from every attorney that I have spoken to in the last 24-36 hours. This -- rare is an understatement, in terms of how often this would happen. Help us understand what would be -- what would he be asked about at this point. Does this mean all attorney-client privilege is waived here or are there very specific parameters as to what can be discussed with that testimony will be about?",

I mean, on the one hand, he's either got to come forward and say, I knew the -- this letter of representations that were made was false when I made it, that's bad on him, or he's got to come forward and say, I didn't really know. I just did what I was told, that also was bad on him.And so, that's a -- he's in an odd spot. My guess is that the judges got to keep the testimony fairly limited around those things that may affect obstruction. You know, he won't be allowed to give testimony about things that happened years ago or advice he may have given to the former president at some point unrelated to the documents case. But it will be limited in that way because really, attorney-client privilege is so sacrosanct. And there's great care by the courts to protect that. A great care by lawyers to do it. I do think the documents case and the federal case, to me, is such a stronger case, especially, we're looking at what the special counsel is doing than this case in New York. And so, I would hope and I sure do wish that the delay in New York was actually going to allow the special counsel to move forward first. I hate to see a case that might not be the strongest case pending with a case that makes the law and sets the tone for the rest of the cases around the country. You know, weak cases can make bad law, yes, for the for the remaining cases, ever stronger cases. And so, you know, we're kind of running a horse race to see which ones coming. And I would suggest that the Jack Smiths (ph) might be the horse to ride in the race.",
