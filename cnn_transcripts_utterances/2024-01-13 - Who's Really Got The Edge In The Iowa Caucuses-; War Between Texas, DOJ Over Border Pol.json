SMERCONISH: Elliot, something else that I took away from your data, the December numbers, the December numbers historically have been predictive of what happens in Iowa.

So if you do this math backwards, right, we think Nikki Haley needs to gain about 35 percentage points in the national polls to be tied with Donald Trump, that would suggest she needs to beat her target -- her polls in Iowa by about 35 percentage points as well. Needless to say, that is a very tall task for her.I don't see the path forward for her with that level of a potential bounce needed to be -- to be ahead of Donald Trump.

In December, there were more than 300,000 migrant encounters on the U.S. southern border or roughly the population of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This week, the Texas military department enlisted the National Guard to block the U.S. Border Patrol from accessing two and a half miles of the U.S. Mexico border on the Rio Grande. The state had seized control of the area and put up fencing and razor wire under an emergency declaration signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott.By way of explanation, Abbott who has shipped 10s of 1000s of migrants to Democratically run cities posted on X, \"We are making clear the Texas will be a tough place to cross.\" In response to the DOJ petition the U.S. Supreme Court writing, \"Texas's new actions demonstrate an escalation of the state's measures to block Border Patrol's ability to patrol or even to surveil the border and be in a position to respond to emergencies.\" And ask the court to, quote, \"restore border patrol's access to the border it is charged with patrolling and the migrants it is responsible for apprehending, inspecting and processing.\" Meanwhile, in New York City, the overwhelming number of asylum seekers needing to be housed led to one Brooklyn high school having to switch its students to remote learning so that their high school building could house nearly 2,000 migrants due to bad weather. On Trump's Fox News town hall Wednesday, he said this about the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are going to have the largest deportation effort in the history of our country. We're bringing everybody back to where they came from. We have no choice. (END VIDEO CLIP) SMERCONISH: Meanwhile, California just became the first state to offer health insurance to all undocumented immigrants under a new expansion of Medi-Cal spearheaded by Governor Gavin Newsom. All low income residents qualify regardless of immigration status, including an estimated 700,000 adults aged 26 to 49 living in the state illegally. Now back to Texas. There was this written in a recent column in the Houston Chronicle, \"The Texas GOP border crisis plan includes secession, surrender and stunts instead of solutions.\" Chris Tomlinson wrote those words and added, \"Abbott is right about one thing, the entire nation must help with the migrants allowed to remain in the United States pending the resolution of their asylum claims. Eagle Pass has a population of 39,000, Del Rio with 34,000 residents cannot accommodate so many families.\" But he adds, \"The governor diminishes his good deed by turning desperate migrants into political pawns.\" Chris Tomlinson joins me now.

Thursday and then again on Friday coalition forces struck targets across more than two dozen locations of the Houthi sect backed by Iran, killing five and wounding six. President Biden said that he ordered the strikes -- quote -- \"in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.\"Yemen sits at the opening to the Red Sea, a crucial shipping corridor, and Yemen is where the Houthis have been fighting a civil war against a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia. For weeks, the Houthis have been launching drones and missiles at commercial vessels in the Red Sea claiming that it's in solidarity with the Palestinian people. The aim is inflicting economic pain on Israel's allies to increase pressure on Israel to cease its military offensive in Gaza, post October 7th. The coalition strikes were condemned by several leaders across the Middle East. The president has now called the Houthis a terrorist group, but said yesterday that it's irrelevant whether they'll be formally designated as such. Biden had de-listed the Houthis as a terrorist group in February of 2021. He says that he will not hesitate to direct further measures as necessary -- quote -- \"to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce.\" Joining me now is retired Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula.

DAVID DEPTULA, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Well, Michael, the Houthis are an Iranian-backed Shia political and military organization and they've been fighting a civil war in Yemen since 2014 against a coalition that has been backed by Saudi Arabia. They currently control much of northern Yemen and the capital, Sanaa. In 2021, as you mentioned, President Biden announced the end of U.S. support for the Saudi offensive in Yemen and revoked the terrorist designation. In 2023, significant event, Saudi and Iran restored relations, and that raised the hope for perhaps a permanent settlement of the Yemeni civil war. But quite frankly, the Houthis see themselves as part of the axis of resistance against Israel and the U.S., along with Hamas and Hezbollah. So, in a nutshell, that's who they are.",

I would also suggest to you that with respect to the Houthis, we may find out that deterrence will not be possible by coercion alone, but this coalition that has been formed may need to completely destroy the Houthis' means of power and projection. That's within our capacity to be able to do so.You know, the Houthis are a rebel group inside Yemen. If we cannot eliminate their ability to project power, we've got some serious thinking to do in terms of increasing our capabilities. But the other point that I would add, and I appreciate the opportunity, this should be a wake-up call that the United States defense strategy needs to be based on having the capability and capacity to fight more than one regional contingency at a time. Today, we've got less than half the combat air forces that we had over 30 years ago when fighting the first Gulf War, and the threats facing the United States and our allies are much greater today. So, we need to prepare accordingly.",
