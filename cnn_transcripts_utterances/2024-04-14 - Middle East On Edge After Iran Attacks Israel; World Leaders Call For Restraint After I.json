Nearly all were intercepted by Israel with help from the U.S., the UK, France, and others.U.S. Central Command said Sunday that its forces intercepted more than 80 drones and at least six ballistic missiles. But the U.S. insists it will not join any retaliatory strikes. Well, Israel's war cabinet met for hours on Sunday to discuss a response, but reached no decision. A source told CNN some ministers are pushing for immediate retaliation, but a call from U.S. President Joe Biden convinced Israeli prime minister to wait at least for now. Israel's president told CNN his country is not seeking war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's warned the United States not to support that Iran told its neighbors in advance of the strike that it was going to take against Israel in an effort to avoid an escalation.But nevertheless, Iran -- Iran strike into Israel really has changed the equation for the Israelis and for the region. I think there were a lot of countries here that really feel that since October the 7th, since Hamas's attack, since Israel's response in Gaza, since the killing now of approaching 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza, the tensions of slowly, slowly been increasing. Israel has had a number of senior Iranian military commanders in the region over the past few months because it believes that they are setting out to work with proxies to destabilize and attack Israel. So Israel believes that it's been looking after its own national interest. But in the region, looking in, there's a sense that this has just been a growing, growing escalation and with no off-ramp at the moment, certainly not now we've heard from Israel saying that Hamas is turning down the current ceasefire hostage release deal that's on the table. But I think when you -- when you look at Iran strike into Israel, you have to see that as being a quantifiable up step in the -- in the possible escalation as we're looking, as we're seeing the situation and there's not -- there is not despite the words from the secretary general of the United Nations, despite what we hear from the G7, despite the phone calls that are going on between Secretary Blinken and partners in the region and partners in Europe there is not an off- ramp to this yet, and that's what -- that's why people are incredibly worried. Because they the steps for de-escalation don't exist at the moment, Becky. How significant was the involvement of the Iranian proxies, the uranium backed groups around this region. We hear that these, these attacks were mostly launched from Iran, but we are also reporting Hezbollah involvement, involvement in from Iraq groups based their Yemen and Syria. Nick that compares with the involvement by some Arab partners, certainly of the U.S., if not, Israel, that being Jordan for example Saudi Arabia. You know, there are other sort of split here regionally about clearly what happens next and the concerns about escalation, isn't it?",

Many will say that conflict already exists, but certainly significant concerns and called for restraint echoed across this region of the Middle East and Gulf.Nic, thank you. Nic Roberson is in Jerusalem for you. Well, as Israel considers how to respond to Iran's attack, other countries as I say in the region, are also calling for restraint on both sides. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry spoke with his counterparts in Iran and Israel on Sunday, warning any further escalation could destabilize the Middle East even more. The Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concerns over any, quote, potential severe repercussions. In a social media post, the ministry called on the U.N. Security Council to step up and manage the situation, given a threat to international peace and security. That, of course, is squarely on the file of the United Nations Security Council. Officials here in the UAE responded as well. The ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement saying called for resolving differences through dialogue and through diplomatic channels. Well, to discuss the possible military options here, let's bring in Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, a CNN military analyst and former commanding general of the U.S. Army Europe and Seventh Army. It's good to have you, Mark. So let's start with what we do know, that is that the war cabinet met for hours yesterday in Israel, to mull its response because they promised there will be one. The question is, what will that response look like? Just weigh the calculations that they are considering at this point, if you will.",

I think the percentage of a kinetic strike more missiles going back toward Iran, fighter jets going into the Iran territory probably will not happen because Israel realizes they have the upper hand right now. They fought off this missile barrage of over 350 platforms coming into their airspace, and they had a lot of Arab partners with them to fight that off.So right now, they're in a better position truthfully on the world stage, and from a messaging perspective than they were before the attack. So what does that mean? I believe that the Israeli defense forces had excelled over the last decade or so in building a very robust cyber capability through development of a whole nation approach. And what I mean by that is they have connected their educational system, the Israeli entrepreneurial system, along with the IDF, to really get some great cyber capabilities not only in defense, which a lot of nations --",

Certainly as we understand it, in a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu, it has been very clear that the U.S. has said that they will not get involved in any offensive operation on the part of the Israelis against Iran. He called this a win for Israel and perhaps understandable in exerting pressure on Israel to really consider carefully what they do next, because Israel, of course, you know, sure, it looked strong and its defense capabilities worked, but they work in conjunction with the U.S. and other partners.Just how much support was it provided? And without that supports would it have been as effective in any way in its defense during that what, five-hour unprecedented, huge wave of incoming fire, some 350 missiles. Let's be quite clear about this -- how much did Israel really need to lean into that support?",

      "sentences": "What id say, Becky, is categorically, they had a whole lot of support. Now, I'm not going to quantify that other than to say there was an intelligence factor. There were tanker aircrafts overhead from different nations to include the United States. There were early warning aircraft overhead that would guide jet fighters towards specific targets as they were coming across. There was a literally a target stream of U.S. and others across the areas.Nic Robertson even mentioned the Saudi Arabians in a glide path though, anything coming out of Yemen, but also the entire carrier battle group that's in the Red Sea as well as outpost from the United States and the United Kingdom in different countries like Jordan and in northern Syria and in Iraq, I'd even point to that. So you're talking about just a massive amount of a multinational force. Israel could not have done what happened last night by themselves, and that was a defense of operation with a lot lead time. So when you're turning the tables a little bit and saying about the potential for an offensive strike of that size and capacity, it would be impossible for Israel to do that without help from multinational partners. I'm going to give you an example. It was interesting today I was thinking about, I heard someone call all this d is really shock and awe campaign or the Iranian shock and awe against Israel. So I looked up the figures, the first day of the alleged American shock and awe in Iraq in 2003, had 500 precision weapons going in to the nation of Iraq. This had about 380. So this was about the same capacity of the shock and awe at the start of the Iraq war and not that many ground targets were hit. When you're talking about that many weapons coming across, you can't imagine the disaster that would have occurred had maybe even a third of those weapons hit targets inside of Israel, there would've been a lot of death, a lot of destruction, and a lot of civilian casualties.",

That is sending a signal to Israel that there's this moment of goodwill towards them. And perhaps they would do best not to squander that as some people think they've squandered some of the sympathy of the October 7 terrorist attacks.

War and what will happen if this new doctrine ends up being establishes that it will most likely go back into the shadow war, in which the Israelis will continue to target Iran, but it will do so in a much more low level way without any fanfare, giving the Iranians and ability not to respond because they're not publicly embarrassed in the sense of Israel taking credit for such attacks, and the Iranians will do the same thing, but probably less successfully so against Israel.
