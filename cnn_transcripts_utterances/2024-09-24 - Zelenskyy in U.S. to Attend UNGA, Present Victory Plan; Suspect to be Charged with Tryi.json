If you're just joining us, here are today's top stories.Israel's military says it struck dozens of targets in Lebanon after Hezbollah launched multiple barrages overnight. An Israeli official says the security cabinet has agreed to continue to raise the level of military operations in Lebanon every day. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Hezbollah is the target, not the Lebanese people. French President Emmanuel Macron has unveiled his new coalition government at the Elysee Palace. The newly appointed ministers met with Mr. Macron and Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The country's new cabinet marks a turn to the right, even though a left-wing alliance won the most parliamentary seats. A NASA astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are safely back on Earth after a stay on the International Space Station. They touched down in Kazakhstan in a Soyuz capsule on Monday after a parachute-assisted landing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to address a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on day one of the U.N. General Assembly. He'll also visit Washington later this week to meet with President Joe Biden. Speaking to leaders on Monday, he vowed to do everything in his power to stand against nations who undermine global unity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, this seems to be the sort of central tenet of his visit. He's been to the last U.N. General Assembly last year. He was virtually at the previous one. So this is his third as a wartime president, but he really wants to differentiate this one.He said on the plane over here, you know, this fall will determine what comes next in the war. And he's bringing this peace plan, which he intends to present not only to President Biden, but we understand to both presidential candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, though he seemed to intimate in a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday that there wasn't a sort of a date set for that as of yet. As for what is in the plan, we don't know concretely yet. The hints that he's dropping is that this will be about strengthening Ukraine so that it has a stronger hand in negotiations, be it with specific weapons. And we do believe that it will include a request for permission to use long range missiles on Russian soil or with things like security guarantees and potentially a nod to a future NATO membership, which is, of course, a pretty big thing for Russia. So that is what we think that he will present. But clearly, this is a moment for Ukraine when they feel they're running out of time, not just because of the situation on the battlefield, but because of the upcoming U.S. election. And I think it was very significant that just hours after we heard from President Zelenskyy on Monday, we had this from Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Ukraine now, I see Zelenskyy is here. I think Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman in history. Every time he comes into the country, he walks away with $60 billion -- billion. Walks in with $60 billion. He wants them to -- he wants them to win this election so badly. But I would do differently. I will work at peace before I'm even before. As president elect, if I win this election, the first thing I'm going to do is call up Zelenskyy and call up President Putin. And I'm going to say, you got to make a deal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We don't know what that deal looks like. President Trump -- former President Trump, has not offered any details of that. But this comes, you know, just barely a week since we heard his vice presidential candidate, J.D. Vance, talk about how he thinks the conflict could be ended by sort of freezing the line where the current front lines are and creating a demilitarized zone. He has openly opposed Ukraine aid.So Ukraine is clearly very concerned about -- at this point. And that's why I think this peace plan is so urgent. They want to try to put these systems in place to rally international support ahead of November.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think -- look, that is true. Certainly, there seems to be more willingness on the side of Europe when it comes to those permissions to use long range missiles inside of Russia. And there's really two countries that are supplying them. There's the Franco- British Scalp, Storm Shadows, and then there's the U.S. ATACMS.But I think certainly Europe will be looking to the U.S. for political cover. There's some suggestions, certainly from experts that I spoke to that with those missiles, there's some U.S. involvement potentially in the sort of GPS targeting that involves. So there may be technical reasons why they need the U.S. on side here. So it's a critical moment for this war. I think this is not sort of hyperbole that we're hearing. Zelenskyy, he really needs this week to go his way. And certainly, I think Russia, certainly from the media coverage that we see there, is watching extremely closely.",

      "sentences": "In court, we learned more about a letter that was provided from a witness who said Ryan Routh dropped a box at his home a while ago and that box was passed on to federal investigators. In it was a handwritten letter according to investigators that they believe Ryan Routh wrote.And that letter says in part: This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job. And then he went on to offer $150,000 to whomever could complete the job. We also learned from the agents in court that the defendant, Ryan Routh, they believe was in a position that provided a clear line of fire to the sixth hole putting green. Now remember Donald Trump was on the fifth hole putting green at the time this all occurred. That would have put him about 12 to 15 minutes away from the sixth hole putting green. Also, if he had gotten to the sixth hole putting green, he would have been about 100 feet, investigators say, from who they believe is Ryan Routh in that position in the bushes. Also, new information regarding the scope that was attached to the weapon that was discovered at the scene that we are told was attached to the weapon by electrical tape and investigators in court said that they -- there was a fingerprint that they believe belongs to Ryan Routh on that electrical tape. That is a preliminary finding. They are still looking into that. We also know there was a letter now addressed to The New York Times that was found at the scene. They did test that letter for fingerprints and DNA. They have not found Ryan Routh's fingerprints or DNA on it just yet, but they did find a fingerprint belonging to someone else. The FBI agent who was testifying did not say who that person is, who that fingerprint belongs to, or what was in the letter. Also, they did search Routh's car. They found a Hawaii driver's license and a passport in his name along with 12 pairs of gloves and six cell phones. One of the cell prosecutors say included a search, a Google search from how to get from Palm Beach County where this all happened to Mexico. Also, they found cell phone data that would have placed Ryan Routh in this area for about a month before this incident occurred. They said that he arrived here as of August 14th. That's according to cell phone data hanging off the cell phone towers in the area. And finally, there was a handwritten list of dates and venues, prosecutors say, that was found in his car. Those include dates where Donald Trump was expected to appear before Election Day. They believe that that handwritten list was written by Ryan Routh. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida.

Hezbollah said it fired a barrage of rockets at the city of Kiryat Shmona. Several fires broke out from the rocket attacks, but Israeli police say no injuries have been reported.This after Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon on Monday, killing nearly 500 people, including women and children. A source tells CNN the Israeli cabinet has agreed to raise the level of military operations every single day. The IDF says it struck 1,600 targets in southern Lebanon on Monday. The onslaught is prompting thousands of people to flee their homes in southern Lebanon, as Israel says it will continue to escalate its attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): To those who didn't understand, I would like to clarify Israel's policy. We are not waiting for a threat. We are ahead of it, everywhere, in every arena, any time. We're eliminating seniors, eliminating commanders, eliminating rockets, and counting. Those who try to hurt us, we will hurt them gravely. I promise to change the security balance, the balance of power in the north. This is exactly what we're doing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for attacks on a number of Israeli military targets, as well as that border community of Kiryat Shmona. The Israeli military is saying it has started another round of attacks, aerial attacks, on Lebanon. So far, we have only really gotten one report of a casualty on the Israeli side of the border, a woman in her 50s who was slightly injured with some shrapnel in the face. By all accounts, according to the rhetoric of the Israeli government, the assault, the aerial assault, will only increase in the days ahead.",

There have been direct attacks from Iran using long-range missiles and drones, where the U.S. military and other allies in the region helped protect Israel from those attacks.We also have seen Israel's direct attacks into Iran with the purported assassination of the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital. The pattern that we have seen throughout nearly a year of conflict is Iran and its axis of allies have talked a big game, but they have seemed to withdraw from full conflict, the regional war that everybody is afraid of. And it is unclear. Hezbollah has definitely been badly hurt over the course of the last week. Its communications have been compromised. Israel has succeeded in killing Hezbollah commander after Hezbollah commander. So Hezbollah does appear to be on the back foot, but also, in its own rhetoric, it has said it will not back down. In fact, the number two official in Hezbollah, after a high-ranked official was assassinated last week at the funeral, he pledged a new chapter in the confrontation, a battle without limits.",
