Lebanese state media reporting Monday that two people were killed in what was a double strike they say and three were wounded, including a child.

Although it is clear when youlisten to the Israeli Prime Minister or the defense minister and on down from there, that there will be a significant response from the Israeli military to what they say was a Hezbollah rocket attack that struck up Majdal Shams this Syrian Druze community in the Israel occupied Golan Heights. Now, this community has been left absolutely devastated by this attack that killed 12 children wounded dozens of others, it struck a football field in Majdal Shams just feet away from a bomb shelter. But there simply was not enough time for these children to get into that shelter as this rocket hit. Just seconds after those warning sirens began to sound, that community is still working to piece itself together. Today, the Israeli Prime Minister visiting the community of Majdal Shams to take stock of the damage and also clearly as he prepares to order a very clear response. Yesterday, the Israeli security cabinet convening to deliberate on a potential response, ultimately ending with them giving the Prime Minister and the Israeli Defense Minister the authority to choose the manner and timing of an Israeli response to this strike. And the question now, of course, Becky, is how significant will that response be? Will it cross any red lines for Hezbollah? And will it potentially trigger this all-out war between these two sides or perhaps even a broader regional war as Israel chooses to respond? There's no question that there is a flurry of diplomatic activity at this hour trying to avoid that dangerous escalation. Trying to ensure that even as Israel will respond that response will not trigger an even more dangerous series of events. There's no question this is a region on edge and a lot of uncertainty as well, Becky.",

Now we heard yesterday from a senior media adviser to Hezbollah, that the group has is in a state of mobilization that some of its military posts have been evacuated. But they of course, deny that they had anything to do with this Majdal Shams strike. Now, just a little while ago, I got off the phone with Lebanon's caretaker Foreign Minister Abdullah Bou Habib, who told me that through diplomatic contacts, Lebanon has received assurances that the Israeli response will be limited. He declined to say what -- who those contacts were. But he said that their understanding is that this means that Israel will not target Beirut, will not target they routes International Airport, and will not specifically target what's known as a guy in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where many of his Butler's leaders are believed to be based. Now we know that Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah has said that attack in Beirut is a red line for the group and that Hezbollah will respond accordingly. So, if it's a limited response by the Israelis, perhaps this could be as the Israeli media saying several days of intensified strikes as opposed to a full-scale war between Hezbollah and Israel. Nonetheless, the current situation has many people on edge. Germany and Italy have advised their nationals to leave the country immediately. Other countries are reiterating previous advisories to their nationals to leave Lebanon, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, put out a video on X or Twitter as it used to be known, advising U.S. nationals in Lebanon to leave before the crisis begins. In her words, she also said that those who are preparing are to stay in Lebanon despite what happens that they should be prepared to shelter in place in her words, for a long period of time, Becky.",

Their appeals appear to be directed more at the international community and other countries who can perhaps use their geopolitical levers of power to try savage to the situation. There is one thing to notice. Maduro wanted legitimacy out of this election. He already controlled every single level of power in this country. He already controlled the legislative, he already controlled the judiciary, and he of course, controls they get the executive power. He wanted international legitimacy. And by the look of it, he's not getting it now. So that is an appetite that Maduro might have for negotiating. Two countries that have not taken a firm position just yet are the two biggest geopolitical players in this region, Brazil, because it's the largest country in South America and Colombia because of the personal relationship between left wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro and Maduro.

So, if there was a second term for a Former President Donald Trump that he himself could pick who is going to take those spots. And so that is something that we have heard from this campaign before. That there is very -- there is a likelihood that there are justices stepped down in the next four years and whoever is holding the Oval Office will be able to choose who gets to sit in those seats. And what they're trying to warn at least the argument by the Biden or rather the Harris campaign now, is that these controversial rulings could continue to happen in the years to come.
