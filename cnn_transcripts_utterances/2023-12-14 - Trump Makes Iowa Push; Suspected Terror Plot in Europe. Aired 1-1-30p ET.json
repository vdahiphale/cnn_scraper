I'm Boris Sanchez, alongside Pam Brown, in the nation's capital.And we're following fast-moving developments, a suspected terror plot foiled in Europe. German and Israeli officials say that several Hamas members were arrested for allegedly planning to attack Jewish institutions in Europe. The operations apparently involve law enforcement from Germany and the Netherlands. Now, terror-related arrests have also been made in Denmark. But authorities tell CNN that there's no direct connection with the German arrests. These arrests are the latest alarming example of a world on edge because of the Israel-Hamas conflict.",

      "sentences": "Well, Pam and Boris, it appears that the -- that Israel has been speaking with Denmark about this terror plot that was interrupted about these alleged Hamas members who were arrested, and that the German arrests -- and the Germans are talking about arresting Hamas members -- that these are separate things.So what we're hearing from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet security agency here in Israel is thanks to the Danes for thwarting what the Israelis are saying is an attack to be carried out by people who are affiliated with Hamas. Earlier today, we got a statement from the prime minister's office here in Israel, this thanks to the Danes, to the PET, which is the Danish security agency, that says that they managed to thwart an attack on behalf of the Hamas terrorist organization. They went on to say that this plot was to kill innocent civilians on European soil. So, as you were saying, Boris, it's not exactly clear where in Europe this attack was due to take place, whether it was in Denmark or elsewhere. Three of the four arrests, according to the Danes, took place in Denmark. There was a fourth arrest that took place in the Netherlands. Now, PET, the Danish security agency, they don't mention Hamas in their statement. They also don't mention that they worked alongside the Israelis, but they certainly are hinting or actually saying quite clearly that they collaborated with what they call foreign colleagues. Now, the people they arrested, so four people, they say were preparing an act of terrorism in connection with other countries. They also talk about an awareness of Jewish places. So that could mean that the target or targets for these individuals were Jewish institutions. Jewish institutions across Israel -- across -- excuse me -- across Europe have been on high alert during this war in Gaza. Now, the Israelis are also saying that Hamas has been working on expanding its operations to be able to carry out attacks outside of Israel, in Europe and elsewhere. And so we really need a bit more clarification from the Israelis about what this line, \"on behalf of the Hamas organization,\" means. Were these Hamas members? Were these people who were inspired by Hamas? Do they belong to other terrorist organizations? For now, we know that there have been a number of arrests made in connection with a potential attack that was thwarted, but we still have lots of questions -- Pam, Boris.",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Boris.Well, it's so interesting, because Alex was just talking about what's going on in Denmark. And there's no relations, apparently, to what's been going on here in Germany. But there certainly are some similarities. Here in Germany also, four people were arrested in total, but one of those arrests also took place in the Netherlands as well. This is as far as the German federal prosecutor is concerned. Three people were arrested here in Berlin. And what we have from the federal prosecutor's office, from the German authorities is, they say all three people who were arrested were longstanding members of Hamas or are longstanding members of Hamas. And they went even further to say that all of them have very close and direct ties to the leadership of the military wing of Hamas, which is, of course, the al-Qassam Brigades. Now, what the Germans are saying is that they believe that the Hamas has started to put a weapons depot together here in Germany, and that these three suspects, apparently, were trying to find that weapons depot to stockpile those weapons. They apparently were tasked with taking those weapons out of the depot and bringing the weapons to Berlin also for attacks, as the Germans put it, against Jewish institutions across Europe as well. It's unclear whether or not there were any direct plans, imminent plans for attacks. But, certainly, the Germans obviously saying that this is a very pressing issue for them. All three of the people have been arrested, one person detained in the Netherlands. As we said, apparently, they are going to go before a federal judge here in Germany tomorrow to then be decided how long they're going to remain in custody. But, obviously, this is a matter for the German authorities. That is of the highest priority. In fact, we heard tonight from the German interior minister. Her name is Nancy Faeser. Here's what she had to say. She said -- quote -- \"The protection of Jews is our top priority. We use all constitutional means against those who threaten the lives of Jews and the existence of the state of Israel.\" So, obviously, top priority for the Germans. One of the things that we have been seeing here in Germany, and, no doubt, which has been happening in other European countries as well is that security at Jewish institutions has been upped immensely, has been increased to a large degree, with more police presence, obviously, in all these places, as you can see, the Germans obviously taking this extremely seriously, guys.",

What does all of this tell you? PETER BERGEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Well, one thing, Pam, is -- it's hard to prove negatives, but Hamas doesn't really have a long record of carrying out terrorist attacks in Europe. So that's sort of striking to me that we have now cases in Germany and also in Denmark. As Alex and Fred Pleitgen were reporting, the Danish case seems to be about people affiliated with Hamas. What that means isn't really clear. Is that people who sort of sympathize? And then the German case, these appear to be members of Hamas. We have certainly seen a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents across Europe since October 7. But I think this is certainly a new phenomenon, where Hamas appears to be allegedly carrying out or trying to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe against Jewish sites. That, to me, is new.",

Belonging to it, raising money for it is illegal in a lot of countries. And so there is certainly a legal distinction to be made. If you're simply a sympathizer without being part of the organization, that would change the legal framework around which you might be prosecuted., certainly if you were in the United States. But, also, many European countries also have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. So I don't -- I do think it matters as a legal matter.",

But Nikki Haley is at play in multiple states. Unfortunately, I don't know if it's going to be enough to overtake Trump. Right now, there's still too many people in the race. And even if all these other folks dropped out and backed Nikki Haley, his lead just might be too commanding for them to overtake her.

That might be helpful for them to get Republican donors to help them with their reelection campaign. However, for Democrats, that is motivation for us in the general election, the reelection next year, to make sure that they have to be held accountable for this. Additionally, American people are concerned about Congress doing something around the economy. They are concerned about what's happening around abortion rights, voting rights.
