Dr. Suliman Baldo, Sudanese Democracy and Human Rights Activist is also the Executive Director of the Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker. He joins us now live from West Orange, New Jersey. Sir really good to have you on thank you so much! I'm sure you've seen our reporting exclusive reporting from Nima Elbagir. I want to start off with how you're defining what is happening in Darfur right now. And the question is also being asked in terms of what it will take to constrain the RSF's progression into Darfur. DR. SULIMAN BALDO, SUDANESE DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST: Thank you for having me. How I define what's happening in Darfur now it's of course not inter-ethnic -- what it is not. It is not a tribal fight. It's not that people versus people fight. It is a systematic campaign by an armed group of militias, going after defenseless civilians, attacking, killing and raping them on the basis of ethnicity. And this for us, for the woman constitutes a massive campaign of ethnic cleansing. That is susceptible of escalating into even more serious crimes against humanity, war crimes and even genocide. If the international community does not stand up to the challenge and protect civilians in Darfur and in Sudan across the country.",

So the international community needs to step up to this challenge, to speak out and hold these two armies responsible for what they have unleashed on the Sudanese people, not only destroying the capital and the economic infrastructure and the human infrastructure of Sudan but also allowing Sudan to disintegrate and fall into violent chaos as it's happening today.

Look, it's been a long week, actually more than a week in the making when the news came through from the presidency about two weeks ago that we should prepare to join him, join the president of South Africa on this trip, this peacemaking trip to Ukraine and Russia. Journalists, local journalists in South Africa were obviously very excited about going on this trip, given the attempts that our president said he was going to make to bring peace to the region. Given South Africa's difficult position, it finds himself in the world of geopolitics, rock and a hard place between the West and Russia. We were obviously very enthusiastic to see how his efforts will be received unfortunately, after having left alternative Air Force Base in Pretoria Wednesday night. Often numerous delays, we were detained in Poland in Warsaw at the Sharper International Airport for more than 26 hours after a standoff between Polish authorities and South African officials. The plane as you said earlier, was carrying a number of South African Special Forces operatives tasked the members of the South African Police Service tasked with protecting the president. They were not allowed to disembark for more than 26 hours.
