His campaign issued a statement saying, in part: The Colorado Supreme Court issued a completely flawed decision and will swiftly file an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and a request for a stay of this deeply undemocratic decision. We'll have full confidence that the U.S. Supreme Court will quickly rule in our favor and finally put an end to these un-American lawsuits. The ruling is on hold pending that appeal.

They even acknowledge right in the top of their opinion the magnitude and the weight of the questions that they are analyzing here. And here, this court found that former President Trump should be disqualified from being on the ballot in that state because they say not only did he engage in an insurrection, but they believe that the 14th Amendment, which bars certain officials from holding office if they engage in an insurrection, applies even to presidents.Now, a lower court oversaw a trial in this case. The lower court found that Trump engaged in an insurrection, but they said presidents are not specifically mentioned in that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, so they said it didn't apply. But here, the Supreme Court, looking instead at the intent behind this amendment, looking at the overall objective of what they were trying to do when they were working on the language of this specific section. Now, the issue there is that the Trump campaign, the Trump team, they've made it clear. They're going to appeal this to the Supreme Court. This decision will likely be on pause until the Supreme Court weighs in one way or another. But this decision, which is largely based on intent and a larger objective, is likely headed to a Supreme Court that is dominated right now by originalists, textualists, judges who pride themselves on looking at the specific literal words in the Constitution. So it may not be the most favorable environment for this Supreme Court of Colorado decision. But again, it's unclear if the Supreme Court will take this up. They likely will want to resolve this issue because otherwise you're going to have this hanging over all 50 states and undecided. And if the Supreme Court weighs in, that decision would be binding across the country. But the Trump team says they're going to appeal swiftly. And as soon as they do, this decision is on hold until the Supreme Court rules one way or another. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

For example, this official telling CNN on Wednesday that Hamas is asking for what they call more heavy duty prisoners.So obviously, in return for the original hostages, they yes, so a lot of prisoners were released from Israeli jails, but they were mostly women and children. So we don't know what they mean exactly by more heavy duty prisoners, but perhaps people in prison for more severe crimes, things like that. So that's part of it. Israel on the flip side is, according to this official, asking for all remaining hostages to be released as part of this deal. So it's clear that there are major sticking points. Israel saying, you know, it is willing for a temporary ceasefire to happen as part of this one or two weeks, according to this official. But look, I think talks are intensifying. We're hearing today as well from Hamas, that the head of its political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, who is based in Doha, is in Egypt to talk with officials. They haven't explicitly said that that would be about the hostages. But we know, of course, that Egypt played a key role in brokering the previous hostage deal.

Causing a dramatic impact to international shipping and international commerce because of the impact that these attacks have had on these vessels operating there. Many companies have said that they're actually pausing their operations in the Red Sea because of the threat of coming under fire by these Houthi militants.So the U.S. and its allies now trying to find a way to respond that does not involve striking the Houthis directly in Yemen, something that the U.S. has been trying to avoid over the last several weeks. And as a response to the attacks to date, the U.S. now says that they are going to be setting up an international coalition of maritime forces that will essentially be in the region and in the Red Sea available to respond and help commercial vessels if they need it. Some of the vessels or some of the ships, I should say, they will be escorting these commercial vessels if the situation warrants it. And of course, we have also seen the shoot down a number of the missiles and drones that the Houthis have launched targeting these commercial ships in recent weeks. But it remains unclear whether the Houthis are going to be deterred by this new maritime coalition. They have said that they are going to continue their attacks on these commercial vessels in solidarity, they say, with the Palestinians and in opposition to the Israelis. However, it's important to note that many of these ships that they have attacked, if not most of them, actually have no ties to Israel at all. And the U.S. says that the Houthis have just been attacking these ships opportunistically. And they have been taking advantage, of course, of the U.S. and allied presence in the area. They want to try to bolster their international reputation and presence there. And they think they will be able to get attention by continuing to target these vessels. So the U.S. facing a very big problem here, growing calls for them to strike the Houthis directly. But at this point, this maritime coalition, according to the Secretary of Defense, they say, is going to hopefully help ease the problem. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It is where the federal broken immigration system collides with the state of Texas, who wants to take this issue into its own hands. And I want to show you exactly what I'm talking about. If you look over my shoulder, you'll see that these are men, women, children who are waiting right now out in the cold to be transported for processing. And what you're looking at right now is a federal issue in the United States. It's up to the federal government to apprehend these individuals, process them, and hold them. But Texas Governor Greg Abbott has just signed a bill known as SB4 that would -- that has created a new state law for illegal entry into the United States. And what that means is, is the images that you're looking at right now could turn into a state issue. Now, I've talked to state leaders all along the border who are very concerned about this. Why? Because it's going to cost their communities money. I talked to the sheriff here in Maverick County, and he says that his deputies don't have training in immigration law and that he doesn't have space in his jail to house all of these individuals. His jail can only house 250 individuals. There's already 180 in custody, and there's thousands of people behind me. So why is all this happening? And why is there this bottleneck? Well, right now, there's about 23,000 migrants in Border Patrol custody, and holding capacity is only 10,000. So do the math. There is an overwhelming number of migrants who are in custody right now, and it has created this bottleneck, which raises the question, why? What's happening? Why is this different? I'll tell you why. There's a few factors. Of course, the capacity issue, the flow issue, there's a lot of migrants who are coming to the United States from all around the world. And then there's this, the Biden administration is trying to implement and use legal consequences for illegal entry into the United States. And what they're doing in certain processing areas along the U.S. southern border is they're using something called enhanced expedited removal. And what that means is that asylum officers make a determination on a migrant's case while the migrant is in custody, which means that migrants are spending more time in custody. And as I mentioned, they only have holding capacity for about 10,000. They're already holding 23,000 migrants. And so what this is doing is it's testing the infrastructure on the U.S. southern border. Rosa Flores, CNN, Eagle Pass, Texas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
