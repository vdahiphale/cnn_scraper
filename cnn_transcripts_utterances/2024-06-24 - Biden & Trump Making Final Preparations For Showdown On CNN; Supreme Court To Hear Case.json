And so you're going to leave that taste in the mouth of voters who watch for a really long time. And, you know, you hear Trump sort of joking about it before his crowd, it's actually pretty important that the rules here are different, that there will not in fact, be a crowd at this debate.And that's something that Trump has historically fed upon, right? He gets feedback in real time from his crowds. He is taking instruction from his supporters, even if it's a joke at that rally. And so but this is going to be a much more sterile environment. It's going to be the two of them, and the two moderators in a television studio. And, yes, for both men, because of this length, there's going to have a really high stakes impact for a long time.",

I think Trump in private has said the first debate he had with Joe Biden in 2020, that he was over aggressive, and the reviews were pretty bad of his performance. And he has taken that to heart. So I don't expect the same level of interruption that he had in 2020. That said, the dislike between these two men is palpable. Joe Biden does not like and does not respect Donald Trump, when he was first elected as president. He started referring to him as the former guy, right? He didn't even want to say his name to give him validation.And obviously, we hear from Trump on a daily basis, his dislike of Joe Biden. And so how that animosity plays out, if they tried to hold it in at the beginning, doesn't spill out over the course of 90 minutes, where they're so close to each other and listening to the other person say things they just so strongly disagree with.",

You have months to go before the campaign and typically things that happen in June, they're not what ended up mattering most in November. But for both candidates, this is a chance to sort of focus voters on what they want them to think about. And for Joe Biden who had pushed for this debate and who had pushed for this earlier debate in particular, he wants voters and undecided voters to tune into what the realities of a second Trump would be.And he is saying this was not going to be like the first term. You might have some fond memories of the economy during Trump's first term in office. A second Trump term would be more radical, would be focused on retribution. And for Trump, he wants to make the case that what you see right now under Joe Biden, and this is what polls show voters are unhappy. They're unhappy with the level of inflation. They're unhappy with the economy. They're unhappy with American entanglements with wars abroad. And his argument is you like things better under me.

They thought this is a win. They got two debates instead of the traditional three. Trump had his operation were so quick to jump to this, that they ended up accepting just these two debates. And they've asked for more in the Biden team said, no, this is what we offered, and you've accepted. And so you're not going to get more than that.But the Biden campaign, one of the arguments they've made really since last year before Trump was even officially the nominee was, once voters clue in to the realities of the choice that there is not, in fact, an alternative to Joe Biden, and there will not be an alternative to Donald Trump, that voters are going to begin to look at this as a choice between two candidates, and they will pick Joe Biden. They will be afraid of the future under Donald Trump. And polls show that a lot of voters and some of the most important voters for Democrats, those less engaged constituencies that will vote Democrat historically, right now, while they're less engaged, they're inclined to not vote for Biden. They're inclined to not vote at all. And some of them might even vote for Trump. And so they wanted this earlier debate in order for voters to tune in earlier, so they have more time to sell them both their message and advertising in the coming months to say this is the choice. It's Biden versus Trump. And you have to pick one of those two.",

He's got to go back and prepare, hope they're doing preps at the 9 o'clock hour, 90 minutes at a clip to get him, you know, in game shape. So he's ready to go.You know, the president has got a couple of things he needs to work on. First of all, highlighting the contrast. This is about the judgment of the two candidates. And one of the things we hire a president for, is to make sure that they can handle the crisis and we feel tested Donald Trump during the worst crisis the country has faced in 100 years. And he failed. He failed miserably. So I think the President highlighting that choice and then talking about what he wants to do, talking about three issues, not 10, you know, give us three big policies that he cares about not 10. And then I'd also say, you know, sometimes the President has breasting old face, where you need to smile a little bit so that he can kind of shake that off.

And this case that it's going to come down perhaps as early as Wednesday, which is the next day that the justices will take the bench tests, an Idaho ban one of the 14 or so states that immediately outlawed abortion.Idaho's law says that it criminalizes the act of abortion on the part of physician or anyone who would help assist in an abortion, except when it's necessary to prevent the death of the woman. Meanwhile, a federal law that mandates emergency treatment in hospitals nationwide that except Medicare funds, which is, you know, the majority of hospital emergency rooms, that federal law that dates to 1986 says that anyone who comes in for emergency treatment has to be stabilized in some way.
