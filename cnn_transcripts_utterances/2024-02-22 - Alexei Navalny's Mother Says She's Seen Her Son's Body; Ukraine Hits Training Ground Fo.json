This is just moments ago, we learned what officials say the cause of death was. We have all the details for you. Then Moscow claims to have captured another village in the east of Ukraine as Kyiv's forces strike a Russian training ground. We have the very latest on that battlefield. Plus, with no end in sight for soldiers on the frontlines, I speak to one of the Ukrainian military wives calling for change. That and much more just ahead. But first, we are tracking breaking news out of Russia where a spokesperson for Alexei Navalny says his death is being blamed on natural causes according to Russian officials in a medical report. It has been six days since Navalny died in the Penal Colony north of the Arctic Circle. And his mother says she's finally seen her son's body. In a video, Lyudmila Navalnaya says she was secretly taken to the morgue on Wednesday, but was warned by Russian investigators that quote, \"time is working  against you.\" She says those investigators are now threatening her into agreeing to a secret funeral, otherwise, they are vowing to do something with the body. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYUDMILA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEI NAVALNY'S MOTHER (through translator):  Yesterday evening, they secretly took me to the morgue where they showed me Alexei. The investigators claim that they know the cause of the death, that they have all the medical and legal documents ready, which I saw, and I signed the medical death certificate. According to the law, they should have given me Alexei's body right away, but they haven't done it yet. Instead, they blackmailed me and set conditions for where, when and how Alexei should be buried. It is illegal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, U.S. President Joe Biden is sharpening his attacks onRussian President Vladimir Putin as well as Donald Trump, using some rather spicy language behind closed doors. Last night, at a California fundraiser, Biden criticized Trump's comments, comparing his legal troubles to the death of Alexei Navalny, telling the attendees, quote, \"if I stood here 10 to 15 years ago and said all this, you'd all think I should be committed.\" The U.S. president also slammed Mr. Putin, saying, quote, \"we have a crazy SOB. That guy, Putin, others, and we always have to be worried about a nuclear conflict.\" Here's how the Kremlin responded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY PESKOV, SPOKESPERSON, KREMLIN (through translator):  Such rude statements from the head of the U.S. state are unlikely to offend in anyway the head of another country, especially President Putin. But this is a huge disgrace for the country, I mean, for the United States of America.

And of course, President Biden has been critical in the past of Vladimir Putin. He's called him a murderous dictator. He's called him a thug. But I do think it's remarkable just against the backdrop of these highly fraught moment between the U.S. and Russia, as Russia is being thrust into the center of the American political election to hear how President Biden is describing Putin to Democratic fundraisers, and he was speaking off camera at a very high-dollar fundraiser here in San Francisco, and it was almost an aside when the president said this. He was talking about the existential threat of climate change, and he said that we have a crazy SOB like that guy, Putin and others. And the president went on to say, we always have to worry about nuclear conflict, but the existential threat to humanity is climate. And you see him kind of slipping that remark in there. And you know, I don't think it's necessarily controversial point of view, certainly among American officials, I think among European officials as well that Putin is a crazy SOB. But to hear President Biden say that to his donors behind the scenes, I think is remarkable. And it does come against this backdrop of all of these items that are piling up between the U.S. and Russia. Whether it's this bid to try and provide Ukraine with more funding, whether it's the death of Alexei Navalny, and we've seen this back-and-forth between President Biden and former President Trump over that issue as well. You also have this issue of what the question of whether Russia is trying to put nuclear weapons in space. And you have this ongoing question of Russian interference in the election. And just this week, we saw an FBI informant alleged to have met with Russian Intelligence officials, claiming to have provided false information about the Bidens. So, you have all of these items that are piling up, and that is the backdrop against which President Biden made this remark. Now, he is known in the past and certainly will be known in the future for making some of these more unvarnished comments about world leaders behind the scenes in these fundraisers. He's among friends, he's among fellow Democrats. These people have paid up to $200,000 to be in these events to hear from him. And I think there's a sense that he wants to give them their monies' worth in some ways. So --",

Now to Ukraine, because Ukraine is trying to hold ground and fight back after thekey city of Avika(ph) -- I'm going to say that again, Avdiivka fell to Russian troops. Ukrainian forces say this video posted to Telegram shows a strike on a training ground for Russian forces along the banks of the Dnipro River, a key dividing line in this bloody conflict. Heavy fighting near the town of Krynky has both sides claiming control of the bridgehead. Meanwhile, as the war approaches its two-year anniversary, G20 leaders, as you can see them there are confronting Russian officials about this war. The foreign ministers of Japan and several Western nations, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany each condemned the war with their Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov on hand at the conference. Our Fred Pleitgen joins us now from Berlin.

      "sentences": "Yes, the village is called Pobeda, Pobeda actually means victory in Russian, and theRussians have now claimed that they have that village. It's quite an interesting area, actually, it's near a town called Marinka, which the Russians managed to take a couple of months back from the Ukrainians. But I was actually in that area say about a month, maybe a little bit less ago at a Ukrainian artillery position that is very close to that, and very close to Marinka as well. And that's really one of the places where the Ukrainians had told us, Isa, that they were suffering a severe -- from a severe lack of shortage of ammunition for their artillery. We were at a position of a U.S. made M-777 Howitzer there, and they told us that, a few months ago, they've been able to fire 50 to 60 shells per day, but they said since had to curb that to about 20 maximum, 30 shells per day. And that was one of the reasons why it was almost impossible for them to hold the Russians up. They said that the Russian gains were coming at huge costs to the Russian army, nevertheless, the fact there were so much manpower on the other side and so few shells on the Ukrainian side made it very difficult for them to hold that area. So, it seems as though the Russians have now advanced, if all this is correct, a little bit to the southwest of Marinka. It's not a massive gain, but it is certainly something where you can see them sort of inching forward in that area. There was one other thing that I was actually looking at today, which is that the Ukrainians said that several people were killed when a power plant was struck by artillery shells in a place called Kurakhove, that is sort of the next town after Marinka, and one of the places when we went through that town was also under heavy shelling. There's a power plant there that the Russians have been trying to knock out for a while. So, you can see that the frontline still extremely active even after the Russians have taken that place, Avdiivka, which is also not very far at all, as the Russians are trying to move forward in Donetsk Oblasts to try and take all of that. Of course, that's one of the declared goals of Vladimir Putin. Isa.",

And one of the questions he will be asked is whether he confronted Lavrov over the death of Alexei Navalny, of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It's the first time that the chief diplomat from the U.S. and a chief diplomat from Russia share the same space seeing the death of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. We know, for example, that these tension has completely overshadowed the main reason why these summit was called for in the first place. Which was organizing another summit at the G20 level, a presidential summit, that Rio is due to host in November this year. We don't  have the picture of 20 nations coming together to sit at the same table and address these issues. Instead, we know, for example, from our team in the ground that yesterday when they were called to share the same stage for a photo opportunity, the U.S. Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Minister, they didn't even look at each other in the face. So, they didn't even acknowledge each other's presence, even though they were standing less than 20 meters, one from the other. And other aspects, for example, is that there were rumors that the Russian delegation had issues with refueling its plane, because most of the companies, oil companies and gas companies in Brazil have business ties with Western oil majors. And so, they would incur into sanctions should they provide fuel for the plane of the Russian delegation? And so, there is that friction, is really what is standing out. And it will be interesting to see what's happening in the next half hour or so when Blinken will respond to questions from reporters and seeing if we have a chance to speak face-to-face to Lavrov and bring him to account over the death of Alexei Navalny. Looking a little bit at the bigger picture, perhaps. It's fairly to say that it is a missed opportunity for President Lula, who is the host, the owner of the -- of the house where all of these is happening, because Lula has always projected himself as a king diplomat, a wise figure who was able to bring different sides at the same table. And right now, it really seems that tensions in Ukraine, in the Middle East, and since last week in Russia itself, are completely overshadowing what Lula is trying to do here.

And we know that beyond that, the medical situation is increasingly dire. Multiple major hospitals in Gaza out of commission. According to the head of Doctors Without Borders, surgeons are reusing gauze in some hospitals in order to treat the wounded. And so, really, just you see a picture of desperation being painted in Gaza. And of course, all of this happening as there is the possibility of it getting so, so much worse because of the possibility of Israeli -- a major Israeli military offensive into Rafah where about one and a half million Palestinians are currently sheltering. Things could get so much worse if indeed that offensive does move forward without adequate precautions, and shelter and aid for the civilians to be able to leave that area. So, a desperate situation that could still get worse depending on the direction that things take.",

He also met with several other top Israeli officials. And following that day of meetings, we are getting some positive indications. Not only the White House saying that it appears that these negotiations are going well, but we also heard over the last 24 hours from two key members of Israel's war cabinet. Yesterday, Benny Gantz, the former member of the opposition, who is now a key partner in that war cabinet, saying that there are initial signs that indicate the possibility of progress in these talks. Critically, he said that at the end of the day yesterday, when there were meetings in Cairo and some indications that Hamas may be moving towards a more favorable position. And today, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying that Israel is going to expand the authority of its negotiators in talks going forward. Indicating that while previously they were really in listen only mode in the last round of negotiations. That Israeli negotiators will now enter this next round of talks, empower to negotiate, empower to try and strike a deal. And keep in mind, there are just over two weeks until Ramadan. That is the window for a deal to be able to happen.",

This is according to a U.S. official. Navalny's widow, Yulia, has been in Europe. We brought you some of those images over the past week meeting with the E.U. officials and others. Of course, she has been vowing to continue her husband's work after his death in that Russian penal colony. We've also heard today from -- he is Alexei Navalny's mother, who has been, finally, after what -- five, six days, been able to see her father -- her son's body. She, in the video that she put on social media, she said she was secretly taken to the morgue, but was warned by Russian investigators that time is working against you. We've also heard, if you joined us at the top of the hour, that a spokesperson for Alexei Navalny says his death is being blamed on natural causes, is that -- that is according to Russian officials in a medical report. But the last few minutes we have heard from U.S. official that President Biden has met with Navalny's wife and their daughter in California. We know that Navalny's daughter studying -- is at University in California. We've seen on social media Navalny's wife also taking photos with her daughter and spending time with her daughter. And of course, in the last few days, you would have heard that the White House has announced new sanctions against Russia after Navalny's death. And we know this will have a significant, they say, range of targets. Those sanctions are expected to be announced tomorrow. I believe our Priscilla Alvarez is with us. Priscilla, what more do you know at this stage about when this meeting happened?",

And it was an off-camera remark, and he is oftenquite candid when he is at these fundraisers. And he called the Russian president an SOB. Now, this was pretty forceful language for the president talking about another world leader. And it just goes to show how emotions and frictions are running quite high here between the United States and Russia. Not only following the death of Alexei Navalny, but also as this war rages on in Ukraine. And so, the president, again, in these closed-door remarks, was quite frank. And it's -- it has since become a touchstone. The Russian government since responding, calling it rude and not taking well to what President Biden had to say about the Russian leader. But again, all of this comes, again, amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Russia. And also, at a time where this is starting to really become a core issue in the presidential election cycle.",
