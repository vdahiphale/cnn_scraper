That comes one dayafter Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed, a major win for the Israeli prime minister. It's 5:00 p.m. in Beirut, 6:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. Welcome back to the show. Well, what is next for Hamas and Israel after the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in Gaza? The IDF video shows the building where Sinwar was targeted. Israel says its forces killed him during an operation targeting a house in Gaza. Hamas now confirms that their chief is dead. But a top negotiator for the group says hostages won't be returned until the war ends, Israel withdraws and the Palestinian prisoners are released. Israel also warns that the war is not over.

You indicated, of course, Prime Minister Netanyahu's statement about the day after Hamas, but then he follows that, Becky, by saying the task is still ahead of us, summarizing that there. It is difficult to see how this could move peace negotiations forward. You can see of course that the White House is using this moment, this opportunity, to apply pressure. But you have to remember yes, Yahya Sinwar was seen as a hardline figure, a figure that was insistent on certain objectives. But you've just outlined the statement from Hamas leader just a short time ago continuing on those objectives, that Yahya Sinwar was demanding, which is an end to all hostilities, withdrawal of Israeli forces, the return of Gazans to their homes. That still remains the stated aim of Hamas. And again, you might have Yahya Sinwar replaced with a more hardline figure. There are questions about the whereabouts of his brother, Muhammad Sinwar, could also be a potential successor. And then of course you have to look at this on Prime Minister Netanyahu's side, who's also been seen as an obstacle to peace talks. So how any of this, this deadlock resolves itself with a lame-duck president essentially in the form of President Biden. it's difficult to see that being unlocked by the death of Yahya Sinwar.",

Only in (INAUDIBLE) on our military force, that's the only guarantee, and that's the only solution. That's the very dangerous ideology obviously. But it is an ideology that we have to realize that leads him because people tend to think that he does everything only for his personal survival. I'm not sure. I think that he really believes there is no room for any kind of settlement with the Palestinians which means that Israel will live from war to war because they will never give up, and the resistance will never stop because that's the nature of people. If they're oppressed, they are resisting. And this means that we are doomed to live like this for decades. I hope that this ideology will be proven as wrong and we will replace it with a new ideology. But right now, I don't see anyone in Israel who calls for a different ideology.",

One of his daughters is stuck in Jabalya, which is now under certain siege. In any case, life is not life for him. He's totally broken. And for them, for this kind of people the government of Hamas was a catastrophe because they didn't bring them any kind of prosperity or even security. To understand their emotions, I mean, it's emotions of people who are totally desperate and will stick now to anything. I mean, the death of Sinwar immediately they are in (INAUDIBLE) because maybe after this there will be peace. But referring to your first question, this offer of Netanyahu is (INAUDIBLE) offer and Netanyahu knows it very well. You cannot just step out from your hiding place with two hostages and handed them for the Israelis. It doesn't work like this because the Israelis are shooting anything which moves. This is all on the only way to release the hostages. We will keep on saying it's only by an agreement, a very generous agreement, the most generous agreement in the world is not enough to release those people to put an end to the suffering of my friend and two million other Palestinians. It's not only about the hostages, it's also about the fate of those people. We have to end it. And there's no reason to continue it. Israel can declare victory. There will be no more victory than this, and there will be many, many -- there will be many, many problems after the declared victory because nothing was solved.

With no clear leader, both candidates then as you would imagine campaigning in the battleground state and very specifically today in the battleground state of Michigan. That of course is in an effort to move the needle. In 2016, Trump narrowly beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in Michigan by a fraction of 1 percent of the vote. In 2020, Joe Biden won the state also by a very slim margin. Arab-Americans make up 4 percent of Michigan's population, the highest share for any state in the country. And prominent Arab-American groups have decided not to officially endorse either candidate this year citing concerns over their policies towards Israel and Gaza. CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere joining us now from Washington. Things couldn't be tighter. This state couldn't be more important. At this stage with 18 days to go, how are the candidates trying to move the needle with undecided voters? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You said a fraction of percentage in your lead in there. In 2016, Donald Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes. It was incredibly tight. There is a feeling among both campaigns that Michigan could be that tight again this year. In 2020, it was a little bit bigger margin for Biden. And so this is a rapid push and full push around the state, going after every constituency, looking for each voter that they can find who hasn't made up his or her mind yet, or is wavering back and forth. People who maybe aren't plugged into the political process in any way like most of the people who have made up their minds. It's about a balancing act of finding black voters and suburban voters and Arab-American voters in Michigan. And there's a large Jewish population there. There's a union workers, obviously a big part of the population in Michigan. And so both Trump and Harris today are doing multiple events in the state, all over the state. And they will be back there. We know that Kamala Harris is going to be there during a joint event with Barack Obama next week. So this is a lot that is happening and will continue to happen. It's right now because the early voting is getting underway in Michigan. But it will continue to be with both candidates there it seems many times between now and election day.",

They reacted positively and we may have to have this summit in a few months, only in a few months. And we are seeing that we made an agreement and a substantial agreement. This is not an agreement with some vague sentences. It's much broader than that. Point one, it is a good framework for the future. I give you a few examples. When we discuss with the leaders of those countries, we can see that they are interested to give up more partnerships in the field of the new technologies, for instance. Digital, artificial intelligence, space. Space is a very interesting challenge for the future and there is a common interest to talk to each other to better understand each other.",

But we can see that the GCC, the Gulf countries, we can see that ASEAN in Southeast Asia, we can see in Latin America, in Africa, with African Union, there are more attempts than before to coordinate at the regional level and this is good because it's an opportunity I think to improve the way we work together as an international community to tackle the global challenges.
