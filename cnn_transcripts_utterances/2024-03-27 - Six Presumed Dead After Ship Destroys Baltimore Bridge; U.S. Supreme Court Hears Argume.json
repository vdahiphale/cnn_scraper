Two people were rescued, six others believed to be from a construction crew now presumed dead. Officials say they're concerned about the structural integrity of what's left of the bridge and the hazards posed by debris, as well as poor visibility in the water.

It's about just under 300 meters in length and I'm here in the port of Hong Kong to give our audience some context here of the scale of these gargantuan container ships.The one that's over here is not run by the same Singaporean company. It is about 70 meters longer than the Dali loaded with 5 -- 6 storeys above the deck of containers. The Dali was carrying at the time of the crash, according to the management company, more than 4,600 containers like those up there, the crew -- 22 crew members on board are all from India. Many of the seafarers working on cargo and container ships around the world come from India, the Philippines, China, Ukraine, Russia, Indonesia as well. I want to give some more context. Over here, look, there's another container ship. This is also bigger than the Dali -- about 100 meters longer. And its right next to a suspension bridge that runs through Hong Kong here. So you can get a sense of how just enormous these ships are even next to a bridge like this. And at the time of the construction of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, that was the late 70s. Shipping industry insiders tell me that container ships like this simply didn't exist. The size of these vessels have grown over the course of the past 50 years since that bridge was constructed. A last bit of context, just last month -- just last month, up the Pearl River from where we're floating right now there was a smaller Chinese barge that slammed into a bridge in Guangzhou just before dawn colliding into that bridge. Now the whole thing did not collapse like the bridge in Baltimore. However, it killed at least five people. There were vehicles that fell off the bridge, either landed on the ship itself or in the water. And the preliminary investigation by Chinese authorities said that this had been the fault of the crew members themselves. The investigation going on right now, well, you've got a transport officials, maritime officials from Singapore who have rushed to Baltimore to assist U.S. authorities with the investigation. The management company itself has traveled there also to -- they say to try to assist with the investigation. There are going to be a lot of questions because there had been deficiencies in some of the examinations of the ship. In September of just last year, the U.S. Coast Guard examined the Dali and said there were no problems whatsoever. But if you go back to June of 2023, officials in Chile inspected that ship and did find a deficiency in the propulsion and auxiliary machinery gauges and thermometers. So there are going to be big questions whether whatever was going wrong with that ship in June in Chile could have contributed to this deadly disaster in Baltimore this week, John.",
