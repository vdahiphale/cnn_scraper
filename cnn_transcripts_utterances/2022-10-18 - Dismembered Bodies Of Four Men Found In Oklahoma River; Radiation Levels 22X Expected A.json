Mark and Billy Chasteen along with Mike Sparks and Alex Stevens disappeared last week. Their remains were discovered several days later. CNN's Ed Lavandera joins us now. Really disturbing development, Ed. The police chief called this a very violent event out of the dozens of murders that he's investigated. What are officials saying about what could have led to this?",

They had left a home, all four men riding their bicycles and then they weren't seen for days. And then parts of their bodies started turning up in a river 40 miles south of Tulsa.Investigators say that they were able to track down through their cell phone records that the four men had been near a couple of salvage yards in this town south of Tulsa. And that's where they disappeared. And on Friday, they started discovering the bodies. Yesterday, the police chief said that they believe they have a witness who said they believe that these four men were plotting to commit some sort of crime. They don't know what the crime is but the police chief says they have reason to believe that this is part of some wider issue that was going on with the four men. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're not releasing his picture yet, they described him as a person of interest. They interviewed him on Friday. But investigators now say that that person Joe Kennedy is missing, they haven't heard him. They haven't heard from him since last Friday. And they're trying to reach him. So the mystery around these murders is really growing.",

Well, let's turn now to Missouri where families are furious, outraged and scared after an elementary school was found to have up to 22 times the expected exposure of radioactive material. The contamination stemming from nuclear waste dating back to the creation of the first atomic bomb in the 1940s.

They are saying this radioactive contamination found inside of a school and outside near the play area is an unacceptable threat. They want it cleaned up immediately.

There you can see it the heavy plumes of smoke filling the air.The airplane apparently bursting into flames after it crashed. A witness tells CNN that she heard the explosion came out. Then saw the flames. Police were asking people to stay away from that area this morning. We understand that the fire is out now. Investigators on the scene working to determine what happened. We don't know how many people may have been onboard the plane or the route that that plane was traveling. The Ohio State Police are now leading the investigation. We are expecting updates later this morning. But again it seems the fire is out waiting for word on possible injuries at this point. Bianna.",

It's a devastating decision for 1000s of fishermen and their families who depend on the season for their livelihoods. Wildlife officials say billions of the crabs have disappeared from the cold waters of the Bering Sea and the actual numbers are indeed shocking.The snow crab population shrank from about 8 billion in 2018 to 1 billion in 2021. Gabriel Prout joins me now he is a fisherman and Co- Owner of the fishing vessel Silver Spray. Gabriel, thank you so much for joining us. What is the lack of a crab season mean for you and your business right now? GABRIEL PROUT, FISHERMAN &amp; CO-OWNER, F/V SILVER SPRAY: Yes, thank you Bianna Good morning. It's really devastating, not just on my family and my brothers and my father, who I work along. He's been fishing in the Bering Sea for 45 years, but also the other some 60 vessels who harvest crab in the Bering Sea and in the seven crew that they employ and their family and their children. And then just ripple effects from there. And, you know, to the communities and the processors who we deliver the crab to and the 1000s of employees and, and immigrants on work visas who they hire to provide for their families as well. So it's not just the crab industry, it'll have many ripple effects throughout the fishing industry in Alaska in general. So it really is a far reaching effect that we're going to be seeing here from this complete surprise and collapse of the snow crab fishery.",

And then of course, COVID came along and 2020 and the Bering Sea trawl survey, which helps measure the crab out there, and the health of the stocks was not able to be completed.So we really missed a very important survey year just due to the complications of COVID. And then when the survey was able to come back in 2021, we saw the devastating disappearance of the crab, what caused that we're not really sure, possibly a little bit due to warm waters, there are several theories going on in there. There was a 90 percent decline that year and an additional 30 percent decline this year, warranting the complete closure of the fishery.",

So I don't think the causes are due to overfishing at all, we can't go out and catch as much crap as we want. We're handcuffed by the state and the feds to tell us how much we can catch to help conservatively manage these stocks.So I think it really is just - just a mystery as of right now to what happened to the snow crab, we're really again, in a bad financial situation, there's no program at all for fishermen across the country for rapid financial relief when situations like this happen that are the causes are unknown. So we're working closely with state and federal regulators to get some type of immediate financial relief appropriated to the state and to the fishing communities and the processors and the second, third generation fishermen, this is affecting that, they're not sure if they're going to be able to stay in business.",

Fitch Ratings is now saying stubborn inflation in the Feds interest rate hikes will drive the U.S. economy into a mild 1990 style recession starting next spring. Here with me now is CNN's Matt Egan. So Matt, this is in line with what we heard from a survey from economists earlier this week as well. Give us a sense of how mild this could be.",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianna, you know, we have heard a lot of recession warnings lately. And I do think that when people hear the word recession, they immediately think of a full blown meltdown like the one in 2008 or 2020. Thankfully, that is not what Fitch is calling for here, they do see a more mild recession, much like the one that began in the summer of 1990.Now, one way to measure how a severe recession is to look is to look at the impact on unemployment. And there was a huge spike in 2020. More than 11 percentage points in the unemployment rate. Another big and prolonged increase in the unemployment rate during the great recession. But Fitch sees a more gentle, subtle increase in the unemployment rate, much like the one in 1990. Now, there's a few reasons for this kind of cautious optimism here from Fitch. One is that the economy's entering this period from a period of relative strength. I mean, the jobs market is historically strong. Also consumer finances are relatively solid, the housing market is slowing down, but it is not in any meltdown. And banks are of course, much stronger than they were in 2008. The problem, of course, is inflation. Inflation is way too high, and that is forcing the Fed to slam the brakes on the economy. The concern Bianna, is that they're going to slow the economy so much that they cause a recession.",
