But we're in Williamsburg, Brooklyn right now, and we've been watching the sky change in the most sort of eerie, apocalyptic ways since midday. We saw the sky turn from like a dirty yellow to this ominous orange at one point. It got so dark that the streetlights came on in Central Park automatically.There are ground stops at La Guardia. We just received word it looks like they're going to cancel the Yankees game and the Phillies game tonight, as well as the New York Liberty as a result of this smoke right here. But this is the worst air quality since they've been taking readings, I think, for the last 30 years or so. Anything above 300 on the air quality index is considered dangerous for everyone, regardless of your health, regardless of your age. Officially, we've topped over 320 today. I saw some readings on some air quality weather maps that were north of 400, unofficial, but astounding when you think about what that means in terms of where this puts New York on the world's most polluted cities, we're up there with New Delhi. Right now in terms of air quality, this is a city with four times as many people and much less stringent air quality standards and regulations as well. And it's all a matter of those wildfires up north. Right now, so far, this part in June, 15 times the average land in Canada has burned. And the height of the wildfire season up north really doesn't get kicked off until July or August. So, who knows if this is going to be a long term trend. We're hoping for some rain tonight, but in talking to doctors and folks from the American Lung Association, they're very concerned about folks staying inside, not being active in this. The more you are working your lungs and sort of inhaling those PM 2.5 particulate matters deep into your body, the worse it can be for folks, especially those maybe who survived COVID and were damaged by that and now have to worry about this exacerbating, those injuries as well. But this is the latest from here. I'll send it back to you, Jake.",

Maria, tell us what the air is like where you are. MARIA SANTANA, CNN ESPANIOL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes, but it has been very, very bad throughout the day. Things have improved in the last hour or so. But like Governor Murphy, Phil Murphy of New Jersey said in your show earlier, it gets really bad depending on where you are. And I want to show you what it looks like right now in West New York, New Jersey, and we are really west of New York, that is Midtown Manhattan across the Hudson River. Right now, you can kind of make out the buildings at this point. Earlier today, you couldn't see anything. It was so dense and so thick with smoke that it was completely white. It also got very dark hours earlier, to the point where the street lights, as Bill Weir said, turned on here. And the authorities in New Jersey are recommending that people stay indoors, that they limit their outdoor activities. And here in this part of New Jersey, people seem to be heeding that advice. This is a very populous area, very popular area, because of the spectacular river views. And on a normal spring day, you would see people here walking around, taking pictures, hanging out at the parks and the plazas. But today it has been eerily empty here. No one really around. Most people are coming by just to take pictures of what it looks like, because it does look like a very eerie movie scene. That's what it's been looking like throughout the day. People who have been working outdoors, we have seen construction workers leave the area because it has gotten so bad, it is very difficult to breathe. I myself have felt the scratchy throat, the dryness in my throat. And like the authority said, the best thing that you can do at this point is wear a very high quality mask if you do have to be outside. Jake.",

And so that's going to be the best advice as much as possible, staying inside and not breathing this in. If you think about this like a weather forecast, there are ways to check the weather here. There's a website called AirNow.gov. Go in there, put in your zip code. People should do this. They should do this on a regular basis, and it'll give you an idea of what the air quality is in your zip code.And that can give you a pretty clear indication of whether or not it's safe to go outside. For people who have asthma, and I know that's in your family as well, Jake, consider using a rescue inhaler 15 minutes before you're going to go out. Just sort of expand those airways so these particles that are in the air become less problematic. As a general rule, if you can see smoke, if you can smell it's there. Those are particles, and those tiny particles, Jake, they can get into your lungs. We know that they can cause irritation, but I think what people don't always realize is that they're small enough, they can also get into your bloodstream. They can cause clotting problems, which is why people have underlying heart disease, vascular disease are most at risk. So hopefully it clears as quickly as possible. But for the time being, you got to treat it like a bad weather event.",

Jake this is a second straight date that the House has essentially been in a state of paralysis as a result of a standoff between conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus and the Republican leaders, stemming in part from the debt ceiling deal that Speaker McCarthy cut with President Biden to suspend the national debt limit until January 2025.Some believe that this deal essentially undercut a separate agreement, one that Speaker McCarthy reached with these same holdouts in order to become speaker of the House in January. But there are some other issues at play, too. There's some frustration among some of these conservative holdouts that the leadership team did not move forward with a bill that would loosen gun regulations, a bill that was pushed by Congressman Andrew Clyde, Steve Scalise. And Mr. Clyde have been in a back and forth about that issue. And there are some other unrelated issues all tied up as part of this. Now, Jake, they have the power to essentially scuttle legislation if they block a procedural vote called a rule in the House. That's the first step in the legislative process if they withhold their support, really, if more than four Republicans vote against it because all Democrats typically vote against a rule that's enough to essentially stall legislation on the floor. And they did just that yesterday on some Republican messaging bills. One, to ban the prohibition of stove, of prohibition of banning stove ovens, something that the Republicans generally agree with, but they wanted to protest here, 12 members voted against that, Jake. And as a result, there have been all these negotiations behind the scenes, the Speaker trying to cut a deal with these holdouts, trying to figure out a way to get them back in the fold to allow the legislative process to go forward. They're not there yet. As the Speaker right now meeting with these holdouts, uncertain what he'll give them or whether the House can act at all amid the standoff.",

Not even the brutal killing of a Washington Post journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi stopped them for doing so. Or allegations of the Saudi government's complicity in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, or all the human rights abuses committed by the Saudi regime.None of that could sway those at PGA who seem all too willing to cash in on what is expected to be, of course, massive sums of petrodollars. But as CNN's Nic Robertson reports, this latest so called sports washing by Saudi Arabia is just one way the country is trying to rebrand itself. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Whether it's gobbling up golf rights or signing yet another global soccer star, or setting oil price trends, Saudi cutting production by 1 million barrels a day or, in diplomacy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's, three day visit, many, many roads now seem to lead to Riyadh. U.S. relations with the desert kingdom have been rocky. President Biden making democracy and human rights a core issue. But increasingly, Saudi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman setting his own agenda. Blinken, hoping to thaw U.S. Saudi tensions and build on recent cooperation, helping both Yemen and Sudan end internal conflicts ahead of his arrival, Blinken putting Israel on his agenda, too. ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: The United States has a real national security interest in promoting normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Blinken's days long visit meeting not just Saudi officials, but regional and other diplomats, too, discussing ISIS in Africa and Asia and likely Iran's nuclear enrichment program, as well as Russia's war in Ukraine all point to Saudi's growing influence. Monday, the crown prince hosted Venezuela's president. Tuesday, Iran reopened its diplomatic mission in Riyadh, thanks in part to bin Salman's strengthening ties with China. Last month, he hosted Ukraine's President Zelenskyy whether diplomacy or sport, MBS is thinking big, eye poppingly big. Listen to the Saudi private investment fund governor who bankrolled Saudi's LIV Golf tour, explain Saudi's growing influence in the world of golf.",
