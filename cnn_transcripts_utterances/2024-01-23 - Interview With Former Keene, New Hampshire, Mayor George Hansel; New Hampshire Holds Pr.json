And I put it as plainly as that, someone that's not looking to the past, but really looking to the future. And she proved that. When she came to Keene, which she came to my city, Keene, four different times, more than any other candidate, she said, take me downtown, take me to Main Street. Let me talk to the coffee shop owners. Let me talk to the people on the street and learn their issues. And as you probably know, New Hampshire is a very independent-minded place. We're somewhat of a rural community. And one thing that we all are recognizing is this consolidation of power and decision-making in Washington. And so, personally, my friends, we're looking for somebody that's going to start to reverse that. Nikki Haley was the only candidate that came, talked to us about policy. She talked to us about cutting federal spending. She talked to us about supporting small businesses. This isn't about personal drama. This is about moving us forward as a country and actually addressing the real issues that New Hampshire voters are dealing with every single day, like the fentanyl crisis, like mental health care. Those issues, we just didn't get that depth of policy from anybody else but Nikki Haley. So that was really refreshing.",
