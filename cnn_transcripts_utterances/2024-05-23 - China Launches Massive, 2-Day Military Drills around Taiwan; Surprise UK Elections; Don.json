You are watching \"Connectthe World\", coming up this hour, vast crowds of mourners are gathered to lay, to rest the late President Raisi will be live in his hometown of Mashhad in Iran. Just miles from Taiwan's shores, China kicks off a round of military drills as quote, punishment. We're live in Taipei later this hour, and a horrific scene of the stage collapse at a campaign rally in Mexico, what caused it and the latest on the rising death toll. Well stock market in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now and is 9 am there or just after. And if we take a look at the futures market for you, the arrows are all pointing north at this point. Certainly on the NASDAQ it looks like it could be quite a positive opening. And Wall Street indices clearly closed lower Wednesday after notes from a Federal Reserve policy meeting showed that officials are worried about the lack of progress on curbing inflation more on those markets, bottom of the hour. We begin with a funeral of Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi who is today being laid to rest in his hometown. Happening now you're looking at the arrival of Raisi's coffin in Mashhad in Northeast Iran, which is also an important pilgrimage destination. The writing on the top of the coffin carriage translates to I have come oh King, give me shelter. Raisi was killed on Sunday after his helicopter crashed near the Azerbaijan border. Iran's Foreign Minister and other officials were also killed. Our Fred Pleitgen is in Mashhad for us. And he joins us now. And just describe the atmosphere if you will, Fred?",

It is really a pretty remarkable crowd that we're seeing here on the ground, hundreds of thousands of people that appears -- obviously very vocal, a lot of them very much in mourning. Of course, one of the things, Becky that we have to remind our viewers -- that this is of course one of the main pilgrimage sites here in Iran, as you mentioned before. But it is also in many ways, both the spiritual and also the political homeland of Ebrahim Raisi, comes from the south and protests on province and, of course, today already a procession in the town of -- But he's also very much affiliated with the Imam Reza Shrine. His father in law is still is the prayer leader here at the Imam Reza shrine. And also, Ebrahim Raisi himself had some functions at that tribe as well. In fact, in 2021, when he was first elected as President of Iran, one of the first visits that he made -- thank you supporters who were here -- when that happened. And so now, people hear coming out -- in full force -- Obviously, a lot of people very much in mourning and very much sad, but a lot of people also telling us that they will remain loyal to the policies of Ebrahim Raisi, which of course, were very tough against the United States, also against Israel. We saw that big flare up in the tensions between Israel and Iran just a couple of weeks ago. But then also saying that they hope that Iran will continue down that political trajectory that it has been on since Ebrahim Raisi took office, obviously a big setback for the Islamic Republic having killed in that helicopter crash also, of course, the Foreign Minister Hossein Amir- Abdollahian as well. This entire week rally has been one of processions of mourning that really illuminates and what you see right behind the -- at the right -- hours from now will be laid to rest.

Now, it is almost certain that they were already planning these drills ever since his election earlier this year. But now that the weather is conducive in the Taiwan Strait, it seems like inauguration week was the week that they were likely going to pick anyway, but they specifically pinpointed his words to try to make him look weak and vulnerable to Beijing's formidable military. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (voice-over): A chaotic start for Taiwan's New President Lai Ching- te just days after taking office, China launching large scale military exercises, and protesters taking to the streets of the capital Taipei. Operation Joint Sword 2024A, set to encircle Taiwan over two days. Dozens of Chinese aircraft, warships and coast guard vessels, Beijing describing the drills as a powerful punishment for so called separatist forces in Taiwan, a dramatic increase in military pressure on the island democracy, WEN-TI-SUNG, FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL'S GLOBAL CHINA HUB: I think Beijing will likely respond with fire theory. That's almost to be expected from Beijing. RIPLEY (voice-over): Senior security officials in Taipei tell CNN, most of the aircraft crossed into Taiwan's self-declared air defense identification zone. A move the islands Defense Ministry calls a serious provocation. SUN LI-FANG, TAIWAN DEFENSE MINISTRY SPOKESMAN: Their military exercise is not helping with the situation around Taiwan Street. RIPLEY (voice-over): China's military says the exercises are a direct response to the separatist provocations and external interferences. They say the motherland must be reunified and will inevitably be reunified. In his inauguration speech this week, Lai calling on the communist mainland to stop, its military and political intimidation and recognize the sovereignty of democratic Taiwan using the islands official name the Republic of China. LAI CHING-TE, TAIWAN PRESIDENT: I hope that China will face the reality of the Republic of China's existence and respect the choices of the people of Taiwan. RIPLEY (voice-over): Word seen by some as a departure from the cautious tone taken by his predecessor signing when. President Lai's first days have been anything but calm. Massive youth protests erupted outside parliament, demonstrators protesting a push by opposition parties to subject the island's new leader to tighter scrutiny from China friendly lawmakers. -- chaos inside Taiwan's fiercely divided parliament, a massive brawl broke out last week over those legislative reform bills, in the Taiwanese capital, confidence in the government and the military.",

Thankfully, no more updates on the death toll. At least the 9 people have been killed later on Wednesday because of the stage collapse. But one thing they want to bring to you, Becky, is their thanks to CNN weather team up in Atlanta. We know a little bit more in detail what happened late last night up in Monterrey. They've sent us a fresh report in the last hour or so saying that the location was hated by gusty winds to at least 40 to 50 kilometers per hour. The stage was likely impacted by a gust front which is when gusty winds push out in no direction from those thunderstorms. And that such an event is very difficult to forecast. That is right now Becky, the main question that many Mexicans are asking as they're waking up these Thursday. How could these events go ahead when we know that the Mexican mythological service had issued a stark warning? Warning, that there were forecasts of gusts of wind up to 70 kilometers per hour for the City of Monterrey which is one of the largest cities in Mexico and the capital of the State of Nuevo Leon. The main person who is trying to answer those questions is Jorge Alvarez Maynez who was on that stage when it collapsed there and who said that the sewer production service had given the organizer -- go ahead and that these event it was an extreme climate event that was not possible to forecast. But of course, his words and his justification are not lining up with what the metrological service are saying and actual CNN weather team also sent us that warning that these event was actually thought to take place, Becky.",

It's a vote his conservative party is widely expected to lose and to lose badly. Latest U.K. polling shows the majority of voters say the opposition party has the best plan for the country. And on Wednesday, Rishi Sunak stood in the pouring rain at 10 Downing Street and said now is the moment for Britain to choose its future. But the Prime Minister admitted that the Tories have had their struggles. Well, CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all of this from the U.K. capital. And struggles I think, is an understatement at this point. You know, there are many, many, many people asking a very simple question. Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister didn't have to actually call this election until early 2025. Why would he call it now when the opposition party is soaring in the polls?",

While Rishi Sunak was speaking yesterday, the government is doing this because they believe things cannot actually get better from here. And part of that is to do with the economic data that has been coming out growth upgraded in the U.K. by the IMF. And on the morning of this announcement, we got the latest inflation numbers that showed inflation rising at 2.3 percent, which is the slowest pace in almost three years, much, much slower than the 11 percent peak the same month that Rishi Sunak took office. So he said in his speech that they'd reached two major milestones in the economy growing faster than anyone predicted. And inflation, he said, back to normal. But if you dig into that inflation data, you see that some parts of it are looking decidedly sticky services inflation. Petrol prices actually rose and to many economists, that actually weakens the case for a bank of England rate cut, which would come some two weeks before the election. So the idea then being called into speculation is that the government is trying to get out in front of that data, getting any worse Rishi Sunak for his party has denied that in an interview this morning, saying that they have no economic stability. And so now is the time to look to the future. But certainly this was a surprise blindsided by some reports, even members of his, own party and I can tell you that the newspapers have not been particularly kind. This is the Daily Mirror left leaning paper saying drown and out reference to the rain, of course, the torrential rain. Well, he made that announcement, The Guardian, calling this a gamble, of course, a reference to those pretty dire polls at the moment, Becky.",

The fact that Donald Trump called her names, mocked her husband, mocked her husband's military service, she's still now saying that she is voting for Donald Trump. And I will tell you there are people within Donald Trump's orbit who hope that he thanks or who hopes that he is gracious. So far, we have heard nothing from him, nothing from the family and nothing from the campaign. But they also hoped that he was going to be gracious -- when she delivered her campaign as to spending speech and he was not at that time, either. When you look at the map within the United States, you see that there are still a lot of people, Republicans in particular, independent voters who are looking for another option than Donald Trump, and they are hoping Republicans across the country that Donald Trump is going to reach out and quote these voters. We know that back in -- just a month ago, in the Pennsylvania primary, Nikki Haley had long dropped out of the race, she's still got 16 percent of the Republican vote in that state. That is a huge number for somebody who had already dropped out of the actual race.

Let's have a look at the open because the futures are pointed at a higher open after losses yesterday in the DOW Jones just off slightly but both the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ trading higher. Look investors really keeping a very keen eye on the Fed. Will the central bank keep its powder dry and keep its interest rates on a whole? It's certainly sitting on that decision. And it's not helping markets. But you can see that NASDAQ's on a clip as is the S&amp;P today. So there's very specifically focus on the sectors and tech stocks were always likely to have a good day today after the video posted some stellar numbers yesterday after the close. The chipmaker which is of course AI focus and is a big beast in the AI chip market beat estimates and reported $26 billion in first quarter revenues. This is how the stock is trading today and worth noting that along with its quarterly earnings, NVIDIA announced a 10-for-1 stock split. That will make it easier for your average solo investor, you and me, if we had the money. To get their hands on a share, perhaps each common share will be split into 10 putting the price around $100 for a new share. This has been quite the most remarkable run for that company.
