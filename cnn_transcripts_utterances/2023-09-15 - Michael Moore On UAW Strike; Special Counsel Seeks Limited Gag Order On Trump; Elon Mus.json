Filmmaker and working-class champion, Michael Moore, is here with us, tonight. Plus, Special Counsel, Jack Smith, asking a judge, for a limited gag order, against former President, Donald Trump, warning that the ex- President is trying to undermine the criminal justice system. And now, senators want to know if Elon Musk personally intervened, to undermine Ukraine. For more, in international affairs, to Tesla and Twitter, just how powerful is the richest man on earth? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, nearly 13,000 United Auto Workers are on strike, at three plants, in three States, against all three major U.S. auto companies, for the very first time. Tomorrow, Union leaders are expected to be back at the bargaining table. They did not have negotiations, today. Tonight, though, in Detroit, the UAW President, Shawn Fain, appeared with Senator Bernie Sanders at his side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's also a political factor, because Michigan is a State that President Biden basically must win, if he wants to indeed remain in the Oval Office. There are a lot of implications here. I want to get straight to THE SOURCE, tonight, with Oscar-winning filmmaker, who got his start, taking the tough questions, straight to the then-Chairman of General Motors, in his 1989 documentary, \"Roger &amp; Me.\" We'll get to that in a moment. Michael Moore, thank you, for being here, tonight. When you look at the picture of what's happening, in Detroit, in Michigan, right now, at these other plants, in this strategic strike that they have going on, do you think it was inevitable? MICHAEL MOORE, AMERICAN FILM DIRECTOR, PRODUCER, SCREENWRITER &amp; AUTHOR: Absolutely, and long overdue. And not just for autoworkers. All across the country, people have been struggling to survive. The tiny wage increases, they've received, in the last 20 or 30 years, have not helped average everyday middle- class, working-class Americans keep up. So, the fact that the UAW has so boldly gone forth here, to take on all three auto companies, at the same time, something that's never been done before, and stand up for this? I mean, it's, I'm very proud of this Union. All my family were UAW members. My uncle was in the sit-down strike of 1936, 1937 that essentially founded the UAW. It's the first contract, when they took over the factories, for 44 days, and in the middle of winter, and really brought General Motors, to their meetings, and made them acknowledge the Union, and to give the Union, their first contract.",

Where are the Democrats? And what are they doing? Go down the list, whether you're an African American, whether you're an autoworker, you're a Union member? No, they shouldn't -- every group should stop just handing over these endorsements, especially to the Democrats. Because we've learned, they had 49 years, after Roe v.

By attacking the prosecutor, in this case, Jack Smith, whom he has repeatedly called \"Deranged.\" Here to break all of this down with me, and try to answer for those posts? Maybe not, we'll make him do that. Temidayo Aganga-Williams, the former Senior Investigative counsel, for the January 6 committee.

But they're saying that this is necessary. Do you think that they'll be successful here? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE, PARTNER, SELENDY GAY ELSBERG: I think so. I think Judge Chutkan is going to impose at least some limited order. I mean, she's concerned about former President Trump, and his First Amendment rights. She doesn't want to be placed in a position, where she's unduly restricting his ability to speak. But there's a difference between candidate Trump, and defendant Trump. And defendant Trump, by virtue of being under indictment, his First Amendment rights, and a lot of other rights, are restricted. So, I think it's justified. And I suspect she's going to do that. She warned him. He's been warned by multiple judges. He's under court control effectively, through all his various bail conditions. So, what he's not free to do is attack the prosecutor, attack the judge trying, to undermine the jury pool, and the fairness of a trial. He can campaign.

This is the basis for this.\" AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Exactly. I mean, it's what we on the Jan 6 committee, in our report, in our hearings have called, the \"Big Lie,\" right? He's been, after the election, he again attacked institutions. He attacked the DOJ. He attacked the courts. He attacked our entire election system.

He's repeating lies about Jack Smith, lies about Judge Chutkan, lies about the entire investigation, I think, with the hopes that he's again, going to infect those minds of potential jurors.

And as we all know, when we're on our phones that, can be our most personal and true self.

And you can't blame an administration, just like you can't blame an administration, for not getting you a contract. It's unfair to do that. There's been plenty of strikes, under Republican presidents, that I don't think the Chamber of Commerce commented back then that it was their fault for not getting it done. And they're way off pace. So, the companies understand and recognize that they're paying their employees more, they're looking at flex benefits more, they're increasing 401(k)s, things like that, to keep employees. One of the segments here, you talked about 9 million people, out of work. 9 million jobs opened in America, not enough workers for them. The power is in the hands of workers, right now. So, I think the Chamber of Commerce, the statements like that they should take a look in the mirror, and realize that their business model needs to change a bit, and respect the workers more, across the board.",
