The focus now is on those ground defenses, particularly for President Zelenskyy. And that will be the focus of today's meeting and the discussions set to take place now.Of course, a lot of international pressure growing on Germany to allow for the transfer of those Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. And also of course because they control the export licenses. If Germany's not willing to transfer its own tanks, to allow other third party countries transfers, namely Poland. We've heard from the Poland Prime Minister who suggested that Poland may well go ahead with the transfer regardless of Germany's position. They said that, you know, they will wait for Germany to give the OK, but if not, Poland will do the right thing. Those were the words of the Prime Minister. So clearly, there is mounting pressure on Germany. We've heard from the U.S. Defense Secretary, Lloyd Austin, saying that he is working with his German counterpart. And we've also heard from the Dutch Prime Minister who said, you know, these talks are ongoing. They are waiting for more concerted coalition agreement with regards to the transfer of tanks. But he said to CNN on Wednesday that he is fairly confident that there will be some sort of positive conclusion to these discussions.",

And that is the concern. That is the balance they're trying to strike now. Because of course, while they are supporting Ukraine on the defensive front, there is concern that if they do cross a line that might be seen as a provocation by the Kremlin and that could in turn escalate the conflict in the way that NATO doesn't want it to be. And of course, NATO is concerned about this turning into a conflict between NATO and Russia because of Ukraine.",

This time it's about claims Santos made his mother -- said that his mother was at the World Trade Center during the September 11th terrorist attack. Here's Eva McKend with the latest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER (voice over): Embattled New York Republican George Santos has long claimed his mother was present at the World Trade Center on 9/11. REP. GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY): She was in the South Tower, and she made it out. She got caught in the ash. My mom fought cancer until her death. MCKEND (voice-over): But newly uncovered immigration records obtained by CNN appear to contradict his repeated claim. The records indicate Santos' mother, Fatima Devolder, said she was in Brazil between 1999 and 2003 and not in New York City during the terrorist attacks in 2001. Santos has refused calls to step down from Congress even as he faces mounting legal issues and a steady stream of revelations that contradict claims he's made about his personal background. Santos is also facing accusations he promised to raise funds for lifesaving surgery for a veterans dog only to take off with the money. RICHARD OSTHOFF, U.S. NAVY VETERAN: I was even gullible enough to give him my bank account routing number and my bank account number because he said he was going to directly put that money for the trip right into my account and it never happened. MCKEND (voice-over): Richard Osthoff says he was connected with Santos in 2016 who he and another veterans say setup a GoFundMe for Osthoff's dog Sapphire to raise money for treatment for the dog's tumor. But Osthoff says when he trying to access the funds, some $3,000, Santos became uncooperative.",

And President Biden wanted to come here, he said, to see the damage himself and also to assess what more the federal government can do to help the state of California. Now this comes after last night the president and the federal government authorized additional disaster assistance to the state. And that's on top of an expedited major disaster declaration that happened on Saturday. Right now, there are more than 500 FEMA personnel on the ground assessing damage all over the state of California. But there are still parts of the state where those personnel have not been able to access because of the damage still hasn't been cleaned up. The FEMA director and the administrator Deanne Criswell was here. And she said that they estimate about several hundred million dollars' worth of damage has already occurred, but that is a very conservative estimate. They expect that number to go up.

And an attorney for the armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed says she has, quote, committed no crime. Here's the prosecutor on her decision to bring criminal charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY, NEW MEXICO: I think it was the totality of the circumstances, that this was a really fast and loose set and that nobody was doing their job.
