Officials say at least eight people were killed, 13 others wounded in a village southeast of the capital, Belgrade on Thursday.Now, the shooter fled the scene, and now hundreds of police officers are searching for him. Now, we've got video we received a short time ago showing a police search going on the side of a highway that happening as Serbia still reels from Wednesday's horrific school shooting, which left nine people dead. Scott McLean is near the scene. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Serbs today are waking up to a headline that seems quite unbelievable. In less than 48 hours, a second mass shooting has taken place. Authorities say that this one happened in this field, in this rural area between two very small villages, about 50, 60 Belgrade. So there's a soccer pitch there. Locals say there's also a barbecue area where young people like to hang out. There's also a vehicle there where the windows have apparently been shot out. And this is where this shooting is alleged to have taken place. Authorities say it happened with an automatic weapon, something that is banned in this country generally. There are illegal weapons still circulating in the country left over from conflict in the 1990s, but automatic weapons are heavily restricted for civilians. And Even getting a semiautomatic weapon in this country requires jumping through a lot of checks and a lot of hoops. There is now a massive manhunt taking place across a very wide swath of this country, a very rural area as well. There's fields. There's orchards here. And there are some 600 police officers who are looking for this suspect, a 21-year-old man they are identifying as Uros B. He may well still be heavily armed. On the way here, we actually saw heavily armed police combing an area on the side of the highway about 20 miles from here, which gives you a sense of just how big the search area may be at this point. Now, Serbs, in light of the school shooting that took place on Wednesday, were already doing some soul searching about what happened in that case and how they can prevent it in the future. There have been discussions about mental health, about violent video games and the impact of social media, and, of course, about guns. Lawmakers have now proposed to put a two year moratorium on the issuing of new gun permits. Scott McLean, CNN, in rural Serbia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Charles will be crowned with the St. Edwards crown, the very same one placed upon previous monarchs. Crown jewels will feature including scepters, a golden orb and various swords, each with their own symbolism. He'll wear robes that have been passed down through the generations. The anointing, the most sacred spiritual part of the service, will be hidden from view by a special screen, one of the only newly made pieces for the coronation, because Charles, who's always been known for his environmental campaigning has been keen to emphasize reuse. He'll be welcomed to the Abbey first by a young chorister to whom he'll say, I come not to be served, but to serve. Inclusivity is at the top of his agenda.
