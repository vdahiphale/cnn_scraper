Speaking at a news conference just a short distance from the Russian border, the president said Europe's security and America's security are closely bound together. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Peace and security in Europe is essential to U.S. security and peace. The idea that there could be conflict in Europe among our friends and us not engaged has never happened in modern history. That's why we're staying together. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER: As for NATO's promise to bring Ukraine into the alliance at an unspecified future date, Russian President Vladimir Putin had this reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As for Ukraine's membership in NATO, this creates threats for Russia's security, obviously. And one of the reasons for the special military operation is the threat of Ukraine joining NATO. I'm convinced that it won't improve the security of Ukraine itself, and in general, it will make the world a lot more vulnerable. And will lead to additional tension on the international stage.

He was fired after railing against top military leaders over what he called lack of support for troops on the front lines.

Echoing the same complaints made by the perhaps vanished and vanquished Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, a bombshell audio message from a top commander in the South, the latest tear in the fabric of Putin's command. IVAN POPOV, RUSSIAN GENERAL (through translator): I, in the name of you, in the name of all our fallen combat friends, had no right to lie. Therefore, I outlined all the problems today in the army, the lack of counter-battery in combat, of artillery reconnaissance stations and the mass deaths and injuries of our brothers from enemy artillery. I also raised a number of other problems and expressed it all at the highest level, frankly and extremely harshly. Our senior commander hit us from the rear, treacherously and vilely decapitating the army at the most difficult and tense moment. PATON WALSH (voice-over): He likely meant this man, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who ordered Popov sacked shortly after he expressed dissent. Shoigu was doing his usual tour of factory Thursday, as Kremlin sources insisted the audio was private, meant for soldiers' ears only, as if that somehow made it OK. Another surreal type of disaster management on display Thursday, as Russia tried to show control after the assassination of another top commander while out jogging deep inside Russia. Here, his alleged assassin, Russia's claims he's the killer and confessed hard to verify, showed how purportedly carried out the killing. In the gilded servitude of Putin's Russia, none of this, the hitmen in Russian parks or the commanders fired for decrying front-line incompetence, is ever meant to happen.

That's according to local regional officials. Two residential buildings were struck as well, damaged, and a 56-year-old man was injured. So we're waiting to find out more, of course, about these overnight attacks. These are common, these are occurring far from the front lines in many cases.

They're banned in about 100 countries. Now, the U.S. says that Ukraine has provided written guarantees, written consent that they would not use these cluster munitions in any population areas, that they would only be used in very specific tactical purposes. And the U.S. says that this is a temporary measure, that the artillery rounds that Ukraine needs are not readily available, and that's why they've turned to these cluster munitions. Again, they have arrived in Ukraine, they have yet to be used on the battlefield. And part of the reason why this is so important to Ukraine is because they absolutely have struggled to make any major gains. Yes, we've seen some modest wins, settlements gained. Ukraine insists that along the southern front is trying to consolidate those gains.

We have the refugees streaming in. But we also have the local population who had very little in the beginning, and now they have to share the little they have with the refugees. For example, yesterday I was in one of those refugee camps and people, I mean they're not really camps, they're settlements. People sit wherever they can sit. They're going to be moved in proper, decent camps further in time. But for now, they're just sitting on people's fields. So what happens with the crops in September? There's going to be no crops. You can only share what you have with people coming to seek refuge in your house. But if you have nothing, then we have a double issue.

That is the same day that the Secretary of State left Washington and headed to Beijing for those meetings. Now, we should also note that this hack only was able to gain access to the unclassified side of U.S. systems. And so therefore, when you talk to U.S. officials, the amount that the Chinese officials were able to glean was quite limited.

It was attributed to a complication from weight loss surgery years before. The Tuxt College report also found certain medications in her system, but they didn't contribute to her death. Lisa Marie was the only daughter of the late Elvis Presley and Priscilla Presley. She was 54 years old.The maker of ChatGPT is under investigation for possible violations of the U.S. consumer protection law. It's the clearest example yet of direct U.S. government regulation of artificial intelligence. The Federal Trade Commission wants to know if that company, OpenAI, has damaged consumers' reputations by misusing personal data. The AI- powered chatbot is popular for its ability to provide detailed responses to questions. And artificial intelligence is being used by some British retailers to catch shoplifters. But some groups say the facial recognition technology could do more harm than good. Anna Stewart explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Got that feeling you're being watched? You probably are. And it's not just CCTV, AI could be watching too.

ADVOCACY OFFICER, BIG BROTHER WATCH: If you're put on a watch list, your information is held for up to a year because there's no real due process. This is all done by a private company, there's no police involvement, there's no direct evidence that anyone's actually committed a crime.
