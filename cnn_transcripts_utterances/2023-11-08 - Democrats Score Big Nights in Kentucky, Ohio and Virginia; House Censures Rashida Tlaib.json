He wanted to have a Republican Senate and a Republican House of Delegates, what they call a trifecta, so he can control the entire state government apparatus. He has lost in that endeavor. That has failed. And he put a lot on the line there. And the night could get worse for him, because not only have Democrats maintained control in the state Senate, but if you look at the House of Delegates right now in Virginia right now, they are currently leading in 51 of these races. We just got an update in, and Democrats are leading in 51 of these races, but 51 is still enough to control the House of Delegates as well. And if that holds, that would actually be a flip, that would mean it went from Republican to Democrat in the face of these efforts from the Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin to get the trifecta in one of the major issues in Virginia. And we've seen this in several states tonight, Abby, abortion rights, Glenn Youngkin wanted to limit them, Democrats said no. They ran on providing abortion rights and that may have been decisive.",

This time around, you can see how much more blue there is for Andy Beshear.And he didn't just over-perform Joe Biden. I think as you noted last hour, Abby, he over-performed Andy Beshear from four years ago. He improved on his margins of victory. I can show you everywhere where Beshear over-performed, and you can look anywhere, there's a color red or blue here, he did better than he did four years ago. That is a tremendous improvement. And also, I just want to show you some suburbs here. Suburbs are so important in the election tonight and will be into 2024, and you can see right here, not tons of suburbs in Kentucky, it's a pretty rural state, but in all the counties with the significance of urban population, almost all of them or at least the vast majority, Andy Beshear did really well.

But until we get rid of Donald Trump, we're going to continue to stumble and bumble and lose races in states and issues that we should win. COATES:  It's very visual at midnight. I like that. The acid reflux connotation of all of it. Let me ask you, though, when it comes to abortion, is Donald Trump really to blame? Obviously, he was the one to nominate Supreme Court justices who on the one hand said that they would be very objective and adhere to precedent. And then when it came to Roe v.

And look, that's something that Republicans need to wake up on because Democrats, I'm sure, will make this a ballot issue in 2024.And that's going to be a big motivator in Democrat voters. I'm looking big picture tonight. Also at not just the power of abortion to motivate voters, I'm looking at the power of incumbency. You look at Kentucky, Governor Beshear being the incumbent governor, had the good fortune of being able to work on the economy, being able to work on education, being able to work on issues to his state. But also as the governor, he was there for his people in the tragic mass shooting. He was there for his people during the floods. He was there for his people after tornadoes, that is invaluable. When you do for the people and you're there for them in times of crisis, they will remember that on election day and come out for him. And if you heard his speech tonight, his acceptance speech, he was talking about this is not about right or left. This is about moving forward. And that is very powerful, because he has been a very good leader for the people of Kentucky. Also, as we're looking at Mississippi, Governor Reeves did a great job -- has done a great job as the governor, improving education, low unemployment, as well as improving the economy, moving Mississippi that is generally in the back of the pack, moving them in the right direction. And his voters look at that as he's done a good job so far, and we're going to reward him by re-electing him. So the power of incumbency really is also on display tonight.",

I think what voters are actually demanding is that they want people who are going to protect their freedoms. And 2022 in the midterms, abortion was on the ballot, but also voters said no to election deniers because they want to protect our democracy. And 2023, voters said no to extremism, on abortion in Ohio, in Virginia, and also in Kentucky. And I think in 2024, the question is going to be, who is going to move us forward? Who is going to get our -- is Joe Biden the person who is going to get -- continue to get the country back on track. And if it is up against Donald Trump, I know the polls that came out are not great, and I would not ignore them if I'm the Biden campaign, and I don't think they are.

As you said, in the head-to-head match-up among registered voters, Trump leads 49 percent to 45 percent.But if you look at voter groups, particularly minority voter groups -- and I'm going to keep both up on the screen right now so you can see this. Among black voters, Joe Biden leads, but only 73 to 23 percent. According to Pew, Biden won over 90 percent of the black vote in 2020. That is a huge change there. Among Latino voters, is  virtually tied again, a Democrat to win, needs to do much better among Latino voters and among white voters. You can see Donald Trump with a 12-point lead. So you can see, particularly with black voters, which helped Joe  Biden, propelled him to the Democratic nomination four years ago, and then into the White House. His numbers are sagging, and there are some other numbers that should worry the White House too, in terms of personality or character traits here. I want to put both up on the screen here. This is the trait applies to Joe Biden or the trait applies to Donald Trump. And I'll put both boards up, so you can see what voters said, OK? Respects the rule of law, Trump leads -- Biden leads Trump 51 to 35. Honest and trustworthy, 42 to 43, will unite, not divide the country, 39 to 44, and cares about people like you, 44 to 40. Now, this incidentally, Abby, back when I used to cover elections in the dark ages, this used to be everything. If you let among people, you know, cares about people like you, you won. Right now, though, look at these other numbers that seem to be dragging Joe Biden down. You're proud to have as President Trump actually leads, has 38 percent to Biden's 33 as effective world leader. Trump leads 48 percent to 36 percent. And remember, this is after Joe Biden's handling of Ukraine and the crisis in Israel right now, and then has necessary sharpness or stamina.

An issue. Biden has been less vocal with when you see him along the trail.They say that in time, her numbers will turn around. But when you look at kind of Vice President Harris as a figure, she's been someone who's been frankly unwilling to really lead the party's ideological conversations on many of these issues. I mean, we think back to the kind of criminal justice front in which she came. She's not been the person kind of over the last 4 or 5 years leading that Democratic convo on it. I mean, when I asked her specifically about how she would define herself between the question of progressive or moderate, she told me, you know, how about you define those words and I'll tell you where I fit. You know like, that's not someone who's really willing to do that work for you. And I think that some of what voters are really perceiving is a rather un-comfort with knowing kind of who she is and what she stands for. I will say that this is not separate from the age issue, but actually, a piece of it. You know, when I talk to voters across the country, kind of outside of the insider world affairs, they really say that if they had more confidence in Biden's number two, maybe they would see this a little differently. When Biden made that promise to be a bridge to a new generation of Democrats, I feel like a lot of people saw Vice President Harris as the first kind of down payment on that.
