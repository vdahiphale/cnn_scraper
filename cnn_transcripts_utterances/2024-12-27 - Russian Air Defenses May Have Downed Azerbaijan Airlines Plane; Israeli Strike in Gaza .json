It was a Russian anti-aircraft missile, operated by Russian- backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, that downed that commercial airliner, killing those on board. So there has been a similar situation to what the U.S. may be seeing when it comes to this Azerbaijan Airlines flight.Now, it's worth looking at the environment there. Ukraine had just carried out a drone strike in southern Russia, and according to defense experts, Russia's air defenses were active in that region at around the time of this Azerbaijan Airlines flight. In fact, the U.S. official with whom I spoke said that because of the poor training for Russia's air defense units and for its military, it may be that that led to the confusion in which Russian air defense units may have fired on a commercial airliner.

The vessel is believed to belong to Russia's Shadow Fleet, looking to avoid oil sanctions. Countries around the Baltic Sea are on high alert for sabotage after a string of disruptions with power, communications and gas.In Gaza, medical officials say Israeli forces have surrounded a hospital in northern Gaza and ordered staff and patients to evacuate. People inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital say they've been ordered to leave and go to the yard of the compound earlier on Friday. A nurse shared a video of a fire burning in the hospital's archives, and heavy gunfire could be heard in the background. The Ministry of Health and hospital officials say Israeli strikes in the area late on Thursday killed about 50 people, including five medical workers. Israel's military says it's unaware of the strikes but says it's investigating the allegations. Israel's military says it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen early Friday before it entered Israeli territory, and that comes just hours after Yemen's Houthi rebels vowed retaliation for a string of deadly Israeli airstrikes on the country on Thursday. The Houthis say the attacks on Yemen's main airport, a power station and two ports killed at least six people and wounded at least 40. Israelis as it hit what it called military targets belonging to the Houthis. The head of the World Health Organization says he and the U.N. team were about to board a plane at the Sana'a airport when it came under Israeli bombardment. Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus said, quote: The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge just a few meters from where we were and the runway were damaged. We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave. Elliott Gotkine is in Jerusalem with details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The Houthis have lobbed ballistic missiles towards Tel Aviv for four out of the last seven nights, sending millions scrambling to bomb shelters. On Thursday, Israel responded, launching its first ever attack on Yemen's main airport and hitting two power stations. The strikes, the Israeli military said, targeted infrastructure the Houthis have been using to bring Iranian weapons into Yemen.Among those hurt, a crew member for a plane for the World Health Organization, whose director general says he was just meters away from the impact. This was the fourth time Israeli planes have attacked the Houthis, who say they're firing on Israel and international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. On Wednesday night, in the war-battered enclave, five men, all of them journalists, according to hospital officials and Al-Quds Today TV, were killed while sleeping in their van. The channel, affiliated with Palestine Islamic Jihad, which the U.S. and others proscribe as a terrorist organization, says the men were carrying out their journalistic and humanitarian duty. Israel says they were Islamic Jihad militants posing as journalists. For evidence, it provided what it said was a list of operatives it picked up during operations in Gaza, edited to translate names and details, on which four of the men's names appear, along with their roles. And as the war in Gaza rumbles on, cease-fire talks aimed at securing the release of the 100 or so hostages still being held captive appear to have hit another snag. On Christmas Day, Hamas accused Israel of moving the goalposts in negotiations and said this was why a deal had yet to be done. For its part, Israel said Hamas was lying and reneging on understandings that had already been reached. Whatever the case, despite renewed optimism that a deal could soon be done, the reality is the two sides appear no closer to reaching an agreement that could end the year-long war and bring all the hostages home.

State media say the new government launched the operation to flush out troops still loyal to President Bashar al- Assad. The attack happened in a coastal region that's home to Syria's Alawite minority. Its members held many key military and political positions during Assad's brutal rule. The new administration has been encouraging former Assad forces to return their weapons.Israel's attorney general has ordered an investigation into Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over allegations she harassed opponents. This comes after a report from Israeli media outlet Channel 12 alleged the prime minister's wife intimidated a witness in her husband's criminal trial and indirectly harassed the attorney general and deputy state attorney. Hours before the investigation was announced, the prime minister defended his wife and condemned the report as biased and false propaganda. The prime minister is facing corruption charges in three separate cases.
