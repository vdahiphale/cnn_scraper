It's unclear how long he will be up there but he will promise to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.I think the key moment that the jury will be listening for, and certainly the rest of us, will be how does he explain that voice of his, that at least now at least ten witnesses have said was his video taken around the time of the murders on the night of the murders at 8:44 P.M. Alex Murdaugh has told investigators and others that he was not at the kennel area where the murders took place that night, and I think that is the big question for the jury, how will he explain saying he wasn't there when at least ten people have said he was.",

Alex himself has been a criminal defense attorney, and we know that his family, many of his relatives are also attorneys. So, I think that he is feeling, look, this is not my first rodeo, I know how this is going to go, and obviously he has got a long time about this.Let me just say also, Jim, one of the other things I think he has to explain, remember, his sister-in-law took the stand and said they were very worried that whoever killed the sister and her nephew might be coming back for more family members, and she said Alex didn't seem worried at all. So, there are some questions about what his (INAUDIBLE) was, what his attitude disposition was following the murder of his wife and son. FISHER:  Randi, this is going to be the second witness of the day. We have already heard one witness before Alex took the stand. Who was that witness and what did they talk about?",

He was talking about -- the very good friend of Paul Murdaugh's, and he is the tenth witness to identify Alex Murdaugh's voice on that kennel video I was just speaking of. But he really just laid the groundwork for Alex Murdaugh being a good father and how close he was to his family and to Paul. I think he said that even their friends, even Paul and Buster's friends called Alex Murdaugh Big Red. I mean, they had a relationship with their children's friends, according to a lot of these witnesses. They were really like family.But just picking up a little more on what they can expect from his testimony today, not only will he have to answer to that kennel video but I think he'll also have to speak to just a lot of these unanswered questions that certainly we have been wondering about and likely the jury has been wondering about, where are the clothes that he was wearing earlier that day, on the day of the murders. The prosecution has suggested that he showered and washed and changed his clothes. We have not had any word on where that clothing. Also how long was he really at his mother's house that night. He said that he was gone from the property -- left the property around 9:06, went to his mom's for about an hour. But her caregiver, she has Alzheimer's, her caregiver said he was only there for about 15 to 20 minutes. So, there are just a lot of questions that we expect he will be pressed on from the stand.",

But, again, Alex Murdaugh, his entire family are beloved in this community. So, he is not your typical celebrity, but in many ways, he is a celebrity because of the prestige that his family had in this community.And I'm thinking, my speculation is that Alex is counting on that. He is counting on the reputation that his family has. He's counting on the stature that his family has in this community to carry the day, and for jurors to relate to him, for him to be able to speak to those jurors in a way that they find credible. So, I think that he is betting on his personality and the oversized personality or reputation, I should say, of his family to be helpful to him as he gives his testimony.",

I mean, the defense, of course, as we say, they just have to establish some sort of reasonable doubt. They don't have to convince the jury of their own story.

As Jean said, they have been given a lot of analytical data, but that isn't compelling testimony that the jurors typically remember. They go back to the deliberation room, and oftentimes they have forgotten what experts have testified to, they've forgotten all of the technical evidence.But if he can tell a compelling story, if he can say what his defense attorney essentially said in opening, which is, look, when you're under stress, when your wife has been murdered, when your son has been murdered, yes, you may say some things that are not consistent. If he can give a reason for why he has given what appears to be inconsistent testimony, jurors may believe him. And if they may like him, that's so important in these trials, likability. They are not just listening to hear who is telling the truth, they are looking at who they like. And we cannot underestimate that subjective factor, because if they like Alex, if they feel like he is really expressing pain and suffering related to the death of his wife and his son, that could carry a great deal of weight in terms of how they evaluate his testimony.",

They had a lot of witnesses and a lot of evidence about this. So, that will really play into whether this jury likes him. Alex Murdaugh is accused of ripping off friends and fellow lawyers and the government of nearly $9 million. So, this is a big deal as to whether or not the jury will take that into consideration as they decide if they like or don't like, if they believe or don't believe Alex Murdaugh. They know that he lied to his clients and ripped them off, at least $4 million to one family he has already admitted to, and then there are these other alleged crimes.

And he has to worry about incriminating himself. Because even after this trial is over, no matter what happens in this trial, he is still facing prosecution and a trial as it relates to those financial issue.So, is he is going to be taking the Fifth Amendment with respect to some of those questions, that remains to be seen. Because, as you said, the judge said he would not give a blanket prohibition to the prosecution as it relates to asking the questions about those financial issues. So, that could become a dicey matter on the witness stand if he is asked questions that he and, as a lawyer, he would know, and his defense team will definitely know if he is putting himself in legal jeopardy as it relates to those other cases that are still pending. But I think the jurors -- I know for me, when I first heard the evidence in this case, it is a big leap from, I have a lot of financial issues, I could be facing criminal prosecution because of these financial issues, to get from there to blowing the brains out of my son. And as a parent, I think that a lot of the jurors are thinking, yes, even if you are in trouble, would you do something so extreme as to kill your wife, shoot her what appears to be execution style, and then to literally shoot your son in a way that we have heard this graphic description of his brains being blown out of his head. I think that a lot of jurors are still probably wrestling with that even though these financial issues are significant.",

And I had helped him plant the corn in the dove field. Paul Paul had planted the duck pond by himself corn and he is making it a really big deal to me about how much better the corn was doing and the duck pond than it was in the dove field.So, we stayed there for a little while.

Like it might be cow peas or soybeans, but you plant. And then there's a feeder to attract deer. Then we planted these little fruit trees on the stands. And what you see me doing is fooling with a fruit tree that I had been tending to. It had fallen over, I had straps on it, I had strings on it holding it up, one of the strings popped.
