We are moments away, seconds away from President Biden's high stakes news conference, a solo news conference. And what is the reality of the situation we are in a highly consequential moment that could be a turning point for his campaign. Members of Congress, donors, voters, strategists, world leaders, all of them are watching this moment, as the president of the United States tries to extinguish growing calls for him to step aside from his reelection campaign. Kayla Tausche is live from the news conference, which as I said, is just a moment here or two away from beginning. So, Kayla, you are in that room watching these final preparations for the president of the United States to come out for this press conference. What are you learning right now?",

      "sentences": "Erin, the room is just starting to fill up as we await the president of the United States. Against this backdrop, we expect him to hail some of the achievements of this particular summit, marking the 75th anniversary of the alliance.But the president is going to have to engage in a high wire act to try to shore up confidence among members of his own party that he is the candidate that they should unify behind for reelection, and to beat Donald Trump. Earlier today, his top advisers held their daily call that they hold at 9:00 a.m. where they discuss the president's prospects in the race. I'm told as of this morning, there had been no change of heart, according to a senior administration official. They now do that call twice a day since the debate, adding a 9:00 p.m. call as well, to just sift through what's happened during the day and figure out what it means for the next. As of today, we do not expect the president to make any announcement about dropping out. That was at least the word from a senior administration official earlier today. The president has been toggling between the various official events here at this summit. But his aides who briefed him on Capitol Hill, some of them joined him here and you have to imagine that in those conversations, he got a little bit of a taste of what some Senate Democrats were saying, giving them an earful earlier today, many of those members telling CNN that it didn't matter what the president said on this stage tonight, because what they saw on the debate stage had caused them to make up their mind. Of course, many of those aides, many in the president's inner circle, the very members of his administration and campaign that have son so much frustration among top Democrats who tell CNN they believed that they were shielded from signs of the president's aging over the last year. Otherwise, they would have been in a position to reconsider or make a different decision on their candidate for 2024 sooner. Now, they're in a position where they're having to make this decision in crunch time with just days before the Democratic National Convention. Of course, all eyes are on the president here tonight. We don't know the exact parameters of what we will hear from him. How many questions he plans to take, how long we expect this press conference to go to. Certainly, we will wait and see and deliver that news to you live, Erin.",

And, you know, I think the things he needs to do are -- you know, he needs to convey that he shares the belief that this race and the potential threat of a second Donald Trump presidency is an existential threat, that he has the energy and the vigor and the fire to fight that fight, I think that's more than anything. I think what anxious Democrats are going to be looking for tonight as they're watching this, you know, they're certainly going to be -- the press is going to be listening to every word and parsing every word. You know, some viewers will do that, too. But I think most viewers will probably just be watching to see if he can bring that level of energy that's necessary to wage the kind of intense campaign that's going to have to happen over the next four months. So I -- you know, he should be focused on and making sure that he's conveying that. He certainly knows this is a high-stakes moment. I have no doubt that he's preparing for it and well see. But there are a lot of eyes on this press conference tonight, and I think, you know, there is a lot of concern -- we've heard a lot of reporting about concern on the Hill, and I think they'll see tonight -- I hope what they'll see is a really vigorous Joe Biden but that's the task ahead of him tonight.",

There's a lot of grassroots people who see this very differently than the political professionals like myself.There are a lot of African Americans in particular who feel that Donald Trump is getting a free pass. He can say anything, and it's expected that he's going to say crazy stuff, that Joe Biden is being held to a different standard and it's not fair. And so, there's a lot of prayer out there for Biden that you don't see. There's a lot of people who feel, you know, in the Black community were used to seeing leaders stumble and be attacked. And so there's a grassroots fundraising is going up for him, phone calls into a Black radio stations are going up for him. And so, he's walking out there with some support that may people may be surprised exist for him and if he can find himself, if he can find that center, if he can speak from who he really is, I think that might allay some fears. I think the challenge is that we are now in a dynamic where any mistake he makes is a headline and Donald Trump continues to say crazy stuff and nobody even notices.

And frankly, the campaign and the candidate have not spoken to those concerns, have ignored the evidence of those concerns consistently over the last year-and-a-half. And so, I think that this moment is one where he is speaking not only to elected officials, we're having a crisis of confidence about his candidacy, but also to a lot of Democrats who are doing that as well. And that does not mean it's universal because the numbers and I think the reporting would tell us to Van's point that it's not a clear kind of universal belief among Democrats that he should be replaced. But there is a universal belief that, that debate in though candidate who was in that debate is not suitable for what is going forward and the campaign set that up as a test for his fitness. And so, we should not think of this conference as step one, on that front. He has already flunked the first test and the terms of the debate, and I would also say we saw an interview with ABC that did not massage all those concerns anyway. So he is running out of rope here and I think that's why you feel the increased pressure coming from the Hill is because people want to see a different candidate and they want to see it fast.",

I mean, regardless of what public data you see, when elected officials with access so they are private polling, when high ranking Democrats are out begging for Joe Biden to do the right thing and step aside, you know what the polls say.The fact it's a tied race nationally means Donald Trump is going to win the Electoral College. I don't think this press conference, by the way, is going to change anything, whether he does well, whether he does poorly, or whether he does somewhere in the middle. First of all, he's already committed the gaffe of the day and he was trying to introduce President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, he called him President Putin. In terms of what the average American sees over the next 24 hours, they're going to see that clip of him messing up on the world stage over and over and over. And this press conference is not going to change it. But one press conference doesn't change what we know. This is a man in decline. It's not going to get better tomorrow. It's not going to get better in two weeks. And I'm with Van. I do think he's coming out on a carpet of prayer, and one of them. I'm praying for him and his family to think hard about whether he's the right person to lead this country right now.

I want to go straight to our chief national security analyst, Jim Sciutto, who is there tonight. And of course, has been there at NATO throughout. And, Jim, you have been talking and this is a crucial thing too, when you talk about all of this coverage about the United States president, what does this do to American standing in the world and the way other world leaders perceive him.

That what you hear publicly from many NATO officials, Ive spoken to several of them is an expression of confidence in President Biden's leadership today and going forward.Privately, they say something quite different, which is they are watching him very closely. They see the challenges that he's facing domestically, and they have their own questions frankly about his decline over time. They don't want to say that publicly. It's quite understandable. They are in the midst of the largest war in Europe, of course, since World War II, they want to show unity and in many ways they have shown unity here. But those questions about his leadership and also this is crucial, Erin, the effect of this election on the alliance going forward because they know that on the ballot are two American leaders Trump and Biden with two very different views of Americas role in the world at Americas role in NATO. And they see a potential American, if not withdrawal from NATO, at least retreat from its positions in the past.

I'll come right back to you.In the meantime, Van, let me just go back to you on the back of the MJ Lee's reporting when she saying you that that deep frustration and anger at Biden's inner circle. I'm just curious about your view on this because these, many of these people who seem to be angry, are people who themselves have spent time with Biden. And there are people who have told others that when they have conversations with him about foreign policy or some sort of a policy issue, that he's sharp and on and to the point and follows up and asks questions and does all of that, and they themselves were shot.

He traveled there.We talked for just under 20 minutes. He gave details. He had a strong message for Prime Minister Netanyahu about his red line in Rafah. He knew what he wanted to say. He was in control of it. That being said, he was old, he seems physically frail as we have all seen, but nothing like we saw at that debate. I mean, have you heard, Kate, from anybody in the inner circle that you are so close to after the debate, did it suddenly come out that they had seen moments like we all witnessed on that debate stage?",

He's making decisions. It's not -- there's not a universe of people who are somehow hiding the fact that Joe Biden regularly looks like he looked on that debate stage on the night of the 27th. So, you know, I think the other thing to remember too about this suggestion that somehow his inner circle is, you know, hiding him. I mean, these are people who care tremendously about him. They advocated to put him on the debate stage. They believed it was going to be a good political moment for him that he was sharp next to Donald Trump. They would not have done that had they thought that this was going to happen. So I think this was a really difficult night. It's -- it doesn't reflect what I've heard from others who are close to him. I -- you know, I haven't been there since March of '23. That's when I left. But every person I talked to you to a person and has said they haven't seen the person that we saw on the debate stage. So I think, you know, I certainly take them at their word.

Astead, the voters that you're speaking to, is there anything that he can do that puts this to rest, in other words, that makes them go back to the way they were before the debate?

But I also think even if we think before the debate, voters were already at the point where they thought that there were questions about Joe Biden's physical and kind of mental capabilities for the next four years.So going back to the pre-debate levels of voter confidence is not enough for the Biden campaign. They have to turn that around if they want the chance to win this race. And that was their tasks before the debate even started. I would suggest that the question of cover up is not the real right one to ask their reporting doesn't bear that out as folks have said, but there was always enough evidence to look ahead to the next four years and say that a lot of members of the American public were uncomfortable with the idea of an 86-year-old second term president. That has been true consistently, and that was not the question that the Democrats were willing to engage in.

Number one, the fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him once, and I will beat him again. And secondly, the idea -- I served in the Senate a long time. The idea that senators and congressmen running for office worry about the ticket is not unusual. And I might add, there were at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now, later in the campaign. So there's a long way to go in this campaign. And so I'm just going to keep moving, keep moving. And because, look, I got more work to do. We've got more work to finish. There's so much -- we've made so much progress. Think about it. Think about where we are economically relative to the rest of the world. Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. We've created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs. 1.5 million to -- I mean, so things are moving. We've got more to go. Working-class people still have -- need help. Corporate greed is still at large.

First, on the NATO summit, President Zelenskyy in your meeting with him, he pressed you to lift your limitations on the Ukrainian use of American weapons, saying that, in his public remarks afterwards, saying that Ukraine cannot win the war unless those limitations are lifted. Are you reconsidering your position on that?And then secondly, following up on Felicia's question there, leaders of your own party have said that they're not worried about that debate. They're worried about the next bad night and the bad night after that. How can you reassure the American people that you are up to the task and that there won't be more bad nights at the debate stage or somewhere else?",

It wouldn't.Question is, what's the best use of the weaponry he has, the weapon we were getting to him? I've gotten a more -- I've got a more long-range capacity as well as defensive capacity, and so our military is -- I'm following the advice of my commander-in-chief, my -- my chief of staff of the military, as well as the secretary of Defense and our intelligence people.

He'd be a disaster.\" I mean, I think he said at one of his rallies -- don't hold me to this -- recently, where NATO, \"I just learned about NATO,\" or something to that effect. Foreign policy has never been his strong point. And he seems to have an affinity to people who are authoritarian. That worries, as I tell you, from Poland, that worries Europe. That worries Poland. And nobody, including the people of Poland, think that, if he wins in Ukraine, he's going to stop in Ukraine, that that's going to be the end of it. And so what I can say is I think I'm the best qualified person to do the job, to make sure that Ukraine does not fall, that Ukraine succeeds, that the European alliance stays strong. You may recall, no one was talking about Finland joining NATO. I remember talking to Putin in -- when, right after he got elected, in Geneva. And he was talking about what we should do; he -- we couldn't be in Eastern Europe, et cetera. And I said, \"You're looking for the Findalization (ph) of Ukraine. But you're going to get the NATO-ization of Finland.\" And about four weeks later, I got a call -- that's not true -- probably five months later, from the president of Finland, could he come and see me in my office. And I had -- I invited him to the Oval Office. We sat down and talked. He said he wanted to join NATO, could I help? And I did. It wasn't automatic. And then I got a call from the Swedes.",
