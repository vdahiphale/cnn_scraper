We expect, as the region begins to wake up right now, that we will be hearing from Iran and other countries there.I think a lot will depend on what the -- what these strikes did actually hit. We know what the U.S. targets were, according to the statement from the U.S. Central Command and U.S. officials. But we are going to have to wait and see the battle damage assessment during daylight hours in the coming hours and see what the result of these strikes have been. Of course notably that U.S. statement, pointing out that it is not just the Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria that they have gone after. They have also struck targets affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards elite Quds Force. So we will have to wait and see. But Nick, it is also worth mentioning that we don't expect really any sort of high- value Ukrainian targets to have been hit, individuals, commanders. We have had reports in recent days that the Iranians have already begun moving their personnel from sites in Iraq and Syria, because, as you mentioned, Iran and much of the world knew that was coming, with the U.S. saying that it was going to carry out its retaliation in Iraq and Syria, perhaps that it was coming. So they had time to prepare for this. So we will have to wait and see and, you know, both the U.S. and Iran have said publicly over the recent days since that attack in Jordan on the U.S. base there that killed those three service members, they have both said they don't want war. But of course, the concern has always been that, you know, as these attacks continue to take place by these Iranian proxies, that it would be some sort of a miscalculation that could lead to that war. So we will have to wait and see what the result of these strikes has been and whether this is enough of a deterrent, that -- if this is going to stop further attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria. Or is it going to lead to another cycle of attack and counterattack?",

We have heard from the U.S. for years, they have been trained, equipped, supported, sponsored by the Iranians.And, you know, we are talking about decades of this in Iraq. This goes back to post-U.S. military invasion in 2003, when you saw these groups emerge, when you saw the Iranian support for these groups, equipping and training them, and these groups carrying out many, many deadly attacks on U.S. forces in the country. And they have always been seeing these proxies in both Iraq and Syria, of course, following the civil war, a decade now, where you have had these groups getting the support from the Iranians. They have been seen as the proxy groups that are advancing Iran's interests and influence in the region. The question has always been how much influence does it have when it comes to individual attacks. And I think everyone would agree that it is more of the overall policy and agenda. When attacks are -- when it is going to ramp up attacks against U.S. interests, if you look at what is happening right now in the region, this all started back in October, following the October 7th horrific attacks on Israel, the war in Gaza. What you have seen is Iran's proxies across the region, whether it is Iraq, Syria, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah, they have all ramped up their military activities. And what we have heard is all of these groups saying that, if the war in Gaza stops, if the U.S. pushes for that cease-fire, they will stop.",

Iran has got a lot to lose when it gets into a direct conflict with U.S. It has got territory, it has got facilities, it has got nuclear facilities. It has a government that is probably about to go through a significant transition, given the age and health of the supreme leader. The proxy forces, on the other hand, they don't have territory. They have had plenty of signaling this was coming, so they have most certainly cleared their people out of these sites and they sort of win just by holding on and feeling that they are important enough for the United States to want to strike. So it is entirely conceivable that the proxy voices will continue to go do some attacks and then Iran will try to quiet this whole thing down. Now we did see one major proxy voice along (INAUDIBLE) this attack say that there would be no further attacks on U.S. targets a few days ago and that clearly came after pressure from Iran and from Iraq.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: One of the key things to think about here is where this actually happened. And this is the Euphrates River, right here. It was during -- in this valley, in Syria, that most of the attacks occurred. Right here at the border crossing, at al-Qaim, between Iraq and Syria, was also a place where the attacks occurred. And then, the Euphrates continues into here. [02:20:00] All of these areas are basically places where these militias operate. And they also operate in areas of western Iraq, right here, and some in the northwest, as well as in other parts of the country of Iraq. But because they are doing all of this, these areas become so important, from a military standpoint. Because what they're doing is they're taking out all of these different nodes, like you mentioned, and Oren mentioned in his report, the command and control nodes, the logistics, areas, all of that. Because this is the main supply route, for these militias, to get the stuff that they need to do their work, from Iran. And that's why these areas are so important, from a military perspective.",

On Friday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with General Valerii Zaluzhnyi and other officials to discuss military matters.Mr. Zelenskyy later referred to him as the commander in chief in a social media post. Sources have told CNN the general is expected to be out of a job by the end of the week. His dismissal would be the biggest military shakeup in Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But many Ukrainians see Zaluzhnyi as the right man for the job and someone who was key in holding back Russia's onslaught in the early days of the war. Fred Pleitgen explains how the popular general fell out of favor with the president. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Since Moscow's forces invaded Ukraine almost two years ago, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi has been the man behind the military effort to push the Russians back, a successful effort but one requiring great sacrifices in Ukrainian blood. Zaluzhnyi, a respected commander close to his troops. \"The path to our victory is very hard,\" he said at a military funeral, \"and the price for this victory is the lives of our warriors, the best citizens of Ukraine, who have stood in the defense of the country with weapons and their hands.\" But after Ukraine's large-scale counteroffensive failed last year, Kyiv's forces making little headway while suffering major losses, relations between Zaluzhnyi and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appeared to fray. Zelenskyy seemingly critical of his top general strategy. \"I have working relations with Zaluzhnyi. He has to answer for results on the battlefield as commander in chief, together with the general staff,\" Zelenskyy said. \"There are many questions.\" Zaluzhnyi remains extremely popular. A December Ukrainian poll finding nearly 90 percent supported him compared to around 60 percent for Zelenskyy. Another point of contention between the two, further mobilization of soldiers to beef up the armed forces but also to give troops, fighting on the front lines for months, a breather. Zaluzhnyi saying, \"It's going too slow. As for the local mobilization offices as of now, frankly speaking, I am not satisfied with the work of the mobilization offices. If I were satisfied with their work, we would not discuss this bill right now.\" But Zelenskyy is critical of further mobilization, an unpopular measure for many Ukrainians. \"And what, everyone, take everyone away because they don't have money?\" this man asks. \"That really smells like slavery.\" \"As harsh as it may sound, in my opinion, it's necessary,\" this man says, \"because it's really a matter where it seems to me there is no choice.\" Outmanned and outgunned, Ukraine's army is struggling to hold the Russians up while the president's relations with his top general seem damaged, possibly beyond repair -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv.

That is because a federal judge on Friday said it could not begin on March 4th.The reason? It is because the law has not been worked out yet. There are questions about presidential immunity, whether Trump could face trial before an appeals court. That appeals court has not ruled in weeks. And so as the wait for the opinion continues, day after day after day, that means Trump's team is not preparing for trial and the trial is not going to be able to go forward as scheduled. This is the trial in Washington, D.C., a federal case against Trump. But he is still set to go to trial in March. In the end of March, in fact, is when the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg is said to put on his case against Trump, now, as a defendant related to a hush money scheme and the falsification of business records. Right now, that is supposed to be the first criminal trial against Trump on the calendar. There are a lot of moving parts here, trial dates do move. And this case with Judge Tanya Chutkan, there is much anticipation of when the appeals court will determine what the law is here, when it will go back to the judge and when that 2020 election case could be put back on the calendar, especially whether it will happen before the presidential election of 2024. Something the Justice Department very much wants to happen, no matter when the Manhattan DA's case and other cases against Trump go forward. So we will wait and see that. Trump, of course, does not want this trial to happen before the presidential election in November. It would shine quite a light on the end of his presidency, how he managed his White House. There would be former officials called to testify against him, very possibly his own former vice president Mike Pence.
