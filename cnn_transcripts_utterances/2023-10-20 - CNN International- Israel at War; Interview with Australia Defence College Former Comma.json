And he also said during his meeting with the visiting Egyptian prime minister, where he also said, China's ready to work with the -- with Arab nations to promote a more comprehensive and lasting solution to this issue.And on that front, the Chinese special envoy to the Middle East actually has now arrived in Doha and just held talks with his Russian as well as Qatari counterparts, very much reiterating his top leader's comments. But as you mentioned, as also many analysts pointed out, the problem is right now is the Chinese response seems to be disconnected from reality. And also, they say this kind of response, not unlike what China has said after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This seems to be more about projecting the image of a peacemaker than acting as one. In the past few days, we have seen the Chinese foreign minister, for example, expressing a hardened line towards Israel while the government here still refuses to even name Hamas in any of their statements and condemnations that the state media coverage of the story appears to be increasingly one sided, very much focused on the Palestinian cause and on their tightly controlled social media. As you know, the government literally could flip the switch to shut down any conversations they don't like. We have seen an explosion of anti-Israel and often antisemitic comments. And all of that, according to experts, is an indication of where the government's position truly lies. And you know, at the end of the day, though, a lot of people also see this as connected to the current tensions between Washington and Beijing. We have seen officials here, but also state media and even social media users now training their fires on Washington and blaming the U.S. as the ultimate culprit here. Driving home the point that the U.S. is a factor of instability around the world, while China is the factor of peace. And that, of course, is a point Xi Jinping very much made in the past few days, doing that has set about and brought for him, very much again, reinforcing this desire and willingness to reshape a U.S. led world order, Max.",
