      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.A year ago, a gunman armed with two assault-style weapons and a handgun shot and killed three children and three adults at the Covenant School in Nashville. It was one of the deadliest school shootings in Tennessee's history. This led to a renewed push for gun control with thousands of people protesting in the state capital. Three Democratic lawmakers joined that protests and two of them were then expelled from the state house representatives. An unusual move that highlighted the power of the Republicans in the state legislature. Tennessee is considered one of the most conservative states in the country, with some of the most restrictive laws in abortion and voting rights. But it wasn't always run by Republicans. For decades, Democrats ruled the legislature and the governor's office. Then the party shared power until about a decade ago. So how did this state end up with a Republican super majority? CNN political commentator Van Jones grew up in Tennessee. As a Democratic activist, he wanted to find out how and why Republicans came to dominate his home state. What he found surprised him. For the next hour, he'll show you not only how deep the divide is between Republicans and Democrats, but also how the two sides are not as different as you might think. (CROWD PROTESTING)",
