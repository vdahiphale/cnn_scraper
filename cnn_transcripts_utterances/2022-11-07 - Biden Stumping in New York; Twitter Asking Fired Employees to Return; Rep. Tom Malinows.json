He's seen this with the Tea Party. And now he's got his chance to try and lead a caucus that has disparate voices and voices that are singularly powerful because of their influence in the media. So, he does understand what he's up against.And, you know, in the line of questioning there it was sort of like, why would you put her on this. You know, oversight is a very powerful position for Congress. And it's been - it's been weaponized in a lot of ways. So, do expect, if there is a Republican-led House, many investigations. Do expect attempts at impeachments that we know will not go anywhere because the Senate does not often convict. There's a lot of this we have experienced in the last four or five years. And the commitment to America, most of the policy details could fit on a card in his suit pocket. So, I think he - you know, he's going to have to flesh out more what it means to have Republican leadership.

And the fact that you can't even trace a lot of this money some of the time is something that is very disturbing to a lot of voters in my district. I -- look, one of my selling points over the last four years, since I was elected, is that I don't take money from corporate PACs. I only take money from individuals. And I think a lot of people support me, even - even if they don't necessarily agree with me on every policy issue because they see me as independent from dark money, from corporate special interest money.

I know of another country that needs patriot air defense systems, and that's Ukraine.

And it may not be the number one issue in this election, but it is really important to understand that a Republican House, if Kevin McCarthy is speaker, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, and the dozen other Marjorie Taylor Greene's that are getting elected across the country have the majority, we are going to have to fight over aid to Ukraine.
