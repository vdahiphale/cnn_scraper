FOR NEAR EAST POLICY: I think we're coming to an inflection point and President Erdogan's career elections in Turkey were free and are still free. But the race has become so unfair that it is really hard to speak of this as a purely democratic victory. President Erdogan benefited from incumbency advantages. He has complete control of institutions and information flow, for instance, in the campaign season, Erdogan's campaign freely spread fake news, fake videos and fake pamphlets alleging of course, a lie, that opposition candidate coalition is backed by terrorists. Now, typically, a board in Turkey would ban any such fake news spreading but the board's reporting Erdogan, of course, did not take any action. That's the first part. The second part is Erdogan's complete control of the information flow. Opposition candidate Kilicdaroglu was not allowed to make a case that, of course, is not backed by terrorists. And I think that was a huge advantage for President Erdogan. So I would say, whereas until recently, I was of the analytical view that Turkey was a democracy that has fallen under an autocrat. I think we can now say that Turkey has moved from being an illiberal European democracy to becoming an Eurasian autocracy as of these elections.",

He was also a Jacobean (ph) top down politician who uses cash as Turkey's founder and Liberator after World War I, of course, to shape Turkey in his own image as a secular Europe facing and Western society.Erdogan shares none of these values. He wants Turkey to be in his own image shaped as a socially conservative, politically Islamist and internationally Middle Eastern nation. Now, we could argue that Erdogan has had some success in this regard. But while Erdogan, of course, is Turkey's elected president, he nowhere has the cachet that President -- Ataturk had who found that Turkey. And secondly, I think everyone, of course, has Ataturk's vision. He also believes in top down social engineering. So I call him an anti-Ataturk, meaning he does not share Ataturk values. He has the opposite values but he believes in the same social engineering. The problem with this kind of top down Jacobean (ph) social engineering is that I think the time for that in Turkey or elsewhere has passed. And that is why President Erdogan has had some success, shaping Turkey's his own image, he controls institutions, public policy, educational curriculum, but half of Turkey still does not want to be like him or fold under his power. So I think that kind of leaves us in a country that is split that has elected Erdogan for another five-year term. When he finishes his job in office, Erdogan would have run Turkey for 25 years that is longer than Mustafa Kemal Ataturk or any other president in the country's modern history.",

So this will be important in the coming days as both members of Congress in both parties review the legislative text. But President Biden was also having to answer to questions about whether he should have negotiated sooner. The position from the White House since early this year has been that they would not negotiate on the debt ceiling. But President Biden saying that he is was not doing that, but rather negotiating on spending cuts. And so that is part of the spin that both the White House and Republicans will be giving in the coming days as they tried to get both parties on board with this in a very short amount of time. It wasn't only reaching the agreement, but also now looking at the legislative text getting a -- for a House vote on the floor as well as the Senate.

Still to come, it is being called the next frontier of drug discovery by some experts. I speak with a scientist using artificial intelligence to discover new medicines. You are watching CNN NEWSROOM. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HOLMES: Now amid a host of unnerving and controversial ways artificial intelligence is being put to use, medical researchers are using its powers for good. AI has helped them discover a new type of antibiotics for potential use against a superbug previously resistant to other treatments. Experts have been looking for a way to combat the bug which can cause dangerous blood and respiratory infections. With a recent study finding one in four patients died within a month of being diagnosed. Now researchers in Canada worked with MIT and Harvard to develop nearly 500 compounds that could block its effects. AI was able to sift through thousands of molecules in record time to deliver the best candidate for the job. It's not the first time AI has been used in the field, but what used to take months or even years to test samples can now just take days. Jonathan Stokes is one of the researchers of that study. He's also an assistant professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster University. Great to have you with us, Professor. Just to set the scene, briefly give us a sense, first of all, of how bad this particular superbug and others like it is? I mean, how dangerous, how urgent the need for a way to combat it?",

And the other reason it's a challenge is because it likes to take up DNA from its environment. And you could imagine if you're a bacterium living in a hospital, oftentimes those pieces of DNA are going to encode antibiotic resistance (INAUDIBLE).",

You know, hundreds of thousands to a couple million, let's say.And then we systematically test those in the laboratory to see which ones have the activity that we want, and which ones do not. You would imagine that this is an expensive and time consuming laborious process. So the goal with artificial intelligence is to help us more rationally select which chemicals we want to test, thereby reducing the total number of experiments we have to perform in a laboratory. And ideally that will help us get to the medicines that we desire significantly faster, and for less money. Yh1: Yes. And you have said that we are in -- well into an era of AI augmented drug discovery. How much of a sea change might this be?

Which first, I think is very, very unlikely, because it brings no benefit to the other killer whales to be engaging in something where they risk getting injured.The most likely explanation is that it simply is bad behavior and I think for these killer whales, that they're treating these boats almost like it is a bumper car carnival ride. They're coming in, they are able to slam their bodies against the boat, rub against them, turn it, stop it from moving with their teeth, onto the rudder, even being pulled behind if they want. And it's a behavior that has started in May of 2020. Has spread to at least two pods, and now I think we're up to 15 out of the 40 animals are doing this.",

The other stress that they have to deal with is the constant noise of boats.

If they are taking out their stress and frustrations, they're targeting the wrong boats. HOLMES: Yes. Yes, really.
