So if we're going to have a change election, this is going to be about change.

Again, two voters, so you don't want to overproject. You don't want to draw sweeping conclusions. But we've known Antonio and we've known Rafael for months now. Our first visit here was 11 months ago, then six weeks ago. And we know they're plugged into the Latino community, so we take what they say seriously. And a reminder here, I just had my friend on the trip with me here, the Mini Magic Wall. Let's bring up the population. Look at this. This is the Latino population nationwide. The deeper the shading, the higher the population of Latinos. So let's zoom in on battleground Nevada here. And zoom in, you look at Clark County where I am in Las Vegas. 75 percent of the votes just shy of that will be cast here in Clark County. So, Anderson, our polling here shows a dead heat. If this only impacts Trump a little bit, a little bit can make a big difference in a battleground state. And both of these voters who we've been in touch with say that it just exploded on social media and that the reaction continues days later. The question is, Trump and Harris both do here this week.

Take a look, that 18 percentage point lead in our poll, and that's a poll different from the exit poll of actual voters four years ago. Four years ago, Joe Biden won Latino voters in Nevada by 24 points in Arizona, sorry. In Nevada, Harris near tied with Latino voters with Trump right now in our poll. Biden won Latino voters in Nevada by 26 points in the election four years ago.
