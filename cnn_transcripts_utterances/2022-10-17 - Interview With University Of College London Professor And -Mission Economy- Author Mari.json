      "sentences": "The prime minister has been on the job, not even six weeks. And spending most of that time scrambling to survive. Her new chancellor,Jeremy Hunt, today brought down the acts on nearly all of her tax cutting plans after it had caused chaos in the markets and caused the British people huge pain in their pocketbooks. On top of the high inflation and rising energy costs which have many here extremely anxious about the coming winter. So, let's try to make sense of this variant British crisis. With Rory Stewart, the former Tory cabinet minister and now president of GiveDirectly and economist Mariana Mazzucato. Let me first ask you, Mariana, we've just been hearing about how she can survive. How the prime -- as if that's all that's at stake. How big -- first of all, let's talk about people. How big is this for the people of the U.K.? MARIANA MAZZUCATO, PROFESSOR UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON AND AUTHOR, \"MISSION ECONOMY\": I think it's huge. It's huge not only -- well, first of all, because of the massive instability that it's caused, which means that then the pound sinks. So, people are poor, relatively. And their mortgage bills, of course, have risen because of what's happened to interest rates. But they're also going to be more worse off, I think, because of what's about to happen. Which is that in order to show that the politicians and the -- that the minister is actually serious about getting the economy back on its foot. They're about to embark on another massive wave of what we call austerity, which we knew doesn't work. Even the World Bank has written articles on how it was futile after the financial crisis to have 10 years of austerity in the United Kingdom. What does that mean? It means cuts to public education, public health, areas even, like, public transport. And what's interesting is that the current chancellor was actually the minister of health in the U.K. for a very long time. He was the, you know, longest minister of health.",

So, you know about this part and you know about this team because you've worked closely with them in various incarnations. What do you think will happen, not just to Liz Truss, but to the stability of this country. Do you fear, as the IMF chief has said, that there may actually be instability on the streets? RORY STEWART, FORMER BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP, PRESIDENT, GIVEDIRECTLY, AND CO-HOST, \"THE REST IS POLITICS\" PODCAST: Well, I definitely think we're going into a terrible situation. I think it's almost inevitable now that we're going into recession along with inflation. I think that Liz Truss, the new prime minister who's only been in a few weeks, is likely to be toppled almost immediately because within a few weeks, she's taken her party into a situation where it has 30 points behind in the opinion polls. If they were good to go to an election on the current polling today, they would be almost wiped out as a party. And most of the members of parliament would lose their seats. So, I think the great challenge now is whether Liz Truss is able to survive a few weeks. And if she doesn't, who's going to replace her?",

So, if enough people put in a letter of noconfidence, that is supposed to bring down the prime minister. But there are rules to try to prevent that from happening within 12 months. So, all those rules would have to be ripped up. And the truth is, of course, they would be ripped up because it's a parliamentary system of government. If she can't command enough of her MPs to win a majority, she can't survive. So, the MPs have the power here if they want to use it. The second thing is that they're than supposed to produce two candidates to the party members. And as you say, the party members only 150,000 largely quite elderly right-wing people who represent around 0.2 percent of the British population. So, the real democratic change, actually, paradoxically is to bring power back to the MPs and let the MPs, who are themselves elected, elect the prime minister. Because although there are few MPs, at least they're elected. Party members are not elected. They just have to pay a few pounds a year and they produced with Boris Johnson and Liz Truss two disastrous prime ministers in a row.",

There is a real risk of increasing numbers of strikes. It's going to be very difficult for the government to keep up with inflation, inflation running a 10 percent. And the government will not feel that it's able to raise wages by 10 percent so people will feel much worse off. And the same time we're in a situation which the financial markets have lost confident. So, there's very little room for maneuver. The government isn't going to be able to get into a situation of being able to borrow more and spend more to get out of this crisis. And I think the problem, unfortunately, is one that isn't just going to be a problem for the conservative government. If it seems likely they lose the next election, the labor government is going to be stuck in a very, very similar situation because some of the options available to the United States, which is the U.S. -- which the U.S. is the world's reserve currency, are not available to Britain.

We have lots of companies making money not because they're investing in a productive infrastructure but just because they're buying and selling, you know, assets. So how do you actually foster a long-term growth? You need productive investment. And when businesses see the market actually reducing, the market that they can actually service reducing, which did reduce with Brexit, they invest less. And there has been a massive flight of business investment away from the U.K. Also, research investment away from the U.K. Research is a key driver of long-term growth. But I do think that, you know, it's not -- well, I would beg to differ a bit on the fact there is no maneuver. We could, for example, be taxing the excess profits. Not just profits. It's not about anti-profits, or, you know, communism. There's excess profits being earned right now from the energy sector, from the gas sector. They could actually be taxed directly because the source of inflation right now is not demand. It's not about wages. There's no point of just increasing interest rates thinking that that's going to dampen demands so inflation goes down. This is mainly being caused by energy crisis and by excess profits in the system which is allowing the markup on profits to rise. And energy companies are going to be earning an excess of 170 billion profits this year. Why not tax that directly and use that meant (ph) to cap, you know, energy prices or also to fund what people need? It doesn't have to --",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. So, one of the trends over the last 40 years has been concentration. Concentration of power, concentration of wealth in thehandful of cities and in a handful of companies. Lots of statistics show that. My take is that basically if you want to have a functioning liberal democracy, you've really got to spread the wealth. You know, you've got to get a much broader range of communities feeling that prosperity. And you know, we can look back on the last few elections in the U.S. and see in places where there was a sense of wealth, a sense of optimism, a sense of, you know, the future might be better. Those areas tended to vote for Joe Biden. The areas where they did not have that, they tended to vote for Donald Trump. And you know, we've seen populism not just on the right but on the left as well. Bernie Sanders is, sort of, you know, the other side of the coin in that sense. So, you've got to start building up local communities. And one of the things that I'm actually very encouraged about is that aside from the political concerns, which are encouraging new production in the U.S. You've just seen for the first time in half a century two big semiconductor factories being started in the U.S., one in Ohio, one in Upstate New York. This is great because it's about building manufacturing. It's about building resiliency. But there's lots of new technologies that are in trained that are allowing things to be done more locally. And this is something I look at carefully in my book, actually. I spoke to Eric Schmidt, former head of Google. And we talked a lot about something called additive manufacturing, 3D printing. This used to be something for hobbyists. It is now something that every industry is looking at because it allows you to make parts right on location. You can make a whole car this way now or even a whole house. You know, I went out into Texas and saw houses being 3D printed in six days for $250,000. That cuts out seven different supply chains and all the energy and all the carbon cost to transport those things through far flung areas and to bring that economic growth and activity into local communities. These are just a couple of examples. But it's happening in pockets everywhere.",

It made a statement many years ago that it wanted to be free of U.S. technology, of western technology. That it wanted to have what it calls a dual circulation economy, which is sort of what we've been talking about. It's keeping production and consumption closer together. That makes sense. To me, China is a bit like the U.S. in the World War II period where it's a big single language market. It still has room to run. It makes sense for them to keep more production domestic. That's all fine. The problem is that the U.S. and China have been in sort of a dysfunctional economic relationship for many decades now.

We need to get Europe onboard with that. And this is something that's going to be tricky as well. It's one thing for the U.S. or North America and South America together which are, you know, a big block. We've got food, fuel, consumer demand. We can kind of hunker down and do localism. Europe feels anxious about this at the moment. And that's because Europe is pulled in many different directions. Britain, in particular post-Brexit feels very alone.

How did we get there? Well, over the last half century, we had politicians of both stripes saying, we don't want to take those hard guns and butter decisions. We don't want to choose between interest groups. So, let's just toss the ball to the market. The market knows best. And what that means in practice is that they tossed the ball to the central bankers. To the Federal Reserve. And the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low, really, for a period of about 40 years. And then of course you got the financial crisis. You get a lot of money being pumped into the economy. Pandemic happens. You get even more money being pumped in. And so, then you get a situation where the economy is so highly financialized and leveraged. And it's -- we've enjoyed this kind of saccharin (ph) growth. And I say that because it's not really the real thing. You know, central bankers can pump up stock prices and house prices. They can't build a new factory. They can't invent the iPhone. They can't really do the new new thing that you need to create growth in an economy. But now, they have to try and bring down the inflation. The asset inflation, in particular, that's happened from all this, sort of, you know, artificial pumping up of things. And they have to do it fast because the inflation is really hitting real folks.

In a sense, these sort of Gordianknots that we find ourselves in where class and race are in meshed. And these are, sort of, insoluble choices. So, this father is forced to a crossroads moment where he has to choose, essentially, to protect his son and his son's future and safeguard his son's future at great personal cost to him and to his conscience and to his integrity. At the same time, sort of, mapped against a moment where the country, the United States, began to lose its integrity in the sense of being hole and undivided and its moral compass in a way. And so, I think what's profound about the film is the doubling quality of the \"Armageddon Time\" within this nuclear family and within the society at large.",

In fact, quite the opposite was the case. I felt myself thrown into a state of cognitive dissonance. Frankly, I've never really emerged from that because you don't get closure, you don't get catharsis. These things don't exist. What happens is, you get a feeling that the world is ever more complex. And that history is layered like an onion. And the more you peeled away from it, you never get at the core. So, I didn't want the film to present a problem that it answered. It's not a lesson that I learned at all in my life. A friendship that I lost. But it had only profoundly complex implications for me. So, I -- it's a history and it's memoir but it's an open book.",

There's a powerful moment involving Anthony Hopkins, who is Paul's grandfather in this film. And he tells Paul, a young boy, to stand up to racism and, \"Be a mensch.\" It basically comes after Paul has turned his back on his friend Johnny when he faces discrimination. How -- what is Anthony Hopkins saying, and I want both of you to weigh in on this. I'm going to ask you first, Jeremy. What does it mean to be a mensch when you face this moment of test of your moral conscience?",

And I think when he says, be a mensch, I think he is saying in those moments to not choose social acceptance and to speak up and acknowledge prejudice when you see it and stamp it out. He's also -- I mean, I think James was interested in the intersection of both being the oppressed and being the oppressor. Because this is a Jewish family that has known persecution.
