      "sentences": "I want to welcome you to CNN's breaking news coverage. I'm Abby Phillip here in Washington.And today scenes of terror, heartbreak and utter desperation as Israel officially declares war on the terror group Hamas. Just moments ago CNN has learned that three Americans have been killed in fighting according to the U.S. government in a memo. The Biden administration officials are also looking into reports of additional American deaths and Americans who are among the missing, some of them possibly kidnapped by Hamas fighters. We are also just getting in some horrible, gruesome news. And I do want to warn you, what we are about to show you is graphic. An Israeli search group and a rescue group says 260 bodies were found at a music festival site in Western Israel near the border with Gaza. These are the images. They show some of them piled up into a tent. The survivors describing Hamas fighters storming that festival yesterday morning attacking civilians with rifles, with RPGs, killing or kidnapping anyone they came across. Now this is just one of the atrocities that we are learning now were committed by Hamas over the last two days against Israel. In response, Israel has now ramped up its attacks on Gaza. The area controlled by Hamas which was -- this was the scene there just a few hours ago as Israeli forces carried out a round of airstrikes. Now it's hard to know how many civilians were killed in Israeli, although a top Israeli minister tells CNN that the death toll is now likely over 600. That number we are expecting to rise. Thousands of Israelis have also been injured. Civilians have been killed in Gaza, including at this flattened apartment building where a girl's body was pulled out of the rubble. The health ministry in Gaza says that the number of dead there is more than 400. Now today Israel is also opening a missing persons command center for family and friends to register the people who are now unaccounted for. We've heard some reports of Hamas terrorists stripping children away from their parents, abducting the elderly, and in some cases raping innocent Israeli civilians. An Israeli minister confirmed to CNN that Americans are among the hostages. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says that the United States is working quickly to figure out if that is true but he has described some of the abductions on CNN earlier today. Take a listen.

So finding out that the death toll where all these young people were outside enjoying themselves through the night, 260, just gives you a sense of the awful scale and the level of brutality.We know -- we understood that there were about because Hamas has given this number, we don't know for sure, but they say there were about a thousand of them with weapons that came out of Gaza. Even with that number of people, that is a very, very high death toll. It speaks to the brutality. It speaks to the defenseless nature of all the people who were being killed. They couldn't run fast enough. They had no weapons to fight back. They were no threat to those gunmen. They could have run past them and then nothing was going to happen to the gunmen. So this is extreme brutality that was executed upon these people. And the numbers keep growing because the discoveries keep happening.

Hamas wants everyone to believe that because the bigger the number of hostages they have, the bigger the amount of leverage they have over the Israeli government.Israeli officials and the IDF, Israel Defense Forces, are being very careful about the language they use, about the number of hostages.

And that's the purpose of this strike group. It is a message of deterrence and it's not just the strike group, which also includes the carrier as well as a guided missile cruisers, a number of guided missile destroyers. Also a number of U.S. fighter jets operating in the Middle East. Those squadrons will be boosted. They'll be staying there longer. Some will be even sent sooner. Not headed to Israel, but again some of those were headed and went to the Middle East specifically to deal with increased Iranian aggression both in Syria and in the Gulf of Oman, so that's their purpose there.

The challenge in part here is that Israel doesn't have a number that it's been willing or able to put out, and how many hostages were taken, how many might be alive and how many have been killed.So it's difficult for the U.S. to be able to get a firm number on that. What's challenging here is that there are a large number, a very large number of American citizens in Israel, many of them dual Israeli-American citizens.

So that's going to severely limit the types of operations that they conduct inside of Gaza if they decide to go in with large military forces, but even the special operations trying to do hostage rescue will be at tremendous risk as well for fear of in fact resulting in the death of a hostage.",

And, you know, the personal toll is a very big toll but for now we just have to put the emotions to the side and keep moving forward. And whenever there's a lull in -- the casualties tend to come in waves so once if there's a kibbutz or a settlement that's been able to recapture that from the terrorists, then suddenly you have a wave of patients. We might have no patients for an hour and then you have 20 at a time.

That's what President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today as the U.S. Navy moves a carrier strike group closer to Israel and increases its presence of fighter jets in the region. The two leaders are expected to stay in close contact as at least 600 people have been killed in an unprecedented attack by Hamas.Here to discuss this is Republican presidential candidate Tim Scott of the state of South Carolina. Senator Scott, thank you for being here. SEN. TIM SCOTT (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, ma'am. Good to be with you, Abby.",

In America, that would be translated into 40,000 Americans losing their lives because of evil. Evil, I can't say it any clearer. Evil attack by Hamas on Israel. Number one. Number two, we should make sure that there is no daylight between America and Israel.Number three, we should be very clear in sending the strongest signal, and I do agree with sending assets into the Mediterranean to be in a positive aggressive, offensive posture if necessary, and we must make sure that the Americans who have been taken hostage, that we put our resources to work to bring those Americans home. And unfortunately, Abby, President Biden paying $6 billion for Americans only increased the price for an American -- I will say, I said this several months ago -- several weeks ago, excuse me, that when you raise the price on an American head, basically, you've just created a market to take more Americans. And we have seen that play out just in the last 24 hours. Devastating news to our country and to the Middle East, and most importantly also to our ally Israel.",

The good news is for the last 10 years, the last 10-year window, we have sent somewhere near $25 billion to $30 billion helping Israel build one of the greatest militaries on the planet. So they have the resources necessary, frankly, to wipe Hamas off the map. And so we want targeted attacks in order to get Americans back.And, frankly, I think you'll see Prime Minister Netanyahu go even further as he makes sure Hamas cannot have another day like yesterday morning in the state of Israel ever again.",
