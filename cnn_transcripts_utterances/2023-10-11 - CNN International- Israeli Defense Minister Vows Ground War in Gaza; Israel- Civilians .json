So yes, the death toll keeps rising. And of course, every day we're seeing more and more evidence of the brutality and savagery of the Hamas attack. And we heard Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, you know, Hamas is ISIS and this is like ISIS. And I suppose as a skeptical journalist, your initial reaction is, well, this is a bit of hyperbole. But now we've seen the evidence on the ground, you know, Nic Robertson there in Kafr Aza, where IDF troops say women, children, toddlers, the elderly brutally butchered, in their words, in an ISIS way of action. And even the Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, when he was meeting with troops yesterday, saying that some of those victims inside of Israel were beheaded. It's truly unfathomable. And of course we've seeing these other stories, who we people we've spoken with who, for example, had to hide under corpses in bunkers for hours on end in order to stay alive, to not be killed by Hamas when they first attacked that trance party, that peace festival going on just next to Gaza. I mean, these are things you hear about, you know, in wars, whether it's, you know from the Holocaust, or from the Bosnian Wars. People kind of hiding under kind of, you know, masses of bodies in order to stay alive. So really quite unimaginable things that have happened and more and more evidence of this, more and more videos and filming and our reporters on the ground there are seeing these things with their own eyes emerging every gay.",

So of course, the Russians aren't going to mess with that. They have a strong relationship with Bashar al-Assad in Syria. But that's about as far as it goes.And if we've seen the way that the Russians have coordinated with Israel over the last few years, there's been a kind of cold peace between the two. They do coordinate in Syria. They accept sometimes that the Israelis will go into target, Iranian backed militias, like Hezbollah, that are operating close to the Israeli border. And there's sort of a tacit understanding that Russia has its interests. Israel has its interests. But on the Palestinian conflict, I don't think the Russians have ever really been a major player.

Given that this unprecedented and surprise attack was clearly very sophisticated and well planned, what do you think that the strategy was if there was one in terms of the barbarism and brutality that we're hearing reports of from the Israeli soldiers.

Because you know, Israel has a strong relationship with the United States that's signed off every year and has, you know, bipartisan support in the Congress. So the funding streams that that support Israel, I don't think will be unduly change. The types of weapon systems the Israelis use, which are extremely advanced, are very different from the weapon systems that the Ukrainians use. Obviously, the Ministry of Defense in the UK, the Department of Defense in the U.S., have a set strategy for Ukraine. Winter is coming in that country and there are plans afoot to try and resist the Russian defensive push and to push back in that way.So these things can be separated defensively. In terms of political time, Biden's time, Sunak's time, Macron's time, that's a different story, right? They're going to have to focus heavily on trying to solve this problem that's broken out between Israel and the Palestinians. They're going to have to try come to some kind of negotiated solution. Not now, but in the future. And that does divert attention away from Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian cause, there's no doubt about it. And I was even just talking to somebody in the region, you know, today, about an hour ago, who said, isn't it interesting that we've stopped talking about Ukraine? I think in terms of political attention, yes, we probably have. And this conflict in Palestine and Israel is going to take all the news headlines for a while.
