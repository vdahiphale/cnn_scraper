In less than two hours, workers across the nation are scheduled to go on strike against the big three automakers. It is the first ever simultaneous strike of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Jeep and Chrysler. And in moments, we're expecting to hear from the president of the United Auto Workers Union about the next steps. So here is what is at stake for you, 145,000 union members and an economic impact of $5 billion. The union is demanding nearly 40 percent pay increases, better benefits, and a four-day work week. And among the players in this whole saga is Shawn Fain. He is that UAW president who has been pretty unpredictable in talks so far and also the CEOs of these companies who say that the demands will put them out of business. Also there is the president himself, President Biden. He's under pressure both economically and politically tonight. First, let's start with CNN Business Correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich, who is live from outside of the UAW headquarters in Detroit. Vanessa, less than two hours now until this contract is expected to expire, where do things stand in these negotiations right now?",

And as you mentioned, we are waiting just moments away from UAW President Shawn Fain to announce exactly where the UAW plans to strike starting at 12But in terms of what the offers have been, General Motors came with a new economic proposal earlier this morning, a 20 percent pay raise across four years, that matches Ford's 20 percent offer, and Stellantis was at 17.5 percent in their last public offer. But as you mentioned, that is nowhere close to the 40 percent that the union has been looking for since day one. And what we expect to hear from Shawn Fain is that they are going to target select plants by activating select unions across the country. That is by design to keep the companies guessing so that they have to try to figure out who's going on strike, who is not. That leaves, though, some workers still in the plants working. It is very unclear because there will be no contracts. What will happen to those workers, Ford CEO earlier telling me that those workers will likely not be paid. But in just moments we will hear more about this rollout plan as there are two hours until this very critical deadline, Abby. PHILLIP: Yes. And, Vanessa, about that 40 percent pay increase that the unions are asking for, you spoke with the Ford CEO, Jim Farley, about this earlier today. Tell us what he had to say.",

We have seen deals come together in the final moments.

Tens of thousands of these people are people that I work for. And, look, they are fighting for the future. You know, it was a couple of generations ago right here in my hometown of Flint, the workers staged a sit-down strike. I think it's poetic that this is referred to as a stand-up strike. But back then, the workers occupied the factories and got that first UAW contract. And as the previous guest said, that led to the creation of the middle class in the United States of America. So, what's happened in the last couple of decades is much of what was gained was lost. And, in fact, the workers that we're talking about actually made concessions in order to keep the American auto industry alive when it was challenged back a decade or so ago. So, this negotiation is really about getting back to that principle that says that if you work hard, if you work for one of these companies, a highly successful company, highly profitable company, that the workers ought to share in the incredible wealth that their product of hands actually generate. And that's what this negotiation is about. And if it does result in a strike, that's what the strike will be really focused upon.",

He's been tasked to sort of monitor this. He's the most pro-union president that we've had certainly in my lifetime, and I think he knows that this is important.But the negotiation is between the workers, the United Auto Workers, and the companies. The federal government is not a party to a contract. So, we can encourage, we can provide support, but at the end of the day, it really comes down to those workers and their representatives in UAW sitting across the table from the companies and coming to agreement. They haven't gotten there yet because they started out pretty far apart. But there's been progress. And so while, obviously, we all want to avoid strike, what we don't want to do is forgo the opportunity to build a much stronger future for those UAW families. And that's what's at stake at the bargaining table right now. Everything that they can gain, as the previous guest, that auto worker from Ford said, everything that they gain goes right into the U.S. economy. So, in the short-term, this is challenging. It's difficult. But in the long-term, whatever they're able to generate, whatever they able to get at the bargaining table will benefit not just auto workers, but it will benefit workers in all these communities where the auto worker's salary is what keeps the economy alive.",

And in this circuit, in the Third Circuit, in the range case, Abby, the Third Circuit has said a closely analogous provision, almost identical for former felons, unconstitutional.

The problem, though, is it just takes one of these members, part of the concessions that Kevin McCarthy made to become speaker, it only takes one of those members to begin the process to remove the speaker.

One is that those hardliners have the support of the former president, Donald Trump, so they can keep pushing, knowing that Kevin McCarthy is going to bend to Donald Trump's will.

MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S: Well, there's lots of different scenarios. A lot depends on how disruptive the strike is, and of course, how long it goes on for. If it's for a few weeks, a month, maybe even two, probably not, Abby. I think the economy is resilient enough to digest that. But of course, if it extended on through the remainder of the year, then the economy would be really in trouble. And of course, the economy is struggling with other things, right? We've got student loan payments that are going to resume. We've got a potential government shutdown. We've got higher interest rates. And most recently, the surge in oil prices and higher gasoline prices is starting to hurt as well. So there's a lot of headwinds to the economy. This is just one more.
