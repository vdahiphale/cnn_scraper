The roof was ripped off by the hurricane and it was being used as a shelter for first responders.So what you're looking at is the roof completely shredded I -- I'd say maybe about 10 to 15 percent of the roof has even left out there. And of course, its badly damaged as well. But, of course, you're looking down as the field, you're seeing the field and a bunch of cards as well as the debris from the roof that fell down to the field. I did not hear of any injuries, but I do know but they had evacuated all the first responders out of the building. Of course, it is not exactly suitable shelter at this point, but yeah, it's a really big -- big thing right where you drive into St. Pete. I mean, you see its lights are still on. They even have light shows going on inside that the changing colors. So it's reflecting off the white roof. Somebody you see it from a ways away and it's definitely a scar left by hurricane Milton.",

First, stadiums -- we saw with the Superdome, which is a more substantial roof, but typically when you're looking a possibility of a major hurricane coming in, I'm looking for still concrete reinforced buildings and parking decks and stuff like that. But, you know, when that -- that type of wind comes in and it's really unpredictable what can happen.So I don't know what it was right for it. And all that good stuff, but definitely feel like a miscalculation when that entire roof comes off.",

You can see this fence. This is the fence between the house that were in our neighbor, three huge pieces of offense came down during these high winds. This piece was wobbling for quite some time, but it did stay. It remained standing. But what we don't know the real mystery is what downtown Sarasota looks like because we know that were only about 20 minutes from Siesta Key and that's where hurricane Milton just made landfall, nearby there. And so that's one of the barrier islands. And if the storm surge, which was predicted of nine to 13 feet, came over these barrier islands, then pushed into Sarasota Bay and possibly pushed into downtown Sarasota as they were expecting that storm surge to do been there could be flooding there. We have had some reports of flash flooding. We have made major power outages here, most of the counties in the dark. So, hopefully, Kasie, people did evacuate the heeded the warnings after what they saw happen with Hurricane Helene. And once daylight comes, we will know what the reality is.",

I see it's around 590,000 of our 845,000 customers.Lots of what were being told we're not able to travel on the roads yet. What we're being told is many roads are blocked, impassable with trees down some of our electoral infrastructure down, unfortunately, and its going to be a busy day to day, just trying to prioritize safety and open things up here in our community.",

That said, the eyewall did travel right across Hillsborough County and that is a game changer.These were the strongest wins that we believe have been experienced in Hillsborough County in as long as anyone can remember. So, you know, the damage out there I think is going to be significantly more than our customers have experienced in their lifetimes and for me, and you know, in my 34, 34-year career, this was certainly the biggest hurricane that I've had to deal with personally.",

That, you know, there are so many hazards outside right now that we would just ask residents to shelter -- shelter in place.It's too early it will take to get the bulk of our customers back. Our customers should -- we are so committed to what we do? We recognize the importance of power to to our community, to the economy. For this, for this restoration, we have brought in over 6,000 utility workers that is almost double the resources that we have ever brought in for a previous hurricane. So, we are well staffed with the resources that we require, but it is going to take some patience from our customers but I want our customers to know we are committed to working 24/7 to get as many customers as we can restore it as quickly as possible. And we won't stop until every customer has been restored. [05:20:03] HUNT:  All right. Archie Collins, the president and CEO of Tampa Electric, you've got so much in front of you.

And right now, were getting a mix of both. We just checked in on those power outages, 3 million customers out across the state here in Orange County, that number has doubled to 80,000 in just the last hour. So, we've been seeing the flashes of greenish blue lights in the sky, which typically means that a transformer has blown. So that number likely will get continue to increase, but I'll give you a look of just here. This is the Buena Vista -- Lake Buena Vista area here in Orlando. We're right in this hotel zone near the Disney parks. So you see some tree branches down. Nothing major on this road. It's also good that we haven't seen a lot of traffic here as well. Speaking to traffic and cars getting back on the road, the Orlando police, their fire rescue, Orange County sheriffs office, as well, they are now back on the roads, are responding to calls. They were off the roads when the winds were at their strongest, who are few hours overnight? Orange County says that they have received dozens of calls about flooding trees down, at least one call about a roof that collapsed here in Orange County. So there'll be heading out to that as well. There was a lot of preparation for the storm though, expecting that there would be the flooding, like what we saw with Ian in two years ago, with Lake Davis overflowing and a lot of the creeks and basins and retention ponds that are all over this part of Florida. The city opened up thousands of parking spaces in the city owned garages, so people could put their cars there to get away from the rising water and the falling trees, more than 3,500 people took advantage of that. But it's not until the sun comes up that we'll get the first look for ourselves at just how bad the damage is. But we know that the authorities, local first responders, are heading out now to respond to some of those calls they got overnight.",
