But we do expect any moment here President Biden, and President Ruto of Kenya to walk into the East Room for that two and two press conference. That, of course refers to the fact that each leader is going to get to call on two reporters of their choice from the respective press delegation.But one of the major announcements that we do expect to see coming out of their bilateral meeting is the designation of Kenya as a major non NATO ally. This, of course, gets to the point of the U.S. wanting to demonstrate its dedication to strengthening the U.S.-Kenyan relationship. And importantly, just keep in mind this broader dynamic where we are seeing a lot of competition by not just the United States, but including its rivals as well, including China, including Russia to really court Kenya. We have seen that play out over the course of a number of months. And the U.S., for example, is concerned about the fact that Kenya is saddled with a huge amount of debt, a lot of that coming from high interest loans coming from Beijing. And it wants to make the point and send the message that it would like to play a role in alleviating that kind of debt burden on a country like Kenya and other developing countries. Now, this invitation to Washington where we're really seeing the full red carpet treatment being given to the president of Kenya. Keep in mind the context here that President Biden had said, had promised that he would be visiting Africa sometime this year. It definitely looks like that is not going to happen. And yesterday, we did hear him telling reporters that perhaps he will make that visit in February once he is reelected.",

And also when you look at even just the menu, the dinner for the evening, that tends to represent sort of a tribute to the visiting country as well, I can just tell you, the starter is going to be a chilled heirloom tomato soup. And then the main course is going to be, according to the White House, a butter poached lobster and a smoked beef short ribs. The White House going to some lengths to say this is a representation of really a reflection of the two countries and the relationship between the two countries. So there's going to be again a lot of pomp and circumstance coming later this evening. But for now, we are awaiting that press conference between the two leaders. Brianna?",

And it's actually interesting, one of the bases you just saw that jet takeoff from, well, there's one right there. I visited last year in Taiwan, visiting Taiwanese forces as they train for this very possibility.They don't treat this as a, in fact, those are some of those training sessions right there you're seeing on the screen, as a theoretical or hypothetical possibility. They trained for it every day, as a defense, they might very well have to put up to keep their island not independent. They don't use the word independent, but still separate from China. And one thing President Lai said in his inauguration speech, which particularly work to the Chinese as he said, in effect that Taiwan is equal with China, that we are peers in effect.

So the Justice Department is suing this company Live Nation and its subsidiary, Ticketmaster, because of the dominance that they have and the lock that they have on ticket sales, on venues and on artists that perform in their venues.The Justice Department today was quite strong in saying that Ticketmaster essentially puts a tax on consumers by collecting many, many service fees and stacking them on top of one another.

In terms of the update really not much from the police chief and the mayor who said they want the legal process to be able to play out. They did talk about the fact that the officer who arrested Scheffler, who was allegedly dragged by the car did not have his body worn cameras, body camera turned on at the time, which is a violation of the police department's policy.

That source telling me that during a recent meeting that included at least some high ranking officials within the police department, they had voiced concern about the charge and perhaps saying that it should be reduced. But they didn't talk about that. And they did not take any questions Boris and Brianna. So we don't know if that those feelings have been shared with the county prosecutor's office.I will say the police department had told me yesterday in response to my reporting that I should listen in today that it would be -- there would be no question, no doubt about where they stand on these issues.

Senator, thank you so much for being with us. You said that you plan to vote to move forward with this bill. Does it really stand a chance of passing?SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Well, it could pass if Republicans decided to vote for it. Remember, the entire reason that we entered into this bipartisan negotiation was at the request of Republicans. Republicans said we want to pass bipartisan border security legislation, they appointed a negotiator, Senator McConnell, the leader of the Republicans was in the room. And we negotiated for four months. We delivered on every single priority that Republicans asked for. The leadership of the Republican Senate caucus signed off on the final product. And then Donald Trump said, stop, don't pass any border security legislation because I want the border to be a mess for this election. And Republicans turned on a dime. Now we think border security is important. The people we represent think border security is important. And so we don't want to just abandon this bipartisan bill that we worked so hard on after one failed attempt. So yes, we brought it before the Senate again this week to see if maybe Republicans had changed their mind, maybe they were going to choose the security of this country, and bipartisan cooperation on the border, instead of choosing Donald Trump who wants the border to be a mess. You are right, as we're nearing this vote, it doesn't look like we have changed the mind of enough Republicans to get this across the finish line. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't hold a vote to try to take advantage of this opportunity. It's once in a decade when we get Republicans and Democrats to agree on a bipartisan security -- border security bill. That's why we're bringing it before the chamber today.",
