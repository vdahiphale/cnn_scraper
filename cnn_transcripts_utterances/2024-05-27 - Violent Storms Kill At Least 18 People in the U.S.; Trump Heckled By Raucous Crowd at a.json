I think exactly how big of a spoiler he can be, and who he will spoil.But given that he's getting up to like 15 percent, 16 percent in some polls, and the margin of error, like I mentioned in some of these states is less than a percent. I mean, that's pretty significant. And so, I think both campaigns you see are concerned about the threat he poses, particularly when you look at that libertarian convention. Libertarians, you know, have real issue with Trump and the way he handled COVID. You saw Kennedy tried to hit on those themes, of course, he got something like 19 votes in the first ballot, right, for the Libertarian Convention. So, it doesn't seem like either of them really won over -- at least in terms of the ballot test on the floor who they were hoping   to win over.

I think what's important to note, right, is we're still about six months from the election.And I imagine as we get further into the Summer and particularly the Fall, it'll probably crystallize to some voters that look, it's either going to be Biden or Trump in the White House. And so, what am I doing with my vote here? And I think that was the point Trump tried to make at this convention when he said, if you guys want, you know, your 3 percent, referencing Gary Johnson in 2016, get your 3 percent.

This was the Tel es-Sultan neighborhood of Rafah.This was not one of the areas that was issued with evacuation orders by the Israeli military. This was supposed to be a safe zone, but clearly, that was not the case. Now, the Israeli military says it was targeting what it describes as a Hamas compound. As you mentioned, Jessica, they say they killed two Hamas officials, but as we have seen, dozens of civilians have also been killed, dozens more, according to authorities on the ground have been severely injured. The Health Ministry saying there are no hospitals in Rafah with the capacity needed to treat the number of casualties from the incident last night. And we have seen horrifying, distressing video emerging, tents engulfed in flames. Of course, this was an area which was housing thousands of Palestinians displaced to the southern city of Rafah. We've seen videos emerging of charred bodies, including the bodies of children being pulled from burning tents. Many of the videos that we have received from our colleagues on the ground are simply too distressing to show on air. So, you can imagine the horror on the ground. We've heard from the Palestinian Authority as well as Hamas, both not only criticizing and condemning the Israeli military's actions, but also criticizing the Biden administration for -- in their words, facilitating Israel's actions in Rafah. And of course, we have heard from Biden in the past speaking to CNN, saying that he could not support Israeli actions in Rafah without the protection of civilians.
