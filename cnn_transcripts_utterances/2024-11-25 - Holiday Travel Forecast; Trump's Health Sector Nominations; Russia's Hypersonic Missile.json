Russia hit Ukraine's Dnipro region last week with a non-nuclear hypersonic weapon. And just this weekend, Ukraine says it repelled a widespread attack involving more than 70 drones. Colonel Leighton is with us now. Always great to have you on the program, CNN military analyst. Colonel Leighton, what are your thoughts when you see the use of this kind of a missile? I mean, I have to think that this is not just concerning the Ukrainians, but all of Europe. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, absolutely, Jim. And that's one of the key issues with this. When we saw that video, it showed multiple blasts. And what that represented was the multiple reentry vehicles that this particular missile has. So it is an escalation. It is a key element in the Russian effort to not only warn us and the Ukrainians of their capabilities, but also to kind of put out a response to the ATACMS missiles that President Biden has now allowed the Ukrainians to use against Russian targets.",

The very fact that they're using what they themselves are calling an experimental missile shows that they have very little in their arsenal, except for nuclear weapons.So, this is a missile that can both have a conventional warhead, which they used in the Dnipro attack, or it could have a nuclear warhead if they chose to put one on there. So it's capable of both. And one of the things the Russians did before they launched this missile was to alert the United States that this was going to be launched, so that we wouldn't mistake it for nuclear launch.",

Let's turn to the role of surgeon general. Trump has nominated Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Forgive me if I'm pronouncing some of these names -- they're so early in the process, but you're a public health expert. Maybe you know how to say your name, but Trump has nominated her for the post. She's a family practice doctor, FOX News, medical contributor who's been supportive of vaccines, including the COVID one. As you know, surgeon general is kind of referred to as the nation's doctor. What do you make of this pick and how it fits into these public health picks that we're seeing the president-elect put out there?",

As you say, she's a family practice doc. She works at CityMD in New York, and she's a frequent -- she has -- she's a frequent commentator on FOX News. And she's a pretty good communicator. And I think that's a big role of the surgeon general. The other role of the surgeon general is to basically lead the 6,000-person uniformed public health service, which she won't have much experience for. But the big public role, I think she could probably be OK in terms of communicating issues important to the health of this country to the public.",

I was really surprised to see that, in '08, when Obama got in, not only did he publicly disclose. He banned lobbyists, he banned unions, and he banned business groups to show no interest from anybody except the American people, and took like 40,000 grassroots donations to fund his inauguration.
