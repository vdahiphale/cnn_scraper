Israel's self-destruction, Netanyahu, the Palestinians, and the price of neglect. Walter Isaacson speaks to Aluf Benn, editor-in-chief of Haaretz. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. Today, Ukraine remembers lives lost a decade ago when police and government forces opened fire on protesters at Maidan Square, not far from where I am now. They were demonstrating against then President Yanukovych's decision to turn away from the European Union and towards Moscow under Putin's pressure. More than 100 people died, a group known here as the Heavenly Hundred. President Zelenskyy says they are being honored on the battlefield. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today, Ukraine honors the memory of their feet, the memory of how Ukrainians can fight for their freedom in the squares, on the barricades, and today at the front. The memory that in the most difficult moments of history, we never give up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It haslost the frontline town of Avdiivka, which it had held for a decade since Russia's initial 2014 invasion. And from there, harrowing stories are now emerging of injured Ukrainian soldiers who've been left behind. As we found, the country is reeling from the lack of ammunition, weapons, and the loss of so many sons and daughters struggling to hold Russia at bay. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voice-over): At first it looks beautiful, all the colors, the sheer density flying in the wind, so much Ukrainian yellow and blue. But when you realize that each flies above the body of a beloved, the pain is palpable. A mother cries for her son. He came from Poland, from abroad, says Lyubov (ph). He went to liberate our Ukraine. He said, Mom, I'm going to defend you. A woman seems to be talking to her fallen loved one. And this widow, Nataliya, moves in for a kiss. Her husband, who had volunteered for the Eastern Front, was killed just shy of his 30th birthday five months ago, when shrapnel hit his head, leaving her and her small children alone. I'm proud of my husband because his sacrifice is worth a lot, says Nataliya. I believe that it's the duty of every man to defend his homeland. Having three children, he could have not gone, but understood that he was going to defend us. Lychakiv Cemetery in the western city of Lviv is like cemeteries all over Ukraine today.",

And they did that this weekend, just as the small town of Avdiivka in the east was falling, to help withdraw forces before they could be encircled by the Russians. At least then they could live to fight another day. President Zelenskyy told me, for every Ukrainian killed in that battle, there were seven Russian deaths. ZELENSKYY (through translator): I'm telling you, frankly, we don't have long-range weapons. Russia has it, and we have too little of that. That's true. That's why our main weapon today is our soldiers, our people. AMANPOUR (voice-over): Back at the cemetery in Lviv, the people, the bereaved, say the nation needs a new call up, if it can properly arm them. I would say they should, says Lyubov (ph), but only if they had weapons. The guys have no weapons, they have nothing to fight with. Believe me. My child used to buy his own uniform with his own money. And here, more ground is already being prepared. The fight for freedom and democracy will be bloody, hard, and long. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (on camera): Well, some are stepping up even more to help in the fight. Canada says it will up its donations with 800 drones to Kyiv. While Sweden has announced its largest support package so far, a record $683 million. Earlier, I spoke to Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba.

The only good news here is that they are unable -- and we should not overestimate the might of Russia. They are unable to maintain large-scale operations simultaneously along the front line.

And the girl that you've referred to, it was a local Polish girl, based on a conversation I had with a 90-year-old woman who was that girl at the time, who lived two kilometers from the camps and took it upon herself to leave food for prisoners at night where and where she could -- where and when she could. And it felt very important to include light. It felt very important to include the other side of human nature and what we are -- what we can do, you know. I mean, it's trying to sort of ask ourselves, as a film, to have a genuine human response, you know, why one life can be considered more valuable than another.

So -- and partly it was to -- so that we get -- we had this -- so, partly, it was to be able to sort of stay away from those sort of screen psychologists and get involved in the interiority of the actor playing these characters. Rather, I wanted to sort of watch them as if were documenting something that was happening live. So, kind of the approach was, I think, liberating for the actors.

And especially since returning to power in 2009, when he began by saying that he would somehow conditionally agree to a Palestinian State, he changed his mind, and his last coalition -- the current one, very right-wing, the most right-wing coalition in Israel's history, even declared that nobody besides the Jewish people has any rights in the entire space between the river and the city. Clearly, the Palestinians stemming again have shown that they're not willing to forego their aspirations, their dreams, their fights against Israel in the case of Hamas. And time and again, this idea that we could simply ignore the problem came back to haunt Israel. But for 15 years, Netanyahu has told the story that Israel could prosper without peace, could reach out to the wider Arab world without peace. And to some extent, aided by the Arab Spring that, you know, dismantled and disrupted the Arab world, Israel was able to enjoy that quiet security, prosperity while most of the time ignoring the Palestinians. But after October 7, clearly, this no longer the case. Now, Netanyahu sticks to a coalition that is very right-wing, and suffering from a very low popularity due to the failures of October 7 and what got Israel into this war. So, he's trying to rebuild his campaign by saying that he would be the only one who could oppose the international dictation towards a Palestinian State. And, clearly, President Biden too has his own political worries before presidential election regard the -- you know, vis a vis, the progressives in his own party that are less for Israel than their parents and grandparents or the Biden generation, if -- the Democratic Party, if you want. So, this fight serves them both politically, but it doesn't get us out of the war, and it doesn't get us towards a better coexistence or peaceful solution in the future. And that's a problem.",

But clearly, there is not enough pressure on Netanyahu to conclude this deal. He's still suffering from criticism in his base towards a deal he signed with Hamas in 2011 to release one Israeli prisoner of war, Gilad Shalit, in return for over a thousand Palestinians, including Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, the organizer of the October 7 massacre.

This obviously was not the case, as we see. But even more so, in the past year, since returning to power a year ago, Netanyahu did everything to split Israeli society through his judicial coup, ignoring time and again, warnings from his own defense minister, from the heads of intelligence, of security service, from senior military personnel acting and reservists telling him that this internal split is a temptation for Israel's enemies to hit, and that's -- the risk of war is almost imminent. True. They were not focused on Hamas. They were focused on stronger enemies like Iran, like Hezbollah, like other Iranian proxies in the region. But still, Netanyahu ignored it. He did not see any risk. He also only saw political risk in these warnings. He never once said, OK, let's check the security along the borders. Are we safe? He's tried -- he tried to fire the defense minister after he issued this warning. And he ignored the military intelligence chiefs whom he saw as supporting his opponents, many of whom were former generals and pilots and so on and then people who were very proud of their military service. And Netanyahu, throughout his career, always had very tense relationship with the Israeli military establishment. His main political rivals throughout the years, Yitzhak Rabin, Ariel Sharon, Benny Gantz, Ehud Barak, were all former senior military officers. And even though he sees them as timid, he doesn't like their politics of, you know, being strong militarily but flexible diplomatically. He doesn't like their ideas of conflict resolution. And, clearly, it came to a head, and the price -- you know, we all paid the price. But Netanyahu, since October 7, has never once taken any iota of responsibility for what happened, both before the war and during the war, or in planning and looking ahead towards the day after the war.",

But then after a while, people realized that this not a long-term solution for coexistence, prosperity, and security. And therefore, they try to seek the diplomatic peaceful solution, which, again, that's -- it's never an end in itself.

The leader of Egypt who went to war in '73, and then four years later came to Jerusalem and eventually signed the peace treaty that is still holding despite his assassination a couple years after. But President Biden is trying to do is to fill in for the lack of that kind of Palestinian leader with MBS, with the leader of Saudi Arabia, and make him sort of the custodian of that peace process in return for whatever security guarantees and other goodies that Saudi Arabia wants from the United States. It's a very long shot, but it can be the beginning of something. And we must remember, it took several years from the Kissinger Shuttle Diplomacy to the peace treaty that eventually was signed when Carter was president, it took a while from Baker's Madrid conference to the Oslo Accord signed at the front yard of Bill Clinton, et cetera, et cetera. So, it's not something that is going to happen tomorrow.
