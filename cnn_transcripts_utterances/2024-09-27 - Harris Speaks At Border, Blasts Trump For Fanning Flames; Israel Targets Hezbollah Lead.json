Let's get right to what America is talking about this Friday. Kamala Harris suddenly sounding like a hawk on one of her weakest issues. In her first visit to the southern border as the Democratic nominee and her first in three years, the vice president says that she is going to be tougher on the border than her boss. It is a direct challenge to Donald Trump and to Republicans who spent the last several years criticizing her for not making more visits to the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what we've seen from the Israelis, when it comes to Hamas, when it comes to Hezbollah, is they believe that military pressure will get them there, while the U.S. has been pushing, certainly in this case, for a pause, an end to the fighting, to get to a place where they can start negotiating so that this doesn't spiral out of control.So, they are not on the same page. We saw this embarrassing situation this week where the Biden administration put forward this 21-day ceasefire proposal, and Prime Minister Netanyahu essentially said, no, we're going to keep going ahead with it with our plans.
