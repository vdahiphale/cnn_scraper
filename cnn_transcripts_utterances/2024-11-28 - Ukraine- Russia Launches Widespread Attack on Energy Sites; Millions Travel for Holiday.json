Happy Thanksgiving to all of those celebrating in the U.S.It's 9 a.m. here in London and 11 a.m. in Ukraine, where Russia has launched a massive overnight air assault on the country's energy infrastructure. Authorities now say it's left more than a million homes without power. Many people took shelter in the capital, Kyiv, where air raid sirens sounded for more than nine hours because of a combined missile and drone attack. One person was injured in central Ukraine and another in the port city of Odesa. Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's power plants and other energy sites since the fighting began in 2022. And those strikes have picked up in recent months, threatening Ukraine's heat supply as winter approaches. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh joins us now from central Ukraine. Nick, this is the second major attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure just this month. Talk to us about how widespread and extensive that damage was overnight.",

A million, you said there, but in some areas the power comes back on relatively quickly. There is some element of resilience in all of this, but the damage as we head into the darker, more freezing winter months, Christina, will be significant. Ukraine's had many winters of this already trying to endure, but Russia's use of the Kh-101 missiles here, a number of them that are particularly fast-moving and able to get through the significant air defenses that work around major cities here, is a sign of how desperate Moscow seems to be to impede Ukraine's ability to stay warm, trying to lessen morale in the months ahead. On top of that as well, though, night after night, Moscow has massively increased its use of drones, normally Iranian-supplied Shahed drones, some of which actually are apparently being made slowly inside Russia's territory as well. A record 188 fired at Ukraine overnight, we're told by officials, and so clearly Russia pushing as hard as it can right now to increase that sense of anxiety, panic, terror in Ukrainian cities. The Shaheds sometimes are shot down, sometimes slam into civilian areas, sometimes aim for military targets or infrastructure itself. So again, sleepless nights for many Ukrainians, Christina.",

Kellogg's plan would require Ukraine to participate in peace talks with Russia in exchange for continued U.S. military aid. It also calls for a, quote, \"formal U.S. policy to seek a ceasefire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict.\" And it would put Ukraine's efforts to join NATO on hold. Trump's future -- National Security Adviser, Mike Waltz, is said to be weighing that proposal along with several others. And this comes, as Nick was saying there, as Russia is gaining momentum on the battlefield against Ukraine. Fred Pleitgen has more details on that from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Vladimir Putin's army advancing on nearly all front lines inside Ukraine, but also as they try to expel Kyiv's troops from the Kursk region in Russia. We fought for this area for almost three months, this Russian Marine says. Thanks to the assault groups of the 810th Brigade, we knocked out these Ukrainian servicemen. Moscow emboldened, now flat out telling the Biden administration, face it, you lost. The West should hear all this, rethink it, come to their senses and admit they lost. They failed to achieve the goals of containing Russia's development. They were unable to defeat Russia geopolitically, the Speaker of Russia's Senate says. Moscow's still fuming after the White House gave Kyiv the go-ahead to use U.S.-supplied longer-distance weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia. We understand the reaction of the embittered, frustrated Washington regime under the leadership of Biden, which lost the election, which did not receive support for its domestic and foreign policies from its own citizens, she says. We must understand that in agony they are capable of continuing to take the most reckless steps. The Russians claim they are not the ones escalating, even after striking Ukraine with a new hypersonic multiple warhead ballistic missile, and now publishing these graphics saying that missile could also carry a 900-kiloton nuclear warhead and reach NATO bases in Europe in a few minutes. On Red Square, people telling us they want de-escalation but support their leadership.",

On Wednesday, Trump claimed that she, quote, \"agreed to stop migration through Mexico and into the U.S., effectively closing our southern border.\"President Claudia Sheinbaum had posted online that migrant caravans would no longer arrive at the U.S. border because they're being addressed and assisted in Mexico. In a later post, she firmly denied Trump's claims that the border itself is closing and reiterated Mexico's position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples. Well, the phone call came after Trump threatened to slap a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada. He said the move was retaliation for the illegal immigrants, drugs and crime flowing into the U.S. A growing number of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks have been targeted this week by bomb threats and so-called swatting incidents. A source says Trump's choice for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, is the latest known victim. Others threatened include Pete Hegseth, who Trump tapped for Pentagon Chief, would-be U.N. Ambassador, Elise Stefanik, and former Attorney General hopeful Matt Gaetz. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Some potential members of Donald Trump's new government facing threats in a series of incidents that took place at their homes this week. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition said several potential nominees were targeted in violent, un-American threats, ranging from bomb threats to so-called swatting incidents when police are summoned under the hoax of some type of criminal threat at a particular address. The FBI and local law enforcement officials are investigating. Now, several top officials were targeted, including Pete Hegseth, Trump's choice for defense secretary. He said Wednesday night his Tennessee home was the target of a pipe bomb threat. Others include John Ratcliffe, who's tapped to lead the CIA, Elise Stefanik, selected for U.N. Ambassador, and Lee Zeldin, chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Now, the FBI said it takes all potential threats seriously, but one law enforcement official who's familiar with these incidents and investigations told CNN these types of swatting calls are quite common and often target those people who are in the news at any given time. When President Biden was briefed on these threats, a White House spokesman said the president and the administration condemns all threats of political violence. It's unclear if all these incidents were linked and how credible these threats actually were, but the timing suggests some type of coordination heading into the Thanksgiving holiday.

You could expect delays for places like Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo as the snow just continues to fall.
