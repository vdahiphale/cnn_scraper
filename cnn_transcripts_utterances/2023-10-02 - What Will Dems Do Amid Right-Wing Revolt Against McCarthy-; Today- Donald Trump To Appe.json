I am Kasie Hunt. It's 5:31 here in Washington where the big question this morning is if and when Florida Republican Matt Gaetz is going to bring that motion to try to ultimately oust Speaker McCarthy. The question is what will Democrats do then? Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  Next week, if Kevin McCarthy is still the Speaker of the House, he will be serving at the pleasure of the Democrats. He will be working for the Democrats. The only way Kevin McCarthy is Speaker of the House at the end of this coming week is if Democrats bail him out. Now, they probably will. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's wonderful to have you.I was expecting -- fully expecting you to be here to talk about the government shutdown this morning. Obviously, that's not what happened. And, I mean, honestly, I haven't seen that version of Kevin McCarthy that we played at the top in quite a little while. He clearly decided to say to Gaetz, like, OK, fine -- OK, fine. I dare you. What happens next? JOHN BRESNAHAN, CO-FOUNDER, PUNCHBOWL NEWS (via Skype):  Yeah. Well, going into Friday night -- up until Friday night we thought there would be a shutdown and it started to change. So, look, he -- you know, McCarthy had been for the last four months -- in particular, he'd been really kowtowing to the hard right of his conference -- the House Freedom Caucus. He pushed all these spending cuts. He opened up an impeachment inquiry, as you said, against Joe Biden. So it looked like he was going in a certain direction and now he changed his direction all of a sudden, kept the government open. And now Gaetz is going to offer this procedural motion to try to get rid of McCarthy. So what happens next is when Gaetz offers it -- once Gaetz offers what's called a motion to vacate, there's two days. There's two legislative days until that vote can happen. Now, there's a couple of ways this can go. There are some procedural motions that could happen that could occur before this particular vote. There's ways to kill this if members want it. If a majority of members want it there's a way to kill this without actually voting on whether to get rid of McCarthy. There's some procedural steps that can be taken. And as you noted, it may be up to Democrats whether or not they're going to do that, though.",

Now, the question is Jeffries is upset about the inquiry -- the impeachment inquiry. All Democrats are. They think it's unfair. They think there's nothing there on Biden. The second part is Democrats were really upset this weekend about how McCarthy actually handled this vote to keep the government open. Once he changed his direction, he just slapped this bill down and said we've got to vote because he was scared what would happen with his own guys. And Democrats were like hold on a second. We need to look at this. And there was no Ukraine money on it, which is a big deal, so they are pretty pissed about that. We have some coverage on that in Punchbowl News this morning. So, listen, they'll look at this. There is probably some Democratic support for McCarthy in here -- some centrists and some moderate guys. The question is here as much as it is about Democrats, is how many votes does Gaetz actually have? Does he have six people? Does he have eight people? Does he have 10 on the Republican side to get rid of McCarthy? Once you know how many votes Gaetz has on the Republican side you can decide how you respond on the Democratic side. Is it 20 votes? That would be a big deal. If it's six, eight, 10, which is kind of where I really feel like where it is -- six, eight, 10 Republicans who really want to dump McCarthy -- then that's a big step but it's not 20.

And Donald Trump set to appear at his civil fraud trial in New York at 10:00 a.m. this morning. He arrived at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Sunday night after stumping in Iowa ahead, of course, of the January caucuses there. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing for $250 million in damages. She's seeking to hold Trump and his two eldest sons accountable for allegedly conspiring and falsifying financial statements and engaging in insurance fraud for years. Let's bring in CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson. Joey, good morning. We're obviously using the careful language of saying he allegedly did this. I think it's important to note the judge has actually already unilaterally declared that fraud was, in fact, committed and has stripped these businesses of their licenses. But it's pretty -- I mean, look, this is a blatantly political move for Trump to go to this case in person on this particular day. Can you explain to us was he required to be there, how much of it was a choice, and what does it say that he's doing it?",

But there's three things that we're going to be looking for.One is, really, solidifying what does the judge's ruling actually mean, OK? The judge said that there was a commission of fraud. The judge using very harsh language, talking about the absurdity of this and really going after the Trump attorneys, indicating and sanctioning them $7,500 apiece, indicating that just the arguments they made were without merit. So in terms of what we look for. Number one, a receiver. Will there be a receiver? That is an independent party that is appointed to oversee the dissolution of these businesses. Why would there be a dissolution of the businesses? Why would there need to be a receiver? Because it goes to the issue of number two, penalty. Will there be what's called legally, Kasie, a disgorgement (audio gap) you have to pay that back? And, if so, what should be the amount? The New York State attorney general seeking $250 million. And then finally, to the other point you made in terms of the licenses, will those licenses actually be canceled? So over the course of today and (audio gap) those are three real major things that we'll be looking to see if they occur.",

Alayna, your backdrop looks very familiar to me having previously spent many a night and getting up very early in the morning to report on stuff across Iowa.Let's start with what you saw there this weekend. Obviously, those were classic Trump scenes -- signing a combine -- although I actually don't remember ever having covered him on a farm. He didn't really do that as often and certainly, in the 2016 campaign. What are you seeing from them? Why is he spending so much time in Iowa? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER (via Webex by Cisco):  Right. Well, I also just -- you noted that sound of Donald Trump attacking Joe Biden. He spent a lot of that speech yesterday in Iowa going after Ron DeSantis, as well, and calling a sworn enemy of the American farmer. So it's very clear that he's still a little bit concerned about DeSantis, particularly here in Iowa. But listen, Donald Trump has pretty -- so far, not spent a lot of time here in this state. He hasn't been coming to Iowa as much as many of his Republican challengers but that is starting to change. He had that event yesterday in Ottumwa. He's going to be back in Iowa next Saturday in Cedar Rapids. And I'm also told he's going to be in Iowa again, at least at one point later this October. And so, I think it's really clear what the campaign is trying to do. They tell me that look, even though he's polling very well and he's leading all of his challengers in the GOP polls --",

He's not expected to stand up and talk. He's really just going there for appearances today. And it is interesting I think. You know, we started to learn a little bit about this over the weekend that he would be showing up. I know Secret Service and law enforcement were making plans. He's going to be staying in Trump Tower. But again, this is, of course, a media play for his campaign.
