Kaitlan is off.Anger, fear, and frustration at last night's CNN town hall, a railroad CEO coming face-to-face with residents after a toxic train wreck unleashed chemical disaster in their town. In just a moment, we're going to speak to those residents and Ohio's lieutenant governor. Plus, a T.V. journalist shot and killed while reporting at a murder scene, and we are learning about the shooting spree that left three people, including a child. And it appears a special counsel investigating Donald Trump is going deeper into his inner circle. But we are going to begin with the toxic train disaster in East Palestine, Ohio. The transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, is heading to the scene as criticism of the government's response mounts. Just hours from now, federal investigators are set to release their preliminary report about why the train loaded with dangerous chemicals derailed and burst into an inferno. So, CNN analyzed surveillance video of the train leading up to the wreck. Sparks flying from the wheels indicate that they may have been overheating and the train slowed down dramatically but kept going for more than 20 miles before going off the rails. It is raising the question, did the engineer realize something was wrong? Meantime, families in East Palestine are afraid to live in their own homes, in their own town, they're afraid to drink the water and breathe the air.",
