      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\" this Thursday as always in another busy news hour on the show ahead, including the damdisaster. Ukraine's President Zelenskyy touring flood ravaged parts of Southern Ukraine, where at least three people have died. Emergency evacuations on an ongoing rescue are also threatened by continued shelling. Plus, an appalling knife attack in Southeast France. Six people including children have been injured some seriously. We'll bring you the latest details on that. And her growing health emergency smoke from Canadian wildfires still is blanketing the Northeast of the United States. 75 million people now suffering from poor air quality, some businesses also advising staff to work from home, take a look at that sky. Is this all part of our globally warmed future? It's a fitting question to ask on World Oceans Day. Our waters provide half of the world's oxygen. How can we protect them so that they can continue to protect us? We'll be discussing. In the meantime, stock market futures little changed on a still very hazy as you could see that Wall Street's after Wednesday's pullback. Interest rate hikes remain a key thing with unexpected moves that's hikes from the Bank of Canada and Australia this week. The Federal Reserve, of course, is up next week too. And in the meantime, over in Europe a technical recession for the Eurozone with data showing two straight quarters of slightly negative growth. It does look to be a shallow recession for now, to be sure, but coming in the face of high inflation is an ongoing conundrum for the European Central Bank. And Beijing, also trying to emerge from its recent period of slow growth reports says a number of state owned banks cut their deposit rates today to help jumpstart lending so to push money out into the real economy. That could signal future stimulus measures from the central government too. Asian markets, we're closing mixed on the day, but modest gains, as you can see there for the SHANGHAI COMPOSITE and the HANG SENG. So as always, plenty to get to through the next hour, but we do begin with the latest from Ukraine. And Ukrainian commander says at least 600 square kilometers of their Kherson region is underwater following that collapse of a vital dam on Tuesday. Ukraine and Russia are still accusing each other of shooting at rescue teams working in flooded areas. And humanitarian groups saying land mines such a drift and floating in the water are another huge threat to safety. Fred Pleitgen is in the City of Zaporizhzhia for us. Fred, clearly hazardous conditions for those that live there, also as we're saying hazardous conditions for those that are trying to provide respite and provide help and support in the rescue efforts.",

There would have been full of children, people out enjoying the hot weather at about 9:45 am local time this morning when this man went on the rampage. And there is some Amateur footage that has now emerged Julia, that we're not showing just because it is far too troubling to watch in particular because what you seem to see is this suspect this young man. And we're expecting more on the details of who he is, in moments, this press conference is about to be held. Who very deliberately goes around the park pushing adults out of the way to stab these children? And we're talking here about pre-school aged children, very young children, two and three years old. What we know for the time being is that there are six people in all, who were severely wounded, and a few of them are now said to be between life and death. It is extremely traumatic for Francis as a part of the world where you simply don't get because of the gun laws, attacks that tend to target children the last time anything like this happened here in France. You'd have to go back to 2012 -- kicking off, that terrorist wave had gone on the rampage in Southern France, killing several children to its school. So it's been more than 10 years since France has lived through anything quite as traumatic in terms of attacks on small children. However, Julia, I think I should add that for the time being the anti- terror investigators have not been seized. There is no suggestion this is part of a wider terror plot. We wait to hear more about the man's motives, who he is? Why he acted the way that he did? But for now anti-terror investigators are -- about keeping an eye but not seized. And the French Prime Minister is headed down to the scene we're expecting, as I say a press conference in a moment to hear more about who the suspect is and why he may have acted in the particularly frenzy and brutal way that he did this morning, here in France, Julia?",

Entrepreneurs are squaring up for what organizers called the ultimate competition for business leaders. The countdown is now on for who will be crowned the EY Entrepreneur of the Year. And we've got just a few more hours to wait and one of those contenders the team behind sun care brand Supergoop! It won the U.S. title with that philosophy of getting the whole family to wear sunscreen every single day. This is not just about summer, and it would crown a busy past year for the brand as they expand into 16 new EU markets through retailer Sephora. Supergoop sold $250 million worth of products in 2022. And I'm pleased to say Supergoop! Founder Holly Thaggard joins us now from Monaco, Holly, fantastic to have you on the show. Let's just take a step back and explain how you came up with the idea not just of sunscreens that people actually want to use versus avoid, but the importance of doing this all year round. HOLLY THAGGARD, FOUND OF SUPERGOOP! : Yes, Julia. Well, thanks for having me. As you can see, the weather is beautiful here in Monaco today, I've been on the Supergoop journey for over 18 years to change the way the world thinks about sunscreen. And that happened really after a good friend of mine was diagnosed with skin cancer. My college roommate was going through a residency and she said, Holly, it's not about beaches and bikinis. It's about that every single day, little bit of exposure that's cumulative. And for most people doesn't turn into cancer until much later in life. But for your friend, it happened at a young age. I looked at the industry it was incredibly sleepy there was no innovation and product. And I literally started to dream about SPF, and thinking about unique ways to get it into everyone, everywhere, every single day routine.",

We are bracing for another day of poor airquality here due to the ongoing Canadian wildfire emergency, the skies around the city taking on a Martian dystopian hue on Wednesday. And as for today's Wall Street trading view, well, not a lot of hullabaloo a quiet start to the session after Wednesday's pullback. Look at that completely unchanged. It was actually the worst session for tech stocks in more than a month but they've been doing incredibly well. Tech investor is perhaps and often nervously watching rising bond yields. That said in context is key. The S&amp;P 500 remains near nine month highs and are actually not that far away from closing in on bull market territory. Once again, that's a 20 percent rise from recent lows. Look, you can see that in the chart there. Now, as we've been discussing this week surprise interest rate hikes in both Canada and Australia, highlighting the continued challenges facing central banks as they battle stubbornly high inflation. It's also a risky period for Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the U.S. central bank, ahead of that important policy meeting next week. Decisions, even if Powell hits pause on interest rate hikes this time around, the Fed will shortly hint that its work on the inflation front will continue. As we discussed earlier, the ECB is also holding a policy meeting next week too. Now IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has been speaking at the Astana International Forum in Kazakhstan, about the path of inflation and the way central banks need to respond. And Richard Quest is there first to Richard, welcome. The good news is inflation is coming down the bad news is not quickly enough. And the IMF chief saying, hold the line. RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Yes, you see, what everybody's focusing on is headline inflation, when you have numbers of 10, 11 percent, which are now down to much more moderate five, 6 percent. But as Kristalina Georgieva has pointed out, it really is all about core inflation. And that is to use that phrase you'll be well familiar with, that is sticky. It's now become embedded in the global economy in different countries, the wage cycle has now or is now on an upward spiral, people wanting more wages, prices, going up, manufacturing, costing more, et cetera, et cetera. So when I sat down with the MD of the fund, I needed to know whether she believed sticky inflation was going to lead to even higher rates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And unfortunately, we were just met with silence, we never got any feedback from them, we never found a path to register. And so when they came in and shared with us that they believe every asset in crypto is a security other than Bitcoin. You know, it kind of made the decision easy; we have to go to court to go challenge this because that's not what the law says. And also, if that were to be the case, it would mean sort of the end of the crypto industry in the U.S. And so we feel like this is an opportunity for us to avail ourselves of the court to get some case law created, that finally starts to bring regulatory clarity, since the SEC is not providing it.

You know, Congress, I think generally is aligned now that there needs to be more clear regulation in the U.S. around crypto to protect consumers, but also preserve the innovation potential. And there we've already seen, for instance, Europe has passed comprehensive legislation. The UK is moving there. You know, Singapore is moving there, Hong Kong, basically the U.S. is falling behind. And I think Congress recognizes this. We just saw, for instance, a draft bill come out last week from McHenry and Thompson that starts to clarify this role between the CFTC and the SEC. So I think we'll get clarity one way or another. It's going to be the courts. It could be the Congress passing legislation or it could be, you know, 2024 elections, something changes there that we finally get to that in the U.S. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
