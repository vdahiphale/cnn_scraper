This is the Whiskey Row boot drop. That boot is going to come down at the stroke of midnight in the Mountain Time zone to signify 2025. Why is it called Whiskey Row? Well, I can tell you there are a lot of saloons on this street today in this day and age. It's very classy. It's a beautiful place. There's stores, there are boutiques, there are bookstores, there are art galleries. The Whiskey Row name comes from a century ago, in the late 19th century, the early 20th century, because there are more than 40 saloons on this one block. And this was the middle of the Wild West. Literally at that time, there were cowboys here. There were prospectors looking for gold and silver. There were also outlaws. There was also all girls who were here. Opium dens, gambling. I can tell you there still is gambling here. There's casinos nearby and there's also upped bedding inside some of these restaurants. But it's been a swinging place the 1890s and the 1910s.
