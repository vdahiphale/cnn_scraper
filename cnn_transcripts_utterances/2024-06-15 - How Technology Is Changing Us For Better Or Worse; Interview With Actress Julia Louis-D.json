LOUIS-DREYFUS: Well, what attracted me to this role was the script, of course, but the script in a very fantasy, magical, realism kind of way, explores issues of grief, death, dying, denial, acceptance, in addition to really exploring the bond between parent and child. All of those themes were, I -- of course, they're very fundamental, and they really appealed to me to explore from a storytelling point of view.",

LOUIS-DREYFUS: Yes, exactly. I would say that the dysfunction that we sort of begin the film with is that my daughter in the film is really the parent to me. And she's -- and I -- my character is in such pain and suffering that she is -- refuses to face the reality that her daughter is in. And so she's making one decision after another that doesn't seem, on its face, is not -- these are not nurturing decisions. And which includes not working. She's overcome with depression. She's selling off everything that's in their house to make ends meet. Nothing makes real rational sense. But I have to say, as someone who played the character, I certainly understand where she's coming from.

And so -- and it's something I've sort of, in my career, have sort of fallen into. These are the -- most of the jobs I've gotten in my career have been comedic. So, I love doing comedy.
