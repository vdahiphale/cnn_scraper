That same massive weather system that spawned a deadly tornado outbreak in the South isn't done with the U.S. quite yet. Some 3 feet of snow has already fallen in the plains where blizzard conditions are expected for the next few hours at least. And in the northeast, the slow-moving storm could bring a foot of snow to parts of Pennsylvania and New England, some places freezing rain. For more on that I'm joined by meteorologist Britley Ritz.

      "sentences": "Quite a few travel delays, Kim, And that is already what's happening across New England. Heavily populated areas dealing with heavy snow. Across upstate New York, that's where the heaviest is at the moment. Rain for New York City on up into Boston which as you know can cause some travel delays in itself. So, the best thing and the best advice I can give you is just slow down as this area of low pressure continues to move on over all across the region.So, we'll watch this closely here where of course it will bring in the chance for snow. But also, the opportunity for still freezing rain as we move through. And of course, my system has locked up on me here so I can talk about what we expect. We do have some freezing rain all across the mid-Atlantic on up into New York. Several reports of that over the last 24 hours. In fact, 3/10 of an inch for parts of Maryland which of course, can cripple a city in itself. So, then we need to make sure that we're slowing down there. There you see the reports. All right, so from all the way up into New York down into Virginia. Numerous reports. Again, several of them through Maryland where we picked up about 3/10 of an inch. And what that does is just knock out power. So, you'll see those areas sparked up there, lit up. Winter storm warnings still in effect for much of New England. These are areas that of course will be dealing with snow over the next 48 hours. So, rain chances will stay on the coast line. We're much warmer there. As we back up and into Saturday, you see the Great Lakes still dealing with scattered snow showers, but as for snowfall totals, the Great Lakes, not so much. Somewhere over toward Ontario and as well as Lake Erie could pick up about a foot of snow, if not a little bit more. Watertown, of course, Buffalo tapping into that. But the higher elevations through the northern parts of the Appalachians are talking about picking up about 18 to 24 inches when it's all said and done through Saturday. Even though we're not getting a lot of snow across the northern plains and upper Midwest, roughly another 2 to 4 inches, that's going to cause some issue with that area of low pressure. We have a blizzard warning. So, when's over 35 miles per hour expected. And that's why we're focused on the northern plains -- Kim.",

We've seen in each of the last two winters COVID cases rise up. We're seeing -- obviously we're in the middle of probably the worst flu season in a decade and we've got a lot of RSV out there still. [04:05:00] So, what happens next is very much up to us, Anna.

CNN teams on the ground say they saw missiles and heard explosions as air raid sirens sounded. And then there's this dramatic video from Thursday. Have a look. This video posted on social media is from the Luhansk region which is occupied by Russia. A local telegram channel suggest an ammunition depot may have been hit. Now neither Russian nor Ukrainians officials have commented on that. Now to the north, the mayor of Kharkiv reports Russian forces attacked critical infrastructure.

Not only here in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, but also to the south in Odessa, to the north in Sumi and Kharkiv. There have been three explosions confirmed here in Kyiv, two on the eastern bank of the river, one on the western bank. And we also have reports at least two people killed and five others injured including two children, all of whom are being treated at hospital right now.You know, it was just earlier this week that UNICEF said that these constant attacks by the Russians on the civilian infrastructure here in Ukraine are putting not only the physical health but also the mental health of every single child here in Ukraine at desperate risk. And to think about it, you know, we were just at a shooting at a children's soccer tournament yesterday. And pieces of a drone strike when they shot the drones down, they rained down near the football pitch where these kids from all over Ukraine, including some of the hardest hit areas were just playing soccer and trying to, you know, trying to have somewhat of a normal childhood existence. And that is simply impossible when they are living with this constant barrage of Russian attacks. There are thousands of people if not tens of thousands of people who are sheltering in places right now at underground stations across Kyiv. Some of those images are appearing on social media. At one point some of those underground stations were plunged into darkness. Here at the hotel, we also lost power without power after hearing some explosions in the area near where we are. And so, this is life in a war zone. This is the reality for millions of Ukrainians. And now after the initial wave of attacks subside, because right now the clear and present, imminent danger is for more missiles to fall from the skies or be launched by the Russians and incoming. Then the danger after that is the darkness and cold that undoubtedly millions of people will now be plunged into potentially for days as a result of this attack. Because the temperatures are really plummeting here, Kim. And so, people have to shelter in place at the moment, then they have to figure out how they're actually going to stay warm and prevent themselves from freezing in the dead of winter even though the official start of winter hasn't even begun in Ukraine. We're still days away from that -- Kim.",

And the bill was must-pass legislation already approved by the House. Now goes to the White House for the president's signature. Among the many provisions are measures aimed at bolstering U.S. support for both Ukraine and NATO. House Republicans insisted on including the language to repeal the military's COVID vaccine mandate. The U.S. Defense Secretary had opposed that measure but Democratic negotiators concluded it was the only way to get the bill passed. U.S. Senate has approved a temporary measure to avert a government shutdown at week's end. Without the so-called stopgap bill funding would have expired at midnight local time Friday night. The measure will now go to President Biden to be signed into law. The funding is only approved through December 23rd but it will buy negotiators more time to hammer the broader, full year government funding deal. They say a bipartisan framework has already been reached. Twitter's new owner Elon Musk is speaking out about his decision to ban some prominent journalists from the social media site.

The controversial Trump era policy allows the U.S. to send certain non-Mexican citizens who entered the U.S. back to Mexico. Previously those migrants were either detained or released into the U.S. while their immigration proceedings played out. CNN's senior legal analyst Elie Honig explains how we got there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: The policy of the United States going back many years through administrations of both parties was that when a person seeks asylum in this country, generally speaking those legal proceedings can take months, years. And people while they were waiting, were allowed to wait here in the United States. Now in 2019 the Trump administration changed that. They said now a person has to remain in Mexico. That could be potentially very dangerous. Because the northern regions of Mexico where people are waiting tend to be controlled in some areas by drug cartels, could be very dangerous, could be a deterrent. This is something the Trump administration was going for. On Joe Biden's first day in office, he ordered his Department of Homeland Security, take a look at this. Homeland Security came back and said, we're going to get rid of this policy. We're not going to let people wait in Mexico. That led is into the court. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
