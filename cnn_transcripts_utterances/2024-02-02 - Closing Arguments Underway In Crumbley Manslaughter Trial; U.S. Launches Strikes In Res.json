It is worth pointing out that the U.S. has certainly carried out strikes in Iraq and Syria over the course of the past couple of months. But this is the first time were seeing them do them both simultaneously, striking targets in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. has made it clear that coming from the defense secretary and the president, that they ultimately hold Iran responsible for the drone attack that killed three U.S. servicemembers and wounded scores more. Iran arms, supplies, trains, and provides weaponry to the Iranian-backed militias that the U.S. accuses of carrying out the strikes. So likely as we learn more about the targeting, we will learn more about how the U.S. went after these Iranian backed militias and trying to send a message not only to the militias themselves that the attacks have to stop, but also to Iran to stop arming and training these militias here. So we do certainly expect more information on the strikes as the evening here goes on. But important to note at this point that two U.S. officials tell us, again, that U.S. has begun striking Iraq and Syria. Now it's worth noting also, Abby, that this might not be a one day operation. We might expect this to continue. U.S. officials have said the response would be multi-tiered or multi-phased. So that means it could go after not only, for example, facilities, but also leadership high-value targets across Iraq and Syria. And a number of other targets, very much expecting a more power powerful series of strikes and actions than we've seen over the course of the past few months in Iraq and Syria, Abby.",

U.S. officials also believed that Iran wasn't interested in a regional war. So it is a bit of a question of how do you manage to thread that needle and now I suspect over the course of the next few hours, well see what sort of targets sets and how broad these operations are to get a sense of how Biden and the administration made that decision. Who do they go after? Where do they go after them? And to what extent do did they go after them on a series of strikes and operations that may very well last more than just this evening.",

All we know at this at this point is that the strikes will be bigger. The U.S. operations will be bigger than what we've seen before. And that could be not just in the number of targets but in the types of targets as well. In the past, the U.S. is largely struck facilities, weapons, storage sites, command nodes that have gone after some leaders are some senior officers, I should say are senior officials in these militias. But now they could try to go after higher rungs in the leadership of these Iranian backed militias. Again, it is our expectation that it is unlikely at this point that the U.S. has made the decision to strike inside of Iran. But, obviously, Iran's reach goes through Iraq, through Syria to arm, train and equip these militias. And the U.S. has been very clear, very outspoken about that connection.",

So this is possibly a facility that has been targeted previously. Atthat time when it was reported by the Pentagon back in November, it was listed as an IRGC site, backed site. This is backed by the -- by the Iranian military. And then it was a weapons store back then in November at that site that was hit. But what we're hearing from the sources now inside Syria, they are saying that three members of an Iranian backed militia inside of Syria have been killed in this strike, that there are other casualties there. I expect we will get more details on this over the coming hours as information becomes clearer. But first approach, it appears that at least one of the strike sites is one that the United States has hit before, at least once, just a few months ago, and it's probably worth noting that when that site was struck back in November, that did not lead these Iranian backed militias in Syria to back off on their attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria. So, how -- how much heavier it will need to be the strike on this side and those other strikes to force a desist really isn't -- really isn't clear at the moment. But as far as we know, so far three people from an Iranian backed militia in Syria, dead. There are multiple others injured. And this is at Al Mayadeen, which is on the Euphrates River, perhaps 40 or 50 miles inside of Syria from Iraq.

MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  Well, I think given the fact that it's been five days since the attack in the base there, I think they're going to be more strategic and I thought they were likely going after leadership first. You heard Oren earlier talk about a lot of different options that they had, but I wouldn't be surprised. However, if not getting leaders in this kind of strike and they're going after their capability to wage war, and that is the logistical supply lines that exist in these trains that run from Iran through Iraq and then into Syria. So that's what it sounds like. This first target was, it was more on logistics. Perhaps, it was a leader that we've been signaling to have some of those leaders leave. But there's still tremendous capacity that the Shia militia groups have within Iraq and within Syria and the like. So it looks like this one though, is logistical base, but I still would not be surprised and the overall campaign that they're going to go after some of the leaders of these Shia militia groups.",

It's important that we keep our eyes on the sacrifice of these soldiers and having that trounced upon by the initial flurry of news of the attacks, I think would have been bad.

We've heard from defense official that B1 -- B1 lancer bombers were used as part of the attack.Now, that's significant because past attacks in Iraq and Syria over the course of the past several months have been carried out by F15 and F16 fighter jets. Those platforms, those jets can still carry a punch, but they are, of course, limited because they are significantly smaller airplanes than what you're seeing on the screen right here, the B1 bomber. This is one of three of the largest bombers in the U.S. inventory, along with the B2 and the B52, the B1, able to carry a much greater punch, than the much smaller fighter jet. So multiple B1s used as part of the attack on targets in Iraq and Syria gives you a sense of the scope and sort of the range of the attack itself. It suggests a much broader attack as we wait here for information on specific targets that were hit. It suggests a bigger attack. And as was effectively promised by the Biden administration, a more powerful attack, one that can be carried out and sustained over a period of time. So again, it is telling that the U.S. used a number of B1 bombers as part of this attack, as opposed to the smaller F15, F16 fighter jets. We've seen strike targets in Iraq and Syria. We've also seen F18 fighter jets from the Navy target sites in Yemen. Again, the B1, a larger platform, able to carry more bombs, frankly, able to carry a heavier payload and that speaks to the intent of the attacks here. A much stronger response to the ongoing attacks from Iranian militias against U.S. forces, Iranian-backed militias, I should say, than we've seen in the past. That was the intent of the administration, and that's certainly the platforms used here that B1 bomber among the platforms use certainly speaks to that, Abby.",

[16:45:10] So I think from -- again, from a strategic perspective, which is what this has to be aside from the messaging back to Iran, it's got -- has to get the results it wants to get. And so, by using the B1, by increasing the size of the attack along the targets, Euphrates maybe dropping bridges, maybe doing other things to hurt, it looks like the original -- the initial signal is to go after these supply lines of go after the equipment and take away their capability of waging a war.",

I wouldn't -- I wouldn't think that we would just go back and strike a previously struck target if there wasn't something there a value. But your most important question to me is -- is this the kind of target that's going to message Iran, all roads start in Iran, all roads go back to Iran and that's the point of what were doing here, is to get them to stop.

And this will give us a sense of the array of the attack here.At 04:00 p.m. Eastern Time, U.S. Central Command forces conducted airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Quds Force and affiliated militia groups. U.S. military forces struck more than 85 targets with numerous aircraft to include long-range bombers flown from the United States. The airstrikes employed more than 125 precision munitions. The facilities that were struck included commanding control operations, centers, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicle storages and logistics and munitions supply chain facilities of militia groups and their IRGC sponsors who facilitated, facilitated attacks against U.S. and coalition forces. So, quite a bit of info in that statement there from CentCom. And it is very much what we suspected. We'll start with the 85 targets there. That is an order of magnitude, if not more than the strikes were used to seeing in Iraq and Syria. So when we talked about more powerful, multi-phased, multi-tiered, that's what we're seeing here, in what is essentially the first strikes a very broad range of not only targets in terms of what they went after, but also the number of targets they went after in. This wasn't simply going after weapons storage facilities or other sorts of storage facilities used by these militias. It is clearly an attempt to do serious damage to their ability to carry out these attacks and to carry out command and control, to effectively be able to function here going after such a number of targets over what it appears are not just one militia, but it looks like the U.S. went after a number of these militias. The U.S. has said it wasn't just one group, Kataib Hezbollah, or the al-Nujaba movement that targeted U.S. forces, but a number of these groups. And at least from what we're seeing in the Central Command statement, that is what it seems they went after once again in going after command-and-control centers, intelligence centers, the types of weapons they use, logistics sites.
