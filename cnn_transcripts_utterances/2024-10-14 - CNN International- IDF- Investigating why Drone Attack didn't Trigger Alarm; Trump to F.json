Just ahead a blow for Israel as Hezbollah attacks an Israeli army base, killing four soldiers and injuring dozens more. Scenes of devastation as Israel strikes a hospital courtyard full of civilians in Gaza. We'll have the latest details.Meanwhile, the U.S. is sending one of its most powerful antimissile systems to the region, as Iran warns it will retaliate against any new Israeli attacks. And panda diplomacy, CNN travels to southwest China, where two pandas are preparing for their big move to Washington. It is one of the bloodiest attacks on Israeli soil since the war broke out last year, a Hezbollah drone attack on an Israeli army base Sunday killed four soldiers and wounded more than 60 people. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited the army base on Monday, and he vowed to investigate how the drone entered Israel without triggering an alert. This as the U.S. announced, it will send an advanced antimissile system to Israel to help bolster the country's air defenses, along with about 100 U.S. troops to operate it. Meanwhile, in Gaza, four people were killed, dozens wounded in an Israeli air strike on a hospital compound where displaced Palestinians were sheltering. That is according to the government media office. On Sunday, more than 41 people, including 13 children, were killed in other Gaza strikes, according to hospital officials. CNN reporters are covering the story from all angles. Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, Lebanon. But let's start with Jeremy Diamond in Israel. Jeremy, obviously the strike by Hezbollah on an Israeli army base is a blow to Israel. What's the reaction, Ben?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it is one of the most significant attacks on Israel since the beginning of this war, more than a year ago, and it comes, of course, following weeks during which Israel has certainly felt like it has had the upper hand against Hezbollah, that it is fighting a significantly weakened Hezbollah. And yet Hezbollah showing the ability to penetrate deep inside Israel, striking an Israeli military base about 40 miles south of the Israel- Lebanon border, and that drone that actually struck the base actually went undetected, no air raid sirens going off, leading to major questions inside of Israel about how that could have happened and why this drone was neither detected nor intercepted.The results are quite severe. Four Israeli soldiers were killed in this attack, and at least 61 others were wounded, eight of whom are considered to be in serious condition. The Israeli military is vowing that it will investigate this incident to understand why this drone was neither detected nor ultimately intercepted. Hezbollah, for its part, says that it fired a round of rockets and fired those drones, at the same time, saying that it was able to successfully avoid Israeli air defense systems. They also talked about multiple drones being used, although the Israeli military has only acknowledged one drone actually hitting this base. We should note that the Israeli military is, of course, continuing to carry out this ground operation in Southern Lebanon, stretching now approaching now two weeks since Israeli troops first went in there. Of course, they have described this ground operation as limited, targeted raids. But we do know, of course, that the Israeli military has now established positions in Southern Lebanon from which it is fighting Hezbollah there. And of course, the question is, how deep into Lebanon will they actually go.",

But the videos that we have seen emerging from the scene last night in the aftermath is deeply distressing.In fact, there is a lot of footage that we simply cannot show because it is too harrowing that strike took place in the early hours of this morning, around 01:00 a.m. according to eyewitnesses. Again, targeting the complex of the surroundings of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital. This is an area where thousands of civilians who have been displaced over the course of the war had been taking shelter in makeshift tents. This has been the case for months. This is an area that was known to be sheltering civilians, and what we have seen is these tents engulfed in flames. Many were, of course, sleeping. There is distressing video of civilians still alive in these tents themselves engulfed in flames. Those trying to put out the fire simply unable to rescue those stuck inside. And of course, this is one of the last few remaining hospitals still functioning in Gaza. It is one of the main hospitals that is providing care for those injured over the course of this war. It's somewhere where Doctors Without Borders has staff supporting Palestinian medics on the ground. And we've been hearing from Palestinian officials at this stage. They've placed a death toll as at least 4 people killed and 40 others injured, but that death toll could certainly continue to rise over the course of the day. But again, we've heard from the Israeli military. They have claimed that this was, in their words, the location of a Hamas command and control center. They have said that efforts were taken to mitigate civilian risk. But again, no actual evidence has been provided to support these claims. What we do know is that the military was aware that this was a place filled with civilians. We've heard from hospital authorities, they believe around 5000 people were sheltering on the hospital grounds, including women and children. And of course, what we've been seeing in Gaza are these continued evacuation orders, which has made the situation four people on the ground extremely difficult in terms of finding anywhere that is safe and secure. For many, they would have hoped that a hospital would be a safe zone, would be protected. Clearly, that is not the case. This hasn't been the case now for some time in Gaza, but deeply distressing to see the footage emerging there. And of course, this follows a series of other strikes across central Gaza. Over the weekend, we saw strikes targeting the Al Mufti school, a U.N.-run school, again, another shelter for displaced civilians, dozens killed there as well. So, a huge amount of concern for the doubling down that we're seeing by the Israeli military in central Gaza. And of course, this is in addition to the desperate situation we're seeing in Northern Gaza, which has essentially been cut off. Not only are airstrikes continuing, but of course, the Israeli military is operating, in their words, with force on the ground there. We've been hearing from many civilians who have said they are trapped. We've been hearing from medical workers who have said that they are trapped. They are not able to leave and escape the fear of their safety and security. So again, a very distressing situation on the ground.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, today, she is unveiling quite a sweeping new proposal. It's an economic plan specifically designed to shore up support among black men. That's a group that Democrats have feared may be sliding towards Donald Trump in this election.And clearly you see in this plan and in her campaign travel this week, this new imperative to try and bolster her support among that group. This plan is called the opportunity agenda for black men. At its heart, it's designed to create wealth, to help black men start businesses, to help them protect their assets. It proposes a million new loans, up to $20,000 to black entrepreneurs, new apprenticeship programs hiring more black teachers, a new health initiative for ailments that specifically affect black men. And she's also reiterating her support to legalize recreational marijuana, which she has said before, but what she's saying today, she also wants to help black men become more involved in the nationwide cannabis industry. So taken together, you really do see this concerted effort. And you know, Democrats have been warning about this for a while now, and even Harris's campaign officials do acknowledge that a lot of black men just feel marginalized by the Democratic Party. They are trying to boost that support. We saw that start last week with the Former President Barack Obama, and you do see in her campaign schedule this week this concerted effort to talk to black men. Specifically, she will do that in Erie, Pennsylvania. Today, she's visiting a black owned small business. She's also participating in a town hall with the radio host \"Charlemagne tha God\". His radio show is very popular among black millennials. The fear is not necessarily that Kamala Harris is going to lose among black men, polls show her winning actually by a wide margin. The concern is that she's underperforming compared to the recent Democratic candidates. And in a race, that's this tight, any sort of slippage could really have an effect at the end of the day. Now, what we saw Harris doing yesterday is really starting to sharpen her attacks on Donald Trump when it comes to his fitness for office, you'll remember she released a letter from her own doctor. It was quite unremarkable, really. They say she's healthy. They say she's fit for office. The real point of it was to draw a contrast with Donald Trump, who has not released his own health records. She says that's an indication he could be hiding something. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is unwilling to do a \"60 Minutes\" interview, like every other major party candidate has done for more than half a century. He is unwilling to meet for a second debate. It makes you wonder. Why does his staff want him to hide away? One last question, one must question, are they afraid that people will see that he is too weak and unstable -- (END VIDEO CLIP) LIPTAK: So, you hear there her trying to turn the tables really on Trump, who had long accused President Biden of hiding away this at the end of the day, is her closing argument, and you start to see her really sharpening it on the campaign trail.",

Officials have said that they have what they need in the immediate future to deal with the response to both hurricane Helene and hurricane Milton, but they have warned that those funds could dwindle. FEMA has already run through nearly half of the $20 billion that Congress had recently approved. They did that in just one week. Now, Biden has said that passing additional aid should be a top priority for Congress. They haven't given an estimate yet of how much they will ask for. But one thing that they are trying to assess is not just how to deal with this response effort, but also plan for any other natural disasters that could be around the corner. There are still several weeks left in hurricane season. So, officials want to ensure that they have enough aid for FEMA, have enough aid for the Small Business Administration to help small business owners and homeowners recover some of the property that they may have lost, and they're pushing for Congress to do more. Now so far, House Speaker Mike Johnson has shown no signs of budging, saying that he will not bring back the House early to deal with this matter, likely pushing any additional aid past the election, but it does come at a time when you have heard bipartisan calls for more funding for disaster relief, as they're trying to help so many of the impacted communities in Florida and states like North Carolina as well.",

Lost you for a second there, but I can certainly get into you know what's happening on the ground in Florida, where it's such a daunting task for Floridians ahead to recover from this, a lot of them dealing with a lack of electricity, a lack of fuel to help them get to those areas to turn the page on this thing, and flooding is still a major concern there.We have Sheriff Chad Chronister in Hillsborough County, who's been warning folks, hey, we're not out of the woods yet. They're still active flooding warnings for rivers like the Withlacoochee River in Pasco County. You have the Hillsborough River. You have the Alafia River over in the Valrico and Lithia area of Hillsborough County, where I was at. And I saw so many homes cars underwater, truly just devastating conditions all of that while folks are still actively dealing with that is going to slow down recovery. And then let's talk about fuel. Fuel such an important resource there, suppliers are working around the clock to make sure that gas stations have that fuel. So, people again can turn the next page in Florida, according to GasBuddy, a tracking website, 30 percent just under 30 percent of gas stations have no fuel, and that's especially true of Tampa and St. Petersburg over in Pinellas County, that were so badly hit. The state saying that over 37 million gallons of fuel have been delivered and police are -- we've seen images of police escorting fuel tankers to make sure they get to those right areas and even opening up public fueling sites, giving people up to 10 gallons of fuel for free. And we also heard Governor Ron DeSantis saying that a major priority here is debris removal that became hugely important before Milton was coming down, because all of that debris from Helene, while those are flying projectiles, extremely dangerous, and we are not out of the woods yet. We're still in hurricane season, so what they've done is remove a lot of the red tape, sizing, weight restrictions for vehicles, to get that stuff out of there as soon as possible. And then, of course, FEMA funding also so important to give people, you know, money to work with to get their lives back as best as they can to a new normal. Biden, of course, visited the area on Saturday, the Tampa Bay area, and he approved a major disaster declaration. This opens up FEMA funding for things like home repair, basic needs and temporary housing. Back to you.",

It's something really Amara over this weekend, where we've heard the rhetoric really quite escalate here in Tehran.One of the things that we were told by a source very familiar with the discussions exactly what you were just saying there, that the Iranians are now saying that they will respond to any attack coming from Israel, that there will be retaliation. And they'd say that they've actually informed all the countries here in the region about that, but specifically also informed the United States as well. Now, of course, all that happens through intermediaries, as the two countries do not have direct diplomatic relations with one another, but the Iranian now -- the Iranians now being very clear about all of this, and at the same time, you have the diplomatic track, if you will, where you had the Foreign Minister of Iran who's been traveling various countries here in the region. But the most recent stop was Baghdad and Iraq, where, once again, he said that Iran, at this point in time, is ready for war, but also ready for peace as he puts it. Right now, the Iranians make no secret of the fact that they believe that the situation here in the Middle East is extremely dangerous and could lead to a wider conflict at the same time, they have said that they do not want any more escalation. Of course, they're also saying that, essentially, right now, they believe that the ball is very firmly in the court of the Israelis. And of course, the allies of these Israelis being the United States. The foreign minister, by the way, also warning the United States about deploying those terminal, high altitude air defense systems, anti- ballistic missile systems, along with U.S. troops to Israel, saying that that puts U.S. troops at risk. One of the other things that we thought was quite interesting this weekend as well Amara is that the Speaker of Iranian Parliament landed in Beirut, Lebanon. He actually piloted his own aircraft flying into Beirut, and there, he not only spoke about Iran's support for Hezbollah, but also gave a warning to the countries here in the region not to allow Israel to use their airspace for an attack on Iran, saying that that could have negative repercussions for them as well. So, you can see there's a flurry of diplomacy going on here in the Middle East, certainly by the Iranians at the same time, they also say that for them right now, deterrence is the name of the game Amara.",

So, the question is, what was the potential target?Now there have been, of course, 1.2 million, at least 1.2 million Lebanese have been displaced from the south of the country, from the Bekaa Valley and from the southern suburbs of Beirut. So, they may be people who took refuge in that particular area. But of course, it's not the only strike in Lebanon today. We're seeing yet again, intense Israeli air strikes along the border area. Here in Beirut however, there has not been a strike since last Thursday. But clearly, the Israelis have they struck further north in Lebanon before this strike in Zgharta.

Now the big unknown out here is when and how the Israelis are going to retaliate? You know, after the April attack Amara, they were very eager to strike back right away.

It may have been launched in co-ordination with a missile attack that was basically meant to distract the Israeli defenses elsewhere.The second interesting part of this is the Israelis are now trying to sort of win the propaganda war a bit more. They've invited reporters to come over the border and look at some hidden Hezbollah facilities that were right over the Israeli border and so forth. So, they're trying to ramp up the concept that this was an ongoing threat so close to their border that they could not put up with it the way the U.S. couldn't put up with such a threat if it was right on its borders as well.

But the history of these conversations between the president and the prime minister is that they reach some kind of short-term accord, but they can't seem to get on the same page for the long-term issues, signing the ceasefire and hostage exchange, coming up with a ceasefire agreement for Lebanon.

Most people just going about their daily lives, even as leaders condemn this latest round of People's Liberation Army drills.China pointing to last week's speech by Taiwan President Lai Ching-Te as the reason for launching these drills, although experts say they were probably just combing through his speech, looking for any line that they could use as an excuse, frankly, to launch yet another round of military exercises. They did the same thing after Taiwan's presidential inauguration back in May of this year. Those drills, by Taiwanese estimates, cost China millions of dollars. They say China spent billions of dollars during the whole year of 2023 staging military drills near Taiwan. So, people around here are certainly used to this. In the scheme of things, these drills are not as large or intense as of yet as previous drills that we've seen, even though China did dispatch one of their aircraft carriers off the East Coast of Taiwan. But analysts say these exercises are still very dangerous and problematic, and a reason for Taiwan and the world to be concerned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHEN MING-CHI, CENTER FOR CONTEMPORARY CHINA, NATIONAL TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY: I think they want to impose a new normal. They are approaching closer and closer, so it's highly dangerous that will leave us very short response time. WEN-TI SUNG, GLOBAL CHINA HUB, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Beijing definitely wants to show force, but it doesn't want to show force to increase so much intensity or quality so as to almost force the hand of American presidential candidates to come up with much more tougher line posture against Beijing.

They put out a map on Chinese state media showing those red blocks the different locations around Taiwan where the drills are taking place, also at Taiwan's outlying Matsu Islands.And what experts say is that this is intended to show Taiwan what a blockade could look like. Of course, a blockade, analysts say could be a precursor to an invasion. Taiwan relies very heavily on imports of among other things, coal to generate energy, so a blockade could very quickly turn the lights off here for a lot of people. And yet, regular folks who are aware of these drills say this has been happening. They're used to it, and they're going on with their daily lives.
