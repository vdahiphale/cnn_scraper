      "sentences": "This moment with the hush money trial coming to an end as an opening to start reminding, and in some ways reintroducing voters to the chaos and what they say is the anti-democratic tendencies of the former president. And that's exactly what we'll see these three police officers doing when they hit the campaign trail.All three of them were in the Capitol on January 6th, and they have talked previously about their experiences and I think they will really start to drive home this idea of the January 6th riot as an example of Trump's tendencies towards anti-democratic ideas. And these officers will hit states including Arizona and Nevada just this week. They will then go on to states in the so-called blue wall, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. And we did talk to one of the officers, Harry Dunn, who told us that, if I can tell my - his - story a million times, he will. And if I can do that, I'll just be doing my part to save democracy. Now, whether that message breaks through amid all of the other issues that voters are looking at this election, I think remains to be seen. But when you talk to the president's advisers, they really do believed that this is a resonant issue. And I think they're challenge is bringing it from issues of democracy in the abstract and putting something concrete behind it. And that's what these officers will do by relaying their own experiences in the Capitol on January 6th. This is a message that the president will start to ramp up over the coming weeks. You'll see him travel to Europe in the next two weeks for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. He'll also be at the G-7. And I think the issues of protecting democracy, maintaining democracy very much on the agenda there. We've also seen him really sharpening his language about President Trump's mental state after the 2020 election, saying that in his view Trump snapped after he lost. That he couldn't accept that he had lost the election, and that that is part of what led to January 6th. So, you really see a toughening of the language, a toughening of the rhetoric, all culminating in that CNN debate on June 27th. Kate.",

And, Jennifer, I want to start with some of the details that we are learning about what might be in these closing arguments. CNN has learned that the defense might focus on who did not testify in this case, Allen Weisselberg, the CFO of the Trump Organization, and Keith Schiller, Trump's body man. How would you bring them up in closing arguments? What would you do with them and what's the risk reward?",

Michael Cohen is the only person who tells you that Trump was in the know, that he knew about the reimbursement scheme. But he says, Allen Weisselberg also new. So, where's Allen Weisselberg? Prosecutors didn't bring him to you? Where is he? Where's Keith Schiller. They claim that Keith Schiller was on the phone when they were talking about these payments and so on. Where's Keith Schiller? I mean, that's the way you do it, which, of course, implies that prosecutors could have brought them and should have brought them and didn't bring them.And then the question is, we were talking about this before, what kind of instructions do prosecutors get? Not about Keith Schiller, who either side could have called if they wanted to. They'll probably get a missing witness charged with respect to him. But with Allen Weisselberg, who, of course, is in prison for perjury, having lied to protect Donald Trump at a previous trial, and who also would presumably invoke the Fifth, right, and, of course, has this severance agreement where he's agreed not to voluntarily cooperate with law enforcement or he forgoes $2 million. So, there are lots of reasons he's not there. The question is, if the defense raises it like that, I have to assume the judge gives an unavailable witness charge, saying to the jury, he's not here. He's unavailable. Neither party can call him. You are not to speculate as to why, and then just leaves it at that.",

So, back in 2020, Joe Biden won registered voters, or led amongst them in the post-election polls by five points. He, of course, only won by four. Go back to 2012, what did we see? Among all registered voters, we saw Barack Obama would have won that group by six points, but, of course, he only one by four. So, this is a very different thing that we see going on here.

And now that all the facts are out, they destroyed their military careers. He's ignored the Supreme Court not once but twice when it comes to the student loan bailout. He has ignored federal law, leaving our borders massively open.So, if you're going to talk about who's a threat to democracy, it's without a question Joe Biden has been that threat. Violations of separation of powers. Violations of the First Amendment just because he wanted to get his way. That is not good for an American president who just uses and changes the law based upon his own whim, his own desires, his own politics. That is wrong. And so I think if you're going to try to bring out what happened on January 6th versus the four years of Joe Biden's presidency, Joe Biden is the one who's not been protecting our institutions.
