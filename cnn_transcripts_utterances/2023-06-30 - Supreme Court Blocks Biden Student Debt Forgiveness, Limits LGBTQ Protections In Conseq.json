He's slamming the ruling as wrong and accusing Republicans of hypocrisy.We're also following the fallout from the high court's other major decision today putting limits on LGBTQ protections. The dissenters warn the ruling may open the door to discrimination against all sorts of protected minority groups. And growing questions right now about the fate of the Russia mutiny leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. Are Kremlin spies plotting to kill him, as Ukraine's intelligence chief claims? I'll ask top White House official John Kirby about that and much more. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. We begin with today's one two punch by the U.S. Supreme Court, decisions limiting LGBTQ protections and blocking President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. We heard the President fire back at the court just a short while ago. Let's bring in our White House Correspondent Jeremy Diamond, along with CNN Supreme Court Senior Analyst Joan Biskupic. Joan, you were inside the courtroom today when these decisions were handed down. It was very tense, very dramatic. Another important day -- JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: Right.",

It said that the Secretary of Education had gone beyond the terms of the statute, said that the Biden administration had engaged in a bit of a sleight of hand in justifying it, something that had actually stretched the 2003 law that was at issue here, and it had allowed for waivers in terms of emergencies.The chief justice said, John Roberts reading from the bench, the question here is not whether something should be done, it is who has the authority to do it. And he said it was Congress's to do, not the executive branch. Justice Elena Kagan, speaking for the three dissenters, said the court was taking power for itself in robbing the executive of doing this and says, it makes itself the decision maker on, of all things federal student loan policy.",

And, you know, coming up to this decision, there were questions about whether the President would continue to pursue student loan forgiveness if the Supreme Court struck down this way of doing it. And today, the President making very clear that the Supreme Court closed one path, now we're going to pursue another. The President saying that he is going to pursue student loan forgiveness through another means, through the Higher Education Act of 1965. This is a pathway that progressives have been calling for the President to pursue should the Supreme Court invalidate this.And the President also laying out other steps in response to this ruling, including a 12-month repayment off ramp -- on ramp rather that will -- where interest will continue to accrue on student loans, but borrowers will face no impact on their credit or face default if they miss payments during those 12 months. And finally, today, the Department of Education also finalizing this income based student repayment program which will lower that repayment from 10 percent of income to 5 percent of income for individuals who apply. Now, the President's advisors say that it's too early to say whether this new student loan repayment pathway will impact as many Americans, up to 40 million Americans that could have seen their loans forgiven under this new plan. But the President making clear, even as he had previously expressed doubts about his own authority to forgive student loans, today he's saying the Supreme Court got it wrong and he insisted that he didn't give Americans false hope.

And he also slammed Republican hypocrisy, talking about Republicans who supported the PPP loan forgiveness program in Congress, but opposed this student debt relief program. And that ultimately is going to be the way forward.Beyond this student loan repayment pathway that the President's going to pursue, he made clear that's going to take a long time. And so in the meantime, this is going to become a political battle and something that the President is going to use as a rallying cry in particular to try and motivate young voters ahead of the 2024 election.

But in Neil Gorsuch writing for the majority, again, six to three, as you said, the First Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and complex place where all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as the government demands. He likened this case to cases such as schoolchildren being forced to say the Pledge of the Allegiance or salute the flag.The dissenter said this is a case more about discriminating against someone, not because of the message, expression, but because of their status.

The dissenters, there are only three liberals left, Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson. They are likely to remain in dissent for many, many more years.

So, there was an argument that the court over read the opportunity for Republican states to even challenge this.

And importantly, these cluster munitions are also banned by over 100 countries worldwide, including key U.S. allies. Now, the U.S. says that because of conditions on the battlefield in Ukraine over the last several weeks, including the fact that Ukraine's counter offensive is not moving forward as anticipated, they do believe that now is a moment, especially when Ukraine is using so much ammunition, that they could use these cluster munitions that are in U.S. stockpiles, Wolf.",
