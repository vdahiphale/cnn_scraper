Just moments ago, President Biden vowed to stand with Israel and condemned the terror attack.This attack came at sunrise. The Palestinian terror group Hamas launched an unprecedented surprise attack on Israel, not just on Israel's military, but an untold number of civilians. You can see here, not even the youngest of children are being spared the horror of the attacks on civilian areas. And video appears to show Hamas fighters taking civilian hostages. There are reports that Hamas is taking hostages across the border back into Gaza. The attack comes on the 50th Anniversary of the Yom Kippur War when Arab states blitzed Israel. And today's attack also comes on the Jewish Sabbath and on a Jewish holy day. At least 200 Israelis are dead and nearly 1500 wounded. Hamas has fired thousands of rockets. And we want to warn you that some video from Hamas may be disturbing, but it is important for you to see what they are doing. Fighters are storming the main border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip and they have infiltrated Israeli cities. There have been gun battles in the streets. CNN teams are deployed around the world to bring you all the latest developments. I want to start with CNN's Nic Robertson, who joins us by phone because he just landed and got off the plane at Israel's main international airport where sirens warned of possible rockets. Here's how things unfolded before I get to Nic. I'm going to show you what happened to him on the tarmac. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I realize that you just got on the ground. But talk for a little bit, if you will, about getting into Israel and what that was like, because first of all, it's really remarkable that you got in, considering how limited air traffic is, understandably so, because of the -- what is going on, the bombs going off, and what is going on in the sky, iron dome is certainly protecting a lot of Israelis, but not as much as people would have thought ahead of time. And we're seeing that from these pictures, and of course from the devastating and horrific photos that are online, and some of the video we played earlier, of the killing and capturing of civilians. Older Israelis, younger Israelis, women, children, grandmothers, watch this. Showing viewers, a civilian woman taken from a car and kidnapped and put into the car by terrorists. And we're showing this so that people get a real understanding and have a real understanding of what happened and what is happening, maybe now in the dead of night, on the ground in Israel to innocent civilians, Nic.",

But this is different. The pictures that we're seeing, the stories and the tales and the horrific anecdotes that we are hearing from in and around the border near Gaza, it's not something that, I mean, people are comparing it obviously to the 1973 Yom Kippur War because it's almost 50 years ago to today. Back then, just like now, Israeli intelligence appeared to have been caught very flat footed. But when it comes to the kind of attack then and now, this is very different.",

They're used to the potential for rockets coming from Gaza.But to have -- but to have gunmen come out, penetrate their communities, surround houses, bang on doors, pull people from their homes. Shoot people dead, families dead on the highway, as we've seen today, beyond anyone's expectation here. People are aware of the tensions. They're aware of the situation. They're aware of the high level of security and the potential risk. I've been in some of these communities that have been affected over the past few years around Sderot and some of the other communities that are very close to Gaza. They understand that they live close to potential danger. But this is not what they've witnessed or experienced before. And what will happen because of this, what may happen yet, is unclear. We've seen, obviously, that the Israeli strikes on Gaza today. Yet what people in Israel will have witnessed, and Tel Aviv this evening will have witnessed. After those strikes, there were still another round of rockets coming from Gaza. Long-range rockets, only a few years ago, Hamas' rockets couldn't reach Tel Aviv.",

We know that you are on the move and you are going to get positioned to do much more reporting. We will get back to you soon. I now want to go to CNN's Senior International Correspondent, Sam Kiley. Sam, what strikes you from what we've seen today? And as you answer that, I'll just give a little perspective. I mean, I'm hearing from people I know in Tel Aviv who are up and down, up and down to the bomb shelter because of the sirens going off.

Hamas terrorists took over an Israeli tank and they didn't just take over an Israeli tank, if we have the video, we will show it as soon as we're ready. There you go. They took over the tank and pulled out the Israeli soldier.This is one of many, many images, many realities of a war that Hamas started with a terror attack on Israel. This in particular is on a member of the Israeli military. Many others that we have seen are attacks and terrorizing, killing, taking hostage members of the Israeli public civilians. This is clearly a very coordinated long-planned attack by Hamas inside Israel. And I want to talk more about that. I want to bring in James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence, and now CNN Security Analyst. Director Clapper, thank you so much for joining me. First question is, knowing what you know about the intelligence network and capabilities in that region by Israel, how did this happen?",

Notably, Shin Bet, their domestic intelligence organization, has always been well-wired, at least in the past, in the West Bank and Hamas.Israelis have an extensive camera surveillance system all along the Gaza. They have a capable signal intelligence capability. So it's really quite surprising, and it really took me back to see the apparent surprise. And as you said, the Israeli is getting caught flatfooted, which really took me back. And I'm also quite impressed with the complexity of this multi- dimensional attack on the part of Hamas. We've never seen anything like that before, to include, apparently, a cyber dimension of denial of service, which adds further confusion to the Israelis and their reaction.",

I think perhaps the Israelis had sort of a stereotypical image of Hamas' military capabilities and did not expect them to be able to mount such a sophisticated multi-prong attack on such a surprised basis.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah, well, they say about 150,000 in southern Lebanon, supposedly buried there, or at least deployed in that region and ready to attack Israel possibly. So what you're looking at is the possibility of a major conflagration in the Middle East if this is not contained. So this is exceptionally serious because, Dana, what you're looking at is not only getting the other groups like Hezbollah involved, but also Iran, which has significant ties to Hezbollah. You also have the Arab nations, and many of them have at least elements within their population that are extremely sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.

The first one from a car crashing into two vehicles full of Palestinian workers and killing and injuring many. The second one was sparked off by Ariel Sharon's visit to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Of course, the Al-Aqsa Mosque is adjacent to or on top of a very sacred Jewish space. It's the site of the two previous Jewish temples that were destroyed.So that also kicked off a major uprising. It seemed in this case what the Hamas fighters are hoping is that through the violent, horrifically successful nature of this attack, they will inspire Palestinians across the West Bank who are angry with the Israeli security forces treatment and regional actors will also step in. The risk is that as we've all been talking all day, saying, you know, Israel will likely invade Gaza in some manner, shape or form to root out the attackers, to root out the network. If that attack goes too far as perceived by outside actors, that's when you could see what Israel calls the Ring of Fire around it attacking. Hezbollah with its 100,000 plus missiles to the North in Lebanon, Syrian militants with missiles also supplied by Iran according to Middle East officials.

They've already carried out airstrikes hitting terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. Kim, mentioned a ground incursion. I think there are a lot of people who think that's likely, but that's an incredible risk in and of itself. That is difficult urban warfare in one of the most densely populated areas on earth where Hamas has the advantage. In Gaza, you are stepping into that and putting your troops into that, where they have a clear advantage as opposed to in Israel, which we saw this morning, where you're supposed to have the advantage.

They knew they had to, in essence, use couriers and other more primitive means to communicate with each other.And when they did that, they were able to, it looks like, prevent the Israelis from really learning what they were up to.

And the very fact that they were able to do this, I think, indicates that they went low-tech in order to prevent high-tech means of detection.
