Thousands of the faithful have converged on St. Peter's Square for Easter mass currently underway. You see it there. Pope Francis is presiding over the service.Now, he did not walk in the traditional procession, but instead arrived in a wheelchair. He will soon deliver his traditional Easter blessing. Now, the 86-year-old pontiff has been recovering from bronchitis after being hospitalized last week. Later in the show, we will head live to the Vatican for a report. Now, Easter is also being observed in Jerusalem today along with Passover and Ramadan. But the ceremonies have been overshadowed by a recent surge in violence right across the region. Just hours ago, Israel carried out a new wave of attacks in Syrian territory this time and it released this video. You see it there, which appears to show strikes on a Syrian military compound, radar systems and artillery posts. Israel says it launched the strikes after rockets were fired from Syria toward Israeli controlled territory. It's just the latest escalation of tensions since Israeli forces stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem multiple times last week. We are covering all the angles of the story for you. CNN Salma Abdelaziz is in Jerusalem, and Scott McLean is in Beirut. Salma, to you first. I mean, let us know what is happening at this hour in the Old City.

After the police raid on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, outrage came in the form of almost three dozen rockets fired across the border from southern Lebanon, where Palestinian refugee camps have for decades sheltered tens of thousands of displaced people. On Friday, Israel responded, targeting the weapons and the Palestinian militant groups they say launched them.(On camera): This is an irrigation channel running through this banana field. This used to be a bridge over top of it, leading to a hotel by the sea. It obviously took a direct hit. Locals say the force was so intense that it shook their homes. They also insist that this would not have been a good place to store weapons. (Voice-over): The aftermath attracted a crowd of local residents and farmhands, among them Haliel El Ray (ph), who makes no apologies for the rockets fired at Israel. This is a response, he says. This, at the very least, is a message that we, as the Lebanese people, stand for resistance. Do you want peace with Israel? I asked him. Of course not, he says. Just down the road, though, it is a much different story. Abdul Halad Abdul Satur (ph), a Syrian refugee, shows us the shrapnel he's collected from the blast that left a hole in the roof of his farmhouse. His kids were sleeping here at the time. Me, my wife and young kids, he says. I couldn't calm them down. We left Syria to flee the shelling, and now this. He walked us through the orange grove, past more and more disturbed earth. (On camera): The house that was hit by shrapnel is about 200 yards away from here. It seems far until you see the size of the crater. Abdul Sauter says there were no weapons here. Incredibly, the only living casualties were the orange trees, some ripped apart at the trunk. Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility for any of the rockets fired from Lebanon. Neither has any Palestinian armed group. The Lebanese army vowed to stop the attacks and located and dismantled several rocket launchers and rockets hidden amongst the hillsides and terrorist orchards. On Saturday, they found one more, though no sign a new attack was on the way, at least for now. (END VIDEOTAPE) So, Paula, we went to the town where the Lebanese army said that some of these rockets from Lebanon were actually fired at Israel, and we couldn't find any locals willing to talk to us on camera. But one man did tell us that he doesn't support any kind of escalation. He said, frankly, when his son feels scared, so does he. He said that now is simply not the time.",

In fact, it's becoming even more contentious. The Justice Department will appeal a decision by a Trump appointed judge in Texas to take an abortion drug off the market, even though it's been widely available for decades and is considered extremely safe for women. Now, less than an hour after that ruling, an Obama appointed judge in Washington state ordered the federal government to keep the same drug available in 17 states plus the District of Columbia.

About an hour later, we have a different federal judge in Washington state saying, I hereby order that this drug remain available 17 states plus Washington, D.C. that brought this lawsuit. You cannot reconcile those two things. This is a classic case that will make its way up to the Supreme Court.If you're wondering, how on earth could this judge overturn essentially the FDA's approval when the FDA approved it 23 years ago and it's been approved since then, you're asking the right question. It is very shaky, questionable legal decision by this judge. I think it's sort of a picture of what some people call judicial activism. He's inserting his own medical judgment. He's not a doctor. He's a judge for the FDA. And he's saying, basically, I know better than they've known for the last 23 years. And that should, let's note, that covers Republican and democratic administration. So I think there's a real legal weakness here, but it'll ultimately be up to the supreme court. We know they overturned Roe v. Wade last year, but I should say there were some indications in the Dobbs decision that we may not have the same six three outcome on this separate question of medication. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Let's take a look at how those numbers have climbed. As you can see, the numbers have gotten much larger over the years. Right now, more than 53% of abortions in the U.S. They're done with medication. They're done with pills. They're not done by surgery.And if we take a look at safety, these pills have an excellent safety profile. If you look at mifepristone, for every million women who take it, there will be five deaths. If you look at penicillin, for every million people who take it, there will be 20 deaths. If you look at Viagra, for every million patients that take it. There will be 49 deaths. If the ruling from the Texas judge stands, that means that women across the country would lose access to this medication. In addition, there could be another effect. If the judge's ruling stands, pharmaceutical companies might say, wait a minute, we're investing millions and millions of dollars into research and development for drugs. The FDA looks at it. They're outside advisors. All these scientists look at it. And now we need to worry that a single judge, not even a scientist, that a single judge can just pull it off the market. It could definitely discourage them from investigating and from researching new drugs. And that could affect us all. Back to you.",

The bills that they want to pass are essentially dead-on arrival, and they can. And some already have begun applying pressure on the Biden administration to appeal the ruling. But legislatively, there isn't much that Congress can do. Schumer did say, however, that Senate Democrats remain committed to passing the Women's Health Protection Act, which is a bill aimed at preserving abortion access nationwide. But that legislation failed to pass last year due to the balance of power in Congress and remains unlikely to pass now, given that Republicans control the House and Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate.

Because, of course, he's getting over bronchitis, and that's not something that you want to do to an 86- year-old pope who's getting over bronchitis, put him out in the cold at night. So while this has been a very challenging week because there's been many, many events for the Pope, we've seen that he has been up to it. Certainly compared to Saturday when he got out of the hospital, he seems to be in good spirits. Of course, when he got out of the hospital, I had a chance to ask him how he was feeling and he said, still alive. You know, he jokes about his health, but obviously his main problem right now is the mobility one. He has to really move around with a wheelchair. He doesn't say mass because he can't stand for long periods of time behind the altar. So you'll see him now, he'll give the \"Urbi et Orbi\" address, as you mentioned, when he talks about various conflicts in the world. And normally he'll do that from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica up there. So he'll have to go back around and up and elevator. But certainly in terms of his health, yes, Pope Francis is a toughie, Paula. I mean, he's 86 years old, and so he's older than either John Paul II or Benedict XVI when they were Pope.

And that's the peace deal that brought an end to decades of sectarian violence. It established a power sharing government in Northern Ireland comprised of both unionists and Republicans. But it's worth revisiting how the agreement came about.Now, in 1993, key leaders from Ireland's nationalist movement began talks aimed at ending the violence. An IRA ceasefire in 1994 allowed for peace talks to begin. The next year, representatives from Ireland's Republican Sinn Fein party met with a British government minister and that was the first time in 23 years. Now, the IRA ended its ceasefire for a time, but it was reinstated in 197, paving the way for Sinn Fein to take part in multiparty talks at Storma (ph). And finally, one year later, the Good Friday Agreement was signed and endorsed through a historic referendum. But ahead of this year's anniversary, police are now on high alert, deploying, \"significant forces\" this Easter weekend. And they're warning of possible disorder, even terrorist activity from dissident Republicans. Now, a top officer says these measures haven't been necessary for years. Joining us now is Katy Hayward. She is a Professor of Political sociology at Queen's University in Belfast. And it is really good to have you. Tell us your perspective after this deal is now a quarter century. I mean, we just heard about the heightened concerns, but, you know, I have to underscore a few thought that this peace agreement could even get done, let alone survive 25 years. Of course, the agreement isn't perfect, but, you know, give us some insight into how it's transformed Northern Ireland. KATY HAYWARD, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY, QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY: Yes, as you say, the lead up to the agreement was one of on and off doubts as to whether ceasefires could hold, whether the parties could be in a room together. So when we finally crossed the line, when the announcement was made that Good Friday, it seemed not only a sense of joy, but also relief. And since then, of course, we have had many ups and downs in the peace process. The paramilitary organizations, as you say, continue to exist. In particular, they exert control and intimidation amongst the most vulnerable communities. And we also have a situation in which the power sharing institutions haven't functioned for too much of the time, I think, in the past 25 years. And yet we have seen society transformed. We don't have political violence and we have a new generation who almost take peace for granted. They think of Northern Ireland as a fairly normal society. And I teach in Queens University. And it's a real privilege to be able to teach them not only about the conflict, which they have no memory of, but also about the agreement and what it means for them and how they still have to -- they have hope for the future and indeed still need to achieve those ambitions that were set out 25 years ago in terms of reconciliation.",

So, I mean, we should remember 25 years ago it was the Moderate, Unionist and Nationalist parties as well as the others, but the two largest parties were the moderate parties and they were over taken within a few years by the more hardline parties in Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party.And so on the political scene, we've seen some polarization. It's the hardline parties that have been dominant. On the ground, however, it's slightly different. So there has been an emergence of a situation in which most people in Northern Ireland say that they are neither Unionist nor nationalist. And this isn't just true amongst the younger generation, although it is particularly true amongst them. The question is how do we have a situation in which that political system reflects that? And this is a question we have now 25 years on. So in the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, which is the Social Attitude survey in Northern Ireland, we ask people about this, 7 out of 10 people in Northern Ireland say yes. The Good Friday Agreement remains the best basis for governing Northern Ireland. However, we see a majority now saying that it does need to be reformed in a way that reflects the fact that so many people now consider themselves in terms other than Unionist and nationalist.",

Getting the political parties in the same room, making sure that they bring the hardliners with them, and the confidence and courage that was needed amongst political leadership, all of that is important to bear in mind.I think we can also take lessons from what hasn't happened in Northern Ireland, so that commitment to reconciliation still remains outstanding. We haven't dealt properly with the legacy of the past. There are still competing narratives about the cause of the troubles, and indeed, there's not much of a common voice as to what Northern Ireland's future should be. And so I think a focus on what's needed at community level was particularly reaching out to those most vulnerable sections of society that continue to suffer multiple deprivation, particularly in economic terms, trying to address those social issues, those economic issues, as well as the political ones. That would be a lesson, I think, from this peace process. And that would also ones that we still need to address here in Northern Ireland, looking ahead to the next 25 years, and how to ensure that the peace remains as strong as possible.",

They finished up the second round in the morning before starting the third, but just constant rain started causing some puddles on the greens, making the course unplayable. Play was halted just after three eastern in the afternoon, and many of the guys, they were just happy the day was over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADAM SCOTT, 2013 MASTERS CHAMPION: I mean, I feel like I just survived. SAHITH THEEGALA, 1-OVER PAR AFTER SATURDAY'S PLAY: It was brutal this morning because it's just so cold. MACKENZIE HUGHES, 1-OVER PAR AFTER SATURDAY'S PLAY: It felt like a different sport today, you know, dealing with all the elements in the cold rain. CAMERON YOUNG, 4 -UNDER FAR AFTER SATURDAY'S PLAY: It's basically impossible. I don't really know what you're supposed to do. It's playing so long. SHANE LOWRY, 2019 OPEN CHAMPION: You're out there this morning. It's freezing. So it's interesting. It's mad here. The weather can change here. Yeah. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Two bogeys, two double bogeys so far. And he's in last place among the players who made the cut, Paula. So tough seeing Tiger out there in these conditions. And, you know, obviously he's not 100% still limping around after that car accident.",

So, you know, a lot of things can happen.If I was going to put my finger on someone who's going to kept him as the guy who's playing with him, Jon Rahm, he was one of the favorites going into this tournament. And, you know, with the way he plays, he can catch anybody. And those par fives, they make things very interesting. But with the weather good today, we'll see if Koepka can give back those strokes. But they're going to resume that third round at 8:30 Eastern today, Paula. Final round expected to start around 12:30 this afternoon. And they're going to go off in pairs, off split tease to try to get the thing completed today.",
