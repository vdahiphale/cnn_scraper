It's not saying how close these planes were to one another, but the early data from flight radar 24 says these flights came as close as a mile apart. Not the closest we have seen, but this is an incident - the type of incident that keeps happening over and over again. Remember, air traffic controllers are fatigued, overworked, understaffed, and the current FAA reauthorization bill going through Congress calls for maximum air traffic control hiring, but Congress stopped short of passing that this week, instead passing a one-week extension of the current plan. Clearly, these controllers need a little bit of help, all they can get from Congress right now.",

You can see where Ukraine retook a little bit of ground in the so-called counteroffensive, but Russia has taken a little bit of that back. How does Ukraine hold the line through the summer? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, John, that's going to be a really tough thing for the Ukrainians to do. And as Jim pointed out in his reporting, one of the key things that has to happen is a lot of the munitions, weapon systems, material that has been promised in this aid package that the U.S. Congress finally passed, that has to get to the front lines. And if the Ukrainians are going to do something to keep the territory that they've got, they've basically got stop the Russians in their tracks. And that's going to be really difficult to do given the fact that the Ukrainians are being outgunned by the Russians depending on which specific area you look at. Anywhere from four to one to ten to one in terms of the ratio of mutations that are being fired at Ukrainian positions versus what the Ukrainians are firing at the Russian positions. So, this is a tall order for the Ukrainians to do. They can hold the line because the Russians haven't exploited a lot of the things that they could have exploited in the areas around Avdiivka (ph), for example.

We're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells,\" he said, \"that have been used.\"The reason I'm highlighting artillery shells is because we know there had been paused shipments of bombs, which can obviously be used for planes.

But they're going to have to use some of the stockpiles that they already have and they're going to have to be able to, in essence, use more specific, more targeted aspects of their operations. In other words, special operations forces, things like that are going to come into play, as opposed to just lobbing artillery shells or using bombs from air platforms, such as the Israeli air force does. So, the 2,000-pound bombs are out because of the fact that they can hit a large area even though they are precise weapons. They can still have a major effect on a populated area.
