Then, relentless bombardment just miles from the brutal frontlines, the reality on the ground in Ukraine. And then later, flying in the face of protesters. Israel takes a step closer to controversial judicial overhaul, what it can mean for the country's economy. But first tonight, in the skies over the Black Sea, a potentially dangerous confrontation. The U.S. says a Russian fighter jet has forced down an American surveillance drone, similar to this one you're looking at. First, by spraying it with fuel and then colliding with it. It happened in international airspace -- and it's important to point that out. In an area where the U.S. has been operating surveillance drone since Russia's war on Ukraine began. The Pentagon's description of the confrontation basically, this was likely no accident. So, I want to turn now to Georgetown University, Professor Jill Dougherty, she's a CNN contributor on Russian Affairs and a former CNN Moscow Bureau chief. Jill, great to have you on the show, and I think it's important to point out to our viewers that we have yet to hear from the Russians on this. But first, just your sense of how you understand this played out or what this potentially means here.",

And if thereports are correct that Russian fighter jet or fighter jets poured fuel on that drone and then hit its propeller, it does very much look, you know, on purpose. So, we'll have to get more details. But I've been looking at the Russian media to see whether there is any type of comment, and they're playing it very carefully, they're quoting western media. But there is a hint in some of the reporting about what you might, you know, a lesson you might draw from this. And that is that Russia has been insisting that even though the United States, the West, NATO say that they are not parties to this war in Ukraine, they are parties to hostilities. And it could be, it could be a way of Russia to kind of send that message that, yes, you are very much a part of this conflict, and we are going to take action. I think one thing to remember is Russia has done things similar to this, you know? In the Baltic region, there have been close flights by Russian fighter jets, NATO had to scramble jets to in track and intercept Russian fighter jets over a period of months and years. But the thing that the Russians do, and this is where it gets dangerous, is they appear to rely on the United States to be the responsible party. And that is not always guaranteed, but that's what they seem to be doing, playing with fire and then hoping that the Americans will not retaliate.",

But I think the issue right now is, they don't really know what to say, because the defense ministry apparently has not said anything. You would expect that the Americans would call in the Russian ambassador, who would want some clarification, and this is one of the problems, Isa. You know, in this -- in this conflict, which the United States is not a party to. But because relations have been so bad, there's very little communication. And that's where things can get dangerous too. Remember, in Syria, during the Syria conflict, at the beginning, at least, and I think continuing to today, there are efforts at de-confliction, as it's called, to make sure the other side knows what's happening, and to communicate.

In the meantime Jill, always appreciate it, thanks very much. Well, Ukraine's president says his country's future is being decided right now on the eastern frontlines. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukrainian defense forces will destroy Russia's military power. But the fighting is very tough and painful. We are seeing that in Bakhmut, we've been seeing it for weeks now. Wagner fighters are now fighting around a sprawling metalwork plant there. Ukrainian forces are holding their positions, now keeping Russian forces from encircling the city. But Ukraine says Wagner units are making moves outside of Bakhmut, attacking other areas, really in the Donetsk region. Well, hours ago, a Russian cruise missile plowed into a residential area in the city of Kramatorsk. Ivan Watson walks us through the wreckage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Just hours after what Ukrainian authorities say was a deadly Russian strike on this apartment block, ordinary people are already hard at work with the cleanup. There are no tears here, there are no complaints, even though at least, one person was killed and several people injured. \"When it exploded, boom, I was knocked on the floor and blood came down my forehead\", 76-year-old Simeon(ph) tells me. \"But I was lucky. These two pieces of shrapnel hit the wall and just missed my head.\" (voice-over):  It is simply part of life in this eastern Ukrainian city. It is located some 25 kilometers, about 15 miles away from a very active frontline. And Kramatorsk has been the repeated target of deadly Russian missiles and rockets. The blast shattered nearly all the windows across the courtyard from the main impact point here at kindergarten number 49. You can see that there are a lot of volunteers, a lot of school teachers, who are here, hard at work, cleaning up the glass staunch, putting up plywood that's been donated by the administration here. The director of the school tells me, she says that she was knocked to the ground by the force of the blast this morning. (on camera):  Thankfully, mercifully, there were no children in this school when this explosion took place. The director says that the school's basically been closed for some six months now, and that the children have all been evacuated to safer places. This is yet another grim reminder of the terrible dangers, the hazards that people are living with every day here in eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Isa, in short, incredibly quick. Think about the fact that this government only came into power essentiallyat the beginning of this year, and they want this entire massive judicial overhaul, the most significant changes in the Israeli judiciary, since its founding to be done essentially by the end of the month. There could be the second and third readings on all of these amendments within essentially the next ten days. That is an incredible speed for something of such significance. Now, as you noted last night, was the first vote on two of the most key elements of this reform. The most important of them is what's essentially known as the override clause. That is allowing the Israeli parliament to overturn supreme court decisions with a simple majority. In fact, included in this amendment, when you read, it's the possibility for the parliament to essentially write into a bill ahead of time that it will be immune from any sort of Supreme Court decision. They also want to increase the number of judges required to overturn a law from a simple majority today to 12 of the 15 sitting judges. And then the second element is being essentially considered by the opposition as something specific for Benjamin Netanyahu. It's essentially an amendment that says that the only way a sitting prime minister can be called unfit for office is only for mental or physical reasons, and must be decided upon by essentially a super majority of the sitting cabinet. That's partly because Benjamin Netanyahu, as we all know, is facing an ongoing corruption trial. There's already a petition in front of the Supreme Court to consider him unfit for office, because of the elements surrounding this ongoing corruption trial. Now, supporters of these reforms say that they have -- they're a long-time coming, they're a long-time needed, they need to rebalance essentially the branches of government that the Supreme Court has become too powerful as meddling in issues of the state. But as you noted, there's a lot of opposition to these reforms. You've seen hundreds of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets, more protests are planned this week. They see this as the end of the independence of the Israeli judiciary, and many of them see this as essentially a personal thing for Benjamin Netanyahu, to help get him out of his ongoing corruption trial. I should say this is something that he vehemently denies. But the protests will continue. And in fact, protesters are planning to meet Netanyahu in Berlin. He's supposed to travel there tomorrow for an official visit. Israeli saying that they will protest that visit, in addition to ongoing protests planned here the rest of this week.",

I do think that what we're hearing from the business community, from the Bank of Israel, from the -- from the Israeli military and security establishment, that must have an effect. And we are getting some reports in recent days that there might be some sort of crack, some sort of possibility for a compromise. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog, has been working day and night, trying to get people around the table to have a compromise. He gave a very impassioned speech last week where he essentially, for the first time, came out against these reforms, said that they threatened the foundations of Israeli democracy, and saying that this country is at a point of no return. Essentially, begging people to come around the table, sit down, to come to some sort of negotiation, saying there is room for reforms, but we have to sit down and work on these together, because if you don't get all of the country on board to them, then it could have a disastrous effect, Isa.",

There will be economic repercussions as a result. And obviously, the governor is concerned about that.

Richard Quest for us this hour in Tel Aviv, thanks very much, Richard.He will be back in about 20 minutes live with his show, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,\" right here on CNN. And I will bring you an update just now on our top story, a story, of course, we've been covering the last 20, 30 minutes or so. The U.S. saying that Russia forced down an American surveillance drone -- or Russia's defense ministry now says its fighter jet did not come into contact with the American drone or use onboard weapons. The U.S. military says the Russian jet forced down its drone, first by spraying it with fuel and then colliding with it. Now the incident happened in international airspace in an area the U.S. has been operating surveillance drones since Russia's war on Ukraine began. CNN's Oren Liebermann is monitoring developments for us from the Pentagon. So Oren, what do you make of the Russian defense ministry response to this?",

      "sentences": "Well, the Russian defense ministry had to respond essentially because of the level of accusation andwhat the U.S. is accusing Russian pilots of doing. But the Pentagon did also just say that there is video that they're working on and imagery that they're working on, declassifying. And that in and of itself might shoot a hole in some of the Russian explanation or lack of explanation of what played out here over international waters over the Black Sea. Earlier this morning, the U.S. European Command says that one of its MQ-9 Reaper drones was operating, as we watched them do not only since the beginning of the war but even before that, surveilling the area, not only the Black Sea but perhaps Crimea and southern Ukraine as well. Two Russian fighter jets, two Su-27s, conducted this unsafe and unprofessional interception, colliding with the drone and knocking off a piece of its propeller, which forced the U.S. to bring it down in international waters. So obviously, a major accusation from the U.S. there but the U.S. lays out how this all played out and how it brought down that drone in international waters. The U.S. State Department has brought this up with the Russians. The Pentagon says there are no plans now for communication between the militaries here. So either between the U.S. Defense minister and his Russian counterpart or the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and his counterpart. But of course, we will see how this plays out. We are also watching if there's any recovery efforts. We spoke to the Navy a short time ago and there are no U.S. Navy assets in the Black Sea. So recovery of this MQ-9 drone may not even be an option. But we will see how this develops, especially, of course, in the diplomatic side between the U.S. and Russia at this point, Isa.",

And now, Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who is widely viewed as a top Republican contender but has not yet declared his candidacy, has given some of his clearest views yet on the subject. He now says, protecting Ukraine is not of, quote, \"vital national interest.\" CNN's Jeff Zeleny tells us much more about the statement and the impact it might have. He's our chief U.S. national affairs correspondent and he joins me now from Washington. Jeff, great to have you on the show on this. Look, these comments by DeSantis really speak to some of the concerns I've heard here from many ministers on the show and, yes, of a potential Ukraine fatigue and what this may mean in terms of long term support, U.S. support for Ukraine. But put this into context for us. Where do the Republican candidates sit on support for Ukraine? Is there consensus here?",

Even though no U.S. troops are involved directly in the battle, of course, it's more of a financial commitment. But boy, there was not this type of discussion during the longest war that the U.S. has ever been involved in, in Afghanistan, of course. There was not this kind of discussion during that period. But there is sort of a hangover from that. There is sort of a fatigue that has set in. So this is a very worrying concern to the Republicans that disagree with this strongly. It also should be a worrying concern to Volodymyr Zelenskyy and others in Ukraine, that wonder exactly what the U.S. foreign policy is. So this is what President Biden always talks about. He said he was reelected to send the world a message. The question is, is that a permanent message or a temporary message? And one could be certainly excused for wondering what the exact U.S. foreign policy is. Here it's clear, of course, from the Biden administration; it's much less clear from at least some inside the Republican Party.",

But boy, those two men are at the head of the pack here. And the former president, he made clear -- he was in Iowa yesterday, of course, a state that begins this presidential nominating process, just next January, February. He was going after Ron DeSantis pretty hard and straight on on policies, on their disagreements on Social Security, on ethanol subsidies etc. So for now, those two men are leading the field. But it is very early and other candidates are still to get in the race. We never know what a presidential campaign is going to be about at the end. So Ukraine may play a role in it; it may not.
