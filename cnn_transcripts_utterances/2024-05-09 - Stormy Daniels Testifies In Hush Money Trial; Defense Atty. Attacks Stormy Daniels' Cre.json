Kaitlan Collins is outside of the courthouse in New York.And today, the woman at the center of this case, Stormy Daniels, was back on the witness stand. The adult film star delivering a combative testimony, strongly pushing back as former President Trump's lawyer tried to discredit her story and her motivation for telling it, often using her career in the adult film industry for reference. One exchange reading, quote -- Necheles, the lawyer saying, \"You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real.\" Daniels responds, \"Wow, that's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room. The sex is real. That's why it's pornography.\" Necheles then asking, \"Now you have a story you've been telling about having sex with President Trump?\" Daniels answers, \"If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better.\" And that's not the only moment where Trump's team highlighted Daniels work in the adult film industry, Kaitlan.",

They repeatedly pointed to that and there was another moment where Trump's attorney Susan Necheles and Daniels and she was questioning her and Necheles asked her, and I'm quoting Trump's attorney now, she said, \"You acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies.\"Daniels responded, \"It was 150.\" Necheles responded to that, \"But, according to you, seeing a man sitting on a bed in a t shirt and boxer shorts,\" referencing the former president, \"was so upsetting that you got lightheaded, the blood left your hands and feet, and you almost fainted?\" Stormy Daniels pushing back, saying, yes, she was surprised to indeed see the future president of the United States like that, given he was twice her age and his bodyguard was standing outside that hotel suite. I'm here outside of the courthouse with CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid, and CNN's Chief Domestic Correspondent, Phil Mattingly. Moments ago, the judge said they will take a break for lunch. And, obviously, Stormy Daniels was on the stand for an incredible amount of time, Paula. Now, it is a Trump organization employee who is testifying about something that is less salacious than what we heard from Stormy Daniels, but maybe just as important. Because she is essentially talking about how this paper trail of getting these checks from Trump organization in New York to the White House in Washington did it. They weren't just sent to the White House. She was sending them to the personal homes of two top Trump aides, John McEntee and Keith Schiller.",

And the reason she has to testify is because the Trump team will not stipulate that, yes, this is how the checks went from the Trump organization to the White House, the circuitous route, but eventually to the White House once he became president.They will not stipulate. That is a defense strategy. They want to bog the jury down in as much mundane testimony as possible, which is why we're hearing from her about the journey these checks take. Well, most people will probably be thinking and talking about Stormy Daniels testimony and the salacious things we heard. The fact is, when the jury goes eventually to engage in their deliberations about the actual criminal charges here, allegedly falsifying business records, I heard testimony is going to be something that they are going to have to consider and think about, OK, let's think about where these checks came from, who had eyes on them, where they were going. So not the most exciting witness, but she is an important building block to try to prove these charges.",

      "sentences": "I mean, this jury probably needs a bit of a breather. I mean, they just listened to six hours of intense testimony and intense cross-examination from Trump's team. I mean, there are some questions about what was the strategy that Trump's team was using going into this today, because it seemed pretty effective on Tuesday afternoon as they were cross examining her, basically accusing her of extorting Trump.Today, part of the questioning, Phil, was on whether or not they actually had dinner the night that she met Trump, and they were supposed to have dinner. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: The escalation, I think, in tone and tenor from the defense was dramatic, and I think very, very tangible compared to what we'd seen at the beginning of their cross-examination. You mentioned that it wasn't just tone, it was actually kind of subject matter and focus as well. Look, to be candid, Kaitlan, I think you may have said this earlier, there was a very, like, slut shaming aspect to it on some level, on some of the things you were just reading there. And it's worth noting that the way Stormy Daniels tells the story, the reason why she went up to the Donald Trump's room, she was supposed to be meeting him for dinner, she was supposed to go up to his room to go to dinner. And the reason why she was surprised is because they'd had a conversation. She went to the bathroom, when -- before she'd gone to the bathroom, he was fully dressed, when she came back out, he was sitting there in his underwear. So, I think, my question, as I've been watching this play out as our reporters in the room have been reporting through it, is, what happened to trigger a shift in tone and or shift shift in subject matter in terms of where the defense was going with this cross? And what does the jury think of it? Because in the end, those 12 people are really all that matters here.",

And right now, the possibility of jail looms large because if he violates the gag order again by attacking a witness, like for example, Stormy Daniels, the judge has made it clear. He will consider sending him to jail.So if the defense attorneys, in order to allay Trump's frustrations and concerns about what Stormy Daniels said on Tuesday, if they have to get up and go in the weeds about, you know, the paranormal possum or all these other things, like we went just so far down the rabbit hole, things no material value to this case, if that's what they have to do to appease their client, to keep him in line and keep him out of jail, I get it.",

Thank you.Our panel here with us in Washington as we digest some of what we've seen today, which has really been a little bit of everything. Elie, I wonder what you think moving from the Stormy Daniels, cross- examination, a redirect now to the bookkeeper. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, it's whiplash for sure for the jury, but this is the natural ebb and flow of trials. You'll have super dramatic contentious moments, followed by more mundane moments. I think when I look back now at the Stormy Daniels cross-examination sort of in total, to me it was a tale of two cross-examinations. Yesterday, the last hour or so, or Tuesday, the last hour or so, was extraordinarily effective. I think they really undermined Stormy Daniels credibility, her motives. She made prior inconsistent statements. She hates Trump. She's openly cheering for him to go to jail. I thought that was very effective. Today, to me, was off the rails, though. The line of questioning that we opened this segment with about, well, you're in pornography. You know how to fake stories about sex. All of that is useless. It's pointless. I think it probably turns the jury more in Stormy Daniels favor. I think they just completely lost the thread this morning with the cross exam.",

There's a lot of indictments. And then the defense raised their arm, kicked and screamed, said, objection, get it out of the record, and the judge let it in because it was a responsive answer. Now, had they cut themselves off yesterday, they could have avoided all these situations like this, where Stormy Daniels, as we saw in the introduction here, was actually quite effective at pushing back and coming off as responsive and witty and credible and frankly kind of vulnerable in these answers.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, it was a fairly contentious cross-examination. I mean, at times, Susan Necheles, Trump's attorney and Stormy Daniels were talking over each other. The judge at least twice had to tell Susan Necheles to let Daniels answer the question, so they were certainly sparring at times.And it seemed like there were a couple points that Trump side was trying to make on this. That Stormy Daniels was motivated by money, going through ways that she had sold merchandise, sold candles, tried to profit off of her relation -- or her one night with Donald Trump, you know, but Stormy Daniels was fighting back each and every part of the way when they asked her, she was profiting. One of the things that Daniels said was, this is me doing my job, not unlike Mr. Trump, suggesting that he was also profiting off the indictments that he has faced both here and elsewhere. Also, a lot of the focus was trying to find holes in Stormy Daniels story, pointing out that she told interviewers different details in 2011 and 2018 that she did not recount in court today or vice versa. A lot of the focus seemed to be on her saying previously that they had dinner, but her testimony today saying that they didn't have dinner. They also tried to suggest that prosecutors were feeding her information to try to match the details that she'd given in the book because on direct examination, one of the prosecutors had asked her, did you mention the floors in the hotel? And she said, oh, yes, the black and white tile floors. So just trying to make it look like she was coached and that she has changed her story. And that is something that Necheles had underscored multiple times asking Daniels, you made this up. You've changed your story. Haven't you, Daniels, saying, no, I haven't and sticking to the story. But, you know, one other area that Trump's lawyers tried to clarify because on direct examination, Daniels had said things such as, you know, there was a bodyguard at the door that she blacked out. So they were really focusing some of their costs today to ensure that Daniels said that she was not forced by Donald Trump to have sex with her. She said if anything came out of that yesterday or the day before, she said, it was my own insecurities made me feel that way. So really trying to draw a distinction that this was not forced on Stormy Daniels and that she had sex willingly with Donald Trump. And then on the redirect by the prosecution, they kept that short and sweet, trying to just underscore their main points in this, asking her, are you telling the truth? She said that she is, and they said, on balance, is your life better or worse now that you've spoken out publicly about this? And Daniels said on balance that it is worse. Now during this period of questioning, you know, as it was heated at times, the jurors, they've been paying attention. They've been pretty active. I was sitting in a different position because I couldn't see how aggressively they were taking notes today, but they took a lot of notes on Tuesday, that had changed when we moved on to the Trump Organization bookkeeper during her testimony. I'd say the jurors looked a little less engaged, maybe a little more bored as she was explaining how the checks, unsigned checks, she sent down to Washington D.C. They came back signed by Donald Trump. That though is an important part of this case. It's some of the elements of the alleged fraud because part of the allegation is that Trump falsified those documents. Of those 34 counts, 11 of them are the checks that he signed to reimburse Michael Cohen. Brianna?",

Our legal observers are saying, as many fireworks as we saw in the Stormy Daniels testimony, some of this testimony from the bookkeeper about checks going back and forth to the White House, ultimately, that is going to be even more important.And I wonder, you are part, Kara, of this team of reporters that we have tracking this and watching this trial. Could you all get a sense of how the jury was responding to that testimony of Stormy Daniels, really contentious testimony as she was answering questions from Trump's lawyer about a lot of things having to do with the adult film industry?",

But also when they were putting up some of the social media posts that he had written, that Stormy Daniels had written, he would lean in toward the monitor in front of him, that's where the evidence appears for him, for the jurors, for the audience. So we'd see him at times lean forward and do that.And then there were a number of sidebars today. That's when the judge has calls the parties, the lawyers up to the bench because they're fighting over whether something can come into evidence or not, or a certain line of questioning is OK or not. Trump is sitting at the table with one of his lawyers, and we saw them engaged in a lot of back and forth, a lot of conversations. Trump at one point had his notepad out, where he sometimes writes notes and hands them to his lawyers. So he was paying attention. And then when his junior bookkeeper was on the witness stand, he turned toward her to look toward her. We've seen that a few times where someone who works for his company, he pays them attention. Whether they can see him or not is unclear, but he does look in their direction to follow along in their testimony.",
