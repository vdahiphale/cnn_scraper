      "sentences": "Well, it's really interesting, Jessica, because we actually did hear Trump just moments ago really hammer President Joe Biden over what he is arguing as being behind the criminal indictments he is facing. Now he talked about the criminal indictments more generally. He did not specifically discuss his New York hush money case, which of course he was just returning from this week from being out of the courtroom.So I found that very interesting. I think a big question that still remains as Donald Trump is probably halfway through his remarks right now, we know that he's still currently under a gag order despite his attorneys earlier in the week trying to see if they could alter that gag order to allow him to talk about witnesses more generally, but they said that he could not do that. So it's still unclear whether or not he's going to go back to discuss this case in more detail. I can tell you, Jessica, from my conversations with Trump's team behind the scenes, his lawyers have really urged him not to do that, not to delve too much into that. But again, we'll see if that changes for the rest of his speech. I also just want to bring up a couple other things that I found really interesting that he talked about. One is that he claimed that he's going to win New Jersey. Now, Trump has made these kind of comments in the past, but this is the most public way he's done that yet. And look, I talked to many of his advisers about this yesterday, about why are you coming to New Jersey, which is not really considered a critical battleground state. They actually argue, look, we know we're not probably going to win this state, but Wildwood, which is where we are on the Jersey Shore, is a very pro-Trump area. There's a lot of people here as you can see behind me, who are very enthusiastic in the crowd. They thought that this could be good for Trump after a very explosive and really embarrassing week for him in court. But they also argue that they could get some people from Pennsylvania and the Philly suburbs to come here as well. Not necessarily the expectation that they could win as Donald Trump is claiming -- Jessica.",

The two of them co-host the podcast \"Hot Mics from Left to Right.\" Good to see you both. Alice, let's start first with you. Trump has been complaining and complaining that he's stuck in court. He can't get out on the campaign trail. He gets this weekend off and he stayed nearby where he lives in New Jersey and went to a blue state. It is a red area, to be sure, in a blue state, but still going to New Jersey. What do you make of that?",

But right beside New Jersey is Pennsylvania, That's a key battleground state. He's doing well there.He needs to continue to do well there. And look to -- you know, to his defense, he has been cooped up in a courtroom. He has been miserable. He has been frustrated with that and good for his campaign to get him out, to get him in a large crowd of strong supporters, even got to have a hot dog on his way in to the events. So good for them to get him out there. And look, he's addressing a large crowd here, but he's getting massive, massive earned media. There's many outlets that are covering this live. He's going to get more than earned media that he can possibly imagine whether he was in New Jersey or if he was in the heart of Wisconsin. He's going to get tremendous amounts of earned media.

He has split in the Democratic Party because of the far-left progressives in the Democratic Party that are antisemitic and anti- Jewish, and they are pushing back on Joe Biden.And that is a tremendous problem for him. And for him to come out this week and tell Erin Burnett that he is in the face of Hamas putting Palestinians in the crosshairs of the crossfire to tell Israel to stand down or we're going to withhold some American military important ammunition that they need. That is, that is just unfathomable. And he is getting tremendous push-back, not just by Republicans, but by Jewish people, by him basically taking the side of Hamas over the people of Israel.

And the fact that Republicans are using that talking point I think really underscores how much they lack the knowledge, the expertise, and the nuance to really understand what's going on here with the Israeli-Hamas war.What Joe Biden did on CNN and what he has done repeatedly from the beginning of this conflict is he has embraced Israel with fervor and in ways that cannot be challenged from frankly the very beginning. And what he is doing now, however, is he is actually telling Netanyahu that there is -- there are ways to go into Rafah where he does not have to put the lives of innocent Palestinians, not Hamas, innocent Palestinians on the line or endanger while Netanyahu goes after Hamas. Those are the conversations and the diplomatic negotiations that are going on behind the scenes. And Joe Biden is not going to be talking publicly about every single conversation and pushback or embrace that he has with Netanyahu because that is not how diplomacy works. And the fact that Republicans are clueless about that I think underscores the reason why Joe Biden is exactly the right president to have at this moment in time and the right president to be reelected as these issues continue to be something that are flaring up on the global stage.",

And once in a lifetime for people here in Atlanta, all the way down to Florida. And the reason being is this, what's called a sunspot cluster that has formed on the sun. It is 17 times the size of planet earth. This is just absolutely incredible and you remember those little solar eclipse glasses that we got last month for April 8th solar eclipse? Well, you can use them and see that sunspot cluster in real life with the naked eye. And that is incredible because to be able to witness that is the reason why we're having this brilliant display of Northern Lights. And so what I want to show you is just this coronal mass ejection, right? That is a solar flare of highly energized particles that are screaming towards the earth. And this is interacting with what is known as -- are magnetic poles and that creates these beautiful blues and violets and reds. It's almost like a Roman guard using his shield and he's holding it up and deflecting this plasma that is being ejected towards earth and it goes towards the poles. And it makes it more difficult to see it in lower latitudes like where we are here in Atlanta.

One bad take his saying, oh, President Biden, he is letting domestic political concerns wag the dog and he is more worried about Michigan then he is about Israel. That is not true. President Biden is rock solid in his support for Israel's security. The other bad take is, oh, this is too little too late and Israel is still going to go out there and commit war crimes and that's unfair as well. The truth is that President Biden and Israel remains strategically aligned, yet President Biden is trying to help Israel articulate and communicate and ultimately architect post-war governance for Gaza that can actually ensure a permanent ceasefire and Israel is within its rights to defend itself against Hamas, including through a limited surgical Rafah operation.",

They have to be synergistic, and this is where I think President Biden has the bigger vision. He is saying that Cairo and Rafah have to be aligned and working together. They cannot be intentioned with one another, and that's where he is getting frustrated with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I think President Biden is doing this from a place of love for Israel and a genuine aspiration for a humanitarian and economic better place for the Palestinian people.",
