The war against Hamas heating up nearly three full weeks after the surprise Hamas terror attack on Israel.In battered Gaza right now, we're told phone lines and other communications have been largely cut off. Civilians caught in the crossfire as Hamas launches rockets and Israeli warplanes open fire. The United States says it's in talks with Israel about a humanitarian pause in the warfare to try to allow the potential release of more hostages held by Hamas. The White House, insisting negotiations aimed at freeing more captives, is ongoing right now. And also breaking in the United States as divers join the search for the mass shooter in Maine. Sources now tell CNN the gun apparently used at the rampage was bought just days before the suspect had a mental health episode. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer reporting live from Jerusalem and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Here in the Middle East right now, we're witnessing a clear escalation in the Israel-Hamas war with widespread accounts of the most intense and sustained airstrikes on Gaza to-date. We've seen the skies over Gaza light up repeatedly in the last few minutes. The Israeli military declaring it's operating forcefully on all fronts, including expanded ground operations in Gaza right now. Hamas, in turn, launching fresh attacks on Israel. We're following all the breaking news from our position right here in Jerusalem. And our correspondents are standing by at key locations in Israel as well as in Washington. First, let's go to CNN's Nic Robertson. He's in Sderot, Israel, for us. Nic, do not far away. You're close to the border with Gaza. What are you hearing, where you are and how much more intense are these Israeli military operations tonight?",

There's another artillery battery that's been quiet for the last few minutes in this direction, they too have been firing.But the intensity earlier this evening, just before dusk, and, again, several times later into the night, the intensity of both those artillery batteries opening up round after round after round, and then what we haven't heard from this location as intense as tonight, tank rounds, not far from here, multiple tanks opening up with heavy, repetitive fire, outgoing round, outgoing round, outgoing round. And then just before dusk, something again we had not seen from here before, a heavy bank of smoke drifted up from Gaza on the wind up the hill here to where we are, lasted 20 or 30 minutes enveloping the town here, just the sort of smoke that the military would use to cover a ground maneuver by troops. We don't know if that's what it was used for, but it was bitter on the throat and it irritated the nose. So, this smoke was really dense for a period of time. It gave the impression that this could be a ground incursion. Now, we don't know because we can't see inside of Gaza right now but we've been hearing heavy machine gunfire coming from areas that sound as if they're inside the Gaza Strip. Typically, it will be the early hours of tomorrow morning before we hear from the IDF clarifying precisely what we've witnessed this evening, Wolf. But it has been heavy and it has been hard and sustained.",

And the other thing of course is that the communications networks inside of Gaza are severely diminished tonight. Jawwal, the main Palestinian cell phone service provider, internet provider, is reporting that most of their services are down. Some people are managing to get few voice notes out, a couple of still images of what's happening inside of Gaza. But it does appear that a lot of the city there is in darkness and a lot of people are without the communications they've become used to, and that, the lack of communications, could also be indicative of this escalating moment towards a possible larger ground incursion that the IDF is talking about, Wolf.",

There are so many families of hostages that believe that the -- obviously, the ground offensive in Gaza and the victory against Hamas has been put first and the survival of hostages has been put second. That is the frustration that many of them feel.But there had been, Wolf, as you know, an anticipation that there was a deal for a release of a significant number of hostages. We'd heard all sorts of numbers, but a lot of people have been -- maybe as many as 50, as we're listening to what's happening in Gaza right now, and that obviously had been being brokered by Qatar. The Israeli national security adviser had even issued a supportive Qatar in those efforts. The belief is that, at least for now, those talks are obviously going very poorly. There has not been progress. Maybe that's part of the reason we're seeing Israel expand this ground operation, the third night in a row of ground assaults on Gaza as this continues here right now, past 1:00 in the morning. But the spokesperson, the chief spokesperson, Admiral Daniel Hagari for the IDF, says that what Hamas is doing right now with hostages is psychological warfare. Here's what he said not long ago, Wolf. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  I suggest to disregard rumors. This is psychological terror and the cynical use of Israeli civilians by Hamas. We will reach and present any credible information, whether it's civilian intelligence or operational. Any relevant information will be given to the families first once it's confirmed, and then will notify the public. Until then, don't surrender to Hamas manipulations of psychological terror.

The war is unrelenting. But there are still many Israelis who feel that they want that we are doing something, that there is a specific event.

They certainly believe that this is a significant expansion of what we have seen Israel doing over the course of the past few nights in terms of those incursions. This is a much bigger effort.Now we are -- you know, the big question is what is going to happen with the hostages. The NSC spokesperson, John Kirby, earlier today saying that they have been having active conversations with the Israelis about humanitarian pauses, the belief that humanitarian pauses could actually help get more of these hostages out. We've heard the counterargument from the Israeli side that, in fact, more military pressure helps to get those hostages out. Wolf, I've been speaking with people who are familiar with these negotiations all day long. U.S. officials are saying that these conversations are not dead. They do admit that they have taken a blow, that they are not going as well today as they have been earlier in the day and yesterday. You heard Erin there talking about this notion that we were thinking that we were perhaps on the cusp of seeing a large release of hostages. That now does not appear to be imminent. Wolf, I was speaking with someone who has been briefed on these ongoing negotiations that have been led by Qatar. This person telling me that things are moving very quickly. The demands, the number of hostages, the timeline, they change every single hour. Now, this escalation in the fighting, Wolf, this also could have huge ramifications for the hundreds of Palestinian-Americans who have been trying to flee Gaza. This will certainly step up their desperation to get out of the Gaza Strip. The U.S. has been blaming Hamas for failing to open the gates on the Gaza side of the crossing that goes into Egypt. We've also heard some complaints that Egypt is not making things as easy as they could when it comes to getting those Palestinian-Americans and other foreigners processed to be able to leave the Gaza Strip in the midst of this escalation.",

It is the northern outskirts of Gaza City. This is where the Israeli forces are right now and it's a much bigger and much more significant incursion than the limited raids we saw in the last few days.

And, you know, the U.S. thinks that it could hamper the negotiations. The Israelis think it could give the negotiations a push because Hamas will be under more pressure.

The number of civilians in that area, the number of hostages is unprecedented, the location of these underground tunnels and here we're hearing more shelling in Gaza.And one has to remember, Wolf, just as it seems Hamas was preparing for the October 7th slaughter for some two years, as they have claimed, if that is the case, that means they've also been preparing for the Israeli response to that slaughter, which was inevitable and which they would have predicted for that same two year period.

Meanwhile, they're coming in on the ground in some force.Now, we don't know at this point what the objective is. In general, what you do in an operation like this is go for the key terrain. What would the key terrain be in Gaza? Probably significant infrastructure. It could be power plants, installation plants. It could be the high- rise buildings in a certain location, or it might be what is a nexus of the tunnel works that they've identified. So, we can't tell at this point what the key objectives would be at this phase of the operation.

But for each of those rounds that's going out, you can hear the impact behind us in Gaza. So, that uptick is just indicative -- there was another round outgoing there -- it's indicative of what we've been hearing this evening. And this is just one of the batteries, the howitzer batteries, artillery batteries that's firing out right now. There are others around here. Earlier on, we were hearing several batteries firing at the same time. But this does seem to be symptomatic of tonight. We don't know what it specifically is being targeted.

It feels like thunder in the air, just constant booms that rattle in the sky.

Every indication has been coming from Iran that backs Hezbollah, that funds Hezbollah, that is a really a political direction for Hezbollah, from Hezbollah themselves, indicating that if there was a ground incursion going into Gaza, that they would step in that they would up their attacks on Israel. And, of course, they have the capability to launch from Lebanon. They have the capability to launch long-range missiles that can cover much of the country. We've seen what Hamas can do from Gaza with its rockets to Central Israel, to places like Sderot, to places even as far away as Jerusalem. Hezbollah to the north has a bigger inventory of rockets, more sophisticated rockets, and, therefore, can potentially do more damage. So, Hamas trying to call for Hezbollah to step in at this time is an indication that they feel that the war with Israel is reaching that point. They are expecting this ground incursion. They are expecting a fuller force arrayed against them, and they want distraction in other areas to try to weaken, A, Israel's resolve, B, try to undermine the Israel's military incursion at the same time. And, of course, this is a big concern about how that would inflame the region as well. And I think perhaps what we've seen over recent days, the day before yesterday, IDF saying that there was a limited incursion, troops came out last night. They're saying the limited incursion troops came out today, saying that incursions would continue today, saying that they would broaden and strengthen, but not saying that this was the big incursion. So, a slow, slow steady, as General Wesley Clark has indicated a slow, slow, steady escalation that perhaps Israel hopes can keep groups like Hezbollah out of the fight. And just as we're talking, I'm hearing heavy machine gun fire over my shoulder there, again, indicative of troops perhaps facing off against Hezbollah or other groups right now, but indicative of troops being close to contact with each other in the battlefield there, Wolf.",

In the area down here, just behind me, to my left, I think, John is sort of showing you that area here.This is the area that runs along the northern border between Israel and Gaza. And if there is an incursion along the north of Gaza tonight, it's going to be in that area. That's where we are hearing that machine gun fire from. And machine gun fire, unlike the long range artillery, that long range missiles, that long-range tank fire, that machine gun fire would be indicative of troops being able to see the enemy and potentially firing at the. And that gives us an idea that if an incursion hasn't happened, the troops, IDF, or close to the fans. And if it has happened, right now, they're very close to Hamas fighting units. So Hamas also, its military has put out a statement this evening, saying they are operational and ready for the IDF forces. So, are we hearing small elements of smoke gun battles? Possibly. Hard to tell from this distance. I think what's instructive is the last couple of days, the IDF has talked about these two-limited incursions with tanks, with infantry, and armored fighting vehicles. It has said there haven't been any IDF casualties. Tonight, may be -- tonight, may be different, if it's been a more intense engagement. Again, we won't know until the morning -- Wolf.",
