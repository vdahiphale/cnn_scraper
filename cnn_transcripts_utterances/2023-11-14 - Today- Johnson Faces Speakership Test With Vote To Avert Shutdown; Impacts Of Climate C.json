I'm going to use this as the kind of premise of my administration. When he talked about retribution in that speech, that's really the undergirding theme of what we've seen kind of the Trump campaign lay out in this kind of GOP primary, and I think it's starting to set in for folks. The reason you see the Nikki Haleys or some other people kind of rising is because there is a real recognition that this version of Donald Trump, although it's the same character from last time, does have a kind of clear-eyed rhetoric that I think promises an authoritarian bend to this next version of himself, and I don't think that should be ignored.",
