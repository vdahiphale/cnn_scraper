Tonight, the U.N.calls on Israel to provide access to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, in order to vet Israel's claims about Hamas tunnels. We'll have the very latest. Then, shelling in Ukraine's Kherson region kills six as Russia's relentless war grinds on. Plus, new details are emerging about the atrocities in Sudan. Refugees from the country's civil war speak to CNN about the violence committed against ethnic groups in Darfur. And the U.N. Human Rights chief now asking Israel to give his team access to Gaza as the biggest hospital there becomes a flash point. Israeli forces have raided Al-Shifa Hospital, claiming military equipment was found inside, and that Hamas was using it as a command center, releasing this video of a tunnel shaft they say it was discovered nearby. Well, CNN cannot verify these findings as journalists are not allowed to move inside Gaza independently. We're unable to get comment from hospital authorities at this time too. But doctors and health officials in Gaza have consistently denied these allegations, and so does Hamas. The United Nations now wants to investigate, while also calling on Israel to stop using water as a quote, \"weapon of war\". Nada Bashir joins us now from Jerusalem. It makes sense that the United Nations wants to try and verify now, but that's not going to happen without an end to the war at the very least a ceasefire, Nada, which at this stage clearly still not happening.",

Let's talk more about this, ShainaLow is a Communication Adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. One of her colleagues posted a picture on X of the leaflets that we were just discussing, that the IDF has been dropping over parts of southern Gaza, asking where known shelters could be found. Shaina, good to have you with us, I want to talk about your colleague, Youssef(ph), I believe is his name, and  clearly, he is there and understands the challenges of the situation. It's not -- I don't think that he doesn't know where those shelters are, the problem is the question of, are they safe? And we know that there are more than overcapacity. Is it truly possible for them to move there and actually survive?",

As you mentioned, they're bursting at capacity. And so, for the 1.5 million displaced Palestinians in Gaza, there simply is not space. We warned about this at the very beginning on October 13th when Israel made the announcement that residents of northern Gaza and Gaza city needed to move south. That there weren't facilities able to accommodate the influx of people. The reality is that there just simply aren't the resources available in the south, we're already hearing reports about the spread of infectious diseases inside of shelters, difficulties finding food, clean water. Really, what we need is a massive ramping up of the -- of the international aid that's been going in, but it's been a trickle so far. And we need a ceasefire, we need to stop this bombardment, we need to stop the fighting because people can't even access aid, so long as -- so long as the bombardment is ongoing. One final thing that I want to mention is that -- is that the south, while Palestinians over a month ago now were directed to flee south, it is by no means safe, and it hasn't been safe since October 7th. We ourselves have had colleagues be injured and lose members of their families in bombardments, in southern Gaza, including in Rafah right next to the Egyptian border. There simply is no safe place in Gaza, and forcing people into even closer quarters is really an impossibility at this point.",

And also, Gaza was prone to flooding even prior to the complete destruction of its infrastructure. And so when you have untreated sewage spreading, and being spread because of flooding, you're -- tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of displaced people are being put at risk. We saw today, that the -- that the head of Israel's war cabinet said that they wanted to allow two trucks worth of fuel in to help with sewage treatment.

But of course, the question is, what's on the other side or the inside of that tunnel shaft? How deep does it go? It's impossible to tell what it's used for. That's what we would need to see either with our own eyes going in or some sort of video evidence, photographic evidence from the IDF to know that it is what they have said all along is there, and that is, Hamas, what they have called terror infrastructure underneath the hospital. Now, they do have the backing of the U.S. which has said it has its own intelligence that shows Hamas uses the area underneath the hospital for its own purposes, for its own centers, its own complex with a hospital on top, providing them -- or believing it provided them some sort of safety. But the burden very much on Israel now, they had a briefing a short time ago with the IDF, there is no new evidence presented, they say it will take time. They haven't really gone into the tunnels too much. They have tried to destroy tunnel shafts, but they also know that going into the tunnels is going to a place where Hamas has the advantage. Still, it's on Israel to prove what's down there. And it is very much a black and white question. There either is a Hamas complex down there or there isn't.
