Donald Trump's Georgia election subversion case set to resume in Atlanta later on this morning with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, remaining on the case. The judge is going to hear two motions from the defense, one filed by Trump, objecting to the criminal solicitation counts against him. He is claiming that violates his First Amendment rights. The other is emotion by one of Trump's fake electors in Georgia, David Shafer, to dismiss all charges against him. Another co-defendant in that case, the former Trump attorney John Eastman, he is poised to lose his law license. A judge in California recommending that Eastman be disbarred for his role as one of the architects of the fake elector scheme. Joining me now to discuss all of this, Eugene Scott, senior politics reporter at \"Axios\". Eugene, good morning to you.",

Because I think what we've seen from Republicans quite a few is I'm trying to downplay, of course, what happened on January 6 and the efforts to overturn 2020. But having your lawyer disbar communicates that this was not a light matter, that's something actually occurred that suggests that this should not happen again.

So, you have an Israeli government, that's sort of talking out of both sides of its mouth. So, it's -- there's confusion in Washington as to who is actually calling the shots.
