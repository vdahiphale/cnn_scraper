That's a customary thing for his predecessors to have done, but it's the first time that Biden himself has stepped out to take questions from reporters in that format in nearly four years time.And so you can imagine that there was quite a clamoring of hands raised. And his press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, moving along quite quickly to get to a handful of questions before ushering him out of the room. He appeared in good spirits. He really wanted to talk about a couple of economic wins, not only the positive jobs report surprisingly so earlier today, but also the tentative agreement between dock workers and foreign port operators to have a 90-day pause on any potential strike and to try to work out their differences. But the bulk of the questions that he got from reporters concerned the Middle East, considering the fact that the region is still on tenterhooks and there's a possibility of a response by Israel and a tit for tat engagement that could further inflame the region. And he was asked about what he believes would be appropriate for Israel to do. And he said that the Israelis have not concluded how they're going to respond. And when he was asked specifically about comments that he made earlier this week that set markets into a tizzy and spiked the price of oil, that he essentially left the door open to them striking Iran's oil reserves, he said, \"If I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives.\" So certainly suggesting that he would prefer that Israel did not strike those oil reserves, just as he said earlier in the week, that he would be opposed to Israel striking Iran's nuclear facilities. He said that the U.S. and Israeli teams are in constant contact more than 12 hours a day. But as for potential call between him and the Israeli prime minister, he said he's not necessarily jonesing for that, but it will happen when it happens and when the U.S. feels that Israel has made a conclusion about how to respond.",

But what he did today is precisely what a president would do when communicating with the American people in the press corps on sort of daily developments. But remember, this is a president whose successful campaign in 2020 came amid COVID and sometimes dubbed the basement campaign. And then, after the debate performance in June, there's just been very little incentive to be out there. His team, for most of his presidency, has sought to minimize his give and take exposure with reporters to try to avoid gaffes. And that strategy has not always helped. But today is something different. He has only a limited number of days remaining in his presidency and a rare moment where really good news for him and his legacy. And the White House is also very good news for Vice President Harris, who is on the campaign trail today. So this combination of the port strike being suspended or ended while they go back to the table, that will last through the end of the year and into January. And this jobs report, both good in terms of numbers and good in terms of wages that, in theory, could inspire not just Americans' confidence, but voters' confidence. What president would not want to get out there, make some good news for himself and try to make some good news for the person who he hopes will carry on and win another term in his, you know, in his place?",

I'm told there was a 5So, certainly, I think he believes he has the right to take credit for something like that. But he also fielded a question about Vice President Harris, and he used the opportunity to give her a lot of credit, equal credit for all of the work that his administration has done, saying that the teams work very closely together and that she's had a seat at the table for nearly everything that they've done. So, you know, at some point, you know, that there will be a lot of oxygen being taken up out of the room by Vice President Harris, her campaign. And then, as we now know, President Obama campaigning for her next week.

It was recently as earlier this year, he said that Kemp was in - to blame for the terrible crime rate in the state of Georgia, blaming him for the state's, quote, \"average economy,\" calling him, quote, \"a bad guy, a disloyal guy and a very average governor.\" I can't think of a worse insult Donald Trump could throw at someone than disloyal.

We want to open up the conversation now and discuss all the recent developments with Democratic congressman of Florida, Maxwell Frost. He's a member of the Harris campaign national advisory board. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. We were all surprised this afternoon to see President Biden in the press briefing room, engaging with reporters for the first time in his presidency. And we haven't actually seen that from Vice President Harris, a formal press conference since she became the Democratic nominee. She has done way fewer one-on-one sit downs with the press compared to former President Trump. Do you think it's time that the media strategy changed for the Vice President? Would you like to see her do more of that? REP. MAXWELL FROST (D-FL): I think she's doing a great job. I mean, if you see what she's been focusing on, is having a very aggressive agenda of going out into communities and speaking directly to the American people through these huge rallies and these big events that she's doing. Of course, from big events, but also small events where she's speaking with people, especially students, young people, seniors, folks of different demographics and very close settings as well. And I think this is really part of the reason we're seeing her helping our party with enthusiasm all across the board right now. So I think she should continue what she's doing. We're seeing a lot more interviews come out. Yes, it's not always with traditional press. We've seen her do a lot of interviews with a lot of cultural media organizations and places like that because she's trying to reach out to voters who might not pay attention to politics right now. But I think she's doing a good job and I think we'll continue to see her do that.",

And we got - we can't just say that it failed. We have to say why it failed.It failed because Donald Trump picked up the phone, called Republicans in the in the Senate and said, don't let it pass because I want to campaign on the issue. I don't want to solve it. I want to campaign on it. Make sure that bill doesn't pass. We can't give Joe Biden or Kamala Harris a win. And that's why that bill failed, because of Trump. And I think it's important to know that. The other thing is in a Democratic House and Democratic White House, the leadership will - the leadership will work with the White House to identify what are the priorities going forth. Of course, immigration is something that's top of mind for people right now and I'm sure we'll have fruitful discussions once Kamala Harris is elected President of the United States and figuring out how do we have both a humane but also orderly process at the border to make sure that we're still in touch with our values of a country, the human right to claim asylum, but also making sure that that process is orderly as well.",

I remember how Donald Trump completely mismanaged this pandemic, which put us in the situation we were in, in terms of the economy. And I remember President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris coming in, fixing that mess, making sure that everyone was vaccinated, had what they need so we can go outside of our homes, get out of lockdown and come back to normal life. And I always, you know, encourage people to remember that. Sometimes it's difficult to think back to that time. It was a very traumatic time. But in the midst of all this death, all this chaos, our economy in a free fall, Donald Trump was going up and telling people to put bleach in their arms. When we changed the leadership under the Biden-Harris administration, we got our act together as a country. We were able to go back outside, be with our families, go to concerts, go to work, start our small businesses. And it's part of the reason we're seeing this jobs report that just came out because of these policies actually work. Sometimes it takes a little time for the policies of a president to actually come to fruition so we can all feel it.   But I always encourage people to really think about where we were at the end of Donald Trump's presidency and where we are right now. And the fact that Kamala Harris is talking to the anxieties of a lot of young men. You know, for me, I just did a back to school tour. Every young man of color I spoke with, one of the top issues was housing. They said, man, I can't rent. I'm having a hard time with barriers to entry with housing. I'm scared one day I'm not - might not be able to own. And I'm going to be honest. I've had criticisms for both parties in terms of not having a comprehensive housing platform, but Kamala Harris is the first major presidential nominee to say, you know what, one of the first plans I'm putting forth is a major plan to make sure that we help both tenants and homeowners alike. And when I speak with young men of color, black and brown men about that plan, they leave saying, you know what, that's someone who's speaking to a direct anxiety that I have. And I think as long as we continue to get that message out there, I'll be on the trail doing it. The vice president's doing it. Tim Walz, a bunch of surrogates are doing it. I think we're going to see that the Vice President is not only going to win by a substantial margin, young men of color, but have the highest youth voter turnout in the history of our country.",

If you look at that recent court filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith, a lot of the tactics that he says Trump and his allies try to use to challenge the 2020 election results, they seem to be back in play here ahead of the 2024 election. And one of those is this attempt to spread widespread claims about noncitizens voting. That's something experts say is incredibly rare, but we're already seeing Donald Trump and several of his Republican allies banging that drum just 32 days ahead of the election, as you mentioned.The other thing we're already seeing is an avalanche of lawsuits challenging voter rolls. This is things like taking issue in key states, claiming that there are dead people on those voter rolls, that states are not maintaining them the way they're supposed to be. Again, this is something that has repeatedly been thrown out in court in the past, but we're already seeing happen in the lead up to this upcoming election. And the other thing that's popped up only one time in 2020, but we're seeing increasingly more now is this issue of state election boards refusing to certify their election results, right? That's something that happened in Michigan in 2020. It was - it failed. That effort failed. But, I mean, it's something that really concerns election officials coming up ahead of 2024. And then just the general atmosphere of misinformation that exists right now around the 2024 Election, as you guys know, that was a huge problem after and leading up to even 2020. We're seeing that again ahead of 2024. And it's something that election officials tell us they're really worried to not just convince people of things that aren't true, but could inspire them to take real world action, like show up at voting locations and even potentially carry out violence. That's something we hear repeatedly from people in key swing - key states as election officials are increasingly feeling - or feeling these threats after what happened in 2020. And ultimately, one voting rights group called this the MAGA playbook for overturning an election, all these things taken together. And it's hard not to notice that some of the same lawyers, especially that were involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 results, they're back in the forefront, again, doing so - laying the groundwork for these things in 2024.",
