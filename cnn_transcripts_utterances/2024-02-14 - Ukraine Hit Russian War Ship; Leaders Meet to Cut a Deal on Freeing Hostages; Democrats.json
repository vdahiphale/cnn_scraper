      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, inching forward but not quite there. A U.S. official says talks in Cairo aimed at freeing the Gaza hostages were productive and serious, but a final deal remains elusive. Plus a special election in New York turns into a big win for U.S. House Democrats, further narrowing the GOP's razor thin majority. And House Republicans try again to impeach the head of U.S. Homeland Security, this time succeeding by the thinnest of margins. We begin this hour with breaking news and what appears to be a naval triumph for Ukraine. A defense official there says Ukrainian drones sank a prominent Russian warship in the Black Sea, the Caesar Kunikov. We are told the drones damaged the large landing vessel beyond repair. CNN cannot confirm the claims. No comment from the Kremlin but if confirmed, this could be a significant blow to its Black Sea fleet. No word yet on casualties. A U.S. official says negotiations are ongoing but there's still been no breakthrough in talks aimed at reaching a deal to pause the fighting and free the remaining hostages in Gaza. CIA Director Bill Burns traveled to Cairo for those talks. He discussed the situation in Gaza with Egypt's president who also met with Qatar's prime minister. The hostage talks have failed to bridge gaps between the parties with one key issue being a disagreement over the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to hostages that would be released as part of a deal. The talks come as international concern and opposition grows over Israel's expected ground offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The U.N. aid chief says such an operation could lead to a slaughter, while the U.N. secretary general says it would have devastating consequences. More than one million people are believed to be in Rafah, most displaced from other parts of Gaza. Some now say they are fleeing the city ahead of a potential ground incursion. And CNN's Paula Hancocks is following developments from Abu Dhabi, she joins us now, and journalist Elliott Gotkine is standing by in London. So, Paula, let's go to you first and just bring us up to date with the situation.",

      "sentences": "Rosemary, no breakthrough, but no breakdown in the talks either. They are still ongoing, albeit perhaps at a lower level. We, of course, had the head of the Mossad from Israel. We had his counterpart from Egypt and, of course, his counterpart from the U.S., Bill Burns, and also the Qatari prime minister as well discussing the framework deal that was proposed in Paris just the other week and also Hamas's counter proposal for a hostage deal that would see the more than 100 Israeli hostages who were taken captive as part of Hamas's terrorist attacks of October the 7th, who've been in captivity now for more than four months, released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.And one of the sticking points we understand from the U.S. official is the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to be freed in exchange for those Israeli hostages. We heard regarding Hamas's proposal last week, that it was asking for all women, minors, elderly, sick Palestinian prisoners to be freed. That doesn't seem to be so controversial for the Israelis. Where they seem to have a problem is with the next batch that Hamas was demanding, some 1,500 Palestinian prisoners, including a third of whom who are serving life sentences, some of them for killing Israelis or being part of attacks that killed Israelis. Indeed, you'll recall Prime Minister Netanyahu last week referring to Hamas' demands as delusional. Now, there is still optimism that this gulf can be bridged between Israel and Hamas. Hamas wasn't part of those negotiations in Cairo. Its position is being presented by the Egyptians and the Qataris. There is still hope, but no breakthrough yet and certainly pressure building on Netanyahu to do some kind of deal.",

But obviously Republicans who are watching this race closely, especially Republicans from vulnerable districts, swing districts in this area, they are going to be taking some key lessons. One of the things Suozzi was able to do in this race was really flip the script when it came to immigration. Republicans have been using that as a cudgel against Democrats in elections over the last several years. Tom Suozzi made his case that he would have supported a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and that Mazi Pilip did not have any answers to actually solve that issue. The key question now, if Republicans couldn't win on the issue of immigration here in New York, third, where can they actually win on that issue? For CNN, Lauren Fox. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It was a victory in the suburbs. And there was a question of who was going to win the suburbs in 2024. That's an indication the Democrats can do well there. It was a good test.And one of the most interesting things, I think, is that the Democrat won not because of the issues, but in spite of the issues. The issues seem to favor the Republicans. Immigration was the most important issue. The border was very important. And crime, the Democrat found a strategy for dealing with that, which is to confront those issues, just talk about them openly and not try to hide from them. And so that may be a bellwether in that it indicates that the Democrats now may have developed a strategy for the '24 campaign, which is to go against Trump, to confront the issues, not to run away from them, and also run against the do-nothing Congress. So that could be very significant because the Democrats were looking for a message and a strategy, maybe it'll come out of the New York race.",

And so instead they go for a kind of frivolous stunt, a show that has no real political impact. It's all simple, very little substance.In the process, however, they're degrading and cheapening impeachment. The standard that we'd always had is, constitutionally, high crimes and misdemeanors. There are no high crimes or misdemeanors. Here it was a policy disagreement. And so, by dumbing down what it means to impeach, they open a door, kind of a Pandora's box, that in the future could come back to haunt them. And so I'm not sure it was much of a victory. The long and winding road of impeachment went from Nixon to Mayorkas. It went from high crimes and misdemeanors to partisan bickering.

Other areas around the city saw even more buildup. Thousands of customers in Connecticut, New Jersey and beyond lost power, and schools in multiple states cancelled classes due to the snow. Conditions made travel difficult as well, with more than 250 car accidents reported in New Jersey according to the state's governor, and more than 1,000 flights canceled across the U.S. with the majority out of airports in New York, Boston, and New Jersey, according to FlightAware. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may change its guidance for people with COVID-19 this spring. According to the Washington Post, the potential new guidelines would not require people to isolate if they have mild symptoms and no fever for 24 hours.

But we're hearing the agency may loosen that recommendation to be that if you haven't had a fever for at least 24 hours without the help of medication and your symptoms are generally mild or they're improving, then you don't have to isolate. Now these are just discussions that are happening as we're now living in a world where there is some community immunity. But the head of the CDC says right now, quote, \"there are no updates to COVID guidelines to announce at this time.\" End quote. If this shift in guidance does happen, it would align with what some states like California and Oregon already recommend on a local level, and it would align with what is already recommended for people who have other types of respiratory illnesses like the flu or RSV.

And keeping that in mind, Shehbaz Sharif, the former prime minister of Pakistan, the most recent prime minister of Pakistan, was the one who has been announced as the main candidate to be PM in the next parliament as well. And the other major parties of the country, aside from the PTI, have announced that they will be backing him. So again, rising inflation, an IMF deal that needs to be wrapped up as well, increased militancy in the country. So, we'll have to wait and see if this rage amongst Khan supporters regarding what they claim is a stolen mandate is going to be something that unfolds further in the country. Rosemary?",

It's been a week since an overturned ship was discovered leaking oil into the ocean and surrounding area, in what Trinidad and Tobago's Prime Minister has classified as a national emergency. CNN's Max Foster joins me now live from London. Good to see you, Max. So, we've been reporting on this for a few days now, but many of the details remain a mystery. What more can you tell us?",

And the government says it is now under control. But I think what we're seeing is this ongoing conversation because there's a huge amount of questions around the mystery of this boat.So, the government doesn't know who it belongs to, no idea where it came from. The prime minister says they don't even know exactly what it contains. Some sort of hydrocarbon is all we're being told. And then no suggestion that there was any life on board when it overturned. There were no distress signals. So now we're in this situation where there's all sort of speculation bubbling up around, you know, what this ship was doing, who it belonged to and why we're not hearing more about it. So, it's gone into the realms of a bit conspiracy theory, but I think, you know, the facts are pretty limited, but as far as we're aware, the government feels quite comfortable about it being under control.",
