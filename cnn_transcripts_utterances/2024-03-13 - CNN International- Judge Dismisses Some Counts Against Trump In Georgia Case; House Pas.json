The CAO (ph) of the House has just approved a bill that could ban TikTok in the United States. And also, just a short time ago, the judge in the Georgia election subversion case dismissed some of the charges against former President Donald Trump and his co-defendants. Now, to be clear, as the judge stated here, this case will continue. Judge Scott McAfee, though, did throw out some of the charges. The rest will remain intact. And if you're wondering how this comes into play with that other ruling that we're waiting for from this judge, well, the ruling on those ethics allegations brought against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, those have not come in yet. So, we're still waiting for those. Let's go straight to CNN's Nick Valencia in Atlanta. So, Nick, bring us up to speed here on the charges that were thrown out and why.",

Now, six of those charges have been thrown out, all of them having to do with this alleged solicitation of these defendants to get these public officials to violate their oath. But, the judge here in this case, Scott McAfee, ruling that the District Attorney's Office did not provide enough detail about what those alleged crimes these defendants were soliciting from the public officials. So, he has decided to throw these counts out. Some of them have to do with the former President, including this fake elector scheme, the scheme by Trump and his allies to subvert the Electoral College and try to say that he won 2020 here, the election in 2020 in Georgia, when he did not.The other charges have to do with Trump and that phone call to the Secretary of State, trying to get him to decertify the election results and overturn the election results. We should be clear, though, the most significant count in this indictment still stands, and that's the racketeering count, count one in this indictment. And we should also be clear not to confuse our viewers, we are still waiting on whether or not Scott McAfee, the judge here, is going to rule to dismiss Fani Willis. He did say in a recent interview that he is on track to make that decision by the end of the week. But, he went out of his way in this ruling to say that this does not mean the indictment is dismissed. We are still waiting really on pins and needles to see what his decision is on Fani Willis, though. Erica.",

And to the extent that that would not have been the case, then, yes, you can revisit those pleas. Remember, though, that when someone takes a plea, right, a defendant decides to plead guilty, there is a negotiation with prosecutors as to what specific counts the prosecutors would like the defendant to plead to. And so, it could very well be the case, right, that if any of these indictment charges that have been dismissed or implicated that the prosecutor simply inputs or interposes other charges that would be appropriate, and the defendant can plead guilty to them. The defendant also may have the option in those circumstances to withdraw the plea completely and proceed to move forward.But, apparently, I think the lawyers looked at the indictment in its entirety and determined that a plea was appropriate. So, the short answer is, yes, it could affect them. But, the longer answer is that in a generalized sense, they may just substitute a different type of indictment charge and still enter a plea of guilty anyway.",

The judge being very clear, though. This is in no way the end of this case. MATT MOWERS, FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ADVISOR, &amp; PRESIDENT, VALCOUR GLOBAL PUBLIC STRATEGY: Right. But, what you're seeing a lot of President Trump and a lot of his allies are doing right now are almost acting as the defense lawyers in a court of public opinion. What they're trying to do is essentially just poke holes in every argument they can against this case. And you see a lot of his allies, Congressman Mike Collins from Georgia, for example, tweeting out some of the decision from the judge that says that the lack of the ability to bring some of the charges was \"fatal\". And he is using language like that from the actual judge's opinion. And doing so, what they're trying to do is discredit this entire set of charges against President Trump in the court of public opinion. And look, Mo and I, both been around politics. We've been on campaigns. You would never advise anyone to be criminally indicted when they're running for office. But, if you are, you kind of want it to go the path that's been going for former President Trump right now, just given the number of headaches and hurdles that prosecutors in different jurisdictions have been having going forward with this case as well as the others.",

It's also important to point out the kind of support and usage that TikTok has, nearly half of all Americans and 170 million Americans. The bill would block that social media site from U.S. app stores if it is not spun off from its China-linked parent company ByteDance. China lashed out at a potential TikTok ban just a short time ago, saying that it believes it will backfire on the United States. CNN's Marc Stewart has more on that for us.

Let's take a listen to that exchange.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEWART: As you will know, lawmakers in the United States are voting to possibly ban TikTok regardless of what they may decide. What is your response to feelings of distrust from American lawmakers and the American public toward Chinese companies? WANG WENBIN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN (Interpreted): Even though the U.S. has not found evidence on how TikTok endangers its national security, it has never stopped going after TikTok. Such practice of resorting to acts of bullying, when one could not succeed in fair competition, disrupts the normal operation of the market. It undermines the confidence of international investors and sabotages the global economic and trade order. This will eventually backfire. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And yesterday, it was the state that helped them get over the top, and the campaign saying it was \"the cherry\" on top for them, because Georgia is a state that's going to be very important in terms of voter mobilization and voter outreach, because there aren't any key statewide races that would bolster voter turnout. So, all of this taken together just shows a campaign that is hitting the ground running as they try to notch victories in each of these states as they did in 2020, knowing that this is a race that's going to be very, very close.",

Look, Ken Buck, I believe, resigned for numbers -- resigning early for a number of reasons, some of which are personal, professional reasons for whatever his next opportunity is.

It's even more complicated by the fact that you have Lauren Boebert, member of Congress from Colorado, who changed districts, is actually running for his open seat.The challenges with a special election that's likely to happen or a special nominating process there, if she were somehow selected, she would then have to resign her other seat.

Looking at Georgia, Matt, not every Nikki Haley voter is necessarily a registered Republican. We know that.

So, they'll make that argument that that contributes to some of that vote share. You talked about the fact that some of the folks who voted for her have never voted for Donald Trump. They voted for whether it's Secretary Clinton or President Biden in 2016 or 2020.And so, I think in Georgia, based upon the polling I've seen, President Trump has a lead over President Biden of anywhere from five to eight points right now, which is pretty significant in the scheme of things. But, it doesn't mean he can take his eye off the ball. And it's clearly going to be a lot of those more moderate Republicans, those 10 percent to 15 percent of Republicans who love the policies, supported the policies of the Trump administration, but may not be comfortable with some of the tweets and the personality, or maybe some of the things after the 2020 election or following the case down in Fulton, Georgia, as well.",

And what you're seeing increasingly is the need to essentially fight a two-front war, drawing contrasts with not just Donald Trump, but with potential third-party candidates.

Researchers say there are two main dangers at play here, the weaponization of AI that could inflict potentially irreversible damage, and concerns that AI labs could actually lose control of their own creations, noting AI should be considered a security risk on par with nuclear weapons.The European Union is leading the way now in policing AI. Today, its Parliament gave final approval to what is being called the world's first comprehensive binding framework for trustworthy artificial intelligence. The law imposes blanket bans on some unacceptable uses of the technology, while also enacting some stiff guardrails for other apps deemed high risk.

All of those things would be outright banned and prohibited under this law.Now, there are a number of other kind of lower risk uses of AI that the EU acknowledges can be useful, but would want some serious safeguards around. So, any AI that may be used for healthcare decisions or economic or hiring decisions, the use of AI in situations that could end up affecting elections and democratic processes, all of those applications would be subject to some pretty tough oversight and rules to ensure that it doesn't get out of hand. And then, there are a set of broader regulations on sort of general purpose AI companies like OpenAI and ChatGPT that would force them to disclose more about how their systems work. And it would also force anyone who is creating deep fakes, essentially manipulated images using AI, to disclose that they're using -- that they're creating material that's not real.
