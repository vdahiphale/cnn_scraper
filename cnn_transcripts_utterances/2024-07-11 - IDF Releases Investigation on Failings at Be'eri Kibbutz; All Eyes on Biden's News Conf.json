      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, we are very few hours away from a high-stakes solo news conference from U.S. President Joe Biden as he wraps up the NATO Summit. We'll tell you why this could be the most consequential moment of his political career. Then Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks NATO allies for their support as his country is recovering from a new wave of Russian attacks. We are live in Kyiv for you this hour. Plus, former U.S. President and Republican candidate Donald Trump claims he knows nothing about a controversial conservative proposal, Project 2025. But new CNN reporting suggests otherwise. We'll bring you, of course, the very latest. We begin tonight though in Washington D.C. where U.S. President Joe Biden is facing a watershed moment that threatens to turn the U.S. presidential race upside down. In a few hours, Mr. Biden will go before the White House press corps for a news conference. This amid mounting pressure from Democrats to exit the race and his re- election bid now on the brink. The firestorm around the Biden campaign has been picking up steam just over the last couple of hours, while Mr. Biden was meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the final day of this NATO Summit. Sources tell CNN, a number of angry as well as stunned Democrats are now blaming Biden's closest advisors for allegedly shielding the public from the full extent of his apparent decline in mental fitness. While the stakes for this upcoming news conference, as we just set up for you cannot be any higher. Every word, every move by the President under intense scrutiny since his halting debate really -- performance on CNN just two weeks ago. The top Democrat in the House had this to say when he was asked about the dwindling support in his party for President Biden. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY):  We have engaged in a process of talking to each other, those conversations have been candid, comprehensive and clear- eyed, and they continue until that process has concluded. I'm not going to address what any outside stakeholders may have to say about this matter. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A delegation from Biden's campaign team just as importantly was just on Capitol Hill briefing senators, Democratic senators about how they still insist that he can win this campaign. They say he still has a path to victory through the Midwest swing states, but this news conference is absolutely crucial. I can't remember a similar occasion when a presidency has been on the line, when a president actually goes in to a news conference and addresses the White House press. So, those are the stakes for the President. It's difficult to see how given the rapid deterioration of his political position in the Democratic Party, he can really help himself with this news conference. But as you said at the top, any gaffe or sense that he's confused or incoherent moment, that will only underscore the impression that 50 million Americans got about his condition from that CNN debate, exactly two weeks ago.",

The priorities of Ukraine, China's cyber and really celebrating the 75 years here. But so much of this three-day summit has really been overshadowed by the discussion that is taking place here in the U.S., the political discussion over Biden's political fate, the 32-member countries and their delegations who have come here, plus, other countries as well watching very closely what Biden is saying, what Biden is doing. Questions about how he's doing physically, how he's doing mentally. He -- President Biden opened the NATO Summit with a speech that was quite well- received, of course, that was very scripted. We just saw President Biden moments ago in a one-on-one meeting with their teams, with President Zelenskyy, President Biden was speaking from cue cards quite carefully. And so, everyone here will also of course, be watching that press conference, not just out of some kind of curiosity, but because of course, it has very real implications for their countries, for the NATO alliance. President Zelenskyy probably said it most bluntly on Tuesday night as the summit was opening, he said, everybody is watching November, including President Vladimir Putin of Russia, because of the very real implications. You have President Biden and former President Trump who have two wildly divergent views of the role and the importance of NATO for the Biden administration, NATO is crucial, it is very much a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, while at the same time, you have former President Biden -- former President Trump, excuse me, who has spoken with disdain about the NATO alliance, about countries who don't pay their dues, even saying that the U.S. and NATO would not come to the aid of NATO countries who would be invaded by Russia if they don't pay their dues. He said that Russia could do whatever the hell they want, so yes, there is a lot of discussion about President Biden, his political fate and what could happen in the coming weeks and months. Isa.",

Now, we heard from some senators leaving that meeting, we heard notably from Senator Richard Blumenthal moments ago, he says some of his concerns were -- laid, but he said some concerns were deepened and was not clear specifically what information he received that deepened his concerns. Other senators saying, look, this was a family discussion and not wanting to get in the details. It is very clear here that many Senate Democrats and House Democrats are really trying to make the decision what they see for -- if President Biden should continue on with the nomination.

I want to bring in Democraticstrategist Ameshia Cross, she joins us from Washington D.C., and Ameshia, welcome to the show. Look, it's clear from what we've heard, not just from our correspondents in Washington D.C., but elsewhere that the President is under enormous pressure. And it seems that that's not going away right, since that disastrous CNN debate. As a former campaign adviser here, Ameshia, I mean, what does he need to do in your view if you're to regain the confidence, not just of the party, but also of the U.S. voters. AMESHIA CROSS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I don't think he's tremendously lost the confidence of U.S. voters. We know that this was going to be a tight race. The race was tight before the debate, it's tight after the debate. We also know that the President's holding stance as in terms of favorability has not changed since April. And that's -- you know, that was long before the debate. This is a president who was up against the headwinds of a -- of a media that is watching his every move, that has been quite frankly very hostile and asking questions, some fair, many not, since the debate itself. The questions that they're not asking his opponent, who is a 34 felony convicted felon, a convicted guy who is also, you know, committed treason, who instigated January 6th so on and so forth. But I think that for President Biden, he's got to do what any campaign would have to do at this stage. He's going to have to meet the people where they are, press the flesh. He knows who the Democratic base is. It's younger voters, it's black voters, it's Latino voters. It's going into the battleground states, the states that will decide this election, and ensuring that those individuals know his plans moving forward. Ensuring that they understand what the three-and-a-half years of a Joe Biden presidency, one that is unrivaled in its successes by anyone except Franklin Delano Roosevelt knows what those successes are. He's got to press the flesh and be on the campaign trail, and he's doing that over the past few days, he's been to over eight states. He's now in front of global leaders at the NATO Summit.

I'm sure you saw this new \"ABC News\"-\"Washington Post\" poll that found that 67 percent of voters, you can see there on your screen, think Biden should step aside, over half of Democrats say the same.

And this is what he wrote for the \"Washington Post\" op- ed. He said, \"he saved us from Donald Trump once and wants to do it again.

Well, that Patriot is already in that new security assistance package. Now, the other items in that package by and large are things to keep Ukraine in the fight, and try to fend off the Russians who are trying to advance, of course, still in the northeast and in the east of the country, a lot of them are interceptor missiles for the NASAMS systems, which is a shorter range surface-to-air missile system and also ammunition, 155-millimeter ammunition for artillery, also artillery rocket ammunition as well for the HIMARS systems. Anti-tank missiles are also part of the whole thing as well. So, the Ukrainians getting that air defense system that they so badly need, and the Patriot missile system is definitely one where the Ukrainian said for them, that's almost worth its weight in gold for the Ukrainians as they're trying to defend their cities.

And that is, in the last few minutes, Jeremy, the IDF seems to -- presented its findings on an internal investigation into the failures at Kibbutz Be'eri in Israel on October the 7th.

Thanks very much, Jeremy.And still to come tonight, President Joe Biden prepares to take the mic in what could be a make-or-break moment for his political career. We'll see what the latest polls are showing ahead of this major test. And his opponent, Donald Trump, says he knows nothing about a controversial conservative plan to reshape federal government. CNN reporting suggests that might not be the case. That is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

So, we took a look at the people whoare involved in writing this 900-page playbook that Project 2025 put out. And when you look at the authors and contributors, 140 of them had previous experience working in the Trump administration. Dozens of others had roles in political life, in his transition team and then found their way to helping these groups that have been advising Project 2025. It includes people who reach the highest levels of Trump's government, including six people who served in his cabinet, four people who he nominated to ambassadorships, many of the architects and enforcers of his immigration policies, as well as several senior level staffers. And when we brought this information to the Trump campaign, they acknowledge, yes, these people did work for Donald Trump, but they don't speak for him now, and they may not work for him again. They said that if there is any sort of policy that Trump has endorsed, it's on his websites, and it is also in the Republican Party platform. Trump yesterday on Truth Social continuing to push this idea that he doesn't know who is behind it, that he doesn't know even what it is. And this coming as Democrats have been taking pieces of Project 2025's plans that are extremely controversial, especially related to abortion policies and many of these culture war issues and trying to pin them on Donald Trump. Trump is trying to keep Project 2025 at arm's length. That's very complicated, though, given how close he is to many of the people who helped put it together.",

Well, this Project 2025 suggests getting -- making it much more difficult to get abortion medication, contraceptives, even male contraceptives. So, that is some of the language that is in this 900-page document that they are concerned about compared to the sort of very tame, sanitized, 16- page platform that they have approved as sort of Donald Trump's vision for the next term.",

      "sentences": "Sure. I think that there is an elite conversation and immediate conversation about Biden and certainly aconversation at the upper echelons of the Democratic Party and then there's voters. And I think there's a slightly different conversation happening with voters. And so, as you noted, The Washington Post, ABC poll had the race tied. It was also tied in their poll before the debate, meaning debate had no impact on the vote. The other piece of information that has not really been brought to that poll was that the relative standing of Biden and Trump is quite different. Trump is significantly less popular than Biden is in that poll. And that has been true in a lot of the work. I work on campaigns all over the country. And that has been true in a lot of my polling, is that while certainly voters have said that Biden, they believe, he may be too old, have questions about his competence or his ability, certainly not helped by the debate performance, they're also deeply, deeply, deeply hostile to Donald Trump, particularly post his conviction. And so, I think that what you're going to find is because of partisan polarization in this country and because Trump is even less popular than Biden, you're going to find the race doesn't really change that much. And I know that there are a lot of electeds who are in competitive states and congressional districts who are nervous about this, but in the polling that I've done for my campaigns and in what I've seen publicly, I haven't seen a change. If you look at, for example, what we call the generic congressional race, meaning a generic Democrat versus a generic Republican, that has been unchanged. That has been tied and the debate had no effect on it. And so, I think we have to be very careful to not confuse the frenzy in Washington with what's actually happening out in the country.",

And so, I don't know. This has been a very -- I think you have to think about our politics differently now in this country. We're in a post-Trump era where -- or I guess we're in the Trump era, if you will, and most of our elections are determined by his dynamic. And so, trying to compare it to other instances in our past just doesn't make a lot of sense. But I don't think - you know, I think both in '16 and in '20, it wasn't clear who was going to win those races. Both candidates were deeply unpopular in both those races. We have the same dynamic now. Lots and lots of questions about competence. You know, frankly, there's lots of questions about Trump and his mental state and his mental acuity as well.",

Why this is significant is because there had been information that came out through the investigation that there was live ammunition around the set. But now having this specific confirmation on the stand from this witness that another actor had a live bullet in their holster indicates that another actor besides Alec Baldwin could have put -- could have been put in the position where they could have fired a gun that could have fatally shot someone like the gun did sadly with Halyna Hutchins. Now, this crime scene technician also was showing photos of these bullets to the jury. We see them right there. She was showing the difference between live bullets and dummy bullets. But as we see in this image, it's very hard to tell the difference, certainly for a lay person who is not a firearms expert.
