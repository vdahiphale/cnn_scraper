So, there's a long history there obviously plays into Queen Elizabeth's history as well, with the many U.S presidents that she met. What is different about this visit is that we're actually being told what they're going to discuss, which would never have been the case with Elizabeth. Those conversations were always highly confidential. We're told they will be discussing environment, something that King Charles and the president of the U.S. share a lot of common interests over. So, we can have a discussion about that. A lot to fix, actually, frankly, in this special relationship, as it's called here in the U.K. There are tensions, Arlette was talking there about Ukraine, not just about these cluster bombs, but also about how quickly Ukraine should become a member of NATO, and also reportedly, President Biden rejected U.K.'s choices, head of NATO as well. So when it comes to the head of state meeting with the president, this is all about firming up the very long term relationship between the two countries. So, some pressure, actually, on King Charles to get this one right as a big meeting for him at the beginning of his monarchy.",

So, that raises, of course, questions why did they wait so long to tell us. There was, though, there a leak in a French news outlet.We know that it lasted three hours, according to Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, that he doesn't say what exactly was discussed, and that it involved 35 people. They're saying all unit commanders and the leadership of the campaign, including Prigozhin. This seems to be deliberately ambiguous. They're not saying whether these are the commanders of the overall so-called special military operations. So, Ministry of Defense figures the Kremlin would not comment on whether any representative of the Ministry of Defense was there. But they do say that Putin listened to the explanations provided by the commanders and offered them further options for deployment and a further combat use. Again, major questions around that. Does this signal that Wagner could still have a role to play in this conflict? That, of course, is crucial to Ukraine. We still don't know, by the way, where Yevgeny Prigozhin is. If this meeting was on the 29th, we don't know where he's gone since then. There have been no photos or videos of him emerging since the armed rebellion itself, where he was seen leaving Rostov in Russia. So, many, many, many questions about this. One really interesting comment, though, I want to bring out from Peskov, he said that these commanders said that they were staunch supporters and soldiers of the head of state and supreme commander, so Putin himself. He said they were also ready to continue to fight for the motherland. So, are they reaffirming their support for Putin? Does Wagner, as I said, continue to have a role to play in this war?

      "sentences": "So, what is the significance of this and like in the larger picture with the war going on in Ukraine?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Pamela. The big thing that I look at this is, as Ambassador Taylor said, this guy is weak. I mean, if you were going to be playing the czar, in Russian history, you always had the czar as the center of all things good. Even though there was evil happening in the middle of the bureaucracy, the czar would take care of you eventually. So, Putin could have played that role, but it appears that he didn't play that role. And since he didn't do that, I agree with the ambassador, this makes him very weak. And from a military standpoint, this could mean that the Wagner group comes back into Ukraine, could mean. It could also mean that they're trying to reorganize things because they have a shortage of munitions, or they have a shortage of weapons systems or a shortage of personnel. And I believe they have a shortage in all those three areas. MATTINGLY:  So, everything is clear as mud, obviously in Moscow, which is par for the course to some degree. But this is all happening as President Biden and NATO leaders head into a very consequential summit in Lithuania. From President Biden's perspective, what's kind of the key takeaway? What does he need from this meeting, from this summit? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  I think stability, right, and this ongoing support of the Ukrainian war effort you have in America. Polls showing that Americans, by and large, support this. It's over 50 percent. It's more than Biden's approval rating. And so he needs to keep this alliance together. He needs to keep NATO strong, right? If you flash back to President Trump's presidency, a very different take on NATO and America's position in the world. So, I think if you're Biden, you want to strengthen NATO, you want to also, I mean, just sort of, politically, for his own benefit, I think, you want to make no mistakes, right? No gaps over there that are visible and sort of easily picked up on by the American public. But mainly, I think it's making sure that this alliance stays together, that they stay strong in support of this effort of Ukraine. Listen, there has been some disagreement around these munitions, for instance, the cluster munitions, some disagreement here from his people of his own party, and then, of course, some disagreement with the NATO alliance as well.",

He said there's been no issue. You had that statement from Sunak, the prime minister of the U.K., expressing the U.K. stance.But behind the scenes, do you think it's a different situation in terms of what the allies are saying to the Biden administration about this decision?",

In order to do that, the Ukrainians need ammunition, 155 artillery ammunition.It turns out they don't have very much it turns out we don't have very much of the unitary. What we have a lot of are these cluster munitions. So, in order to get them the ammunition they need for right now, until we can ramp up production of this unitary, they need to provide ammunition so that the Russians can't run them over. BROWN:  Can I just follow up really quickly, if you don't mind, in terms of the difference between the cluster munitions the U.S. is sending over versus what Russia has been using, break it down for us, Cedric.

      "sentences": "The weather has cleared out today, Phil, and that is the good news, although airlines are still recovering after that huge day for cancellations yesterday, just checked FlightAware, 437 cancellations already today after the more than 2,000 nationwide yesterday. That puts it in the top five for cancellations this year.A busy day for a lot of folks. In fact, the TSA told me they screened 2.63 million people at airports nationwide yesterday, all the folks coming back from the holiday week. The worst airports, New York especially hard hit LaGuardia. Half of all flights in or out canceled yesterday. Newark, 8 percent of all United Flights canceled, JFK, huge international hub, about one in five flights there canceled, Boston Logan hit hard, Philadelphia hit hard, even here at Reagan National Airport, 20 percent of all flights canceled. Here's what happened. The FAA says, as that weather moved through the East Coast, it cut off some major flight routes, essentially the on and off ramps to get in those busy airports. So, we are still hearing about ground stops today. We are not out of the woods just yet. The FAA warning of ground stops in New York, also in Boston and in Florida, as the day goes on. This is the big tip and the big takeaway you should take from this, according to travel experts. Try to take the first flight out if you can. It's the weather that builds later in the day that's usually the problem. And if you leave early, you have a 25 percent better chance of getting to where you want to go on time. Phil?",
