Donald Trump right now at 44 percent, if that held, would be a best performance for Republican candidate among Hispanic voters since George W. Bush back in 2004.And this is part of a larger trend line, Kate, that we're seeing among non-white voters, we see among black voters as well -- we've discussed that on this program before -- whereby they're much more favorable to Donald Trump than they were four years ago.

That's bigger than 2019 before the pandemic, four percent bigger than last year, bigger than 2005, which was also a huge year after the slump of travel following 9/11. The big thing that is driving this according to AAA, are gas prices. The national average of a gallon of gas now $3.61. Compare that to last year, about the same. People with longer memories might think that is high, but you have to consider that so many people now are budgeting for travel.

We've been talking to customers as they've been rolling in here, they've been telling us they've been trying to arrive least two hours early because they knew about the issues. It actually kind of goes along with what Pete is talking about because the traffic to get to the airport has been astronomically crazy, and everything has been backed up. That's probably going to play out across airports all across the country. They do believe, this will be the largest run of people coming to the airport since 2019, 3.5 million people. And look not many things do better numbers in the Super Bowl. Here, just yesterday, they did over 111,000 passengers through TSA, that was more than 104,000 the day after Super Bowl. So you know, the impact when it comes to people who are going to be out here traveling back and forth, but looking at this security lines, already starting at seven o'clock this morning, they have been backed up and this will be a ripple effect across the country. They believe that traveling will be up some nine percent across the country as 3.5 million people hit the air. You know, when you add all of this together and you think about the fact, there is some weather out there, everyone is sort of packing their patience.

In terms of lawsuits, the state of California is saying we want to let them make money on their name, image, and likeness. Everyone has been hearing NIL -- name, image and likeness. That's what's been happening over the last few years to the point we reach this moment where the NCAA and the colleges really realized that if they didn't settle, as you said, $2.77 billion, that they could be bankrupt, because they would have lost much more in those lawsuits if they had gone to court.
