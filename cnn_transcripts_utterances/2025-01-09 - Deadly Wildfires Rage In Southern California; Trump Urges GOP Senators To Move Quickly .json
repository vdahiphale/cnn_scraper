The latest fire breaking out near the Hollywood Hills late last night, putting some of Los Angeles, most famed landmarks in harm's way. So far, at least five people have died in the wildfire outbreak, and there are now several major fires burning across the county that are fueled by winds which have at times gusted up to 100 miles per hour. Evacuations, which some residents describe as chaotic, are underway. The gridlock getting so bad in some places that evacuees have abandoned their cars and continued on foot. More than 130,000 residents impacted by evacuation orders, and more people need to be ready to leave. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT.

Ariel, very grateful to have you on the show this morning. What is the status of the conditions around battling these fires? And what can residents expect as this continues into the next day? ARIEL COHEN, METEOROLOGIST IN CHARGE, NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, LOS ANGELES/OXNARD:  First of all, I want to say on behalf of the National Weather Service that our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by these fires. These fires are going through, raging through our own communities in our area, and it is heartbreaking to see what has happened. We know that the loss has been truly catastrophic and extensive across the area. You know, we're here standing by our partners in the emergency operations center in the Los Angeles area, make sure that were working together to foster public safety as we go forward. We are past the peak of the destructive windstorm component of this event, with those 80 to 100 mile an hour wind gusts being in the past at this point. Nevertheless, strong Santa Ana winds do continue across the region and will continue for at least the next couple of days. They are becoming increasingly confined to wind prone areas from the San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Mountains, all the way through the Santa Monica to the Malibu coast area. And with these winds remaining in the 30 to 50, occasionally 60 miles per hour range and very dry conditions, very significant amount of fuel loading available for these fires to burn through, we continue with critical fire weather conditions and red flag warnings as we head through tomorrow. So while we don't have the same extreme level of a destructive wind storm going on, we still are expecting fires to grow rapidly and explosively at times as this is continues to be a very strong wind event across the area. Everyone needs to be at a high state of readiness.",

If its one bill this too big to fail kind of strategy if everything's in there, if there's something you don't like, he thinks he can get everyone on board and that will make it easier for him.On the other hand, Majority Leader John Thune and many people in the Senate who I talked to think that they need to do two bills and move faster, especially on the border element of this package. They say, you know, the tax conversation is going to be really complicated, especially when you're dealing with, you know, lifting SALT caps and some of these very controversial tax policies. And they want a win quickly. They want to move on the issues that they think that they can all get support on faster on the border in particular. And there's also some nervousness from people I've talked about that, you know, Trump may say its fine to do one big bill, but then as the weeks and months go on without any wins on the border, that he may get impatient and they want to move faster to prevent that.",

But Alito says he only discussed a former law clerk of his who is seeking a job with the incoming Trump administration. Today, the Senate holds a procedural vote on the first bill in the new Congress, the Laken Riley Act. The GOP led immigration bill would require detention for undocumented migrants charged with theft or burglary. It has gained traction among some Senate Democrats, but it's unclear if it's enough for final passage. The bill is named after a Georgia student killed by an undocumented migrant last year. In just hours, a funeral service will be held at the Washington National Cathedral for America's 39th president, Jimmy Carter. There he is live, lying in state at the United States Capitol.
