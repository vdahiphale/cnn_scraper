Well, look, it's obviously right now this whole question of will they or won't they debate? I will say from my conversations with Donald Trump's team, they recognize that they need to have a debate before the election. The question is really about the rules. And I know this is such a processy question and that, you know, it sounds like we're getting in the weeds a bit, which we are. It's the question of whether or not microphones will be on for the entire length of the debate or shut off for one of certain -- when a candidate is finished speaking. But I think the key thing to take away from this discussion in this debate over the debate, John, is that it shows how important both campaigns view this debate. They recognize it could be a defining moment ahead of the election, just like it was in June for President Joe Biden. And so they want to do whatever they can to have their candidate get an edge. And right now we are seeing this jockeying over the rules, trying to see which side can get, you know, maybe a better advantage or can get an edge in that September 10th debate. That is what this is all about. And it really does come down to that they recognize that this is going to be a big moment at one for Harris to really try and define herself on a grander stage than we've seen apart from last week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. This is a moment where she can go head to head with Donald Trump on the debate stage. And so they recognize the stakes of this. And I know from my conversations with Trump's senior advisors as well, that they also recognize how important of a moment this is for Donald Trump. And, remember, we talked about this in the lead up to the CNN debate in June, but they also recognize that Donald Trump's demeanor, his rhetoric, his tone whether or not he is being very aggressive toward Harris, that could potentially be even more important for the debate and for some of the prep that they are doing than actually some of the substance. They recognize that he needs to look presidential. He cannot come off looking like a bully. And so that's where a lot of this is coming down to. And I know, despite all of this talk behind the scenes that both sides are prepping. Donald Trump is doing more informal policy sessions, but he is preparing for this because they recognize how important a debate is for these -- both of these campaigns.",

That is not really the history that we've seen between these two men.RFK Jr., and this was great reporting from our K-File team, had really criticized Donald Trump very heavily. He had a history of calling him a bully, someone who appealed to bigotry and hatred, even tried to argue that Donald Trump was corrupt. And some of these attacks we heard as recently as early July. Take a listen to one of these interviews that RFK Jr. did on July 2nd. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY (I), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Oh, you know, I think Donald Trump was a terrible president. He wasn't training this one. He was a terrible president. He was turning the government over to corporate pirates. I think the problem is, number one, he's a bully. And, you know, I don't like bullies, and I don't think America M.O. (ph). That's part of America's tradition. The easiest thing for a political leader to do is to appeal to our bigotry and our hatred and xenophobia and prejudice and point to people who are unlike us and say they're the ones who are damaging our country.

And I think that's a really important part. He also criticized RFK Jr. very heavily, but when it comes down to it, I think. When I talked to the Trump campaign, they say we want to have any edge weekend and this election and bringing him onto our side could potentially help them on the margins and some of those really important battleground states.

But something that the campaign and that allies of the vice president tell me is that she wants to talk more to the individual experience, recognizing what people are facing.And so there is this new wave of ads that the campaign is releasing. They released one last Friday on economic opportunity, one yesterday on lowering prices and acknowledging that prices are too high. And I'll tell you that over just the last seven minutes, I got another release from the campaign about yet another economic ad that talks about her growing up in the middle class. So, clearly taken together, they are trying to do a couple things here and talking about the issues that affect people while also her talking about her background and why she is a candidate that understands it best.

And what they're pointing is to the fact that, over the course of decades, more than a hundred years, the Justice Department attorney general has had the power to provide these powers to an outside prosecutor to do cases and limit whatever jurisdiction they have. And until now, every other court has found that this is completely legal until they ran into Judge Aileen Cannon.And I'll read you just a part of what the filing says before the 11th Circuit. It says, if the attorney general lacks the power to appoint inferior officers, that conclusion would invalidate the appointment of every member of the department who exercises significant authority and occupies a continuing office. And then it says, you know, other than, you know, some of the offices that are specifically mentioned in statute or the constitution, the Defense Department, State Department, Treasury and Labor Department. And so that's what they're fighting for. Look, we were looking, John, this summer, we thought for sure, that this was going to be a summer where Donald Trump was going to be defending himself, instead, because they ran into Judge Cannon down in Fort Pierce, Florida, the department is now fighting essentially for its very basic power to do these types of prosecutions with a special counsel. I should note that Hunter Biden has appealed, has tried to use this very reasoning to try to get his case dismissed. He has failed. A number of other people have failed. And so now we expect the 11th Circuit to take this up. No chance, it seems, for this to be resolved before the November election. John?",

We understand that parts of the country are experiencing rolling blackouts, families yet again are being sent into bomb shelters. And President Zelenskyy has vowed a revenge, a retaliation of some form for these Russian attacks.But he's absolutely in a tight place, Sara, because this is part of Russia's strategy, has been so since the beginning of the war, to attack civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, making it difficult to just get water or turn the light on or exist and leave in Ukraine. That's why President Zelenskyy is pleading with western allies, is pleading with the United States to lift restrictions on the use of weapons. He asked for two things specifically. He wants to be able to use his long range missiles inside Russian territory to target that war machine at its heart. And he also wants to be able to activate air defense systems near or up to air space that is Russian. Now, both of those things, of course, to western officials, to officials in D.C., will concern them. It will worry them about a potential escalation with President Putin. But President Zelenskyy says without this help, without lifting these restrictions, his people will continue to be vulnerable to these types of Russian attacks.",
