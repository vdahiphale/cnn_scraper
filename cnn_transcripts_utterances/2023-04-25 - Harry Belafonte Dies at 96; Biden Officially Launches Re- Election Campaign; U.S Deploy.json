Belafonte won several Grammy Awards for his records in the early 1960s and was one of the first black performers to win a Tony Award for the Broadway hit John Murray Anderson's Almanac.

In the '60s, he stood up for civil rights blacks in America and stood side-by-side with the likes of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy, both later assassinated. Two decades later, he turned his attention to the poor and powerless abroad, especially in Africa.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden officially launched his re-election bid, but that doesn't quite mean that he's going to be hitting the campaign trail just yet. Advisers say not to expect the president to be holding any type of large scale rallies in the immediate future. Instead, they believe, that one of his selling points to the American public people is simply doing his day-to-day job as president.A bit later today, we will see him address a union conference, trying to highlight his ties to the labor union. He is also, over the course of the next two days, hosting South Korea's president here at the White House for a state visit, an effort for him to be able to highlight his efforts to try to restore relationships around the world after some relationships were eroded during the Trump administration. But President Biden in that video laid out his record and vision for how he see the country and the way he wants to see the country move forward in the years to come. He also, as you heard him lay out there, warned of the threats that he believes America's freedoms are facing, including issues relating to abortion. And he says that they are being threatened by what he has described as those MAGA extremists. And you saw in that video how he highlighted two specific men who he could face off against in a general election matchup, and that is former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has yet to enter the 2024 race. Now, even as Biden is not expected to immediately hit the campaign trail, his campaign will be mobilizing their fundraising efforts in the days to come. They know they need to tap into those big dollar donors as well as grassroots supporters to help fuel this campaign in what is expected to be a very expensive race. But even as the contours of this campaign are taking shape, there are a number of challenges facing President Biden, including the majority of the American public who does not believe he should run for re- election and many raising concerns about the issue of his age. Of course, he's 80 years old, would be 86 at the end of a second term, if he were to win. These are things President Biden will have to address in the coming year-and-a-half as he tries to get voters onboard.",
