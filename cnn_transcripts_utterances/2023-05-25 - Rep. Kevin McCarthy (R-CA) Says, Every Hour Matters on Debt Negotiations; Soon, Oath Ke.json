And that hearing, we do expect it to go on for a little bit of time today. There are many things that have to happen in a sentencing hearing like this. There are arguments from both sides.We know that the Justice Department is going to be asking for Rhodes to be sentenced to 25 years in prison. So, that would be by far the largest sentence any January 6 Capitol rioter would be facing if the judge, Amit Mehta, does agree with the Justice Department and what they want here. But then Rhodes aside, they also are going to be arguing that he shouldn't be sentenced for that much. And I was reading some of the arguments that they made already in writing, and one of the things they say is that he should be credited for the amount of leadership he had in this organization, the Oath Keepers, for all of these years. Obviously, now, that is an organization that the Justice Department says led this conspiracy around the violence of the Capitol attack on January 6th. And not just Rhodes, many, many other members of the Oath Keepers have been found guilty of different types of charges, including seditious conspiracy related to that. But the judge is going to be looking at those arguments. He's also going to be taking into consideration an emotional hearing yesterday where many victims of the Capitol riot were able to speak about how it impacted them. One of them said a Metropolitan Police officer, Christopher Owens, said they chose to be a part of a group that surrounded us, taunted us. My physical scars, bruises and wounds have healed, but my mental trauma haunts me to this day. And so Judge Mehta is going to be thinking about those victims as he decides what to do with the sentence. He's also going to have to do a bit of math whenever he comes to determine exactly how much prison time if that is going to be given to Stewart Rhodes here today. John?",

But the prosecution has portrayed this sentencing in particular as a real outlier. They describe it over and over as unparalleled, unprecedented. They say it defies any comparison. And that is because witness after witness spoke about the impact and the trauma that the events of January 6th had on them.But the government also portrays the real victim here as our normal, democratic functioning. It's our democracy itself. And that flies off the pages of their 180-page sentencing memorandum, where they repeatedly talk about the injury to democratic functioning, peaceful transition of power and the rule of law.

And we see an uptick in political violence and they're saying, Judge, you have an opportunity to put an end to that and make a statement here, deter others who would do the same as the Oath Keepers, the so-called Oath Keepers, or as the government calls them, Oath Breakers, did on January 6th.",

And this is a case that revives the idea that this Idaho couple had wanted to build their dream home on a plot of land on Lake Priest in Idaho, and been stopped by environmental regulators. The EPA said that their land was essentially wetlands that needed special permits if they were even going to be able to build the sackets.The family challenged the Environmental Protection Agency. And today, the justices ruled, first of all, that their case can be revived. They can try to be able to build their home. But more importantly, Kate, the justices, by a 5-4 vote, instituted a new test to determine when the EPA can regulate wetlands. It had to do with how close parcel of land had to be to a body of water to be considered wetlands. And the justices today, again by a five four vote, in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, said that the parcel of land had to be continuous to actual water. They separated it under an old test. There just had to be kind of a significant nexus that, in this case, allowed the EPA to regulate the property. The EPA had won in a lower court, but now the justices, again, by a 5-4 vote, have reversed the lower court. And the other thing I should mention here, it's not just of consequence to this couple that for nearly two decades, as I say, has been trying to build this dream home on this piece of property, as they made their case to the justices, this is actually the second time that this case has come up to the justices. But more broadly, Kate, this is yet another ruling by this Supreme Court that cuts back on the power of the Environmental Protection Agency in its regulation. Last year, they did it under the Clean Air Act to restrict what the EPA could do. And this one, Kate, is under the Clean Water Act.",

And he is doing that by really criticizing Trump's time as president and suggesting that he would do much better and actually get done a lot of the things that Trump talked about doing but didn't actually accomplish. And as far as the rollout goes, most of the Republicans that I've been talking to are saying, look, this was an unconventional start. It was always going to be a little bit of a weird entrance into the race. The real question is how he campaigns and moves from here. And, really, we won't get a sense of whether he has the ability to take on Trump until these two guys get on a debate stage together.
