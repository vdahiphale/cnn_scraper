Ten tug boats, nine bridges, eight salvage vessels, seven floating cranes, five Coast Guard boats, and that's just for starters. Let me remind you why they need all this equipment the moment early Tuesday morning when the unthinkable happened, when a ship the size of a building slammed into the bridge. There's that moment, forcing it to fall in a matter of just seconds. It killed six construction workers who were filling potholes on the span at the time. The remains of four of those workers are still underwater, believed to be trapped under concrete. The collapse cut off a critical shipping terminal, crippling a major economic hub that brings in hundreds of millions of dollars every single day. Here is Maryland's Governor Wes Moore just moments ago about the difficult task of cleaning up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

So there's substantial Republicans support. I recognize some of my colleagues have a difference. I respect that. They're trying to keep America out of being entangled and what they like to call legitimately forever wars. But again, I think we have a big stake in this. I think the Ukrainians have resisted heroically and but they've done so not just with our health. They're -- I mean, Europe is in this, in a big way. We actually have 11 countries that have contributed larger percentage of their budget and of their GDP to this effort, and then the united (INAUDIBLE).

This is we're acting in concert with our friends, with common values and common interests.

Reminder, looking directly at a solar eclipse without proper protection can lead to severe eye damage, even blindness. Regular sunglasses, they do not cut it. The American Astronomical Society has a list of approved eclipse glasses and you can find that on CNN.com. Even if you do get the right eclipse glasses, you might not be able to see it. Sadly, we're getting an early sense of the forecast for April 8. Weather models indicate clouds potentially raining on excited spectators. So keep hoping for sunny skies, eclipse only by that passing minute. And high praise moments ago for Beyonce on her new album \"Cowboy Carter\". Vice President Kamala Harris posted on X, quote: Thank you for reminding us to never feel confined to other peoples perspective of what our lane is. You have redefined a genre, and reclaimed country music's Black roots. Your music continues to inspire us all. The album features guests including Post Malone, Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, even her six-year-old daughter, Rumi And there's a story behind the vinyl cover addition with Beyonce's name intentionally, as you could see there, misspelled. Her mom once talked about it in a podcast. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) TINA KNOWLES, BEYONCE'S MOTHER:  We asked my mother when I was grown, I was like, why is my brothers name spelled BEYINCE? You know, it's all these different spellings. And my mom's replied to me, it was like, that's what they put on your birth certificate. So I said, well, why didn't you argue when make them correct it?
