I'll speak with an employee who says the shooter aimed a gun at her head before telling her to leave.Plus, the Department of Justice asking former Vice President Mike Pence to testify in its January 6th investigations. Sources tell CNN he might. And Russia unleashing a wave, a new wave of deadly missile strikes on Ukraine, including targeting a hospital maternity ward, killing a 2- day-old baby. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, another tragic mass shooting, this time at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. Six people are dead. Four others remain hospitalized, at least two of them are in critical condition tonight. And we are just learning the names of those who were killed. Lorenzo Gamble, 43 years old. Brian Pendleton is being remembered as sweet, kind, the kind of person who in the words of one former co-worker, would give you the shirt off his back. He was 38. Kellie Pyle was 52. Randall Blevins, 70 years old. Tyneka Johnson, just 22. And also a 16-year-old male, his name and photo being withheld for now because of his age. And we also do have information about one of the injured, 24-year-old Jalon Jones was shot several times. He is in the ICU tonight in stable condition. This is the second mass shooting in Virginia in the past ten days. In the last week alone, there have been eight mass shootings in this country. And that includes another one today in Pennsylvania. Four teenagers wounded just a block away from a local high school. So far this year, more than 600 mass shootings, hundreds have died, thousands more injured. The Virginia gunman who is seen here in a video recording in 2016 by another employee was an overnight manager at the Walmart. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had been an employee at the store for nearly ten years. And during that time, several co-workers tell CNN, he exhibited odd, even threatening behavior. You'll hear shortly from a woman who survived the shooting and the chilling moments she lived through. All of this comes as a suspect in another mass shooting appeared in court for the first time today via video accused of shooting and killing five people and wounding 19 more at Club Q, an LGBTQ club in Colorado.

And we know that at least from the vice president's point of view, he is open to having some discussion to come to an agreement for some testimony to the investigation.Now, there's a lot of things that have to happen between now and when he might sit down with the FBI and the prosecutors. And that includes the possibility, of course, that the former President, Donald Trump, will try to intervene and try to block some of that testimony, which he has done repeatedly, including with Pence's aides, Marc Short and Greg Jacob, who have provided testimony initially providing limited testimony, and then being forced by the Justice Department after a judge's order to provide additional testimony after the former president tried to intervene. So, there's a lot of things that could complicate this. It's a lot different, though, from Pence's position with the January 6th committee. If you remember, they were asking him to come in, and he closed the door to that I think in one of these interviews he's given in connection to his book. Here's the thing. The fact that Pence has already talked about his interactions with the former president in his memoir that just got published really does mean that, I think, the Justice Department has a good argument to make that, you know, there are things now that you are certainly willing to talk about in your book.

It was a crucial step in destroying Russia's capacity to hold onto the city. With the Russians now massed on the eastern side of the Dnipro River, they're close and still control 60 percent of the province, which they claim is now part of Russia. No doubt there are many Ukrainians among them who were also prepared to prove them wrong and to kill.Do you feel sorry for the guys you killed at all?",

As winter deepens, this is becoming a greater and greater problem, and fueling more and more calls from the Ukrainian government for surface to air missiles from the international community so it can defend itself -- Erica.",

Friends who were summoned to the house the morning before that first 911 call which happened just before noon. On that 911 call, we understand that the call was about an unconscious person.The coroner said there had been blood everywhere. I remember those early interviews with the coroner who said this was gruesome, that she didn't really see anything.

But I don't have any reason to disbelieve what the police have said or the investigators have said. I think it's very plausible that they were in the house and they didn't hear anything down in the basement or what they're calling the first floor with the doors closed, or in a house where a lot of people are coming and going all the time on a Friday night. Boyfriends, people coming in to party, people leaving. Sort of that all-night party atmosphere, if you will. And the other thing I would point out is this Internet presence that these four had.

Workers desperate, angry after nearly a month of what they've called unsanitary living conditions and subpar pay.And all of this coming as China's COVID restrictions are leading to despair not just at that plant but frankly across the country.

The local government killed my dad, he tells me, breaking down in tears. I just want to get justice for my dad. Why did you lock us down? Why did you take my dad's life away? His 58-year-old father needed emergency medical help when their building was locked down. He says there were no COVID cases in the building but China seals off entire neighborhoods, even when there are only suspected cases nearby.

I mean, we all became more attached than ever to our devices, even seeking validation by way of likes on social media. I mean, I would argue that we spend much more time on our devices interacting with sometimes thousands of people we might not even know if there are people then we do with human beings. I mean, kids these days would rather forgo play dates or going out and engaging in sports because they would rather stay home on these devices.
