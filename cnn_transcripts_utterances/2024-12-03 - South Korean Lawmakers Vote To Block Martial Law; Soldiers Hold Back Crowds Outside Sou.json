SouthKoreans are waking up to a very different country today, one that is now under martial law. A very good evening everyone. Hours ago, lawmakers voted to block President Yoon Suk Yeol's decree, calling it invalid. And here you can see some of the dramatic images from overnight in Seoul, where protesters -- you could hear them erupted just outside the National Assembly. Later, dozens of troops that had entered the main parliamentary building began to withdraw after the vote. And under South Korean law, the President is obliged to comply. But at this hour, it remains unclear what effect the vote will have on the declaration. We haven't heard from the President now coming into the fifth hour, and just taking a few steps back, it began with a late night TV address to the nation as you can see there on Tuesday night. President Yoon accused the main South Korean opposition party of sympathizing with the north, and he said his declaration was necessary, he said to protect the country from what he called the, quote, \"danger of North Korean communist forces\". Our Mike Valerio is in Seoul with some of the crowds gathered just outside South Korea's National Assembly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They voted to overturn martial law, defying, of course, the President's ruling.

It was the middle of the night that this was -- this vote was called, so, it was a unanimous decision. There were members of President Yoon's own party, the leader of his own party were against what he had done. So, he will certainly be feeling pressure now, whether this was a high-stakes gamble that has not paid off, we simply don't know at this point. We don't know his exact rationale for doing this. But the parliament has voted that this should not go ahead. The President, under South Korean law, we understand, should comply with this. But there are some complications within this law as to whether or not that could be the case. So, we are waiting to hear from President Yoon. He is obviously a President embattled at this point. He is not a popular President, his approval ratings are in the 20 percent at this point and have been there for some time. And he has criticized the opposition for paralyzing the government. We know it is a hugely polarized country at this point.

The way that I would characterize this is almost equated to the security assistance that the U.S. provides in other places, although in this case, it's obviously, you know, some significant challenges. But what General Jeffers and his team will do is work as part of the country team and with State Department and coordinating with IDF and with the Lebanese Armed Forces, France and others, to look at what are the needs in terms of training capacity for the LAF, and then also strategy development in terms of how the LAF can provide security along the southern Lebanon border to essentially fill the void that's been left by Hezbollah being routed out. And so, ensuring that there is a force in place that can provide security for the people of Lebanon, but also ensure that the kinds of terrorist attacks that we've seen in the past from Hezbollah can occur. So, working out of the embassy and coordinating on what those needs are, and then working with other countries and the inter-agency to help fulfill those needs, if that makes sense. Again, much more to follow in the days ahead, but that's the basic concept. Thanks. Charlie.",

And so, this has really taken a lot of people by surprise here, and you know, I think that the biggest question now is, you heard Pentagon Press Secretary Ryder address in the briefing is how this is going to impact the almost 29,000 U.S. service members in South Korea as well as an additional, you know, 10,000 or so number of contractors, family members of these service members who were there. You know, is this military, you know, and martial law situation going to impact the way that they operate there? Is the U.S. even going to be able to continue its joint military exercises with the Koreans knowing that the President is now apparently seeking to weaponize the military for these -- for martial law. And so, there are just so many questions swirling here that really throw such a wrench in the U.S.-South Korean relationship. And Secretary of Defense Austin actually hosted Yoon here at the Pentagon recently. And he said something that was very notable that really underscores just how much this situation has turned everything on its head. He said that the ROK and the U.S. have a shared vision that is rooted in freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Now, we should note that a senior State Department official was speaking today in Washington on a different subject about Japan, but still, you know, obviously on regional issues, and continue to say that the U.S. stands in solidarity, of course, with the Korean people, still is very supportive of South Korea and that the administration hopes that this political crisis is going to be resolved peacefully.

Ramon, really appreciate you being with us, I'm just seeing news coming in to us that President Yoon's party, own political party have now urged him to drop martial law orders. So, closely, watching what is unfolding at this hour, it's just 17 minutes past 4:00 or so in the morning. How do you see this, Ramon then playing out? It's incredibly tense as well as fluid situation, but we have yet to hear from the President. RAMON PACHECO PARDO, PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON: It is tense. I agree, but as you just pointed out, there is no real support, even Yoon, President Yoon's party thinks that the situation should be resolved  peacefully. The martial law should be lifted and the National Assembly has voted in this direction. And I will assume that over the next few hours, the pressure coming from within South Korea, but also from the U.S. for President Yoon to leave the martial law should have an effect. It should also be said that even the military is not supporting martial law. We have seen the press operating freely in South Korea, we have seen a vote in the National Assembly, so, not even the military is enforcing the martial law.",

I don't think it has any basis today, and I think even within the military, you don't see support for these ideas. You may have seen in the 1960s, 1970s, and never mind in conservative circles. I mean, this is a view that really if you talk to younger and not so young, really South Koreans, they think it belongs to the past. In my opinion, President Yoon is frustrated because the National Assembly is controlled by the opposition party. But even as we have seen within his own party, he has limited support. We see leaders in his own party who really are preparing for the next presidential election in two years time, two years and a half, which President Yoon cannot run. So, they're really beefing up their own credentials as the true leaders of the conservative party.

U.S. President Joe Biden is in Angolaon what could be his last international trip. Mr. Biden told reporters just hours ago in Luanda that he was, quote, just getting briefed. A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN, the Biden administration is in contact with South Korea's government and is monitoring the situation closely, adding that it was not notified in advance. Let's get more on the Biden administration's reaction with senior White House correspondent M.J. Lee in Washington, Arlette Saenz who's traveling with the President in Angola. Arlette, let me go to you first. So, seriously concerned is what we've heard, the words we've heard from Biden administration official. What else are you hearing from the President? Because initially in the last hour or so, or even probably longer, apologies if I've misplaced time. He said he was just getting briefed. Do we know any more?",

President Biden has previously praised Yoon -- President Yoon as a great friend. Speak to their relationship and perhaps to the kind of pressure that may be applied here on South Korea, because we are watching -- we're still waiting to hear from President Yoon in the fifth hour or so to see whether he will yield, of course, to the vote that we've seen on martial law by lawmakers. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's a great question. How the Biden White House is going to respond, as Arlette was just laying out there, we've barely heard anything from President Joe Biden on this situation, only confirming that he had been briefed. The NSC, we know, as Arlette was saying, never got a heads up from Yoon and his government that he was going to be making this shocking move. I do think it's really important, as you were just saying, to put into context the U.S.-ROK relationship and particularly the Biden-Yoon relationship. You know, a big part of President Biden's foreign policy work and I guess, ultimately, his legacy is going to be how much effort he has put into and how much emphasis he has put into improving and strengthening U.S.-Korean relations. The bigger context here, of course, is trying to counter China's influence in the region. It's actually a part of the reason why the U.S., under President Biden, has seen it as such an important task to improve South Korean and Japanese relations, obviously a long antagonistic history there between those two countries. But the Biden administration has basically been of the belief, I'm simplifying a little bit here, that the stronger the ties are between South Korea and Japan and the U.S. as well, the better chance they have of countering China's growth and influence in the Indo-Pacific region and in the world overall, and that has meant that President Biden himself has had to have some warm relations and really some warm overtures to Yoon Suk Yeol, a very unpopular president in South Korea. When he went to visit Asia for the first time as president back in 2022, South Korea was one of the places he visited, obviously arriving in Seoul too much fanfare. And then, he was --",

I take it is moments of celebration for the protesters who've been out there for several hours. It's 4:30 in the morning or so in Seoul. And the timing of this is interesting. M.J., given what you were saying, we were talking about the kind of pressure, perhaps that President Biden would have been applying to South Korea, a strong ally of the United States. Significant number of U.S. troops on the ground there. Speak to this moment, because just hours ago, you know, we'd heard from Cedric Leighton, the CNN military analyst, who was talking about how this, if it continue, it became a constitutional crisis, it would have became -- would have become a dangerous moment because of instability in the region and what that would do for the Indo-Pacific region and the U.S.'s standpoint in the in terms of projecting power.",

It's taken a fewhours since that vote took place, a unanimous vote against the call for a martial law decree. Even those on President Yoon's own side, those within his own political party had voted against it. We'd heard the leader of his own party saying that it shouldn't go ahead and he would try and block it as well. So, presumably, President Yoon was looking at the overwhelming response to his declaration. There wasn't one single person that I saw that had spoken up publicly in favor of it. So, presumably, he has seen that this is the way it had to go. Now, we did understand that under South Korean law, once the parliament had voted to block that martial law decree, the president was supposed to accept that and to lift the martial law. Of course, if he hadn't done that, there would be a very different and dangerous situation we would be in. But according to Reuters, it does appear as though he has dropped that order for martial law. Now, what, of course, can now happen is any soldiers, if there are any soldiers left on the street, we certainly saw a pullback from the National Assembly, a number of hours ago, when it came to military presence, but any that are remaining will now be able to go home or to go back to their barracks. So, there will be a collective sigh of relief that this is the way that this has materialized, but this hasn't ended. There is going to be -- there are going to be a number of questions asked of the president as to why this had to happen, why he decided that there should be this martial law decree? Was there more to it than simply this political stalemate, if you like? There really have been some very dramatic scenes over recent hours. And, as I say, this certainly isn't the end of it. There could be a huge amount of political pressure now on the president. Isa.",

Not only was he facing, over the last few weeks, opposition from the opposition party, which has the majority in the National Assembly, but within his own party. There were suggestions that senior conservative figures were leaking damaging information relating to this corruption, these corruption allegations. And of course, it wasn't just the first lady, there were others in the president's orbit who had been implicated. The president himself, it was being argued had overreached, had acted in ways that were seen as unpresidential and potentially illegal. And his steadily plummeting approval ratings on the back of problems to do with domestic politics, the status of medical doctors, all of this had counted against him. But it had been assumed that there were ways in which he could compensate for that by being very active on the global stage with diplomacy. And of course, we saw him recently at the APEC and G20 Summits in Latin America speaking very forcefully about the rule of law and upholding international principles. So, it's ironic that he now seems to have violated some of those very principles that are at the heart of democratic politics in his own country.",

Earlier, I was told by my producer that they were chanting, this protest in the streets was chanting, lock him up. Those are the chants we're hearing. In the last few minutes, if you're just joining us, the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has said he will lift his martial law order, if you remember from last five hours or so. That follows parliamentary vote which blocked it basically. We've seen lawmakers voting against it, but we have seen a country and world pretty much taken by surprise, shocked, and outraged as we saw for several hours. The political uncertainty and instability that could lead to, of course, martial law. But lawmakers who were able to get into parliament there, that just -- that image in front of you, voted to block President Yoon's decree. They called it invalid. And we've seen some dramatic images in the very early hours of this morning as crowds erupted, protests erupted, and the National Assembly, we've seen troops entering the main parliamentary building. We see the lights on there. And under South Korean law the president was obliged to comply. So, the president in the last few minutes has complied. He said he will lift his martial law. What we don't know at this stage is whether the president will address the country and what will this mean for the president. Because as we heard the protesters there in Seoul, they were calling -- they were chanting, lock him up. Let's get more from our Paula Hancocks. There's a lot we don't know why he called this decree in the first place. Paula, we had some chants there of lock him up. I'm wondering, at this stage, whether we're expecting to hear from President Yoon, whether we know whether he would rest the country. And what will this mean for him? I mean, we're looking at impeachment here as we hear these chants?",

So, just to give you a sense of the tableau, right behind me, you can see it clearly, if you read Korean, impeach and remove Yoon Suk Yeol, is what's said on the bottom banner. And all of these people here are not going anywhere until they hear from the president about what is going to happen next and frankly, what he was thinking. There is just such a palpable mood of people being stunned across South Korea of why he did this and what was his possible exit strategy? Why he thought that, you know, this could possibly succeed? So, we're seeing people, we're expecting demonstrations to grow and grow through the -- as the sun comes up through the morning hours. I should note, though, how we got here, you know, Paula may have said this, forgive me, Paula, forever, if you talked about this, just tuning in through our earpiece. We have a very weak president, Yoon Suk Yeol. Conservative politician, long time prosecutor. And you know, approval ratings have been hovering in the low 20 percent range. And weekend after weekend, there have been calls and demonstrations emanating throughout Seoul for him to step down. Scandal after scandal roiling his administration. So, the thinking among people who we're talking to who inhabit this quarter of the city, Oedo, where the national assembly is found, is did he do this to potentially quash dissent? Did he do this because he was and is so weak, now weaker beyond imagination, to try to go into a new position of strength? Completely unclear. But I think that, you know, in addition, as we look back at the crowd again to those feelings of being so stunned and dismayed, there is absolutely a sense of anger, a sense that we have been here before in the '80s and earlier ever since the Korean War, you know, military rule back and forth, that they are not going back, that the people of this nation do not ever want to go back to a time where military rule was the law of the land or where martial law was the law of the land. So, we will be waiting to see how the president responds. If he goes on TV. How many days he has left in his term, because his days certainly seem to be numbered.",
