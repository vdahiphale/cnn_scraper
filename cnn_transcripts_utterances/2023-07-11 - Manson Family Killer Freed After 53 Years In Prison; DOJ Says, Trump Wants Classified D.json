I am Laura Coates.And, look, there are some of the most gruesome, some of the most infamous murders in the entire history of our country. And tonight, a convicted killer from the Manson family is walking free. Leslie Van Houten released on parole after 53 years behind bars. Now, she was, of course, a part of the group that terrorized Los Angeles over two nights in 1969, killing seven people in some of the most gruesome of ways, including Actress Sharon Tate, who at the time was pregnant. Van Houten was convicted of killing a couple in their own home, stabbing the wife 16 times at the crime scene. Now, she wiped her fingerprints at that crime scene. She changed her clothes. She even drank chocolate milk from her victim's refrigerator. And she says that she did it as a follower of Manson's. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

First, there is a reversal by the Justice Department. The federal lawyers now say that the former president is no longer entitled to the immunity in the defamation case against him, the one involving E. Jean Carroll. Now, this basically means that Trump now has to defend himself without the DOJ stepping in on his behalf.And it essentially paves the way now for a second, yes, a second defamation trial against Trump involving that same plaintiff. And on top of this, you've got a grand jury in Georgia that was chosen today to decide whether to indict -- remember, it's a probable cause, not beyond under reasonable doubt, but whether to indict Trump and others for trying to overturn the election. But wait, there's more, as they say, because in the classified documents indictment already against him in Florida, his legal team is now arguing that his trial ought to be moved not a month or two months or even six months, but after the election, the one that's a year-and- a-half away. And among the arguments that he's, one, too busy running for president, and also that a jury, they believe, will be too biased against him. But you know what's clear, this seems to be part of a political strategy, and it seems to now go hand in hand with his legal strategy. Joining me now is somebody who knows his strategies quite well. It's a lawyer who just left the Trump defense team in this very case, Tim Parlatore. Thank you for joining me this evening. Nice to see you. Listen, I'm so fascinated by all that's happening right now. You have been intimately involved in the classified documents up until, of course, leaving that defense team. The fact that he would like this to be moved until after the election, we're talking about more than 400 days away, does that surprise you at all that he wants to delay it in that way, knowing that there's the election?",

It ain't an about-face. It's a half turn. The fact is this is a man who, as the coach of Ole Miss and Auburn, made $25 million on the backs of black players. And yet he has showed them little more than contempt and derision since he has ascended to the Senate of the United States. This man is smart enough to know what he's doing. He's sending dog whistles out. He's signifying that, hey, I'm with you, even when he is forced to turn around, the compatriots of his who are white nationalists understand that he's doing so as a matter of forced compulsion, political correctness, to cooperate with the stream of the times in order not to be seen not out of that stream. So, the bottom line is that Tommy Tuberville doesn't convincingly tell us that he is not a white nationalist or that he's not involved with or sympathetic to them. He simply was forced to say, yes. At the end of the day, those who claim to be racist are not in my league, but I think that the white nationalists are not racists. Then he says, okay, they are racist.

And basically, in addition to being an airport that they occasionally would use for civilian flights, they also use them for missile launches. And Kim Jong-un can get there very easily from his palace. And he can observe the early morning launch and watch this big rocket go up, and they take all the video, and then they release it as a big news bulletin maybe 24 hours later, sometimes sooner.This missile followed a pretty typical trajectory for these ICBMs from North Korea. You know, they've been talking about firing an ICBM at a regular trajectory, which would actually have it kind of crossing over possible continents. I mean, large numbers of potential countries could have a North Korean missile flying overhead if they were to launch one of these ICBMs at a normal trajectory. But they did a lofted trajectory, which basically sends it very far up in the space and back down, only traveling total ground distance, about a thousand kilometers. That is less provocative, for sure. It follows the pattern that North Korea has used for previous missile launches and it comes at a time, Laura, that there has been a real uptick in tension on the Korean Peninsula. I mean, it was just this week that the sister of Kim Jong- un, the North Korean leader, put out a statement warning that they would shoot down American military reconnaissance planes that had been operating in the area. North Korea accused those planes of crossing into their, not their airspace, but sort of like an economic zone that they control, you know, near the North Korean coast. The U.S. denies this. There's no evidence offered on the North Korean side. But they are basically, you know, sending out warnings and this ICBM launch is certainly intended to be that for the United States, because that missile well within range of pretty much every major city there, Laura.",
