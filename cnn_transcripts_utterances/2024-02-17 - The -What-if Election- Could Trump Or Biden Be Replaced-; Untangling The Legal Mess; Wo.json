      "sentences": "So what would happen then? I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.We know the front runners, but is there November showdown a certainty? Among the looming questions is what if? What if Donald Trump is convicted? Well, this week ended with the judge in Trump's civil fraud case dumping him for nearly $355 million and preventing him from doing business in New York for three years. And we're waiting on more potential explosive legal outcomes, the Supreme Court immunity decision, the Georgia interference case, the January 6 federal prosecution, the declassified documents found at Mar-a-Lago, and now the stormy Daniels business records case scheduled for trial next month. For most candidates in most election years, that would surely be a big bump in the road. But what's the alternative? He's light years ahead of the sole remaining GOP contender. And this comes one week after Biden took a hit regarding his age and memory from the special counsel's report on his own classified documents case, which explains why despite how far we are into the primary process, both party front runners still feel a bit vulnerable. As \"The Washington Post\" recently put it, \"What if November's likely Biden Trump rematch suddenly isn't?\" Meaning it's possible that we might see the nominating contests suddenly up ended, and one or both of them is replaced. Look at these recent headlines, \"Can Democrats replaced Joe Biden?\" \"After Hur's Biden age comments, could any Democrats really take his place?\" \"Could Democrats replace Biden as their nominee?\" \"Democrats might need a plan B.\" \"Donald Trump has a big problem ahead.\" A whole swath of GOP voters appears firmly committed to not voting for Trump in November. \"What if Trump is elected with criminal charges still looming?\" \"What happens if a presidential candidate is convicted?\" On a recent episode of his podcast, Ezra Klein of \"The New York Times\" lobbied for Biden to drop out and for leading Democrats like President Obama to convince him to do so. The question also was weighing heavily on the minds of voters on both sides. According to a brand new Monmouth poll, 48 percent of registered voters believe Biden is either very likely or somewhat likely to be replaced as the Democratic Party's nominee. And for Trump, 32 percent say it's very or somewhat likely that his legal troubles will result in him not being the Republican nominee. You know who else is thinking along those lines? Nikki Haley, here's what she told CNN, Kaitlan Collins just last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Seventy percent of Americans don't want to see Trump or Biden. Fifty-nine percent of Americans think Joe Biden's too old and think Donald Trump's too old. And a party that gets rid of their 80-year-old candidate is the party that will win. There will be a female president of the United States. It will either be me or it will be Kamala Harris. If Republicans nominate Donald Trump, it will be Kamala Harris. But if we can go and do what we're trying to do, we're going to make sure that it's me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So during the primaries, what you're doing is you're allocating delegates to candidates, but you're not choosing the actual people who will be delegates. And that process usually takes place after the primaries. And so, what would happen is, depending on when the candidate dropped out is their names probably wouldn't be on the primary ballot, they wouldn't be running on a ballot, they'd be all Joe Biden delegates or all Donald Trump delegates.But anybody wishing to jump in the race, if one of those candidates got out, we'd have to go actually try to get people elected as delegates who were sympathetic to them.

And in the decision, the judge goes out of his way to stress this, it doesn't technically matter if you have typical victims, people who get ripped off, but Donald Trump is correct when he says there's no victims in the traditional sense here.Usually when you handle the fraud case, there's stockholders, investors, members of the general public who have been ripped off. And it is a fact in this case that the, quote unquote, \"victims,\" to the extent there were any, were the banks, they are sophisticated billion dollar operations. They made these loans, they got repaid, they got repaid with interest, but the judge does a very technocratic job of sort of weaving around that. He says, legally, it doesn't matter. So I think there's fair questions about whether this penalty is fair or not. I do think it's worth noting, the judge actually could have sentenced the Trump Organization to corporate death, but chose not to. Instead, he's sort of giving them corporate rehab. He's basically saying, Donald Trump and your sons, you're suspended for a couple years, we're going to install a monitor, a former federal judge Barbara Jones, who's very good at this, who's going to try to bring the company back and she's going to keep an eye on it.

They're -- they're, you know, more minority oriented. On the Republican side, significantly more conservative evangelical, older voters. These are the most committed voters, the most conservative voters in the electorate.And so, when you -- when you win a Republican primary, generally most candidates kind of, you know, tend to, you know, gravitate towards the middle for the general election. But these are -- these are committed and committed to their -- to their party, to a candidate.

This would include in this upcoming election Hispanic voters, independent women, suburban women, independents overall.Voters who -- for whom politics is -- is not something that they talked about over the dinner table every night. And so, these voters don't pay as much attention. They are late deciders in campaign and they are driven by -- you know, by pocketbook issues. The challenge with many of these voters is they are late deciders. They don't decide until the last few weeks of an election. And so, that -- and there are very few of them, especially an election like this. Michael, you've got potentially two candidates who have -- you know, who have a majority of voters who are unfavorable towards them. I mean, Biden's numbers are 36 favorable and 54 unfavorable. And Trump's are not much different at 38 to 52. So, think about it. A majority of voters in the country have a negative impression of each of the two likely presidential candidates. Fewer than 40 percent have a favorable opinion of them. And the election -- he took -- swing voters in this election. The swing voters in this election are going to be around the 20 percent or so of the electorate who don't like either one of these candidates. You could call them double-haters. They -- in a sense it's almost like a nose-holder election. Voters is going to hold their noses and vote for somebody they don't like at the end.

In this case, I don't think Trump voters were surprised at all that in a New York City court of law, a judge decided to fine the president. I mean, if asked, they would inevitably say, the case was stacked against him. And of course, they'd find him guilty.There -- it's a matter of expectations. These Republican voters believe that Democrats are pressing these cases against President Trump because they believe that Trump would beat Biden. They don't -- they don't buy any of the arguments whether he's convicted or not convicted. It's not going to make much difference in their vote. Now that's not -- not the case necessarily with independents and swing voters. But for Republican primary voters, it didn't make a damn bit of difference.",
