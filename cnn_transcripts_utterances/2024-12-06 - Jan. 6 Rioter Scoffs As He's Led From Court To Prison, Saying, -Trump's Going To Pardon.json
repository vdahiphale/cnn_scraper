He shouted as he was being handcuffed, quote, \"Trump's going to pardon me anyways.\"CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us now with more. What more did the defendant say, and how did the judge respond? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Kayla, this was an extraordinary scene in the D.C. district court where hundreds of these rioter cases have been handled. This was a man, Phil Grillo, from New York City. He was being sentenced for nonviolent, but felonies today in federal court. And the judge, Judge Royce Lamberth, the judge who sat on that bench the longest and is nearing the end of an extraordinary judicial career, puts him in prison immediately. That rarely happens in a situation like this. And then, as the judge exits the courtroom, the defendant, Phil Grillo, is standing there with the U.S. marshal taking off his tie, taking off his belt, being put in handcuffs, and he yells out, \"Trump's going to pardon me anyways.\" And his two friends who are sitting there in the front row of the courtroom telling people that they're members or leaders in the Republican Party in New York. They're shouting at him, \"Don't worry, Phil, Donald is going to take care of you.\" So just this encapsulation of the political and judicial moment we are in right now with these January 6th rioters being convicted, being sentenced, being brought to justice. But knowing that the moment that Donald Trump takes office, they will be freed. And in this circumstance, this man, he's going to be in prison at least until that pardon comes on January 20th.",

But judge Lamberth says that he needs to do his job as well. And he noted he was bound by his oath of office. And the president will do his job. It's as simple as that.",

The unemployment rate ticking up just slightly. CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is here to help us break down the numbers. Vanessa, what stands out to you in the report? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is a rebound and a surge. This is 227,000 jobs added in November. A very strong number. And this is the 47th consecutive month of job growth. That's the third longest stretch on record. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.2 percent from 4.1 percent. And that is because you have more folks looking for a job. And folks are also looking for jobs longer, on average, about five months being unemployed before they can find a new job. But I want to draw your attention to the month of October, which you mentioned. A really dismal report, only 12,000 jobs added. Because of two major hurricanes and the strike at Boeing. We got revisions this month for October, but the total that month, with the revisions still only 36,000 jobs added in the month of October. That is pretty dismal. And the Biden administration is really calling that more of a blip. Not reflective of the overall jobs market. But where jobs were added in the month of November, you have health care, leisure and hospitality, government. Those are where the major jobs were added. Also retail, though, this year -- or this month, excuse me, in November, retail lost 28,000 jobs, which is unusual during the holiday season. But we haven't seen so much of robust hiring this time around, so maybe that tracks a little bit. Wages also are up 4 percent year over year. That's outpacing inflation, which is at about 2.6 percent. And, Kayla, as you know, the Federal Reserve looks at these jobs reports to try to figure out the strength of the labor force. But they also look at other things like how Americans, everyday Americans are doing. And they're looking at borrowing costs and they're seeing that borrowing costs are still very high for average Americans. So that is one reason we could see a rate cut later this month by the Fed. And just to point out that the odds that the Fed would cut rates was 71 percent before the jobs report. When this jobs report dropped earlier this morning, those odds went all the way up to 91 percent. So folks are thinking, we're going to see that cut in just a couple of weeks -- Kayla?",

What model will it be based off of? Because, keep in mind, that even A.I. models themselves can actually have some biases built in. We don't have a lot of details on -- on any of this. But this is all part of these mounting changes that the \"L.A. Times\" owner has been instituting. It started with some of that backlash to his decision to block the planned endorsement by his own editorial board of Vice President Kamala Harris. That morphed into him wanting to revamp the opinion pages, bring on more conservative voices like Scott Jennings. We are also hearing that, now, a new rule instituted at the \"L.A. Times\" that, prior to publishing opinion pieces, those headlines must be personally approved by the \"L.A. Times\" owner. I don't know of another newspaper where this happens, although it is well within his right, as the owner of a newspaper, to run it as he sees fit. But we are getting some backlash from the reporters there. The \"L.A. Times\" union saying that this A.I. leader publicly suggests that his staff harbors bias without offering evidence or examples. We also have seen several resignations from the paper as well -- Brianna?",
