(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; ARMY VETERAN: I'm straight-up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. It hasn't made us more lethal. It has made fighting more complicated. We've all served with women and they're great. It's just our institutions don't have to incentivize that in places where, traditionally -- not traditionally, over human history, men in those positions are more capable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Many people I've spoken with currently or formerly in the Pentagon had perfectly fine relationships with him.But it goes to both experience, lack of experience, in their view, but also his positions on key issues. One retired four-star general told me, \"There's no serious experience in the business of running the Pentagon or the national security processes. But the more critical one is this. \"Common denominator is clearly loyalty. And while some loyalty is essential, slavish fealty is dangerous.\" And this four-star general here was talking not just about the Hegseth appointment but other appointments we've seen in the national security sphere so far, as we've heard from the president. Some of the reactions were more colorful. I heard \"ridiculous\" from one current serving, quite high-ranking officer. \"An F-ing nightmare\" from another who served. Both Trump and Biden, I'd should say and, of course, I'm using a euphemism there. So it speaks to experience but also world view. Because their concern is that Hegseth is -- and he's been quite a vocal supporter, proponent of America First, the American First agenda if Trump -- that he will push the president or be part of the president's effort to, for instance, end aid to Ukraine, not defend Taiwan potentially from a Chinese invasion. They see him as carrying out this agenda going forward.",

And I look forward to serving with him and with all of our leadership team. I want to thank the others that ran. We had a really strong, healthy discussion. And we've all come out united and friends. And one of the people that was in our discussion is one of the people that is going to -- although he didn't say anything, his presence was very much felt. That is the vice president-elect, J.D. Vance. I think the fact that he not only was he a voting member of our conference but also in there with us every step of the way to make sure that the direction that we're going to go as a united conference and with me leading the policy issues and all of us working together, that we'll have a united voice. And I'll say one thing about the election. And I've said this on all my local stations. What I think the biggest issue was -- and there are big ones, border and national security and others. It is literally the American family, the mom and the dad, the grandmother, whoever it is, going to the grocery store. We do it all the time every week. And we could see, all of us could see, the escalating costs of something so very basic to us, just the cost of food and hearing from the vice president in her campaign, the economy is doing great, don't worry. And so we hear those voices. We hear them loud and clear. Those are the voices well respond to along with President Trump through the next several years. THUNE: Thank you, Shelley.

We're looking forward to his great leadership there. SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK) &amp; INCOMING SENATE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE VICE CHAIR: Republicans were asked a very simple thing. Can you get us back on track? Over 70 percent of the country right now believes the country is on the wrong track. Our task is going to be very, very simple, to defend our values, to be able to strengthen us as a nation, and to be able to bring prosperity to people who are really struggling right now. That's a primary issue for us. And all of those are things we are going to get onto immediately. Because the American people have spoken and said we do not like the direction that the country is going. So let's get us back on a better direction. So this leadership team, President Trump, J.D. Vance, we're headed in a direction to be able to get the country back on the track that she is looking for.",

Now in terms of who is bidding for this, it is all technically secretive because all the bidders are supposed to sign nondisclosure agreements and put down 10 percent of their initial bid. But according to sources I've been talking to, it is a mix of allies of Alex Jones who want to keep InfoWars going as it is, and people who might have other ideas with what to do with InfoWars. One of those allies has put in a seven-figure bid. You see the picture of Roger Stone. I don't know if he's the one that put in that seven- figure bid or has backers behind him. But he is one of the parties that I've been told has expressed bidding. But you all see there some names of other organizations that would likely not want to keep InfoWars going as it is. \"The Onion,\" a satirical news site, I've heard from sources, had expressed interest as well, as well as Media Matters, which is that left-leaning media watch dog group. Now we are waiting to hear the outcome of this. It could come in the next few hours or potentially tomorrow. Keep in mind, the court-appointed trustee, he does have some discretion as to who will win this auction. It doesn't necessarily have to go to the highest bidder.
