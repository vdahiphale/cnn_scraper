Most of the rest of the world calls it an unprovoked invasion. Either way, it has so far claimed the lives of an estimated 300,000 troops, likely similar numbers on either side. Kyiv reports that at least 20,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed.Live images coming to you there from Kyiv as this day has dawned there. Russian forces had hoped to quickly capture the capital. Today, there are barricades and there are sandbags, a lot of destruction, but not one single Russian soldier. One of the fiercest battles right now is for the eastern city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces have been holding ground as Russian troops try to break through. The western Ukrainian city of Lviv is playing tribute to fallen soldiers at a military cemetery. Residents have gathered for a joint prayer and a raise of memory light at display. Meanwhile, the U.N. General Assembly is demanding Moscow immediately withdraw its troops from Ukraine. One hundred and forty-one of member states backed that resolution. Seven countries, including Russia, Belarus, Syria and North Korea voted against it. U.S. President Joe Biden meanwhile set to meet virtually in the day ahead with the members of the G7 and the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

It is also calling for the resumption of peace talks with China -- quote -- \"continuing to play a constructive role.\"But no concrete details are provided here. There is already reaction coming in from the head of the E.U. delegation in China, saying this is just a position paper. Just that. It is not a plan for peace. But we also heard from Ukraine's charge affair in China who says that the paper is a good sign while urging China to do everything to end the war. Earlier, we heard from a senior official at the U.S. State Department who said any peace plan must be durable and it must be just. Listen to this.

If Xi Jinping can get Putin and his army out of Ukraine, I think we would all applaud and give a peace prize. (END VIDEO CLIP) LU STOUT:  Now, this also comes as the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon warned China of consequences if China provides lethal support to Russia. This is an allegation that China has continued to push back on, including in the most recent briefing. These are the comments from the spokesperson saying this. Quote -- \"We can easily imagine that the intelligence the U.S. referred to is most likely chasing shadows and smearing China. Since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, China has firmly stood on the side of dialogue and peace.\" -- unquote.

There's a real sense that it reinvigorated the NATO, that it strengthened the western alliance.What is notable about this western alliance is one of its definitions of how to end the war. That is quite simply for Russia, who is resoundingly and unitedly called the aggressor, to simply pull out of Ukraine, and this is the path to peace. It's quite striking, you know, the division between where this western alliance sees the situation, where China sees it. There was no mention in China's 12-point plan of Russia as the aggressor here, merely saying that both sides should resume talks, where the western alliance sees this very differently. I think, again, that is one of the stark things that has happened here, not only is the western alliance more united, but its position is perhaps more polarized obviously from Russia but also from China, and that's to the detriment of both the west and of China, not something that China, of course, recognizes as well. But go back to the very beginning of the war. This resolve that was just getting going to support Ukraine resulted in bullets and some shoulder launched anti-tank-type missiles being sent.

We've been visiting some of those humanitarian camps across this region, particularly here in Hatay province, in cities of Iskenderun, and in Antakya, which was among the hardest hit by the earthquake a little over two weeks ago. You know, we've seen thousands of families that have been put up in tents. But there are still many who don't have tents who are sleeping in the street and it gets very, very cold at night, many of them telling us that they've registered their names with a disaster and emergency agency. They're waiting. They've been told to wait for those tents, but still no news. And so far, according to the authorities, some 900,000 people are living in tents. So, not only have they gone through the trauma of the earthquake, not only have they lost absolutely everything, many of them have also lost loved ones, but now their future is hugely uncertain with no clarity on when they're going to be offered shelter. Now, some are being put up in other locations, including University dormitories. We visited a ship yesterday -- a cruise ship, which has been converted into a temporary accommodation for those displaced by the earthquake. But there is a significant challenge ahead for the government. President Erdogan says he's committed to rebuilding the impacted areas within a year. They say they're going to build some 200,000 supposedly earthquake-resistant buildings over the next year with construction of about 30,000 apartments set to begin in March. But when you look at the scale of the destruction, it is difficult to comprehend how that will be done within a year. It is a significant challenge for the government. And, of course, the humanitarian situation poses a significant challenge to the government. There are calls for further support from the international community. The United States pledging further funding. The United Nations appealing for $1 billion in aid. And for those who are now living in these tents, unsure when they will be able to return to a permanent home. This will be a difficult few weeks and months.",
