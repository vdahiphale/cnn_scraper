      "sentences": "Well, Boris and Brianna, there are going to be undecided and persuadable voters who are here on hand in Delaware County, just one of the critical suburban areas outside of Philadelphia, asking questions of Vice President Kamala Harris. Of course, these are representative of many voters who still have questions in this race.Even as you know, millions and millions vote across the country, more than 1 million Pennsylvania voters have already cast early ballots. There are still a sliver of undecided or movable voters. So those voters will be on hand here, at least a smattering of them asking questions of the Vice President. And the Harris campaign believes this is an opportunity for her to explain her policy positions but also give some voters who perhaps are not yet sold on her candidacy a bit more to hang onto. But we do know that she also will, as she spoke earlier this afternoon outside her residence in Washington, D.C., outside the Naval Observatory, really pushing back at the former President, questioning his fitness for office. Some of his comments he reportedly made about his generals, look for her to continue that conversation. She's really been using the former President's own words to bolster her argument. So on the campaign trail, that has been something she's been doing as she's been traveling to Blue Wall states. Pennsylvania, of course, is the mother of all battlegrounds, 19 electoral votes here. It is virtually politically impossible to imagine either of the candidates winning that magic number of 270 electoral votes without Pennsylvania. And the rest, of course, of the Blue Wall states of Michigan and Wisconsin, the Harris campaign believes is their best path to the White House. Of course, Donald Trump, as you said, is campaigning in Georgia today. But he, too, has been in Pennsylvania so many times. But here in the Delaware County, she's trying to -- it's a blue-ish county. She's trying to run up the score, if you will, because she knows the rest of the state is challenging for her to say the least.",

Here's Vice President Harris responding to these reports.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is.

      "sentences": "That's right, they are. We've heard from a number of top Trump campaign advisers, as well as others who had worked in Trump's former White House. That includes Mark Meadows and Kash Patel, really pushing back hard on what Kelly has said.I also did -- just in response to Harris's comments there that you played, I did just receive a statement from Trump campaign adviser Steven Cheung criticizing Harris over this. I'm going to read you some of that. He said, quote, \"Kamala Harris is a stone-cold loser who is increasingly desperate because she is flailing, and her campaign is in shambles. That is why she continues to peddle outright lies and falsehoods that are easily disproven.\" It goes on to claim that Harris's rhetoric was in part to blame and Democrat's rhetoric is in part to blame for some of the assassination attempts on the former President's life. And these are claims we have heard before. But all to say, they are pushing back very heavily on this and arguing in my conversations with them that they believe some of the former officials who have been criticizing Donald Trump, including John Kelly, it's because they are no longer in Trump's favor, and that they don't have the right intent in doing this. So, you know, that's what their argument is. But I do want to just talk about and put kind of the context of Kelly's remark or put Kelly's remarks into context because I do think that is important. You noted, he was a former Marine general. I will note his son also served and died while serving in combat. And just having covered John Kelly in the past when I was covering the first -- the Trump White House back in, you know, in 2016 to 2020, that John Kelly is someone who really cares about the way that power works, the division of power within the U.S. I found it very notable listening to some of those recordings that they gave to, that he gave to the New York Times when he said that he once had a conversation with Donald Trump where he had to say, \"I don't serve you, I serve the Constitution.\" Now, I do think it's also important to note, you know, some of what Donald Trump himself has said in relation to this because we did hear from Kelly and several other former White House officials who served with Trump, that includes John Bolton, Mark Milley, Jim Mattis, Bill Barr, all of them sounding the alarm on Donald Trump and what it would mean if he was elected once again. But I want to point to what Trump has said himself. He has, in the past, made very clear that he wants to massively expand the power beneath the executive branch if he is in office. He's talked about using the military to round up migrants in the United States to deport them. He also often praises authoritarian leaders. He talks about Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin being tough guys. And we heard him actually use some of that rhetoric last night when he was campaigning in North Carolina. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's a fierce individual. The press, the fake news, hates when I say that he's a brilliant man. He runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. He's a fierce man. I got along with him very well. Putin, these are people that are tough people. Kim Jong Un, North Korea, nuclear weapons all over the place. I said, you ever do anything else, go to a game, do something. You know, he loves producing nuclear weapons. That's what he likes producing. And he's got a lot of them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks so much for being with us, Anthony. I do want to get your reaction to these reports from General John Kelly.

One of the things that he didn't add in that interview was a lot of times, he had to push the President back from doing things that were illegal or against the constitution or even against the institution of the presidency. So I applaud him for being out there. He sent me a text last night that he will not be doing the View. So I'll just give you some news flash there. He's not going to be doing the View, but I think he wants to get his words out there on record so that people know. But the real question you have to ask people is what's up with the support of Donald Trump if you've got people, 40 people in the White House, myself included, telling you how dangerous the person is. Let's say we worked at a pharmaceutical company and we told you that the pill you were about to give one of your family members was going to kill them, would you still give the pill? There's something in the body politic today that we have to get our arms around. I think there are people that like this strongman sort of thing. And I'm just here to message people that Churchill ultimately was right that democracy is a terrible form of government until you consider all the other forms of government. And what we know about strong leaders is it leads to lots of corruption, kleptocracy, and ultimately violence. And so I'm asking people to please reconsider their vote for Donald Trump. We know that his economic plan is not as good as the Vice President's. We know that he doesn't believe in our rules-based society. He doesn't like our allies. And if you like the continuity of America and all the things that have made us peaceful and prosperous over the years, I hope people will reconsider what they're doing and vote for the Vice President.",

It's a catastrophe, according to the United Nation's representatives on the ground. And the military pressure is still continuing as well with the Israeli defense forces, Israeli military pounding areas of northern Gaza, specifically the Jabalia refugee camp. It's a densely populated area that Israel has already, you know, said it's cleared of Hamas two times in the past.But now, the military says that they're seeing signs of Hamas reappearing there, trying to reestablish itself, which is why they're going back in. And they're hitting residential buildings, they're hitting schools, at least two schools we're hit today. They're not serving as schools. These buildings are serving as shelters for the displaced civilian population. And some, you know, appalling scenes that we've seen come to us on video from Gaza over the course of the past 24 hours. One scene of a young girl being dragged from the rubble by rescue workers in a pause of the Israeli military campaign, bombing campaign inside Gaza. There was lots of other video as well, which we just can't broadcast because it's bodies strewn across the streets. The whole area drenched in blood, that the ground beneath them drenched in blood and people screaming. It's absolutely horrific nightmare scenes. So, you know, that kind of trauma, that kind of, you know, pressure in the -- in Gaza, on the civilian population, is ongoing despite what the U.S. Secretary of State may have said to his Israeli counterparts.",
