CNN's Katelyn Polantz leads us off here. Katelyn, there's been plenty of response from Donald Trump. He has gone on social media praising this decision.

That is going to be moving forward. So we'll here from them there.And then there are the other cases in Florida, this question of immunity has come up. There Judge Aileen Cannon is very likely to look at it there as well. And then in New York, we're already starting to hear from a different set of folks, the New York lawyers for Donald Trump. They have taken a letter to the judge overseeing that case where Donald Trump was convicted by a jury previously and has his sentencing set for next week. They're arguing that it should be thrown out because there were things that were brought into that trial, tweets when Donald Trump was president, ledgers from the White House, Hope Hicks testimony, she was an adviser to Trump when he was the president, those things were in trial and should have been taken out. They're going to be arguing things like this to the judge up there in New York. Here's Will Scharf, one of Trump's attorneys last night on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There are many Democrats who are still wondering how seriously both the president and his top advisors are taking their concerns. There was all this talk over the weekend about sort of really taking a hard look at things. There are very few signs that the president himself and his top advisors are reconsidering or listening to the anger and concerns from Democrats.On a phone call last night with top donors, Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, was telling people, I'm told, she said we are clear- eyed about this. We're not Pollyannaish. But then went on to say the president's health is fine. She said his health is probably better than most of the health of the members of the National Finance Committee who are on this call, which certainly does not indicate a level of seriousness that they are considering things. But I am told this morning that the Biden team will be looking at new polls and data that is coming in this week, likely tomorrow, to assess the damage on the Democratic ticket. How much is this going to impact House races? How much is this going to impact Senate races? We know there is a broad scale panic among some Democratic House members, particularly in swing states and other difficult districts, about all of this. And there is just a sense, is the president sort of reconsidering or at least looking at this carefully, or is he simply digging in and in a bunker of his own?",

If this election is truly as consequential, if democracy is truly on the ballot, is he the strongest candidate?Now, on the other side of this, Donald Trump and his supporters have had a very good run of days here. From the debate last Thursday, certainly not a flawless performance by any means as he was giving one misstatement after another, but a stronger performance than Joe Biden. But that Supreme Court ruling yesterday and all of its legal effects here, now trying to essentially a hold or change his New York conviction, this certainly has Donald Trump supporters in a very pleasant and happy mood this morning. Of course, we should point out, four months from Election Day this week, a lot could happen. But first and foremost, all eyes today are on Democrats and the Biden campaign. Are they going to make any moves? As of now, zero evidence that they are giving in or really even listening are considering any of these concerns from Democratic officials, Kate.",

And right now, they don't see a great option.And in fact, this is where we're going to start seeing where the blame game starts being passed around. We've certainly seen the Biden campaign come out against some of their own surrogates and have been very critical of some of the assessments that they have said publicly about the debate this morning, same thing I've heard.

They're going to be going and walking in 4th of July parades. They're going to be meeting with their constituents. More importantly, they're going to be meeting with the Democrats that have helped elect these congresspeople back home. And if they start getting an incredible amount of pressure, it really is a fight to survive fight, right?

But more important politically, could you imagine if Joe Biden decided to say, look, I'm stepping aside, and then you had the likes of Gavin Newsom or Gretchen Whitmer or anyone else come in and try to take on Kamala Harris, who is the first African American vice president. I mean, imagine the split in the party there where you have African American constituents, even the likes of James Clyburn, who helped Joe Biden get elected, like really is credited with making that happen, could you imagine the internal fights that would happen if there were some kind of battle for the Democratic nomination in just a few weeks before their convention?",

Well, what's the meaning of their proclamation that a president is not above the law if he can engage in those kinds of conduct?

They are veterans of the George W. Bush administration, of the Reagan administration. In many ways, the conservative majority seemed to be arguing some very old cases in an attempt to remove the Sword of Damocles, the possibility of criminal prosecution over future presidents, but in doing so, they have opened the door to presidential abuse of power.  If you think about the ways in which Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy -- I want to make clear this is not a partisan problem, this is a presidential problem. The way in which they use National Security to authorize wiretaps, for example, the case of Nixon breaking into Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office, the ways in which they use their core constitutional authorities to abuse presidential power.
