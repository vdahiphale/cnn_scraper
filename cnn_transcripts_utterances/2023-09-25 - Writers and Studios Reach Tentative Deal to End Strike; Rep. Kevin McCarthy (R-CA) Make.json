I'm ready to go back to telling stories.But the guild is telling them not yet. No one is allowed to return to work. They're saying they need to figure out the legal language first. What they described it as is just dotting every single I. We do not know what is in this contract, but sources telling CNN that artificial intelligence was really the last sticking point that they had to work through. I want to read part of the statement that the WGA put out. And this is what they're saying. What we have won in this contract, most particularly, everything we have gained since May 2nd is due to the willingness of this membership to exercise its power, to demonstrate its solidarity, to work side by side, to endure the pain and uncertainty of the past 146 days. So, after they figure out the language, there is going to be a leadership vote, and that will likely happen tomorrow. After that, we'll get all of the details on this deal, and the members will be able to ask questions and then vote on it. The first thing that you're likely going to see return to normal, it's the talk shows, the late night shows. Those are really the first ones that we'll be able to go back on T.V. And you're seeing some of those on your screen. The biggest question, though, is what happens to the rest of T.V this year, and, really, movies next summer. And the thing is that those also are going to depend on the actors who are on strike as well. These two strikes together have been extremely difficult for this industry. It's sort of a domino effect, because it's not just Hollywood. It is really an entire country impacted by these two strikes. Phil?",

I think those were the two big hang- ups that they were in the room for the last five days really trying to work out the language in that.So, what they're saying to them is, we stood in there, we fought for you, we know what you wanted, and this is what we got. It will be interesting to see tomorrow when the board has that vote, if they do ratify this new agreement. We know we won't see picketers anymore on the picket line, but the WGA has told its members, you are still on strike.

The actors union is bigger, it's more powerful, but there's a lot of bad blood there. I mean, the leadership in the actors union has been very vocal about how they feel about the heads of the studios. And so there hasn't been a lot of talk.

As you said, we still have a while to go until a general election. And the more that they push out this messaging, a lot of people close to the White House believe that it will kind of naturally begin to resonate with voters. But I think it's clearly a concern.

A lot of voters seem to want someone younger now.
