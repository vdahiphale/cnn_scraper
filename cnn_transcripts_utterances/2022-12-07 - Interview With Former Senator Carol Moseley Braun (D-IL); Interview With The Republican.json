Welcome to our program. So, Carol Moseley Braun, Senator, I saw your face beaming as Raphael Warnock pay tribute to his mother and laid out the really terrible journey that took for her to get to this moment. CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN, FORMER U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT:  Thank you for having me, Christiane. I am delighted and over the moon about this victory. And I must say that the joy of his re-election is matched only by the prayers that went up to make sure it would happen. And I want to say thank you, also, to the young voters who came out -- I mean, the young voters and the millennials and the generation Z, whatever that means.

However, you know, Herschel Walker was, in many ways, a bridge too far for a lot of these suburban voters, college educated voters who often vote Republican or willing to vote Republican but did not want to vote for both Herschel Walker himself but also a Trumpy candidate. I mean, one of the things that has happened in his 2022 midterm is we have seen independent swing voters and even soft republicans really reject the people that Donald Trump put forward and, kind of, dragged across the finish line in this Republican primaries. You know, the base has been picking. The base of the Republican party has been picking these extreme Trumpy candidates. And there's a lot of independent and swing voters that don't want to vote for them. I mean, you know, Walker ran about 200,000 votes behind Brian Kemp, the Republican governor in the general election.

And right now, what I am watching them do though is have a familiar pattern of, kind of, keeping quiet about the former president. If they don't find their voice. If they don't condemn him -- some of them, they're more likely to, sort of, blame him for the losses, that's true. But they need to be unequivocal that this person cannot be the 2024 nominee and they need to take action to ensure that that does not happen. They need to start backing, you know, they -- encouraging people to run against him. There is still this weird fear among Republicans because they are very afraid of the base that Trump controls that they won't, sort of, condemn him outright. No matter how many white supremacists he is dinner with, no matter how many elections he cost them, he still has this, kind of, control. But they have to recognize that this a moment of extreme weakness for Donald Trump and it is their opportunity for offense, but it doesn't just happen. You know, they have to do something about it which they have been reluctant to do over the last seven years and that's what gives Donald Trump this continued life within the party.",

The idea of government by fiat and, I guess -- we don't put up with dictators in this country. At least we haven't in my lifetime. And so, I think that this really is a vote to stabilize the ship of democracy to make our government work better, and it will. And I think Joe is doing -- Joe Biden is doing a laudable job. Actually, with all the legislative accomplishments he's achieved, with the -- his -- with his position on the world state. I mean, he's done a great job so far with those things. And so, I think this was a vote for normalcy by the American people. And that it happened in Georgia, actually, I think, is astonishing. And again, back to my dream, the people who had gotten elected before to the United States Senate, well, from Illinois, me, Roland Burris, and Barack Obama. We're all Illinoisians. So, Warnock is the first from Georgia, from the deep south to breakthrough and to make -- and it makes a huge difference in the narrative about what's happened to the black community, what's happening in America, and what's happened with his candidacy.

In Latvia, there are perpetual tensions between Latvian population and very significant local Russian population, part of which, unfortunately, happen to be pro-Putin.

You have elevated levels of dopamine, the part of our brain, the amygdala which triggers fear, anger, hate. Us against them. I would argue it's the worst of humanity. That this is what is rewarded. And then what happens to societies when that happens? These three sentences I've said repeatedly in the last six or seven years. When you don't have facts, you don't have truth. Without the truth, you can't have trust. Without these three, we have no shared reality. We cannot solve any problems and you cannot have democracy. And what we're seeing globally is a rollback of democracy, back to 1989 levels. You have 60 percent of the world now living under autocratic rule and we still keep having elections, right? So, the transformation is happening in front of our eyes.",

Facebook is our internet. So, this is part of what you see. And then because Rappler was born on Facebook and we monitor the data that comes through, we can see the behavior that it encourages, right. Like, I was a reporter at a time when governments would talk about the CNN effect, this is before 1996. Well, now we have social media impact. And it is not in one country. It is global.

And what wound up happening is that it's, kind of, like throwing spaghetti against the wall. There were a lot of Filipinos on social media. Before social media, before Facebook, it was Multiply. And so, then the -- it became a large group of people that were then first for entertainment and then shifted to politics. And this is part of what I laid out in the book. How did it happen? How did we discover it? Who discovered this? And how did young kids work in a political campaign and shift, you know, drugs, for example, was a number eight concern during our 2016 campaign. And because it was a key concern for Rodrigo Duterte who was then a mayor, it rose to number one, largely with the help of social media. So, it's the same thing. It's -- bottom up, you know, they -- there were lies, half-truths that were pounded, metanarratives that were pounded online for a year. And then the same thing would come top down from the campaign or from the president himself. In our case, I was targeted with a metanarrative that I was a criminal. Filipinos -- some Filipinos believe I'm a criminal, right, because then a year later, President Duterte says the exact same thing. Reinforces the lie and says it in his State of the Nation Address. And then that's quickly followed a week later by the first criminal charges, the investigations. We had 14 investigations in 2017, 2018. By 2019, I was getting arrested, like, I think I had 10 arrest warrants in less than two years starting in 2019.",

That's why I started with, what are the algorithms pushing? What kind of behavior is rewarded, right? So, when -- I mean, Duterte was Trump before Trump was Trump. If you really, look at it this way, right? And what did it reward? When Duterte attacked, that was rewarded. You know, it was -- I mean, there are all sorts of new words that came out of this. Gaslighting, right? Information operations. When President Duterte, in July 8th -- and I will never forget this. I wake up and President Duterte attacks me. And I wake up to this and it gets viral spread on social media. And when that happens, it's almost like a brigade coming at you, pounding you. It's not -- it isn't something like, you know, in the physical world where there are people in the room and people realize, oh, that's not civilized. I'm not going to do that. It isn't like that. This is programed. The algorithms of distribution choose. And that's the incentive structure they put in place. So, someone like Duterte got tremendous reach, tremendous distribution, and as the government -- and this is something that laid -- is laid out in the book, you can see that both Duterte and Marcos information operations worked hand in hand. These networks worked together. And they would have -- they would, for example, be told, oh, let -- attack Michel today. Choose her post. This is the post. Attack it in one spot.

They have to be. It doesn't all drop. And what I'm hoping to do what the book is really to show you our discovery of this. And also, to show you how simple it could be. On January 6th, Facebook did something that they could do and this is to turn up the news ecosystem quality. It's one -- it was one of their great glass measures, you know, when the violence happened, everyone was scared. And so, what they did, they turned up quality news, essentially, like a button. And when they did that on crowd tangle, you can see NPR, New York Times, CNN, right? You could see quality news come up. And they kept that on for a few weeks. But then they realized they made marginally less money. I mean, why would a company that controls the public sphere let that little amount of money control the future of democracies?
