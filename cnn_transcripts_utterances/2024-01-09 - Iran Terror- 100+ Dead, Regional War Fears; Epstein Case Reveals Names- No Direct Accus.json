And they're certainly keen on avoiding war, at least a major war in the Middle East, because that can only serve to drag them down.However, on the Israeli side, one of the things that we've noted in the last few days and really few weeks is the increased volume of attacks between the Israelis and Hezbollah on Israel's northern frontier, the northern border with Lebanon.

Now, those operations are less effective than they were in the north, and so in that sense, the IDF spokesman is absolutely correct.They have a better chance of, in essence, mopping things up in the central part and in the south with the resources that they currently have than they did in the north with a similar set of troops.

At the moment, more voters say they trust Trump than Biden on many of the key issues the country is facing, particularly the economy and the border. But the doubts about Trump's commitment to democracy and the broader sense that he is a threat to the rights that Americans have come to expect is the reason why 93 million separate individuals, by the best estimates of Democratic analysts, have come out to vote against him and his party in the last three elections.

But with deep differences remaining between the two parties, they're now at an impasse.And that means funding for Ukraine and Israel also remains in limbo, because Republicans insist that foreign aid be paired with major changes aimed at securing the Southern U.S. border. Now more than ever, many Chinese citizens are seeking political asylum in the United States, having spent a decade under the strongman rule of President Xi Jinping. And they're using some unconventional means to do it, sometimes paying smugglers to help them navigate a dangerous path through South and Central America to reach the U.S. border. CNN's David Culver spoke with migrants fleeing the world's second biggest economy, who say everything there is not what it seems. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As soon as we pull up, they rush towards us. My mic, not even on, but that doesn't stop this crowd of Chinese migrants from venting to producer Yeong Sheon (ph). They're angry, having to wait in the cold for Border Patrol. This is just one of three makeshift border camps we stopped at in Eastern San Diego County. Alongside migrants from Latin America, at each camp we meet dozens from China. The numbers reflect the surge. From 2013 to 2022, CBP recorded fewer than 16,000 Chinese migrants illegally crossing the U.S. Southern border. This past year alone? More than 31,000. That's roughly double the prior ten years combined. But unlike those fleeing countries in turmoil like Venezuela, Cuba, or Haiti, these migrants are leaving the world's second largest economy.",
