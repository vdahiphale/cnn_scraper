Our panel of experts is here to discuss.(END VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER:  Hello. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington, where the state of our union is reeling from the death of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. Only 47 years old, Navalny appeared in good health and reasonably good spirits in the Siberian penal colony where he'd been held on bogus charges in Putin's Russia. And yet, somehow, on Friday, the world learned that the pro-democracy anti-corruption activist was dead. Putin is being blamed for the death by President Biden, Governor Nikki Haley, and so many other Western leaders. And yet Donald Trump has had nothing specific to say about this, this after Trump told a South Carolina crowd last Saturday that, as president, he had told a NATO ally that he would encourage Russia to do -- quote -- \"whatever the hell they want\" -- unquote -- to any NATO country that does not spend enough on its own defense. Trump's last remaining Republican challenger, Nikki Haley, says of Trump -- quote -- \"We cannot have a president who sides with murderous thugs who want to destroy America\" -- unquote. Yet Trump looks poised to easily defeat her in her home state of South Carolina this Saturday. And despite a bipartisan gathering of American leaders who tried to reassure allies overseas this weekend about the U.S. commitment to countering Russia in Ukraine, the Republican Party that Trump has remade in his image seems largely on board with the strategy of poking NATO allies and petting the bear. Joining us now to discuss, former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney. Congresswoman, thanks so much for being here. So, the Russian prison service announced Friday that Vladimir Putin's critic Alexei Navalny is dead. Biden says Putin's responsible. Do you agree? And how should the U.S. respond? FMR. REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY):  Yes, there's no question. Absolutely, he's responsible. The best thing that we can do right now is to pass the aid bill that the Ukrainians need so urgently to help them continue what they're doing to defeat Putin's army in Ukraine. And one thing that's really important, Jake, for the viewers to recognize and understand is, one man, one man has the power in his hands to get that done. And that's Mike Johnson. Now...",

He could put the bill that's already passed the Senate onto the floor of the House for a vote tomorrow. It could be on Joe Biden's desk by tomorrow night, and the aid could be flowing to Ukraine. And Mike Johnson ought to search deep in his conscience, understanding exactly what's happening, the slaughter that's happening in Ukraine today, the extent to which the Ukrainians are on the front lines in this battle for freedom. And history will look back at this moment and ask, what did Mike Johnson do? He has said, and I take him at his word, that he believes that God has told him that he's called to be Moses.

And I think that Republicans who understand the importance of the national security situation who continue to support him are similarly going to be held to account. When you think about Donald Trump, for example, pledging retribution, what Vladimir Putin did to Navalny is what retribution looks like in a country where the leader is not subject to the rule of law. And I think that we have to take Donald Trump very seriously. We have to take seriously the extent to which you have now got a Putin wing of the Republican Party. I believe the issue this election cycle is making sure the Putin wing of the Republican Party does not take over the West Wing of the White House.",

NATO, in my view, is the most successful alliance probably in the history of the world. And the extent to which, because of American leadership, we have been able to lead those free nations of Europe, we have been able to guarantee security, but we have been able to deter exactly the kind of thing that we're seeing happen today in Ukraine, because NATO members know and because our adversaries know that, if there's going to be an invasion of a NATO country, we will come to their aid. We will all come to each other's aid. And I think one of the things that is so misguided about this current debate, people like J.D.

I mean, this is not something that's out of left field. And when you look at these cases and you look at the verdicts and the judgments, it's clear that the common thread that runs through all of them is Donald Trump's lack of willingness to abide by the law, lack of commitment to the truth, fundamental lack of character.

If you look, for example, at the Navalny assassination and how important it is for the West and for organizations that are committed to freedom and democracy to strengthen themselves and to stand tall now, one of the most important of those in the United States is the National Endowment for Democracy that was established during the Reagan administration that has long fought for freedom and stood for dissidents. You have now, today, as we sit here, Elise Stefanik, who has said that she would be perfectly willing to steal the next election, who, as far as I know, has made no comment about the assassination of Navalny, she sits on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy.

And when we have that, what ultimately happens is in fact world peace. The fastest, most effective way for us to get there is to look at the four years when Donald Trump was our president and ask the question, how was Eastern Europe? Well, Putin stayed away from Ukraine. In the Middle East, Hamas did not invade Israel. In the Indo-Pacific, China, because of the 301 tariffs, because of the headwinds put on their economy, they were not talking about Taiwan. But, more importantly, Jake, the number one national security issue facing America today is our insecure, unsafe, and wide-open southern border. Americans have spoken, whether I'm in church, whether I'm at the gym, or when you look at the polls. One thing is completely clear. Our southern border is the greatest national security risk we have as a nation. And, unfortunately, Joe Biden has failed miserably on keeping Americans safe here at home.

Chuck Schumer would oppose a stand-alone aid package for our ally in the Middle East. Why? Because they wanted to leverage the deaths of Israelis to fund Ukraine. My first objective is always to keep America safe. In the border bill, we did not see a border wall. A border wall, having just returned from Eagle Pass, Texas, listening to the Border Patrol agents themselves, here's what they're telling us, Jake. A border wall would make the actual officers safer themselves. It would see a precipitous drop in the number of illegal immigrants crossing our border. In that border deal was no funding for a wall. There was no new policy or reinstating the policy of remaining in Mexico. Without those two pieces, allowing two million Americans -- two million illegal immigrants into America, that's not a border deal to pass. That's a border deal that should fail.",
