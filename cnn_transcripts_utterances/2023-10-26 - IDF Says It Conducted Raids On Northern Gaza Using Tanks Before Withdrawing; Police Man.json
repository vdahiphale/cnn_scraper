      "sentences": "The reality on the ground inside Gaza getting bleaker by the hour as Israel makes its deepest raid into the territory.These are live pictures of the Gaza city skyline. Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD, I'm Becky Anderson. It is 5:00 p.m. in Gaza, it's 6:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi where we are following two major breaking stories. First, the heated debate about to begin any moment at the United Nations as diplomats work to break the humanitarian deadlock that is failing Palestinian civilians. Then, updates expected this hour from the U.S. state of Maine where a massive manhunt is now underway for the person of interest in two shootings that killed at least 16 people. We do expect to hear from authorities in just about 30 minutes from now. Well, Israeli forces have conducted what is believed to be the biggest raid into Gaza since the October the 7th terror attack. IDF says these new images show that forces are conducting targeted raids using tanks in northern Gaza. They were there before withdrawing. It could be laying more groundwork, of course, for the major incursion that officials, including the Israeli Prime Minister are saying will happen, promising even more suffering inside Gaza. And it is that suffering that is being discussed this hour at the United Nations where the General Assembly is beginning an emergency session on the Israel-Gaza war. It comes in the face of a Security Council deadlock over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that is now reaching a critical point. Of course, the main U.N. agency there says it is being -- and I quote them here, \"paralyzed by the lack of fuel\". Israel insists supplies exist under Hamas control. Well, to give you a sense of the damage, these are before and after satellite images of one area in Gaza. I've got teams across the globe to cover this story for you and need reaction to it worldwide. Nic Robertson is in Sderot in southern Israel, Nada Bashir is in the Jordanian capital of Amman, and Richard Roth is at the United Nations. And Richard, let's start with you because this is the General Assembly. Of course, the U.N. has not been effective at passing any resolution on this conflict at the Security Council level. Just talk to us about what they hope to achieve today, and just how significant this could be.",

There will be a debate between 10:00 a.m. New York Time and 1:00 p.m. But as we've seen over the years, the more divided, the more deadlock the Security Council is, the General Assembly says in effect, hey, what about us? The problem is that the General Assembly can vote on a resolution, and this one does not even mention Hamas, but it is non-enforceable, and it does not have the clout of a Security Council resolution. Of course, in New York yesterday, both a Russia resolution at the Security Council and a U.S. resolution was vetoed by each other. And there was a U.S. veto of a different draft a week ago. The issue here has certainly riled up Arab delegation, Muslim nations, so most of those countries have joined on to this resolution draft. There may be a vote, it's really, Becky, what happened with Ukraine, where the overwhelming support for Ukraine in the initial months of the invasion by Russia. Becky?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so far, not a full ground invasion. The prime minister under pressure not only it appearsfrom the military, but also from the public for action. He's promised tough action to take down Hamas, and has indicated, and his military chiefs have all been indicating recently that there would be an incursion. This, not a full blown incursion, but a preparation for what may be to come. That's how the IDF describes it. Large in scale, but limited in what it was setting out to achieve. They said that it set out to take out terrorist targets. Terrorists who they said who were planning operations against Israel. That was the scope of it. But large, it seemed to us on scale, because we watched part of it and listened to it unfold behind us here last night. We can see the tanks firing shells across the skyline there. And here are some the type of detonation that we haven't heard before. It was hard to tell what it was, but this operation, at least, here, does seem, in military terms, to potentially pave the way for more to come. Because you don't go in, in military terms, and take out part of the enemy's infrastructure and walk back and leave it for them to rebuild over a few days before you approach it again. So it does seem to be that the army is moving closer to that incursion. I have to say, to the point about what's being discussed that the U.N., I think there was an expectation that part of the pause before the incursion might have given the space for successful conversations at the United Nations. That clearly isn't happening, and the military here is getting closer to their ground goals, which is perhaps a bigger incursion, Becky.",

No more information as of yet, but we know those talks continue. That's a story then on the ground from Nic Robertson's perspective where he is. Nada, I want to get to you. The Jordanian Foreign Minister -- King Abdullah of Jordan, have not been holding back in their position on all of this. We know that Jordanian Foreign Minister will be speaking at the U.N. Jordan, of course, an ally of both the U.S. and Israel, well, certainly has, you know -- has ties, and has been very critical of what is going on, warning the world against displacement.

Let me get back to you, Richard, anything that comes out of theU.N. here, of course, is a non-binding resolution. And you know, through Ukraine, and now with the Israel-Hamas conflict as it stands at present, but there's clearly a wider story here on a political solution or a political horizon possibly for Israel-Palestine. The U.N. has been seen time and time again to just not seem equipped for needs at this point. It just doesn't feel like it is equipped to do a job that so many people around the world would expect it to do. Come together with a call for action. At this point, Israel has called for the U.N. Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres to resign. Just remind us why? This isn't certainly the first spat that Israel has had with the United Nations, it probably won't be the last. But you know, why did he call for that resignation? What was it that Guterres said that riled the foreign minister so much? And we talk about whether the U.N. is really equipped for purpose at this point. Is it?",

But I have to say it's so frustrating to see these resolutions, these draft resolutions, come and go, and for so little to be achieved. It's good to see member countries having the opportunity to have this discussion at the General Assembly. But quite frankly, you know, what is happening on the ground is happening in real-time at this point. Thank you all very much indeed for joining us. Let's get you some live pictures of Gaza. And these are -- what? Mid to late afternoon, you see an awful lot of smoke rising from behind a building there at 5:15 p.m. in Gaza City. We've got -- working our sources on the ground. We will get you information as to what we understand to be happening in Gaza city at present, but I mean, it is clear that, that is likely another airstrike from Israel. And that is the story there just after 5:25 in Gaza city. And we are going to get you back on the ground, of course, as we move through this hour. Also in Gaza, the IDF is confirming that it did strike the area where the relatives of an \"Al Jazeera\" journalist had been sheltering. A warning that the following video is distressing. \"Al Jazeera\" network's Gaza bureau chief al-Dahdouh lost 12 members of his family in an airstrike on Wednesday. You see him here in the blue check shirt in blue jacket including in those deaths where his wife, his son, daughter and grandson. The IDF says it was targeting Hamas infrastructure. Of course, staying on this story for you more coming up after this break. Also, still to come this hour, a massive manhunt is underway in the U.S. after deadly mass shootings at a bowling alley and restaurant in Maine. A live report on that is just ahead.

Now, the issue is, look, just because you have mental health issues or you're struggling with depression or some kind of mental health problem, doesn't mean you go and carry out a mass shooting. Where at least at this stage, we have at least 16 people that have been killed and dozens injured, right?
