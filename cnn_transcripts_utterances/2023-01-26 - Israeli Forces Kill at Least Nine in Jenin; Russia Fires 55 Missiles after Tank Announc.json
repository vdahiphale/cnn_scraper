Ukraine's military says Russia fired 55 missiles at energy facilities this morning and 2 dozen drones overnight. At least one person was killed in the capital. People in Kyiv, again took shelter in underground metro stations during a nationwide air raid alert. Ukrainian officials say, air defenses shot down most of the missiles and all 24 drones. Other sites targeted by Russia include Odessa just one day after UNESCO deemed the city an endangered World Heritage Site. Strikes there damaged energy infrastructure. Germany's defense minister says 14 Leopard 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine by the end of March. He says it won't be too. Late Right now, intense fighting is focused on the eastern city of Bakhmut. Fred Pleitgen updates us on the battle there, the latest flashpoint in this 11 month old. War. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The Russian army claims its overwhelming firepower is decimating Ukrainian defenses on the most brutal fronts in this war around the town Bakhmut. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Fifteen men just ran into this house. Yes, target hit. They managed to collapse the middle of the building. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Ukraine has now acknowledged losing its last foot hole in the small town of Soledar north of Bakhmut. The Russians there, mostly mercenaries from the Wagner private military company judging by their own claims. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We were fast to select the target, charge up and hit it. We hit precisely. We hit the building right in the place where the 80 GM (ph) was located. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But despite sources telling CNN, the U.S. has advised Ukraine to withdraw from Bakhmut. Even Wagner commanders admit Kyiv's forces are fighting back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The enemy puts up fierce resistance to our fighters. The enemy is holding on and is getting additional reserves and military supplies. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And the Ukrainians continue probing in other areas far from Bakhmut, the military releasing this video of a daring raid across the Dnipro River in south Ukraine, taking out a Russian command facility there. But to go on the offensive, Ukraine needs hundreds of main battle tanks, so far western partners have pledged about 100. Moscow has vowed to hit those tanks when they enter Ukraine and is conducting a show of force of its own, sending the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, Moscow says carries hypersonic missiles to ocean drills with the Chinese and South African navies. But for now, Bakhmut is the epicenter of this conflict and Ukrainian soldiers here say they will fight for every inch.

So they will be an important boost in terms of the tactical picture. But they also have a very important strategic symbolism because they symbolize unity now within NATO. No schism between Germany and the United States, which had been appearing over whether not Germany would supply those tanks, whether not the Americans would also come on board. They've now offered some 30 plus Abrams tanks. It could be months in coming. But more importantly, it opens the doors, potentially. This is something that the Ukrainians are really hoping for, Eleni, to more strategic weapons, more weapons like ultimately fighter bomber aircraft. Possibly even F-16s. There's a hope that they may get an uplift in terms of their air force. Certainly, they want to see a great deal more contribution in terms of their air defenses coming -- in the last 24 hours here in Ukraine suffered yet another onslaught from drones and missile strikes coming from Russia. They need those air defenses desperately and, above all, perhaps they need heavy artillery in order to hold on to positions that the Russians are trying to overwhelm with a force of personnel and even their relatively old and not very sophisticated Soviet-era equipment, Eleni.",

This comes about two years after Trump was banned in the wake of the Capitol Hill attack. Congressman Adam Schiff is among those denouncing Meta's move, tweeting, \"Giving him back access to a social media platform to spread his lies and demagoguery is dangerous.\" CNN's Donie O'Sullivan explains why Meta made this decision. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Meta announcing the most politically consequential decision in its history certainly here in the United States. Announcing on Wednesday that it was going to let former President Donald Trump back on its platforms, which will include, of course, Facebook and Instagram. Now you might remember Trump was kicked off the platforms in the days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Facebook at the time saying it was too dangerous for Trump to be able to have that megaphone that he might incite further violence. And two years later, Facebook, Meta has now said that it has reassessed its ban. It has determined that there isn't as great a risk of imminent violence or harm posed by Trump and that they are going to allow him back on the platform in the coming weeks. Now this is a boon in Trump's campaign effort for 2024. He has, of course, announced that he is running for president. Again, we have seen in the past the Trump campaign really effectively use and spend hundreds of millions of dollars of advertising on Facebook because it is a very effective way, they have found, of targeting voters but also fundraising. As you can imagine, a lot of people on both sides of the political spectrum here speaking out for and against this decision. Of course, many people saying it's important to be able to hear from a former president and candidate for president. That's including the ACLU, who at this statement. They said, \"This is the right call. Like it or not, President Trump is one of the country's leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech.\" They said, indeed some of Trump's most offensive social media posts ended up being critical evidence in lawsuits filed against him and his administration. And we should know -- we filed over 400 legal actions against him. And that's a very important part of all of this, of course. The ACLU saying there although we might not like Trump, we believe what he is saying should be able to be seen by voters and citizens in the United States and people around the world whether it be good, bad or ugly.
