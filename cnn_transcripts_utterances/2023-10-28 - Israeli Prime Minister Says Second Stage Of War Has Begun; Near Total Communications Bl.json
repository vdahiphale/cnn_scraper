Israel's military says its troops and tanks are inside Gaza right now in what promises to be a bloody and complex battle in order to rid the Gaza Strip of the terrorist group responsible for the horrific October 7th attack that killed at least 1300 Israel Israelis.Inside Gaza, Palestinians are trying to shelter and they are mourning in darkness amid a near total communications blackout. As the Hamas controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health is estimating hundreds of Gazans have been killed by Israeli airstrikes in just the last two days. Meanwhile, the families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza are growing more terrified by the hour. Earlier last night, they pressed Netanyahu to make a deal that would secure the immediate release of each and every person held hostage while one pointed a photograph of their loved ones toward the wartime leader. We're going to start this evening with CNN's Nic Robertson who's live in Sderot, Israel. Nic, as Israel says it has started the second phase of its war against Hamas, you've been seeing huge explosions and hearing heavy machine gunfire tonight where you are, which is not far from the Gaza border.",

That area between the border fence and the towns inside the Gaza Strip.You're hearing the detonations there. We've seen missiles fired and different types of missiles that come from low altitude that we haven't seen before. In the midst of all of this, Hamas is still and other groups are still going to fire rockets out to different parts of Israel in the middle of all these strikes. Heavy, heavy tank rounds as well. There were flares in the sky above us a few minutes ago. There are these munitions that sort of drop and scatter red submunitions or red tracers down towards the ground. There's just an intense cacophony of different types of fire. The helicopter gunship is perhaps the newest thing that we've heard and that's sort of come over here in the last couple of hours or so -- Jake.",

Because of that near total communications blackout, it is getting harder for us and for everyone to get information out of Gaza. But the little that is trickling out paints a very grim picture of the humanitarian situation on the ground where you have people saying that there's nowhere safe in Gaza.They have no food, no fuel, electricity, water, and now communications have been cut off. People of Gaza have been almost cut off from the world, from each other. People inside Gaza don't know if their loved ones are dead or alive. And Jake, even before the intensification in the airstrikes and bombardment over the last 24 hours, the humanitarian situation on the ground was already devastating and we have to warn viewers our report they're about to see is graphic and they may find it disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over): It's hard to believe this was Gaza just a few weeks ago. Little Noor (PH) dressed in his finest, dancing with his brother at a wedding. His mother Wesal still can't believe her boy is gone. He was holding my hand as I took him to make him a sandwich, she says. He didn't get to eat it. A shrapnel cut through his neck. He's now in heaven. God give me strength to deal with this. The airstrikes that took 6-year-old Noor (PH) and other relatives left her with injuries all over her body and the unbearable pain so many Palestinian mothers are having to endure. There is a void in my heart, I can't even cry, she says. I really want to cry. But the tears are not coming out. Why can't I get it out? I want to cry for my little boy. Recovering at a hospital, she just wants to get back to her three other children, now homeless sheltering at a school. Hell is raining down on Gaza. Israel says it's going after Hamas and doing what it can to spare the innocent. But it is the innocent who are paying the heaviest price. The few hospitals still barely standing and the pictures are too graphic for us to show. But faces here tell of the horrors they've survived and this living nightmare they can't escape. Three-year-old Judy hasn't uttered a word in 16 days. She won't eat or drink, her father says, still in shock with a piece of shrapnel lodged in her head. What did these children do? We have nothing to do with resistance, he says. They're just targeting Palestinians. They're killing children because they're Palestinian. To them we're not humans. They don't know if she'll be able to walk again. Judy is one of the lucky ones, if one can call them that. She still has her father by her side. Baby Arwa (PH) keeps asking for her mom. She's too young to understand, her uncle says. Arwa lost her mother, her brother, and her sister, too. She shows the camera her ouchy. Every corner of every hospital so many heart-wrenching stories of loss so hard to comprehend. Didi (PH) only wakes up to cry, her aunt says, in a room with her 7-year-old brother Kinan (PH). The two were the only ones to survive an airstrike that killed their mother, father, brother, and dozens of their extended family. Kinan (PH) doesn't say much these days. He asks me if we have internet here, he says I want to call mommy and daddy, his aunt says. Doctors in these overwhelmed hospitals say every day brings a constant stream of children with no parents and a flood of injured they just don't have enough to treat. With the little they have they do what they can. But how do you begin to deal with so many going through so much? (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And I think that has been reflected in a lot of the words. We've also heard today from the Turkish leader speaking at a large rally in Istanbul in favor of the Palestinian cause, repeating his words that Hamas are not terrorists but freedom fighters and that Israel is an occupying force, words so strong in fact that Israel has sent Turkish diplomatic representatives home. There is of course in the middle of all this growing tension and anger, the question of the hostages. Now the families of the hostages who met earlier today with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said earlier on in the day, look, we need him to look us in the eye and tell us that this latest escalation is not going to put our family members in danger. In fact, what we've been hearing over the course of the evening not just from the Israeli prime minister himself who said that that was one of the main aims of the operation, but also saying that he believed they could be brought home. We've also been hearing from a representative of Qatar's Foreign Ministry speaking to Becky Anderson who earlier along explaining that the Qataris and the Israelis were keeping a close eye also on Hamas' willingness and that he believed there was still a great deal of room for him and negotiation.
