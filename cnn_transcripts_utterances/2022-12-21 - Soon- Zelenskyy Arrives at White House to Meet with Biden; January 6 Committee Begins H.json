I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.One hour from now, a major show of support as President Biden welcomes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the White House. The stakes, the symbolism of this wartime visit, you can't overstate it. This is Zelenskyy's first trip outside Ukraine since Russia invaded 300 days ago. Hours from now, he will also address Congress as lawmakers send billions more in aid to Ukraine. President Biden has already promise a sophisticated new defense system for that country as Russia's assault enters a new critical winter phase. Let's get right to CNN chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly. And, Phil, we're about to witness a big moment. Tell us more about the planning, the security that's in place and what to expect from this visit.",

President Biden extending the invitation in ray phone call between the two presidents on December 11 at and ramping up over the course of the last seven or eight days to make this a possibly, the security concerns very obvious to everybody, the process as complicated as it can be. But as you noted President Zelenskyy is on the ground at joint AirForce Base Andrews and in about an hour, we are going to see the symbolic. The president laying out the red carpet in a welcome for President Zelenskyy. About 30 minutes after that, it's the substance. And I think there's no question about it when you talk to White House officials. The bilateral meeting and closed door meeting between the two presidents, between President Zelenskyy and U.S. top national security officials is extraordinarily important both for what it means and what that conversation entails about how things will progress going forward. But also about what President Biden will be announcing and that is a significant new expansion of the U.S. security assistance that would include a battery of Patriot missile defense systems plus munitions in total $1.8 billion in new security assistance. This has been something they have pledged throughout the process. Today will underscore a commitment he has made clear is unequivocal and will not shift any time soon.",

Great to have both of you here. Thank you. Ambassador Volker, we are now 300 days into this war. President Zelenskyy will soon be walking the halls of the White House. Your thoughts on just the significance of this moment? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO:  Well, I think this is terrific. First off, if you remember back at the beginning of the phase of the conflict in February, people did not expect Ukraine to survive or to prevail. So for Zelenskyy to be here, to be visiting President Biden at the White House and to actually be pushing Russian forces out of his country is a terrific thing. Second it is important that Zelenskyy knows Ukraine is standing because of the help that the United States, the American people have given. He's grateful for that but also needs that to continue for Ukraine to prevail.",

So, I'm interested in what he will say but also hoping that he will embolden our leadership to say and do bold things, to say that we will not allow Putin to be the architect of the 21st century and that we will help Ukraine win.",

But Ukraine's fight is more man Zelenskyy and killing Zelenskyy wouldn't change Ukraine's fight to be free. Ukraine is vulnerability right now. It is at a tipping point. It is struggling to push back Russia and the aid has been huge. But you can't defeat Ukraine if it has the arsenal of democracy and that's what I'm looking for today.

On the second set of questions about why did the IRS drop the ball, we don't know yet. The IRS policy is to audit the sitting president every year and there were plenty of red flags to audit this particular president. We don't know why then they decided to sit on their hands. Was there -- were they just too intimidated? Was there some sort of political intervention? Was it disorganization? We just don't know. But those are the questions.",

This has been the case for many years. It has been a norm. It's not a law but it is their manual, within their manual because in part about suspicions about former President Nixon's own tax returns.And so, as a result, the public has the right to know that the president is not acting as if he's above the law and that there's dysfunction in place that is supposed to make sure that the president is abiding by the law.

We don't know where that income was, you know, what it's from, for example, we don't know who -- we don't know what was generating this money for him.That may not itself be in the tax documents. They may not be in the tax return but if the IRS in the process of auditing all of this requested documentation saying, where did you get this money from? What property was it based on or what other corporate endeavor did this come from? It might be in the IRS' own files. But we also know, unfortunately, from this report that Trump's tax representatives were extremely difficult to deal with in the process of this audit such as it was and didn't hand over a lot of this material. So you could imagine that if and when these audits are completed and they haven't been completed yet, IRS may be doing more of its due diligence to find out again where the money came from particularly if we're talking about foreign entanglements or whom he owes money to. Again, that would be the kind of things IRS could request. We don't know if they have or will be released, et cetera. But there are still a lot of puzzles here about how this man's complicated financial, you know, endeavors worked and who he was getting money from and who he owed money to.
