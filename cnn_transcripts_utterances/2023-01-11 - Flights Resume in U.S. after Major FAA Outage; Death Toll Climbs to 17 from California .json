Thousands of flights are delayed or canceled. Right now the FAA did lift the ground stop that paralyzed domestic air travel.The cause still unclear right now, even as airlines are starting to get flights back up in the air. We're also keeping a very close eye on the deadly storms in California. At least 17 people have been killed from what is now weeks of rain, floods, mudslides and some pretty big winds. As bad as it is already, more rain is still on the way. Let's start with Pete Muntean. He's at Reagan National Airport. Pete, a computer outage that absolutely no one needed right now. What is happening?",

The cascading effect is only beginning; 6,100 cancellations at last check at FlightAware across the U.S. Cancellations just hit 1,000.Because of this system outage, the Notice to Air Mission System or NOTAMs, those are the bulletins that pilots need before they can fly, added-on information about key safety information, whether a runway is open, whether or not taxiways are open, whether or not the navigational aids in bad weather are still functioning. The FAA issued a ground stop but the ground delay programs are still in effect. American is delaying flights out of Charlotte, Delta out of LaGuardia. Some are waiving fees. Southwest Airlines getting hit by the lion's share of these delays. About one in every five of those delays are on Southwest. We are just seeing the beginning of the end here. This is like planes and crews being out of position. If an airport is the door, the hallway is the airspace, it is crowded, hard to get people moving and out. Now we will see, as crews are out of position and planes are out of position, this domino effect. This is so nearly unprecedented. The last time we have seen a nationwide ground stop was after the 9/11 terrorist attack.",

      "sentences": "Oh, my goodness, Kate. This is probably about the $3 billion question. So several decades ago the FAA was tasked, good tasking, they were required to change over the entire United States' aviation system and the system of the world to an entire electronic, smoothless (ph) hand-off, wonderful flying system of the future.That was the largest computer modernization program in history. What happened is, piece by piece, part by part, they tried to make everything computerized. This notice to airmen, which it was called until recently, and then it was notice to air missions, so as part of that, they put all these NOTAMs online. So you could access them easily but most importantly, the airlines of the world, the contractors and service providers of the world could link in by a computer. Now it starts getting more complicated. It's not just a billboard you can access as a pilot but a billboard that other systems can link into around the world. So it's turned into a huge contractor-run system, where all sorts of other contractors can link in, provide information, get information out. But the catch is you have to get this information before you can fly. That's what makes the system so vital but also so fraught with danger. The FAA was cited by the Office of the Inspector General, because they were way behind schedule, way over budget. And there was a big push to get it finished. So maybe in their hurry to get it finished there were some codes or glitches.",

There have been many studies, some asked by Congress, by Office of Inspector General, including cyber security, though there's no indication this was a hack or an attack.But the problem with these massive government computer systems, they're run by contractors. Almost always, when you have a contractor- run system, there are criticisms for the people in charge in government not understanding it, not being on top of it. So you're at the mercy of these glitches. The good news in the vulnerability is our air traffic controllers, ground controllers, many of them remember the old system, where you had to do hand-offs manually, et cetera, so planes in the air are safe. That's why there's a ground stop. They won't throw any more in the air until everyone is brought down safely, because they can still talk to the pilots.

The county telling me they have done about 500 assessments, so far more than 100 homes have those yellow pieces of paper, which means they'll need a lot of work in the next couple days.
