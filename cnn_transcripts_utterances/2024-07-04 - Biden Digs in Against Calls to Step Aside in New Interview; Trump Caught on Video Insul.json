Now President Biden himself gathered Democratic governors from across the country, some attending in person, some virtually, to hear out their concerns and also try to argue that he is ready for a second term. You saw some public expressions from some of those governors saying that they fully support the president. But there were some concerns raised with him in that meeting here at the White House last night. Now President Biden yesterday also called into a campaign staff call where he insisted that he is remaining in this race until the end, and he will not be pushed out. But privately, the president has acknowledged to at least one key ally how consequential the coming days in his campaign will be. He's trying to take his message directly to voters sitting down for a major interview with ABC News tomorrow. And he'll also be hitting battleground states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. A part of his campaign to reach out to voters also included a pair of interviews with black radio hosts from across the country that he taped yesterday and started to air this morning. And in one of those interviews, the president warned about what a Trump presidency could hold if he's reelected. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They have been more than happy to let Joe Biden's debate performance stay in the spotlight, as well as all the Democratic hand-wringing that's taken place over the past few days.However, there is also just the situation and the reality that they're watching this unfold just as much as the rest of the country. And there is little certainty about how this will end. You know, they -- even though Donald Trump has been saying for more than a year that he doesn't think Joe Biden would get to the November election, they have not necessarily been planning any sort of contingencies for if Biden were to step down. Now we did see them for the first time publicly acknowledged all these scenarios and the speculation about who might replace Joe Biden on the ticket if that should come to pass and they put out this statement yesterday, quote, \"Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest and not fit for the White House. Every one of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\" Now that comments and that attack on the Democratic field as well as Vice President Harris comes amid all these questions about who might replace President Biden on the ballot if that were to come to pass. I am told, though, that this -- that within Trump's camp, they believe that it's not likely to happen because of all the hurdles to removing Joe Biden at this time, also because of his own defiance here. And as I talked to one Republican pollster, they said that they'd probably prefer it that way because the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know.",

So, Matt, healthy or do you see danger in this kind of cacophony of pressure for Biden to step down, you know, that -- do you concern yourself that it potentially undermines, you know, not just his leadership, but, you know, America's stand on the world stage even?MATT BENNETT, EXECUTIVE VP OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND CO-FOUNDER, THIRD WAY: I'm not particularly worried about America's stand on the world stage. The president is going to lead us into the NATO summit next week and he's going to do so capably. He always does. He's been a tremendously effective president. And the reason there is so much upset in Democratic politics right now is because nobody wants this. Every Democrat deeply respects and admires and has great affection for Joe Biden. He, as Joe Trippi said, has really saved democracy in 2020 by beating Trump. He has been incredibly effective, even with very narrow margins in Congress and passed huge pieces of very important legislation. So Democrats love and admire Joe Biden, and we know that he can lead us on the world stage going forward. But we are very worried about what we saw last week. And I think the thing that worries many of us is that it's been almost a week since and really all we've seen from the president is two speeches that he gave with teleprompters. So if he is to go forward, and as Joe said, only he can make that decision, he needs to show that he can do a lot more than that. He can do town hall meetings. You can do press conferences, you can do off-the-cuff remarks, and if he can, then everyone will unite behind him. And if he can't, we trust that he'll do the right thing.",

I think that there's a period when they all come back where the president will I think have some time and still, you know, can be out there and do the things that Matt has talked about that he needs to get out and do.But I also think that president is going to listen to those voices when they come back, and tell them what they're hearing, and that's where I think, look, he -- I truly believe that Joe Biden deep down knows that Donald Trump -- it's his whole being right now, the soul of the nation, fighting for that and stopping Donald Trump. And he's going to do what needs to be done to put the nation and call on Republicans, independents, and Democrats who care about our precious democracy and what we've held for 248 years. He's going to do that. I don't think there's a lot of time. I don't think there's weeks. But he will do what's right. And I would expect shortly after the July 4th this weekend when people come back next week that he'll have a sound idea of what he needs to do and will do it.",

These white parties, by the way, are famous. They kicked off in 1998. They ran from 1998 2009, and they were held around Labor Day.They were a who's who of people in the entertainment world, the business world, it was Diddy's attempt to fuse hip-hop with old money. And it was extremely successful. So because the suit involves white parties, it's really capturing a lot of attention because people remember those parties. He was so well-known for them. And for her to say that she was sex trafficked and that he forced her into prostitution as she alleges, is a really major deal. Now, of course. Diddy's attorney, one of his attorneys says that no matter how many lawsuits are filed, it does not change the fact that his client is innocent. They say that Diddy never sex trafficked anyone, never sexually assaulted anyone, and that, you know, they also went on to say that unfortunately we live in a country where people can just make up anything and can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. And so they're fighting back against the allegation. And as you pointed out, this is the ninth lawsuit since November when Cassie Ventura, who was a former girlfriend of Diddy's filed, that suit against him and that's the only one that's been settled thus far.",

They are expecting some flash flooding as well, from several inches of rain that they've already gotten, and still a major category three hurricane with 120- mile-per-hour winds with that center sitting 50 miles to the southwest of Grand Cayman. They've had gusts this morning, over 55 miles per hour and GrandCayman Island right now are still finding gusts over 40 miles per hour with some storm surge up to four feet. Now, as we go through the next day, we could find some additional weakening because there's this big area of wind shear right ahead of Beryl. Wind shear is that wind energy upstairs in the atmosphere and hurricanes hate it. It really chops away at some of the intensity, which is why we have found this kind of slowly coming down since it hit Jamaica. But it will continue to maintain hurricane strength as it gets towards Mexico going into tomorrow, looking at another landfall here somewhere on the Yucatan Peninsula, could find that storm surge there up to four to six feet and you can see that I, again, continues to stay with hurricane strength near Cancun and Cozumel. And then we're looking at getting back into the Gulf of Mexico where it's got warm waters again and can intensify for another time. We have rain forecast. We're looking at some four to six inches of rain across the Yucatan Peninsula, even some totals up to 10 inches are possible. And that could cause some flash flooding concerns. So here's that official track. You find it maintaining hurricane strength. That's why you've got the hurricane warnings in effect along the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, then it gets back into the Gulf where it could intensify again, maybe make another landfall as a hurricane somewhere on the border of Texas. And we'll have to watch this closely to see where the heaviest rain and storm surge could set up as we go into the weekend. We're really watching this dome of high pressure that's causing heat across the south to see if this weakens any, if it can make that turn to the north into Texas as we go into the weekend and going into early next week.
