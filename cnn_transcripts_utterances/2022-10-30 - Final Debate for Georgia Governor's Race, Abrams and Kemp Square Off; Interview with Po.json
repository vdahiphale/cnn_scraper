This was supposed to be packed tonight. And you can see that it's completely shut down.This space, maybe 6.5 feet across, guys. Can you imagine being stuck in the middle here, with literally thousands of people in this small area, packing and pushing you? It's hard to wrap your mind around how terrifying that must have been for those people who were essentially crushed to death or for those who slipped and fell and had people piling up on top of them. Some people so desperate, you know, they were trying to climb up these walls here, just jumping and grabbing for anything they could to get up above the crowd of people. There's a lot of questions that need to be answered here in South Korea. Why were so many people allowed to pack into a narrow space like this? Where was the crowd control? Some of the images that we've been showing you, they were from an hour or two hours before this deadly incident. Was there nobody shouting the alarm saying, hey, too many people, let's clear them out before something horrible happens. I mean, these are the really tough questions that they're having to ask here. But tonight, as you see, it's all about well, most people who were here last night want nothing to do with this place now. It's empty, aside from a handful of reporters and the police blocking off the area. And of course, those shoes and the pieces of people's Halloween costumes just sitting in trash bags. I guarantee you, a lot of the pieces of costumes there come from people who didn't make it out alive yesterday. WALKER: Just heartbreaking details to think about, you know, these costumes and how recognizable some of the victims may have been, Will.

So we -- well, we started getting emergency alerts on our phones, OK?So one thing that they do here in South Korea is whenever there is some sort of emergency situation, you start getting these text messages. So I'm getting all these messages in Korean. And I called our producer install, a Seoul and I said, this seems like it's a really big deal. They're talking about a human casualty situation. And then I just did a search, quick search on Twitter and YouTube, and the videos that I was seeing showed all these bodies laid out on the ground. So we knew we needed to get out here. Even though we didn't have anything verified, yet. There wasn't a whole lot being reported in the media just yet. When I got here, I saw people in their Halloween costumes in tears on the phone because they had finally gotten through to their loved ones who had been wondering if they were OK. There were a lot of other people in costume, you know, frantically texting, trying to get a hold of friends that they couldn't reach, you know, friends who were missing. And as I mentioned, you've talked about more than 4,000 missing person's cases. There was so much confusion when you had 100,000 people out here, how many parents at home were watching the coverage and hadn't heard yet from their kids, you know. Even if they did turn out to be OK, and maybe they just lost their phone or something or they were in a hospital. But just the fact that people had to worry so much. So you see the area down here with all the all the cameras. This is actually where the alleyway is, where the majority of people died. And you can see a lot of the press cameras. This is also where the mobile command center has been set up. You know, they had 1,700 plus police, firefighters and investigators working out here. So, I think the hardest part for me, as I mentioned was when we saw this line of stretchers when we arrived. And I thought for sure those were stretchers to help treat the injured people. And then we realized that those stretchers were waiting for bodies and then we just started seeing them rolling the bodies out one by one. And it was just, you know, seeing people's costumes and particularly that young woman with that beautiful dress, that beautiful princess dress and it was just with the -- the sparkles and the glitter and I just -- that's when I just really lost it for a second because I just thought about her parents and how beautiful she must have looked and how much fun she had been hoping to have and just how that how that night ended for her and how her family must be feeling.

And so, they basically had to put out an appeal for family members to come and identify bodies.But you can see, you know, you've got police bands, you've got a couple of them here. There's a row of police vans that goes all the way down the block there beyond what I'm not even sure the camera can see.

Georgia's center of the political universe. Yes, I mean, there has been a ton of early voting, about 1.5 million people, including mail and absentee so far. I really think Georgia has switched. You know, the electorate here has heard so much about voting, so much about voter suppression, you know, and, you know, I think, really, we are switching to an electorate that does much of their voting early now. There is this concern about wanting to get their vote counted.

      "sentences": "Yes. We need to have in mind that the market and from the data is -- the market is less competitive. Like while, many buyers have been priced out of the market due to low affordability. There are fewer offers per home. So, this means that sellers may be more willing to negotiate. Furthermore, date shows that sellers are also more willing to reduce prices among recently sold, like, properties that were on the market for more than a month. Sellers had to drop prices by 12 percent on average.And finally, due to the lengthening, like, days on the market. There are more homes available for sale since it's less competitive. Then we also have to have in mind that mortgage rates at seven percent may be the new normal. And actually, younger baby-boomers may remember the seven percent rate back in the mid to late 1990s and the early 2000s when they were in the 30s and 40s and they were buying homes. But, back then, inflation was about like two percent that current buyers also need to deal with elevated inflation.",

And arguably the two candidates have already left an indelible mark on Brazil's history. And yet so many people here consider this one of the most important elections of their lives. You're talking about Jair Bolsonaro. He is the incumbent here. Trying to be re-elected. He has been called many times the Trump of the tropics. He's taken a page from American conservatism. Boris, you were right, this is eerily familiar to the culture wars that are going on now in the United States.And then you have Lula da Silva on the other side. A former president who really tried to bring Brazil economically and socially into this century. He has gone through immense scandals, he was imprisoned, he is now out of prison and here for re-election. That's a little bit of a setup. But let me show you what's going on here. So, we're in front of a school, polls open just in the last hour. As you can see here, this has really gone on with great efficiency. There was a lineup in the morning, but now people are coming out fairly quickly. Important to point out here, that it is electronic balloting only. There is no paper backup here. That has been a controversy. The president already, Jair Bolsonaro, saying he looks that, like, he thinks that may be a problem. But at the same time saying he will accept the outcome. Look, guys, this is going to be a tight race. The polls are not showing definitively. So, it won't be a long night. We have should have results in the evening, again, a lot on the line here in Brazil.",
