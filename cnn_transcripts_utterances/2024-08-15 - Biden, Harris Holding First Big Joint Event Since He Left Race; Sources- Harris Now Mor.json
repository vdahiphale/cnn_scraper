Discussing his secret work, preparing for a second Trump term, and saying the former president is, quote, very supportive.Plus, President Biden and Vice President Harris will share a stage for the first time since she replaced him on the Democratic ticket. We'll look at their relationship headed into the Democratic convention. And did Donald Trump just admit defeat in the GOP's 15-year war on Obamacare? You're going to want to hear what he said yesterday about keeping the Affordable Care Act in place. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. It's been three and a half weeks since President Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Harris. Instead, in that time, she's rallied her party behind her and is closing the gap with Donald Trump in key battleground states. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, Harris actually holds a one-point lead. It is statistically insignificant, but it's a big change. Joe Biden did not lead in our polling average all year. Later today, Biden and Harris will appear for their first big event together since the switch up, and they're going to tout their work lowering prescription drug costs for seniors. MJ Lee is in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, waiting for them to take the stage. MJ, you have some terrific new reporting on what is going on behind the scenes between the two of them and their camps as we wait for this -- this event to take place.",

Of course, President Biden and Vice President Harris have spent a good amount of time together since the president dropped out three and a half weeks ago. But this is going to be the first time that we see the two of them on stage together at an official event, both of them giving remarks. And the topic of this event actually tells us quite a lot about the state of the election.You know they are going to be talking about the Biden administration's work so far on trying to lower the cost of prescription drugs. This is an idea that is broadly popular across the country, particularly among older and more senior voters, a group that President Biden has actually tended to do quite well with. And for Vice President Harris. Keep in mind, she is quickly learning a bit of a tricky juggling act, especially when it comes to the economy. You know, she is, of course, the number two in the Biden, Harris administration. She has to take responsibility for the different policies of that administration. But at the same time, now that she's a presidential candidate, we are going to see her sort of pick and choose and navigate the policies that are going to help her, tell a compelling economic story. Because the reality is that when it comes to the economy more broadly, President Biden has not gotten the high remarks. And so, there is going to be some sort of separation and distinction that we see the vice president try to show when it comes to the economy. As she is preparing to run against Donald Trump, because this is going to be one of the most challenging and important topics for her to navigate while heading into November. Dana?",

Why take a risk by coming out and saying something controversial, or any of that kind of stuff?I think they hit the point of diminishing returns on that. And now the Biden administration, you know, to Laura's point has to like very careful. You can't blindside the person that you're trying to pass the baton to here. And so, how you socialize this stuff? How you communicate this stuff, so that Harris is capable of explaining the policy of the administration that she is supposed to be defending.

It's supposed to work this way, that it's the president and his aides who make the policy, the plans, the strategy, and then they say, oh, by the way, VP office, this is what we're doing.And now, it should be on its head if they want to win, or at least be much more inclusive to want to put back up what I refer to at the top of the show, which is CNN's poll of polls. Harris 50 percent, Trump 49 percent. Leigh Ann? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST \"EARLY BRIEF\" NEWSLETTER: I mean, there has been a market shift in the polling since President Biden dropped out, not only in national polling, but also in swing state polling as well. And so, this is exactly why Democrats were worried about President Biden after the debate, because the polling had shown that he was so far behind, you know, by Donald Trump. Donald Trump or President Biden had not been behind in a poll in 2020 throughout that campaign. He had not been ahead in a poll in this cycle. So now we're starting to see the Kamala Harris bump, and it's going to be dependent on her, if this honeymoon continues and she's able to continue this trend.",

And that is still a pocket of voters that he does pretty well with compared to her, at least, that was sort of the dynamic in the three weeks since we've seen the shift. So, it makes sense to be with him, to try to get his blessing and his help with the voters who like him and support him.BARRON-LOPEZ: Yeah. That's right. Because out of all of the different voting blocks that they were -- that make up the coalition that they were trying to build, seniors were one of the few of them that were sticking with Biden this year. Even as he was losing, you know, voters in different segments of the Democratic coalition. Be it young voters, be it you know, Latino men and black men at the margins. And we're seeing that Harris is starting to gain back more of the Democratic base, the traditional elements of it. And so, of course, to be next to Biden, this is the one time she may want to appear alongside him. She may not want to be alongside the president very much throughout the rest between now and November. But when it's talking to seniors, that's an area he's done really well in the battleground states.",

And Vought explained, he's creating so called shadow agencies, getting regulations, memos and executive orders ready for action on the first day of a Trump presidency. He also believes in expanding presidential powers, and that the president has the authority to use the military to maintain law and order.

He wouldn't go in and say, I have no influence whatsoever with Donald Trump, and he's not going to do anything I'm going to do, right, because he is trying to sell your impact and your access.That said, I think he's telling the truth, you know. I mean, it's the idea that Project 2025, and the Heritage Foundation and all those guys aren't closely tied to Trump world was just sort of ridiculous. I mean, Russ Vought might as -- well been receiving his mail at Mar-a- Lago. And so, they threw -- you know, Trump realized that this was becoming bad optics for him. And they threw the Heritage Foundation and Russ Vought and Project 2025 under the bus so hard. They'll get a stuffed toy as a prize. But it doesn't change the fact. So, I think politically this helps Democrats, just insofar as it makes the denial seem less plausible and that's about it. BARRON-LOPEZ: The denials aren't really credible because of the fact that Donald Trump talks about a lot of these policies on the stump. He talks about abolishing the Education Department. He talks about, you know, giving no funding to schools with vaccine mandates. He recently said that he was open to banning medication abortion, the mailing of it, reversing the FDA approval. That's all in Project 2025, so is mask deportations. Russ Vought worked in the first Trump administration. Is likely on a short list to work in a second one, as our lot of the authors of Project 2025. They all expect to staff a second Trump term.
