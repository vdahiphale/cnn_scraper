And Azerbaijan launches an operation against Armenian forces in a disputed region. How it's raising fears of an all out conflict. We begin with the United Nations General Assembly, where Russia's invasion of Ukraine will be the focus of a meeting of world leaders later today. The war dominated the opening session, with U.S. President Joe Biden urging world leaders to remain steadfast in their support of Ukraine. He said Russia alone bears responsibility for the war, and Russia alone is standing in the way of peace. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I ask you this. If we abandon the core principles of the United States to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they are protected? If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure? I'd respectfully suggest the answer is no. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

General Assembly, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ripping into the Russians, accusing Moscow of destabilizing the entire world through the Kremlin's war against Ukraine. Now, Zelenskyy said that Russia's actions were essentially weaponizing hunger by bombing Ukraine's grain ports, also weaponizing energy as well by occupying the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, and even weaponizing children through all of the Ukrainian children who have been brought to Russia. Now, of course, the Kremlin has consistently denied any of the allegations put forward by the Ukrainians, but Zelenskyy said that none of the global problems that are pressing in the world, like for instance climate change, he believes can be solved unless there's peace in Ukraine.",

But with this government shutdown in the United States potentially about to happen. That is a direct concern as to whether this funding will go through and clearly for President Zelenskyy that is very alarming indeed.Now it's worth noting that a lot of the military aid that Ukraine is receiving from the U.S. is from the Pentagon's own stockpile so that might not necessarily be impacted by a U.S. government shutdown and as well the funding as well comes from the presidential drawdown authority. So again, not necessarily directly impacted, but what could be impacted, and the Pentagon spokesperson Chris Sherwood warned about this just yesterday, is the delivery of that equipment and the training of people on the ground to use that equipment. Both of those could be affected if the government shuts down because not only will personnel be on furlough, so people to train, for example, the Ukrainian pilots on how to use these F-16 fighter jets, but also there could be a potential lack of basically any kind of equipment to deliver them to Ukraine, because a lot of this activity from the Department of Defense is not deemed critical to national security when the government is in shutdown. Now, the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, could make an exception for this and continue some of this activity, but clearly a very big concern for Zelenskyy and for Ukraine as this counteroffensive enters some very difficult months further ahead. And particularly as we head into winter, Russia could fortify its defenses quite a lot if this counteroffensive slows down. That is particularly alarming as well. And clearly, from the Biden administration, there is political will. We saw this yesterday with President Joe Biden's speech at the U.N. Clearly, there is a lot of will from his administration for Ukraine. It remains to be seen what the other side of the House feels about it. And we've also seen just in the last day, there has been some material support from European allies. We've seen from Denmark. We've seen from Norway some promises of new aid as well, such as ammunition, such as tanks, but clearly the U.S. support is the most important to President Zelenskyy. And if there is any disruption to that in the coming months as we head into winter, that could be very disruptive to the counteroffensive as well.",

And they also went on to talk about how Canada has been sheltering terrorists and extremists. And this is a long-standing issue, Anna, between India and Canada. It's nothing new. The Indian Prime Minister has been taking up this issue with Trudeau very often, the issue of Khalistan. I want our viewers to get an understanding of what the Khalistan movement is, why the Prime Minister has been urging Trudeau to understand what this could mean for India because there's been a dark past with separatist leaders, especially in the state of Punjab in India where the Khalistani movement was at its peak in the 1970s and 80s. Here's more on the Khalistan movement. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SUD (voice-over): Ever since this meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of the G20 summit in New Delhi, tensions between the two nations have escalated even further.

SUD (voice-over): For decades separatists have demanded an independent Sikh homeland known as Khalistan to be carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. The Sikh fundamentalist movement launched a violent insurgency in the 1970s. After massive crackdowns and the deaths of thousands of Sikhs, the government banned the movement. Decades later, the most vocal supporters are still among the Indian diaspora. One of them was Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Sikh leader and Canadian citizen who was gunned down outside a temple he led in British Columbia in June. In a stunning accusation, the Canadian Prime Minister now says there's credible allegations linking New Delhi to Nijjar's murder, a claim that the Indian government has strongly denied, saying such unsubstantiated allegations seek to shift the focus from Khalistani terrorists and extremists who have been provided shelter in Canada and continue to threaten India's sovereignty.

Democracies don't act like this. The reality is India has been veering closer and closer to an autocracy for a while now, especially under the BJP government of Modi. On the other hand, there's another set of reaction. That's from Sikh Canadians. The Sikh diaspora in Canada is one of the largest outside of Punjab. And for Sikh Canadians, they've believed since June that the killing of Hardeep Singh Najjir was at the hands of the Indian government. But what did surprise the community is the strength in which Prime Minister Trudeau came out with the unequivocal terms he used, the language he used, and the unanimous support of the opposition parties.
