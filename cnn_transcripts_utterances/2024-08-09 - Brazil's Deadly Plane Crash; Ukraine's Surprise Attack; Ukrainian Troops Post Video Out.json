Ukrainian troops appear to have captured an important natural gas hub in Russia's Kursk region. And Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer surrounded by misconceptions about her gender, wins gold at the Paris Olympics. All that and much more coming up. We begin with that deadly plane crash in Brazil. All 61 people on board that plane are believed dead after it went down in a residential neighborhood on the outskirts of Sao Paulo. Witnesses say the video showing -- filmed video of the plane's rapid descent seconds before it crashed. Flight tracking data says the plane dropped some 17,000 feet in just one minute. It's still not known what went wrong with a regional turboprop which had taken off from the town of Cascavel, heading towards the capital. But officials say they have now recovered the plane's black box. Brazil Air Force team is in charge of that investigation. And the death call -- death toll could have been high if it weren't for the fact that many people who wanted to board the plane went to the wrong gate and missed the flight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  It's such a big emotion. You don't know. I'm here shaking my legs are here. Only God and I were aware of this moment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  At 9:40, the stop was closed. The flight was leaving a Voepass. I was working at the Toledo Regional Hospital. I'm group 10. When I got here, I waited. I argued with the airport worker, and that was it. He saved my life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Richard, I know you've been looking at the video, the footage, and of course that flight data,which showed the plane losing altitude a minute and a half before crashing. Considering all of that, what do you think may have taken place here? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  We don't know, but that's not very helpful any more than any speculation as what you can see. The core point to notice what you can see when the plane is coming out of the sky is that there is no forward motion. There's no forward movement at all. It is in a spiral spin down. It is in a flat spin. And something -- and forget the -- I mean, the 90 seconds is the horrificness for those that were on board and the -- what there was some -- I can't even bring my mind to think about it. But what took place before it? Was it an accrual of ice on the wings? We know there was high altitude, freezing conditions. And therefore, between flight levels 12,000 and 21,000 there was a -- that could -- that have been it? What could have failed by way of structure of the aircraft? How did the pilots respond at any given moment? So, the last 90 seconds, in a sense, was the non-recoverable stall. By that point, the plane is in extremis. There is nothing really more the pilots can do. It's horrific to say, and it's even worse to watch, but they probably -- that upward is over (ph). Go back 90 seconds beyond, and now you're starting to say, was it ice? Was it the de-icing equipment? Was it the anti-icing equipment? Was it the feathering of the propellers? Unlikely, because of the forward movement. Something caused the plane to lose altitude. As it did so, it goes into a stall. It then goes back up again, but that's just, if you will, because of the -- either the inputs or increased speed. The black box will tell everything, Lynda. Absolutely everything. Those black boxes will reveal.",

We'll find out in a matter of hours if Brazil's investigative authorities have the necessary technology. My guess is they probably do, but I don't know. If they don't. The boxes will be sent to the U.S., Canada or somewhere else where they will be opened and read. If they do, they will do it themselves. And almost immediately -- they may not tell us, Lynda, but almost immediately, they will have a very good idea of what happened because the box will show, number one, what the pilots said to each other as it was happening.

      "sentences": "Well, and the video is very, very helpful because there are some hallmarks of an aerodynamic stall. So,an aerodynamic stall is when the wind, the air flowing over the wings is not sufficient to -- literally to keep the plane in the air, since that's how it goes. And this happens when you lose forward momentum or something else happens. And so, this plane, I -- you know, I've worked on other, you know, accidents in Brazil or other accidents related to this aircraft, and there have been about 18 of them, which is not alarming because there are hundreds of these planes, but they do have a few things in common. Some of the prior accidents did concern weather and that aerodynamic stall caused by, as Richard mentioned, icing, problems with the weather that interrupted the flow of the air over the wings and ice does that, because this isn't like a sheet of ice that you ice skate on. This ice is like lace. It's like a very porous and it catches the wind and it really destroys your lift. And then, another accident recently, and this was in Nepal back in January 2023, was the situation where the pilots -- actually, it was the second pilot, it was the co-pilot who, instead of putting the flaps on as they were coming into land -- and they were kind of in the same place that this plane was, they were coming into land, they were getting ready to set up to get -- you know, get the down on the runway. Instead of on -- being on -- putting on the flaps, the switch next to the flaps was the prop feathering. It changes the positioning of the props and they lost forward motion. So, there have been a couple of similar accidents that have the hallmarks of this one and certainly, that plane falling from the sky looks like those. When you stall, that's what happens. You fall like a leaf out of the sky.",

And at 17,000 feet, it was below freezing up there. And in many of the areas here, because of the cloud cover through here and even some strata form rain, just -- not thunderstorms, just rain, at that altitude, the relative humidity was over 100 percent. That can cause icing. In fact, even up here, there was a severe icing alert, maybe not quite where the plane flew through, could have been very close, but the thing is, if there's severe here, even if it's moderate here, that plane was in something and it possibly didn't even know that it was, but that was a segment that did come out of Brazil. So, there's the plane as it took off. It did take off toward Sao Paolo. The airport here on the -- just the east side of town, but as it was up to the north of Sao Paulo, probably making its -- on its way down leg here, and it just didn't make it to Sao Paulo, Brazil, because the plane literally came straight down. The relative humidity up in the atmosphere was 100 percent. The temperatures are below freezing. You have to think. That happens all the time. It just depends on what altitude. In the summer that altitude is higher. In the winter, that altitude is lower, and here we are now into parts of Brazil where it is obviously their winter. Lynda.",

Now, let me break this down for you. You mentioned the Lipetsk attack by drones, that is something we've seen quite familiarly over the past months. Ukraine using longer-range drones to hit Russian military infrastructure. And last night was no exception. They claim 700 guided bombs, a key Russian weapon on the battlefield, hit when they struck an ammunition depot with a drone. That's one attack, very far inside Russia. Separately, we've now had, since Tuesday, a ground incursion towards a town called Suzdal. You saw the images there, near the gas harbor. A key strategic thing, potentially infrastructure, that enables Russia to get gas from its pipelines through Ukraine. That's still happening, even in a time of war to Europe. They seem to have one of the key buildings in control. That video is important, because for days, Ukraine has kind of been quiet about what's going on. They have not officially claimed this. This is not an official statement that it's the Ukrainian military doing it, but it's close enough to it, frankly, you can see them there in their uniforms and weapons. And that makes it utterly clear what people have been saying for days now, that we're seeing the first Ukrainian regular army in invasion, incursion into Russia. And it seems to be more significant than Suzdal as well. There are reports from military bloggers. It's so hard to work out where Ukraine is. They're using surprise as one of their main tactics, suggesting that all points of the compass around Suzdal. They're in fact advancing further, potentially five or 10 kilometers in some direction. You played the video there of a damaged military convoy, that's deeper inside Russia. Seems to have been hit by drones or artillery or missiles. Significant damage there to a large number of personnel and ammunition. So, a bloody scene, certainly, and a reminder of how successful this Ukrainian surprise attack has been. Lynda.",

The prime minister says there haven't been any reports of major damage. The White House says the U.S. has shared information with Austrian authorities to help foil that suspected terrorist plot targeting Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna. A total of four people have now been arrested in connection with the alleged plot, including an Iraqi teenager. Swift canceled three nights of performances as news of that threat emerged. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, are set to hold a campaign rally a couple of hours from now in the battleground State of Arizona.

We have this disturbing video which shows a huge plume of black smoke coming from the crash site. It happened in a residential area just hours ago. Local officials say no one on the ground was killed, but all on board perished. Several bystanders captured the aftermath and videos now on social media.

It's the hub of all activity. That crash happened only about eight minutes before it was set to touch down. And that area, that residential area is about drive from Sao Paulo, but it is a small-town neighborhood. It's densely populated. We actually spoke to -- actually, you just spoke also with someone who filmed one of these videos and the description of that is just this is a neighborhood. You know, your neighbors. She was filming this video and also fearing for her life and also for her neighbors, right? We also have heard from authorities that they are right now in sweeping that entire area. I want to highlight something, Lynda. I think it is a miracle that nobody on the ground was killed in this incident. You know, I spoke and I tried to confirm that with various different authorities. I couldn't believe it at first, but it seems that people just took shelter, as your guest described earlier, just under the table, just going down like we've seen in the movies. It is quite unbelievable that this happened. We are now seeing that the State of Sao Paulo has declared a three-day long mourning period across the state. There is a cabinet that was set up, an emergency cabinet along with national authorities to kind of get a sense of how is it that this happened. That video that shows the airplane spiraling down.

U.N. estimates that more than 60,000 Palestinians have been displaced as the Israeli military pushes ahead with a new operation in Khan Younis. Well, Israel also reportedly carrying out a new attack in Lebanon today. Lebanese state media say a drone strike killed a Hamas official in the Port City of Saigon. Clarissa Ward is following the developments and joins us now from Tel Aviv. Good to have you with us, Clarissa. So, I want to ask you about what we're hearing about potential ceasefire talks that are set to resume, we believe August 15. These talks, of course, came to a halt when the assassination of the Hamas political leader took place in Tehran. What are the expectations for these talks that are set to take place in six days?",

      "sentences": "Well, there are very high hopes being pinned on these talks, and there is a lot of rhetoriccoming particularly from the White House, Lynda, saying that they feel that they're closer than ever to a ceasefire agreement. However, there are still some real question marks and a lot of acres between the two sides. We don't even know if Hamas yet has committed to actually attend these talks. We have heard, though, an interesting statement just recently, Lynda, from the Iranian permanent mission to the U.N. when asked directly about whether Iran would consider delaying or even cancelling a retaliation for the assassination of Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh, which took place last week in Tehran. The representative said, our priority is to establish a lasting ceasefire in Gaza. Any agreement accepted by Hamas will also be recognized by us. He goes on to say, we have the right to legitimate self- defense. And that's a matter totally unrelated to the Gaza ceasefire. However, we hope that our response will be timed and conducted in a matter -- in a manner not to the detriment of the potential ceasefire. I think, Lynda, that's really the closest clue that we have had directly from Iran, giving rise to the hope that Iran would be willing to avert any kind of a retaliation until this next wave of ceasefire talks takes place. At the same time, though, they're obviously giving themselves the wiggle room if those talks don't bear fruit soon to revert to what they call their right to self-defense. Lynda.",

      "sentences": "So, it's interesting because there has been so much speculation and very little clarity. Unlike in April, where Iran really sort of telegraphedwhat it was going to do hours in advance. You know, Israeli forces and their allies had a chance to kind of get everything set and ready to intercept the vast majority of those more than 300 projectiles that were fired towards Israel. In this instance, nobody seems to know what to expect exactly. Would it be a unilateral strike from Iran? Would Iran act in conjunction with the so- called Axis of Resistance, the number of proxies in the region that are aligned with Iran? The speculation right now, though, from Israeli officials, Lynda, is that Iran is not the main concern right now. The main concern is Hezbollah. And Hezbollah has indicated that they would be willing to act unilaterally to strike without Iran and not in sync with Iran. Obviously, you mentioned as well, Lynda, we had that strike, that drone strike that Israel is claiming responsibility for in Southern Lebanon, in the city of Sidon, which targeted a senior Hamas commander, not a Hezbollah commander. But all of that still just ratcheting tensions up and adding to a very tricky atmosphere where many fear that it is almost inevitable that we will see some kind of an escalation in the coming days.

The volatility sparked by concerns about a slowing U.S. economy, tech stock valuations, and market implications from a sharp rise in the value of the Japanese yen.

You can have real time conversations. It will even laugh if you crack a joke. And OpenAI is saying in a new safety report that it's now concerned the tool is so realistic that humans might become over reliant or emotionally dependent on it. I want to read to you just a portion of that safety report. OpenAI says, users might form social relationships with the A.I., reducing their need for human interaction. Potentially benefiting lonely individuals, but possibly affecting healthy relationships. Essentially what they're saying there is that people might pull back from their human relationships in order to spend more time with ChatGPT. And while this might sound sort of like science fiction, it's already happening with older versions of the technology. I spoke with a college student, Lisa Li last month, who told me that she considers ChatGPT to be her boyfriend. Here's how she described that relationship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Khelif made headlines earlier in the games after facing online scrutiny and misinformation over her gender. The IOC responded by saying she was born female and is a woman. And to some breaking news now, and I'm not talking about the kind we normally bring you on CNN, when I say breaking, I mean the dance form, which has made its debut at the Olympics. For the first time in history, breaking traces its roots back to 1970s New York. And Friday was the women's event with Japan taking gold. Our Patrick Snell is following all the action for us, popping and locking on a Friday. Good to have you with us, Patrick. So, let's start with Imane Khelif. Obviously, the center of a lot of abuse really online over the last couple of weeks, questioning her gender. She was of course born female. She has always competed as a woman in boxing.

The Spanish claiming gold after a thrilling 5-3 extra time victory against Les Bleus at the famed Parc des Princes, that's where Paris (INAUDIBLE) play their domestic and Champions League fixes.
