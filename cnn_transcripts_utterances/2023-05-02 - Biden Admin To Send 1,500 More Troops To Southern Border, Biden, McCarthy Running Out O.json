I'm Jake Tapper.And we start today with, not one, but two -- two looming crises, potentially just days away, which could have serious consequences for the United States. The first crisis has to do with your wallet and an ongoing fight between Republicans and Democrats over the national debt. If they cannot make a deal, the Treasury Secretary Jessica Yellen is warning the U.S. government could run out of money to pay its bills -- bill bills for past spending, not future spending, and U.S. government could run out of that money in less than a month. Economists are warning that that default would lead to a likely recession, massive job losses, plummeting retirement accounts, and risks to Social Security and Medicare. Then there is, of course, the second looming crisis. That's at the southern border, where the Biden administration is now planning to send an additional 1,500 active duty troops to help border officials prepare for a massive surge of migrants next week. Next week is when a strict border policy known as Title 42 expires. Title 42 allow the U.S. government, under Trump and then under Biden, to quickly expel some migrants using COVID as an excuse. But it's about to expire, and now tens of thousands of people are currently camping out and waiting it out in northern Mexico, waiting to cross the border. On the U.S. side of the border, many cities and towns already are overwhelmed with migrants and humanitarian needs, leading those cities and towns to declare states of emergency, begging for more resources, now and ahead of next week's deadline. Now, if you're out there thinking, hey, I feel like I follow the news and we've known that these deadlines were coming for months, if not years. You're right. And if you're thinking, you know, our elected representatives -- they could have made some deals to fix this at anytime. You are also right.

Now, they believe that some degree, over the course of time,particularly as long standing pre-Title 42 protocols, sort of kick into gear, they will be able to maintain control of things. But you just can tell by the resources that this is more widespread than just the U.S. troops. They will be joining the National Guard troops that are already down there, that they understand what's coming, and you can see the flow by the thousands of started to increase and uptick.

McCarthy wants to put this on the House floor the week of May 11th, coinciding with the end of Title 42. It's expected that it will pass the House. The question will be, will it pass the United States Senate? That is highly, highly unlikely. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has no plans to bring it up with the Democratic-led Senate.

Michael Luttig, who warned the justices in a letter, quoteThat letter submitted as part of a Senate hearing today on the Supreme Court ethics, or lack thereof, and coming amid a cascade of reports on possible ethical violations from some of the justices. And those are just the ones we know about. Joining us now, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He is a Judiciary Subcommittee chairman, and co-led today's hearing. Senator Whitehouse, it's always good to see you. So, I have to say, I know there's a lot of criticism of Justice Thomas. Some criticism of Justice Roberts. But all nine justices, all nine of them seem to be on the same page that they do not need increased oversight, including the three liberal justices. You can't even get them to accuse on -- them to align with you on the issue, on the idea of oversight, what's the next step? SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI):  Well, first of all, let's not be so sure about that, because Justice Kagan has said publicly that the court has tried to put an ethics code for itself together in the past and it hasn't succeeded yet. So I think it's a bit much to say that none of the nine justices wanted. They just haven't sorted out yet. The second point is that I think the other judges are really getting quite fed up with the Supreme Court justice's behavior, because they do have to live under ethics codes and ethics processes that they know would not permit the kind of behavior that the Supreme Court has both engaged in and is trying to justify. There's also going to be pressure from within the rest of the federal judiciary to clean up this mess. And if push comes to shove, we've got legislation.",
