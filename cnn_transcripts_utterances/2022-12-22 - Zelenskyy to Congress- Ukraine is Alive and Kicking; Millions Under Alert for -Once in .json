He said, not a single word was uttered, warning Mr. Zelenskyy against barbaric shelling of residential buildings in Donbas settlements, there were no real calls for peace, and he continues to say the U.S. continues to fight a de facto and indirectly fighting with Russia until the last Ukrainian. Others does it like Russia has considerably taken and they believe they are in a battle not just with Ukraine but with the collective West and, of course, with NATO. And I think interesting that Russia should be criticizing Ukraine for the moves of peace because it is clear they are also not making any moves the fees. In fact, in a big speech in Moscow on Wednesday President Putin not only painted a picture of Russia as under seized by what he sees an expense of NATO, but announced major military expansion, expanding the army by about 30 percent the size of it a new military district over the country's northwestern border where NATO is of course set to expand and beefing up the nuclear arsenal and improving its readiness things like that. Big picture what this means is there is no real and insight in this conflict, both sides pulling out all the stops to retool their forces. Russia may be calculating the longer this goes, on the more the western resolve what, it is clear that one of the purpose of Zelenskyy's trip was to do everything he can to guide against that.",

It is not just the snow component for areas of the Midwest and the central portion of the country, you also have rain and ice and freezing rain to contend with across areas of the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. In turn, you are likely going to have some additional delays and additional cancellations at basically any of these airports you see here, as they occur that dangerous conditions.Another thing as well is the cold, this is a very wide spread. Again, this is not just for the high plains or the Upper Midwest like we are used to see. This cold air is spreading all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico and as far east into areas of New York, and Virginia but in the Midwest, in areas of the High Plains, these wind chills are bitter, absolutely frigid. Looking at Billings, the wind chill today, minus 50. We do see things warming back up to at least minus four by the time we get to Saturday, but today is going to be the peak for billings. For Denver, the peak is tomorrow. So as cold as today is, it's still going to get even colder as we go to the next 24 hours. Places like St. Louis, Nashville, Charleston, yours is also going to be delayed about another day or two. You have to wait for that cold air to begin to shift. Keep in mind, when you are talking wind chills of minus 35, frostbite can set in just ten minutes. When you start to get above that minus 45 threshold, now frostbite can sudden in just five minutes. So please do not plan to spend any excessive time outside, and bring your pets inside during this timeframe. One thing to note is that a lot of people are noticing the temperature dropping rapidly, take a look at this going from 43 down to ten degrees. This is in Cheyenne, Wyoming. They did that drop in just ten minutes, Denver having a similar spread of about 30 degrees in a very short period of time, so again you are looking at a lot of these temperatures going down but it is also the snow. Here's a look at where it, is we are seeing that transition from Minnesota over into Wisconsin, areas of Iowa, Kansas, also looking into the snow. That is going to continue to spread off to the east. Let us what you have all these winter weather alerts. Some including blizzard warnings where we do anticipate that that visibility is going to get below a quarter of a mile, and winds at least 30 to 35 miles per hour for a prolonged period of time. Overall, all of this white area you see here, likely to pick up about 2 to 4 inches. Then you start to get into the purple color, you talk about four, six even eight inches of snow. But some of these areas, especially along the great lakes where you will get some of that lake effect enhancement, a foot of snow is not out of the question, which with a lot of these systems. So, again, Christine, a lot to talk, about unfortunately not the greatest timing in terms of folks going out and traveling today as well.",

Some in the crowd provide commentary saying they are tired of the long waits and that U.S. immigration authorities are watching it all happen. I am in Brownsville, Texas, the river is right behind me. Our drone camera is capturing a similar scene, a large group of migrants on the Mexican side, a large law enforcement presence on the U.S. side, and our cameras were rolling as a group of migrants including a child crossed into the United States and turned themselves into authorities all of this contributing to what one law enforcement says is up to 1,200 migrants turning themselves in to border authorities every day in this part of south Texas. Border patrol is dropping off hundreds of them in respite center say advocates, most of them shovel out the same day, but local shelters are starting to see an uptick of migrants who can't afford to.
