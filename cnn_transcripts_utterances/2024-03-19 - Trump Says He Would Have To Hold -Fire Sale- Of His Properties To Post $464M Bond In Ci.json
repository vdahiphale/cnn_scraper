Donald Trump and team are starting to realize how high that price, who could truly be? First, literally, in his New York civil fraud case, where the former president now claims he would have to hold a fire sale of his most popular properties unless the court grants him a delay in paying the massive penalty he owes the Empire State. That penalty for his fraud, you may recall, exceeds $450 million ordered by a judge after it was proven in court that Trump and his company lied to lenders about the value of his property. If Trump cannot find a company to help with his bond in New York attorney general has already hinted she will seize Trump properties and begin to sell them off. And then in terms of paying the piper, there is this stark new reality for former Trump White House aide Peter Navarro. Navarro reporting to prison today in Miami, becoming the first former White House official in history to be imprisoned specifically for a contempt of Congress conviction. He, of course, refused to testify in the House Select Committee's investigation into January 6. Let's bring in CNN senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz. And, Katelyn, let's start with the massive financial penalty Trump's facing in New York. Is there a real possibility that Letitia James or he will have to sell off his properties?",

There's still awesome time before the deadline comes when that judgment would settle and Trump would either have to post the bonds so he could continue to appeal or his properties could be seized from the attorney general in New York or by the attorney general in New York.But right now, Donald Trump is yet again at the appeals court, and that is why he's talking about his inability to get any insurer to underwrite his bond of $464 million, nearly half $1 billion. He says that's because none of these companies will give a bond of more than $100 million and that, you know, it's one of those things where he cant post real estate. So if you really want wanted to have the collateral to secure the bonds so he could continue appealing what happened in this case, his loss here on these civil fraud accusations, that he would have to be forced to pay off or to sell his assets, all of his real estate empire or large portion of it, and that would be a fire sale where he wouldn't get as much for the properties as he deserved. So that's what he's arguing to the appeals court to try and get more grace out of the court system as this continues on, as he tries to keep the appeals going. But we are going to have to see exactly what he does in order to either post the bond or have the attorney generals office come in and seize things. He just wants the courts to say, let me be. I have the real estate, acknowledged that. Just let me be and allow me to keep appealing this.",

We just wrapped up the warmest winter on record across the U.S. That sent things blooming early. So when you get a frieze, which can still happen this time of year in March. That puts anything that's blooming that's not protected, there you go, are at risk, and it could really cause some frost and freeze damage. So that's kind of the situation that we were in this morning, but the good news is, is a lot of these peach blooms here, you see these petals. The farmer was telling me this morning that these petals can actually protect the peach. So the peaches actually in here is really cool that he was showing me what the inside of this looks like and this is it in its bloom stage. So it can be damaged. But with the petals that really helps protect it. So that's why a lot of these trees were okay this morning. At this time last year, they had blue much farther than this and that's why a lot of their fruit was damaged. Now, the strawberries actually bloomed about a week or two early. So that's why they have those covered. You see all of those white blankets there -- those are called row covers and they literally lay them on top of the strawberries. They're strawberry underneath there. And what it does is it will keep the heat in. It can keep the heat in. It can protect it from frost developing as well. And that was something that they did this morning. For the peach trees -- obviously, it's hard to put a big blanket over this. So what they did this morning was they had fans in the field and what those fans do is get to wind -- winds to kick. And when you have some winds, that helps keeps those temperatures afloat a little bit. They won't drop like rock as quickly as they would with calm winds. So, they had fans going, we have the blankets and thankfully, things are doing okay here today, but we do know that the trend is that winters are getting warmer, the growing season is getting longer by two to four weeks and that puts these plants, these fruits at risk -- Jake.",
