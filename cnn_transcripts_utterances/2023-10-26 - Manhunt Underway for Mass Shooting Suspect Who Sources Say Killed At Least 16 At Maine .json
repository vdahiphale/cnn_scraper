His main two messages are very clear as he repeated it over and over again, which is if you see something suspicious call and that this is still a very active scene in Lisbon.Joining us right now is CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez, CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst and former Deputy Director of the FBI Andy McCabe and CNN Law Enforcement Analyst, former Secret Service Agent Jonathan Wackrow. Andy, very clear from what we just heard is that they at least for the police in Lisbon, that this man is not caught, that he made it -- could not have made it more clear that this is very active and they are seeking help and information from the public. What do you hear? What do you think about this now more than 12 hours in? [09:20:05] ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yeah, you know, I mean it's -- it's -- on the one hand, it's a good sign that they're continuing to try to kind of crowdsource as much intelligence as they possibly can, because they are clearly still searching for investigative leads here. On the other hand, it's -- it's -- it's not a great sign that they still need that kind of assistance. Nevertheless, they're doing they're doing the right thing. They could probably enrich the information they're getting from the public if they shared a few more details about what they know. But we'll see maybe at 10:30, we'll get some more information about that. I think what's important to recognize is that this search is going on right now, at different levels. At the most fundamental level, you have local police, like the Police Chief we just saw, who are responding to calls from -- from citizens who see things. At the next level up, you probably have some contingent of police officers and state police officers who are grid searching particular areas of interest. And then kind of at the last level, you've got your federal partners, who are likely running down intelligence leads on phone numbers and social media accounts and electronic devices and things that could possibly point towards the location of this individual. But all three of those things really have to be going at the same time.",

      "sentences": "Well, they -- yeah, there's a full contingent of federal resources that have now been set up there. We have ATF, the FBI, the Marshal Service, DHS, everybody is now up there. Because this is a very, very big -- potentially big search area. This is a wooded area, it's -- it's a place where people can disappear for weeks and months at a time. And -- and this is a suspect, who has the advantage of several hours, you know, being on the run, probably knows the area very, very well. And so one of the things that we know is going on right now, is that the investigators are trying to figure out, you know, where he has been, what kind of preparation went into this event, whether this person maybe was doing searches of locations where maybe they're trying to hide? Maybe they have a second vehicle. We know that they found one vehicle near that area, where we saw Shimon doing his reporting from that initial search area.But 12 hours later, clearly, he has had some time to move on, how did that happen. And so that's one of the things that the FBI certainly is working on. They've got a couple of SWAT team. SWAT teams there on the scene to help with the main officials. But a lot of the work that Andy is talking about, is some of that intelligence work, you know, they're doing searches of bank records, his electronics to see, you know, again, search history, to see where his phone has been in the last few days, few weeks, again, to get a sense of where we have locations that are good for these resources to be dedicated to. This is a very, very big search area potentially. And the only thing that police can do is to try to narrow that down as much as possible, because otherwise they could be at this for -- for a long time. I actually just want to mention one last thing. You know, for those of us who have covered many, many of these incidents, it's so unusual to have a suspect who carries out not one mass shooting, two locations, but then to get away, right? A lot of times these shooters want to have a confrontation, they seem to lose interest in sort of the -- the shooting aspect, and want to end it somehow, either with themselves or with competition with police. It's very unusual to now have a manhunt at the end of one of these events that we have gotten so accustomed to here in this country, guys.",
