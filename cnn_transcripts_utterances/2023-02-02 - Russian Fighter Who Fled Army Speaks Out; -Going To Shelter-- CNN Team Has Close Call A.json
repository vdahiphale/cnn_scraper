The lack of equipment, training, boiling rapids for food, the atrocities he says were committed by Russian fighters. You won't want to miss this interview.And breaking news, the Pentagon right now is tracking a Chinese spy balloon that's flying over the U.S. President Biden asking for military options. What are the Chinese doing? Plus, FBI agents investigating Congressman George Santos for allegedly scamming a veteran out of thousands of dollars meant for his dying dog. That veteran is OUTFRONT tonight. What did he tell investigators about Santos? And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a Russian officer speaks out right here. Konstantin Yefremov served on the front lines for three months and is now telling all. The former lieutenant is the most senior Russian officer to speak publicly about what he saw ended in Ukraine. You are going to see that interview in just a moment. Yefremov managed to escape Russia in January. But he still speaks with the men he served with, and so I asked him about Ukraine's claims that Russia's mobilized half a million troops and whether any of those troops are properly trained. Here's what he said that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KONSTANTIN YEFREMOV, FORMER RUSSIAN SENIOR LIEUTENANT, FLED MILITARY (through translator):  These people who are coming out, they're not prepared, they have not been trained, and they're not even aware what kind of horror is awaiting them there. This number is just a bubble, because we are talking about just handymen. Not servicemen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He says that they have no choice, other than prison for multiple years. Yefremov, who first spoke to the BBC, shared this video with us. He says that what you're looking at here, which he took with his cell phone on the frontlines, is Russians firing a series of rockets towards Ukrainian positions last year. He tells us that not only did he not know where the artillerymen were shooting, and his job here was to protect them, that's what his unit was doing at the time, he says. He says, the Russians firing those rockets had no idea what they were shooting up. Of course, we know the targets are constantly civilian homes, schools, apartment buildings. Yefremov, in fact, says he wouldn't three instances of Russians torturing Ukrainians. And he has this to say to the Ukrainian people.

He and his team were in the middle of a civilian area. The attack, of course, sending everyone scrambling for shelter, afraid of dying. At least seven people were injured. You are going to see and hear from Fred in a moment about this terribly close call. And for the Ukrainians who are still in the line of fire, nowhere else to go, they're about to be even more of these horrible moments. A spokesman for Putin claiming tonight that Russia is now on the verge of using its, quote, existing potential to the fullest, in order to respond to the weapons that Ukraine is set to receive from the West. Fred Pleitgen is on the ground in Ukraine. And, Fred, we're also glad to see you.

The strikes came as a search and rescue efforts were ongoing in exactly the same neighborhood, after a Russian missile leveled an apartment block on Wednesday night, killing at least three and wounding eight. The Russians seem to be bringing the cities of this region into their war, regardless of the consequences. And Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is saying there is worse to come. Putin spoke Thursday at events commemorating the battle of Stalingrad, where Soviet forces defeated Nazi Germany 80 years ago, openly threatening the U.S. and other countries supporting Ukraine. Clearly, they don't understand that modern war with Russia will be quite different for them, he said. We won't send our tanks to their borders, but we have the means to respond and it won't be with the use of armored vehicles. Cities like Kramatorsk already know that the Kremlin is ready to escalate its war on Ukraine. Largely quiet just weeks ago, they are now in the eye of the storm, as Russian forces seek to grind their way through Donetsk. When the coasts seemed clear, we left Kramatorsk. We are going to get out of here as fast as possible, just in case more missile strikes come. But it certainly seems to us as though the Russians are making Kramatorsk a front line in this war. A grim prospect for the thousands of civilians here and in other towns in eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  You know, Erin, that really is one of the things, is that towns like Kramatorsk really have been fairly safe over the past couple of weeks, the past couple of months, and people were starting to return to Kramatorsk. But now those people, understand they are not safe at anytime of day or any time of night, and they certainly believe and understand that things could get a lot worse, very soon, Erin.",

A lot of those mobilize are starting to come to the front lines and certainly, the Russians and many places are already doing probing offensives, are trying to see and feel out basically how strong the Ukrainians are, if there are any weaknesses in the positions of the Ukrainians.But it certainly seems to us, Erin, that hitting those rear echelon areas, hitting towns like Kramatorsk, but also others in that area as well, is very much also part of Russia's new tactic, possibly Russia's new strategy. We have seen that with missile strikes occurring in some other towns, as well. And it's having a devastating effect on the civilians that remain in those areas. Of course, a lot of them feel extremely unsafe and a lot of them are being hurt and being killed in the process, Erin.",

YEFREMOV (through translator):  Everyone or nearly everyone who's there understands that what's happening is wrong, that it's all very wrong, and they truly do not believe Putin's fables about Ukraine's invasion, and I would like to say that the very fact that they're in trenches, just cause -- their living situation, for many of them, their military service is their means of living, and basically they only have one choice. It's either their family and children and up on the streets, or they have to be in the trenches. And now, after the mobilization, many of them in general, after the mobilization, they cannot resign.

This is enormous. As Oren points out, China has satellites. They're watching the United States all the time. So, what is this thing about -- what China's doing right now? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  So, one of the big things, air, and that China could be doing with this is that they could be scooping up signals intelligence.  In other words, they're looking at our cell phone traffic, radio traffic. They're looking at the governments command to control networks. And as Oren pointed out, we have ballistic missile bases, a series of ballistic missile silos in Montana and in North Dakota and Wyoming. So these are the kind of things that they're looking at. Also, they're probably looking at the strategic bomber base that we have in the Dakotas. So, this is something that gives them a chance to perhaps augment their satellite coverage.
