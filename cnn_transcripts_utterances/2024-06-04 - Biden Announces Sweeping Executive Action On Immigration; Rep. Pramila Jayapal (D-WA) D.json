President Biden's announcement comes today, just weeks before his first debate with his Republican rival. Today's move is President Biden's most aggressive crackdown yet on illegal immigration. It's an issue that has long been one of his biggest political vulnerabilities, and it's also a top concern for voters going into November. And for more on that, let's bring in CNN's Harry Enten.

That ranked, get this, 15th on the list of most important problems, according to the American public. Look at where we are today in May of 2024, 18 percent. My goodness gracious, what a jump from May of 2020, 18 percent of Americans said that immigration or something within that realm is the nation's top problem. That ranks second.

Joe Biden held it within the margin of error, but still a slight lead at plus one point over Donald Trump on the issue of border security and immigration. Take a look now at May of 2024. Look at this movement in Donald Trump's direction. Now he is trusted on the issue of border security and immigration versus Joe Biden by a 27-point margin. That is nearly a 30 point jump. You know, there have been a lot of issues that have been moving in the former president's direction during the course of this campaign. But I can't really find a single issue that has moved more towards Donald Trump versus four years ago than this particular issue. Again, when you're dealing with something that's now one of the nation's top problems, according to the American public, and an issue that's moving very much towards the former president, you can definitely see why the current president, Joe Biden, felt like he needed to act because at this particular point, the issue of border security and immigration is truly hurting Joe Biden's reelection chances.",

So that could be folks who were born in Mexico, could be folks who were born in France. It could basically be anybody outside the United States. But look at this, you might expect this to be a Democratic-leaning group. Uh-uh. Not at least according to an average of our last two polls. What do we see? We see Donald Trump at 47 percent, Joe Biden at 44 percent. Again, that's a close contest. But compare that to four years ago, when Joe Biden had a clear advantage among this group.

She is the chair as well of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Congresswoman, I do want to discuss this hearing with the Attorney General here in just a moment. First, though, I would like to talk to you about this other breaking news we're following, which is the President's executive action on the border. You told CNN earlier, basically, that you - or pardon me, you told the - you told CNN earlier that you were disappointed that the President has sort of gone into the same frame as Donald Trump at a time where you think there should be a distinction between Trump and Joe Biden. Do you see a distinction with this new policy announcement? REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): You know, Brianna, I think it's very complicated, right? Because what the President is doing, and I have been clear with the White House for months, that this is not the right way to go, because, A, it's not going to solve the situation at the border. The only way to do that is to actually create more legal pathways to modernize our immigration system, to make sure we are getting resources for immigration judges and asylum officers and border patrol folks. Those are the kinds of things that would actually make a difference. Just doing enforcement only and shutting down the border, as Donald Trump did, this is the same section of immigration law that Donald Trump used when he shut down the border, is not going to work, because it doesn't get at the root causes of any of why people are coming. And it is deeply disappointing, because we have obligations in both our domestic laws and our international treaty requirements that require us to be able to allow people to seek asylum. And what the President's executive order does is it caps asylum and says you can only seek asylum if you come through the CBP ONE app or if you're a walk-up to the port of entry. And it really takes away that ability for people to seek asylum between ports of entry, which is, again, against our domestic laws and against international treaty obligations. So it's not going to get us more Republicans coming over to our side. As you can see, Republicans are just criticizing the President anyway for everything that he's doing, even though it is Republicans that are blocking the ability for us to have real progress and it is going to alienate our base, who is, frankly, just exhausted by constantly seeing immigrants being put up as a political football and attacked in the way that Donald Trump and extreme mega-Republicans have.",

Obviously, that must be what they're using, because there's no other legislation that we've passed around that.The second most conservative Republican senator drafted a piece of legislation that ended up being bipartisan in the Senate that would have required more resources to go into those kinds of things, and Republicans said no. So the President didn't need to do an executive order to assign more asylum officers. He could have done that on its own without the harsh enforcement of shutting down the border. KEILAR: So I do want to ask you now about the Attorney General's hearing. Merrick Garland told the committee he's worried about the possibility of a terror attack after October 7th.

And the fact that we now have members of Congress, Republican members of Congress, who are trying to say that those people should not be held accountable for what they did for perpetrating this kind of an incursion on our democracy is stunning to me, and it just shows how dangerous a situation we're in and why we need a Department of Justice that is absolutely and thoroughly dedicated to holding everybody accountable. And nobody is above the law, not the former president, if he incites an insurrection, and not the people who charged the Capitol that day in the worst assault on the United States Capitol since the early 1900s.I think we have to be very clear that this is a massive problem, and Republicans are trying to undermine democracy at the most fundamental level.

But it was interesting, the first witness we really heard from was Hunter Biden himself, because the first piece of evidence they introduced was a large portion of the audio version of his memoir, which he personally narrates. They played while I was in court, they played over an hour worth of clips from that book, and Hunter Biden sat there attentively listening to himself tell the story of how he descended into addiction. And they focused specifically on the time between the fall of 2016 to the spring of 2019. Of course, that is around the time when he purchased this firearm at the center of this case. Now, it's unclear if they're going to get to another witness today, because, of course, the defense attorneys will also have a chance to cross-examine this FBI agent.

So usually it's the defendant saying things that they wouldn't want anyone else to hear, right, that directly implicates them in the criminal behavior. Here, this also implicates him in the criminal behavior, but not in the same way. This is a book, of course, that he voluntarily wrote and that he decided to narrate himself as an audio book.So I agree with Paula, It could cut both ways. Of course, it has evidence that the prosecutors want to get in around the timing of the drug use. But there he is in his own words talking about his struggle. And, you know, I think that for the sake of completeness, if the defense wants to put other portions in, if they're relevant at all, the judge will probably let them do so.
