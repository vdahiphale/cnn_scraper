A New York police official say this is a ghost gun, meaning a handmade weapon that could have been 3D printed. It's not the only potential evidence. Police say they found a Mangione today after a McDonald's employee spotted him eating inside the restaurant and called 911.Police say they also found a multi-page document on the suspect. And the source says that document criticized the health insurance industry and included the lines, quote, \"these parasites had it coming,\" end quote. \"I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done,\" end quote. A private memorial is being held today for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to the source. Thompson was on his way to attend his company's annual investor conference when he was shot and murdered last week in New York. Let's go straight to CNN's Danny Freeman, who is live for us outside McDonald's in Altoona, PA, where Mangione was taken into police custody just hours ago. Danny? Do investigators know how he ended up in Altoona?",

Now, they arrested him for charges unrelated to specifically the murder. They arrested him on gun charges, but on his person notably, as you noted, they found that ghost gun, they found that suppressor. They found fake IDs. They also found a manifesto.

You can order these parts to be delivered to, you know, your home and then there are literally YouTube videos that instruct you on how to put it together.Next to it you see the magazine which looks like a 15-shot magazine and this has no serial number, it just comes with the parts. It's not sold the way you would buy a gun in a gun store where you'd have to fill out the forms because the trick of this has always been, well, it's not a gun until it's assembled. Therefore, you know, it doesn't have to go through the process, which is why it's been popular among not just people who like to build things and like guns, but also among criminals, gang members, and in this case, a self-appointed alleged hitman. So you have that, you have the suppressor, also homemade, and probably Jake, probably the reason that the gun malfunctioned three times in a row as he was firing it at his target because the silencer was probably pulling the barrel down. There's usually an adapter that you can use called the Nielsen device which will fix that, which he didn't have. So this is going to be critical because they will fire a bullet through this gun. They will look at the shell casing and compare the strike marks microscopically. They will match that to the shell casings on the scene and see if they were fired from the same gun. They'll do the same with the bullets and the striations if the markers are there. And this may be the proverbial, no pun intended, smoking gun that ties this suspect to the case after that testing. Otherwise, they will rely on the DNA and the fingerprints and presumably if all of these things match, they have a very strong case, but we won't know until those tests are done.",

He's keeping him with himself because he's not going back to the last location.The other thing is, is I'm familiar with Altoona and that area. And I believe from what I've read that he said he was or was a student at Penn State. Well, Altoona is just about 40 minutes from Penn State. And frequently what you find with fugitives like this is after a few days, they start to need help. They start to need a familiar place so they can operate a little bit better and possibly even get some help.

One of the examples that really stood out to me was this Facebook post from UnitedHealth expressing sadness over Thompson's death. It got tens of thousands of emoji reactions and most of them are laughing emojis.I think what we're seeing is this sort of bubbling up of the pent-up anger and frustration that so many Americans feel over the health care and health insurance industries. And we've seen a lot of these stories people sharing of, as you said, being denied health care claims. And that is one of the things that experts say is often the root of people's frustration with their health insurance. There was a study last year that found that a majority of Americans, 58 percent, experienced some problem with their health insurance over the course of a year, often including claim denials and pre- authorization issues. And of that 58 percent, 15 percent of those people experienced actual negative implications for their health. These denials can cause anxiety. They can delay treatment. So I think what we're seeing is this general sense from many Americans who feel like these companies, although I'm sure the companies would sort of quibble with this depiction, but that these companies are prioritizing profit over the people that they're serving, Jake.",

How did police not have his name? And police did not have his name because he just wouldn't have been on that radar beyond this. This was a result of literally thousands of hours of reviewing video by hundreds of cops who pulled those tapes by going block by block, store by store, building by building, camera by camera, until they assembled, you know, all these hours and found that one moment when the mask was down. Before that, the moment in Starbucks, after that, the moment in the taxi. So they have enough images until somebody, a woman in a McDonald's who worked there, said, I think that looks like the guy.

And coming into this country today, it felt like we are arriving into a new and a very different Syria.From the moment that we crossed the Jordanian border and we were met by the rebels from one of the groups, the Free Syrian Army, a moment really that was so surreal for many of us who have watched this conflict very closely, especially with the developments over the past year, where it did seem like Assad had survived that war, that he had gotten away with it all. And arriving in the city, in the capital, you know, comparing it to my previous trips, Jake, where people were very cautious around foreign media, they were very guarded, did not want to say the wrong thing, did not want to speak openly because we were being closely watched and monitored by the Assad regime and people were living this fear of retribution if they spoke to foreign journalists. They could get arrested for that. But coming here today and hearing people speaking so openly and freely about what they think, how they feel is just truly remarkable. So many people are just happy to see this regime gone. There's so much relief. But at the same time there is a great deal of uncertainty and apprehension right now. And what we are also seeing, Jake, is one of the many dark sides of the Assad regime coming to light, the atrocities that were committed by this ruthless regime. You know, many of these atrocities have been documented, but what you have right now is much more is being unearthed as they are going into these prisons, as they're going into these notorious detention facilities where people were being tortured to death and beginning to free prisoners and many are fearing what else they're going to find in these facilities, Jake.",

And that just shows the close relations between Vladimir Putin and Bashar al- Assad and what was the Bashar al-Assad regime.And the two really very important for one another. Remember, in 2015, the Assad regime very much on the back foot back then in the Syrian civil war, losing a lot of ground, especially in the north of the country. And it was then that the Russians came into Syria, expanded an air base near the city of Latakia, and then unleashed their air force on the rebels in Syria. And they were brutally effective. There were obviously a lot of casualties on the ground. But it also allowed for two things. It allowed for the Syrian military to move forward and oust those rebels from large parts of the country, essentially saving the Assad regime, also, of course, with the help of Iran and some of Iran's proxies. But what it also did, Jake, it also instantly made Vladimir Putin one of the most powerful leaders in the Middle Eastern region, definitely a factor in that region. And it allowed Russia to also project power not just into the Middle Eastern region, but all the way into Africa as well with that air base that they were using for longer distance flights. Now, all of that instantly has been called into question. We were on a call today with the Kremlin, where they, first of all, acknowledged that they did not see this coming, that this came as a surprise to them. They said it basically came as a surprise to the entire world, they said. And, of course, now very uncertain what is going to be the future of their air bases as well. They said right now they have to see who the new leaders in Syria are going to be. As of today, the opposition flag flies over the Syrian embassy here in Damascus.

It alleges both men sexually assaulted the then-minor after the MTV Video Music Awards. In a statement, Carter called the allegations heinous. He claimed the woman's attorney is attempting extortion. Carter pressed further, saying that if this had actually happened, the accuser would have, of course, gone to the police, writing, quote, whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree?, unquote. CNN's Kara Scannell breaks down these allegations in the case. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

On Sunday night, it was amended to identify Jay-Z, whose real name is Sean Carter, as that celebrity. The rapper is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl at an after-party following the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000. The woman alleges she was drugged, and according to the lawsuit, at that point, Carter began removing plaintiffs' clothes as she grew more and more disoriented. Then, the lawsuit alleges Jay-Z raped her, while a female identified as celebrity B watched. The lawsuit was brought by plaintiffs' lawyer Tony Buzbee, who has filed 20 lawsuits against Combs. Combs has vigorously denied any wrongdoing. The Texas lawyer said they contacted Jay-Z to try to resolve the matter through mediation before filing the lawsuit. Jay-Z denied the rape allegations, calling them heinous. He said the lawsuit followed an attempt at blackmail and said Buzbee is a deplorable human being. My heart and support goes out to true victims in the world who have to watch how their life story is dressed in costume for profitability by this ambulance chaser in a cheap suit. The musician, who is married to Beyonce, said his heartbreak is having to explain to his children the cruelty and greed of people. Buzbee responded on X saying the alleged victim never demanded a penny from Jay-Z and accused the rapper of trying to bully them into silence. We will let the filing speak for itself and will litigate the facts in court, not in the media, he said. (END VIDEOTAPE) SCANNELL (on camera): So Jake, strong words of denial from Jay-Z's camp tonight. You know, they're saying that if these allegations were true, then there would be some criminal case here instead of the civil lawsuit some 20 years after the alleged assault took place. His lawyer is saying that this is part of a smear campaign. And tonight, his attorney is asking the judge to require the Jane Doe who filed the lawsuit to re-file it using her real name or dismiss the lawsuit saying that what's fair is fair. Jake?",
