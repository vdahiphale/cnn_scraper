But now are signs of there are talks that are moving in a direction that these opponents want.One of them is Congressman Chip Roy. He's one of the 20 who voted over and over again against Kevin McCarthy. He has pushed for a number of process reforms, things to empower rank and file members over the speakership and weaken the leadership of his conference. He says he has had, quote, more productive discussions over the last two hours than he has had over the last several weeks. He said that, you know, he compared this to high school when you are right before an exam. You sometimes you do better work before an exam than you cramming for an exam than you might have done a few weeks earlier. And he said we're getting to a point where we're starting to crystallize what our differences are but there's a little bit more ways to go. Now Jake, this comes at a critical moment. Because we expect this could be the last vote of the day. The House will have to adjourn after this. They need 218 votes to do that. It's still uncertain whether they will get the 218 votes. Republicans believe they will, and if they adjourn, that's when these critical negotiations will take place tonight. There is an effort by McCarthy allies to put together a negotiating group, some key emissaries to Kevin McCarthy. As well as some of those people who are part of that 20-member block opposing Kevin McCarthy. All getting in a room, negotiating, try to see where they are going forward and Roy telling me that he's part of this as well.",

That's not all that unusual because at the end of the roll call on a vote, they normally go after any stragglers that there might have been. But we were watching Ken Buck because he was a McCarthy supporter who said he voted for McCarthy five times but the fifth time is the last time McCarthy could count on his vote. And we wanted to see if there was continued erosion of McCarthy support.Abby Phillip, I don't know what Ken Buck is doing, but he might be just kind of waiting to get the lay of the land before he makes his decision.",

And as Manu just reported, there is a little bit of movement to at least have some -- to have some talks this afternoon. And so, I'm not sure how that will affect his vote, frankly. Maybe he will give it more time. Maybe he might choose to vote present just to show that he wants it to continue to play out, but I think that will be a big factor.",

So, you know, now we're going to have the wait likely until the end of the tally to hear what he actually is going to come out and do here.And you know, I think your point, Abby, is the right one to underscore. These talks that seem to be accelerating. Because, you know, part of why also they haven't been able to adjourn the House today, and we're on the sixth vote instead of, you know, where, you know, McCarthy allies were talking about potentially trying to adjourning right away to continue the conversations. Is because Democrats had taken a hard line and said, no, we're not going to help you adjourn the house, and the rebels weren't going to help with it either. So, if there are productive negotiations and people do feel like they're getting somewhere, it makes it much more realistic that they could get to 218 for an adjournment and actually let Republican start to shake this in a way that, you know, we've clearly -- I don't know how many times we've used the phrase Groundhog Day today.",

The question of course is what happens behind closed doors.Once they do that and once, they start talking about this, if other names emerge. The question that you asked Ken Buck earlier -- which I think is a really good one -- which is can Steve Scalise get to 218? That's not totally clear to all of us yet, of what the alternatives here look like. And you've heard from those who are saying they're voting for McCarthy, but a lot of them have said behind the scenes, you know, they're voting for McCarthy until an alternative emerges.",

And I don't think that a majority of the 20 or so people voting for someone other than Kevin McCarthy on the Republican side are gettable. I can't stop thinking about Lauren Boebert's speech. In which she took on Donald Trump directly on the floor of the House and saying, no, Donald Trump, you should be calling Kevin McCarthy and telling him to drop out because he doesn't have the votes. Remember, Donald Trump created these people. But now they're like the robots in \"Terminator\" becoming self-aware and then taking over. ALYSSA FARAH GRIFFIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I mean, listen, Chip Roy may be gettable, but, the numbers, I see virtually no path to victory for Kevin McCarthy. And the fact that all day they're on the floor, they're walking around and they're not having these conversations, they're not making these negotiations. He hasn't flipped a single vote at this point. So, the fact that he let this drag on to the second day to the 6th loss ballot and now he saying, maybe we'll have a meeting and pull some up. They got to learn how to cut bait. There is no path to victory as far as I can see here. And the one thing that I want to warn, Kevin McCarthy's made massive concessions.

This is something that some conservatives have been floating. It starts to get dicey when he is literally throwing the kitchen sink to try to get the farthest right wing of the conference on board with him. Not a good sign.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: And further weakening whoever speakership. You know, if he gets it, you know, they're talking about selling shares of himself. Essentially selling shares of the speakership and you wonder what moderates will do then. I mean, they're already nervous about some of the concessions that he made around the motion to vacate. So, he keeps on piling stuff on and giving away goodies to this group of 20, then I think you're going to have moderates get a little nervous.",

That, you know, maybe Chip Roy or a few of the others could come back. Maybe they'll have these meetings and pick a few off. But when I listen to these speeches, I have to believe there are at least five hard nos. Now he needs to turn 17 votes. He must turn all 17. I don't see it right now. But Scott Perry sounded like a hard no. Gaetz sounded like a hard no. Lauren Boebert sounded a hard no and there are probably a few others.I mean, so I just don't know how he gets to that number. By the way, if they break, they adjourn, they recess and go to their meetings, some beat-down sessions. We'll see how many people that moves. But is it going to move 17? I kind of doubt it.",

I got my big staff. I've got my national profiler, I'm going to wait for a better time to do it. Same with the Scalise.
