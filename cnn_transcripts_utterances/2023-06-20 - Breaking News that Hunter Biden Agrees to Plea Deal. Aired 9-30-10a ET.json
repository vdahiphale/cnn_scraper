The criminal part of this investigation by the Justice Department that Hunter Biden is going to plead to these two tax charges and, of course, you know, as far as the gun charge, if he completes all the diversion -- all of the things that he's supposed to do, that goes away. But, as you guys know, this is probably only the beginning for House Republicans who are now going to want to see everything that the Justice Department did. One of the - one of the complaints they have that they're looking at is whether the FBI thoroughly looked into all of those financial dealings. The things I just described. The Burisma dealings. The Chinese energy company, CEFC. There's so many things that they believe the FBI did not do to properly investigate this. Of course, that's going to be now the subject of months of investigation by House Republicans. Guys.",

We don't know if perhaps they had much more and then they narrowed it down to this, which sometimes you do when you're negotiating a plea deal.Important to know about David Weiss. He is a longtime career prosecutor at DOJ under administrations of both political parties. He was a fairly senior prosecutor throughout the eight years of the Obama administration. He was nominated to become U.S. attorney by Donald Trump. But it's important to note, he had the support of both of Delaware's Democratic senators at the time. And when Joe Biden took office in 2021, usually the president gets rid of all the U.S. attorneys. They usually resign in anticipation of that. Biden kept on three U.S. attorneys. One of them being John Durham. One of them being someone in Chicago. And David Weiss was the third. Presumably because Biden knew that David Weiss had this case involves his son and did not want the appearance of getting rid of this individual. So, he's a longtime career prosecutor. Biden intentionally kept him in place. And here's the outcome.",

And CNN reported just a few months ago that Hunter Biden's lawyers met with Justice Department officials in April. Among those officials, of course, the U.S. attorney who's been overseeing -- the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney who's been overseeing this case to make their arguments for why Hunter Biden should not be charged. We've learned that they made a presentation. And during that presentation they made several different arguments about why Hunter Biden should not be charged, including pointing out that he had already paid back these taxes, including the fees and penalties.They also argued that this gun charge was not strongly supported by the evidence and that recent Supreme Court decisions last spring was going to make it difficult for their case to hold up in court. Now, of course, they did not get their wish. Their client, of course, is facing multiple charges here. But in recent weeks negotiations have really ramped up. They've been back and forth between the Justice Department and defense attorneys trying to hammer out a plea deal. And we're told that they had a deal in place. Then it fell through. Then it was back in place. And now they finally came to this agreement to resolve this years' long investigation. Again, this is something that's been going on for about five years now. And the fact that it has finally come to a resolution is certainly a relief we're told to Hunter Biden, to his lawyers. And they tell me that they are -- overall they are pleased with this deal.",

There is a federal law that makes it illegal for an addict, a person who's addicted to drugs or alcohol, to possess a firearm. This is a strange and somewhat obscure, a rarely used, not never, but rarely used firearms. I used to do firearms cases all the time, but the vast majority of federal firearms cases are either a firearm used in another crime of violence or a firearm possessed by somebody who has a prior felony. This is sort of low down on the list of firearm offenses. And so the question here, well, he's - he's apparently -- it's not entirely clear to me whether he's going to plead guilty to that firearms offense because this letter from DOJ specifies that he will plead guilty to the tax misdemeanors. It does not say he will bleed guilty to the firearm offenses. It says he's going into a pretrial diversion agreement.",

One of them - on that has to do with his substance abuse issues, which Hunter Biden has been very, very public about. He wrote a book. And, ironically, that's the book, the book where he talked about his substance abuse issues, very, very candid things that he said about what he was doing at the time is what really compounded his problems in this federal investigation because it was from that, from his own words, that prosecutors and investigators learned that at the time that he had owned or he had purchased a gun he was addicted to drug, which is a violation of federal firearms law. One of the things you do when you buy a gun is you fill out this form that goes to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and you swear that -- one of the things that you swear to is that you are not addicted to drugs. And, of course, what Hunter Biden did when he wrote that book, he admitted, and he said it in interviews, he said that he was addicted.And so one of the things that happened was, they became very, very focused on that particular charge because it is something that the Biden administration has been pushing, certainly to go after people who lie in order to buy firearms. So, what this program will do is, you know, Hunter Biden will get some treatment for his drug issues. And if he completes this to the satisfaction of a judge, this charge, as if it never happened. This charge goes away. So, Elie's right, it is a plea, two tax charges, and if Hunter Biden agrees, you know, again, if a judge approves all of this and if a judge is satisfied that he has complied with all of the terms, then this charge just disappears. And so that's part of the -- certainly the probationary period here that Hunter Biden will have to live through for the next couple of years. It is a fascinating thing, though, certainly for Hunter Biden and the candidness of him talking about his substance abuse problems is what ended up causing some issues for him in this case, guys.",

That's going to be a major disappointment for Republicans who see this as -- Hunter Biden as one source of, you know, major -- what they say is corruption when it comes to President Biden.This really doesn't substantiate that. And I think the Biden administration, they've been waiting for this to come to a conclusion. President Biden himself has really ignored so much of this. Really keeping his son Hunter close, in spite of all of the criticism and in spite of all of the attacks. He's taken Hunter Biden on foreign trips. And what you hear from the president himself is that, this is my son. He's had a troubled past. He is still my son. And I'm going to keep him close. And I think that this resolution on the legal front is only going to really allow President Biden to kind of double down on that strategy, even as Republicans now shift to Capitol Hill to see what else they can -- they can dig up here.

Again, I think it's important to underscore, none of that is in this plea deal. It doesn't mean that it's not going to be part of the congressional investigations. As we've heard from our colleagues, and we just know from our own reporting, and having eyes and ears and being journalists, it is not going away with a Republican led House of Representatives.Having said all of that, I do think it is important to take a step back just for a second and note that we do have the son of a sitting president pleading guilty to federal charges. They seem to be, in the grand scheme of things, relatively minor charges. And it does - and I'm sure we will see and hear from Hunter Biden. When we do, he will talk about the fact that this is -- was caught up in his addiction. And that is part of why -- maybe he's going to say that is the reason why he decided to plead guilty to this.

We'll see him at about the 4But this all comes as we've seen President Biden and his family really offer this unwavering support for Hunter Biden, even as he's faced these legal issues and this investigation from the Justice Department. The president has repeatedly said that he supports his son, saying in a recent interview that he does not believe he has done anything wrong. And he has intentionally kept his son incredibly close. He's been a frequent presence at family events here at the White House, and other events as well. He -- his daughter, Naomi Biden's wedding took place here on the South Lawn of the White House. We believe that the last time that the two of them were seen publicly together was back in May when they attended a graduation up at the University of Pennsylvania. But over the years, the -- Hunter Biden has really acted as a sounding board for his father. And some Democrats privately have expressed concerns about having him so closely involved with the president. But ultimately, when it comes to President Biden and the first lady, it is family ties that come first and they have repeatedly issued and announced their support and commitment to their son. Now, the White House has been very careful. They've refrained from commenting on these investigations from the Justice Department.
