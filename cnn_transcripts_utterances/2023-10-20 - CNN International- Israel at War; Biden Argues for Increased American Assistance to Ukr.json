Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of that. Meanwhile, Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood. He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine. History has taught U.S. that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going, and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising. For 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe and has been the cornerstone of American security. And if Putin attacks a NATO ally, we will defend every inch of NATO which a treaty requires and calls for.

About $60 billion of that would help Ukraine continue defending itself as Russia's unprovoked invasion nears the two-year mark. And Israel, as the war with Hamas enters the two-week mark would see about $10 billion from that package.But there remains to be seen what the path is for that package in Congress, where there's a leadership vacuum in the House of Representatives and very clear consternation among both fiscal hawks and progressive Democrats about writing blank checks to many of these countries. The White House is confident that there remains bipartisan support and that there is rough agreement among many lawmakers that the U.S. will end up on the right side of history.

There is no speaker in the House of Representatives. So, getting any kind of funding through is going to be very challenging.And looking beyond Capitol Hill and the broader public opinion in the States, because of course that is the key question here, really, there is a divide as to whether or not funding should continue, not only to Israel, but also to Ukraine. And if you look at CNN polling in the last couple of months, there clearly is not much agreement as to how much funding there should be. So, for Ukraine, we did a poll back in August, already over half of Americans were saying that the Congress should no longer be giving funding to Ukraine. Now, if we look -- turn to Israel, already, this is very much the start of a war. There is clearly a lot of escalation on the ground, and yet there is still not agreement amongst the American public as to whether or not there should be funding. Just 35 percent think the U.S. is giving the right level of assistance. 36 percent say, they're not sure. So, Biden has a lot on his plate, really, to argue for more funding, and $100 billion total for all of this, not just Israel, but Ukraine, Taiwan, also the U.S. Mexico border. It's a lot of money to be asking for. And as we're seeing this morning, we're reporting on these developments on the ground. Escalation is clearly underway. Ground invasion is being talked about. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire. Getting aid in seems very challenging still. Biden's attempt in his visit there was to deescalate, to find compromises in this war, it doesn't seem to be going very well.",

All these kinds of things are getting damaged because of strikes and because of continued fighting. And so, any kind of aid would be crucial. And as we're seeing, lots of dispute, lots of different countries involved in making that happen. Not just Egypt, which borders with Gaza, but also with Israel. Clearly, they have some views as to what kind of aid should be getting in, how much, and notably, they are not allowing aid in through the Israeli crossings into Gaza.
