That does not make sense to me, and I've known Lauren Michaels a long, long time, and he's the executive producer of course, creator of the show, and I don't see how that would be acceptable to him.I do think Chappelle is a controversial figure.

He fits the bill, but obviously you can have -- you can't go too far. You're not going to have Kanye West hosting and doing antisemitic jokes. So, I don't expect him to be out there doing things that are really outrageous comments about the transgender community. He has said some pretty edgy things I have to say in his Netflix special. And of course, you remember, he was even attacked on stage once in the past year. So, he's been in the middle of this, and he kind of welcomes it. You're right about his style.

So, I would imagine behind the scenes there's been discussion. He may have said to some of the writers, if you don't want to write a sketch, then you can write a commercial or a sketch that he's not in. The host is not in every sketch.So, there are ways to manage this, and I would be surprised if he wasn't managing it.

So, what crazy thing did Elon Musk do now? And it's as if there's like a thought experiment happening in his head that he doesn't actually realize is playing out in real life. The FTC is watching this. What's going on? OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTERTwitter is perhaps not in compliance with federal regulation. So, they're saying, that we are, you know, actively looking. They're deeply worried about what's happening at Twitter. But the broader picture here I think is, can Twitter survive Elon Musk? I mean, the FTC is one problem that he has. He has multiple fires now burning at Twitter. Advertisers have fled, executives he ousted, right, and then other executives are leaving the company. Morale is low. I was talking to someone who told me that internally, company -- employees are viewing this as the Titanic, looking for lifeboats, hoping to get out. His verification Twitter blue subscription model has imploded. They had to suspend that today. And so, you look at all of these factors happening at Twitter, and you wonder how they're going to succeed as a company. And then Elon Musk comes out himself basically and tells them, well, we might not actually survive. We might have to declare bankruptcy. And so, it is just a huge mess, and this could have really significant ramifications for us all because it's a very important communications platform. Government officials use this. Countries use this to communicate, and it's now been thrown into complete chaos.",

He said a couple of weeks ago there's a massive revenue drop at Twitter and he told employees in his first note if we don't increase revenue, we might not survive this economic downturn. And his problem is that he has scared advertisers away. And one of the only people, the key figures at Twitter Yoel Roth, who was the head of trust and safety that was really making them have some confidence in the platform, he departed Twitter yesterday.And so, I don't -- I don't know how they're going to get themselves out of this one. It just seems like one thing after the next, and the last 24 hours, you've seen this company really get into a quickening death spiral. I'm not sure they can navigate out of this one.",

I mean, this wasn't something that happened in weeks or months. I mean, it's really been in just the past few days and also because of who FTX is. They're one of the leading crypto exchanges.Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and he's been one of the faces of crypto. He was the white knight who bailed out others struggling crypto firms. And now he's become so toxic that he couldn't get a bailout of his own. He's lost a fortune that was worth $15 billion. He resigned as CEO. It's just been an incredible series of developments. And FTX itself, I mean, it's backed by top investors. It had endorsement deals with Steph Curry, Gisele, Tom Brady. Its logo was flashed on the home of the NBA's Miami Heat. And now it's bankrupt. That means that its investors may get wiped out. Employees could lose their jobs. Some people -- some of the customers, they could lose money as well through no fault of their own. Let me read you what you what Sam Bankman-Fried said on Twitter today. He said, quote, I'm very sorry, again, that we ended up here. Hopefully things can find a way to recover. Hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency, trust, and governance to them. Ultimately hopefully it can get better for customers. Now all of this has shaken confidence in the crypto industry. Bitcoin prices down another five percent today. Down dramatically from the peak just a year ago. Regulators are reportedly swarming, and all of this of course, is going to just bolster calls for a regulatory crackdown.

The committee is dropping $2 million to bankroll that turnout operation that Kemp built.Now, earlier this week, we learned the fundraising operation for Senate Democrats will contribute $7 million to boost Warnock. The two wasted no time getting back out on the campaign trail. Senator Warnock, Herschel Walker, their arguments are really coming into focus, Boris. Warnock argues that this is about competence and character, suggesting that he will again work to try to indict Walker over character issues and make this greater argument that Walker is not fit to serve in the United States Senate. Recalling a moment during their one and only debate when Walker suggested diabetics just need to eat right. Walker, meanwhile, says Warnock is more concerned about carrying out President Biden's agenda than with the worries of everyday Georgians.
