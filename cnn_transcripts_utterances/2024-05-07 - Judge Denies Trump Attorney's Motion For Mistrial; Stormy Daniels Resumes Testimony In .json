Yesterday, two Trump Organization officials, who had potentially very consequential testimony, he was lounging back in his chair with his eyes closed. Was somewhat interested in his lawyer during direct cross.But today, as you saw, as we're getting these reports -- I mean, he is so actively involved in directing his attorneys, prompting objections, of watching her on the screen.

But I also noticed, at one point, though, she talked how she stopped doing her podcasts that she had. She said she was fired from it. And the prosecutors asked her why. She said the only line of questioning they wanted to talk about on the podcast was this story, this case, this allegation, or her story about her affair with Donald Trump. And that, essentially, she wasn't interested in. She wanted to explore the topics. It seemed to be trying to cut at, well, she also suffered potentially financially as well. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: How they swear kind of the last 15 minutes before the lunch break of her testimony, it's going to be interesting to me where she said, first, she wanted to get her story out. Then she didn't want to get her story out. It was because of fear. It wasn't because of money. And then who was actually -- what was her understanding about who was actually holding things up? Was it Michael Cohen or was it Donald Trump directing Michael Cohen. And I think there are a couple of things, a couple of elements -- there's less than -- because we've got to get what actually matters here to some degree in terms of the legality that's been alleged, where, how they take that, how they kind of actually smooth out what seemed to be some divergent stories towards the end there. It's going to be absolutely critical because, again, as lurid and almost visceral this morning was, this is the part that really matters. This is where they're able to prove whether or not, or at least continue to flesh out details of the actual allegations of the actual charges here.",

She's just being made whole.If on the other hand, she was paid $130,000 for a photo shoot, that would be income. That would be taxable. The way they paper -- the way they made this settlement appear, was if she was being paid for a legal suit, more like a car accident where she's being reimbursed. You can question whether that's legitimate and fair. But because of the way they structured it, probably not taxable. And it's worth noting, she just testified, of the $13,000, once her attorney and publicists took their cut, she said she only cleared about $96,000 for herself.",

So they're aware of what's going on here. The bigger concern -- again, and they're not going to comment on Stormy Daniels directly. But the bigger concern here, again, is how does this play out in the actual campaign? How does this actually play out with voters? And when I talked earlier about how the defense does not want to drag out their cross-examination, part of that is because they don't really want all of these details coming up. They don't want more details. They don't want her telling more of the story. Because the more details there are, as we saw this morning, the more salacious it is.

I had the privilege to be in the courtroom this morning, where the testimony was uncomfortable at times, certainly graphic, as Daniels went into great detail about her encounters with Donald Trump long before he was president. It had been 17 years since they'd actually come face to face. She talked about how he called her Honey Bunch. She talked about how she'd put it on speakerphone when he called her after they first met at Lake Tahoe in 2006. She talked about that night when they met. And she even mimicked his pose that he was making, that, she said, when she came out of the bathroom to find him on the bed in his hotel room. It was a testimony that Trump's attorneys complained about when they returned to the courtroom. They even asked for a mistrial but the judge declined to grant them one. And he did instruct them about the parameters of where they can go with the testimony for Stormy Daniels this afternoon. I want to bring in retired federal judge, Nancy Gertner, who is here with us. Because, Judge Gertner, we have been looking at the decision that this judge has been faced with. He's been faced with many of them since this trial started. And I should note, right now, that inside that courtroom, they are talking about that non-disclosure agreement that Stormy Daniels had signed and how she was upset when the story became public because Michael Cohen could be out there talking about it. She could not. But first, just on what has happened just a few moments ago, what do you make of Judge Merchan's decision not to declare a mistrial here?",

And in fact, in some respects, even if she we're getting her story -- selling her story and it wasn't true, as with the doorman, it would suggest that the details of this are less important than the fact that she sold it to -- you know, to -- to Cohen, who then paid her to keep her mouth shut. In other words, there were guardrails. You don't have to go into these details. This is not about rape. This is not about a sexual assault case. This is about a payoff to keep you silent. The problem, as I understand it, that he was focused on, that the judge was focused on is whether the lawyers had objected. Presumably, this went on over a period of time.
