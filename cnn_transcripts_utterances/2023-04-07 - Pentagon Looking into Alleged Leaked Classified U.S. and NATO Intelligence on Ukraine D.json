Now, it is not clear whether these documents are authentic or whether they have been doctored, but the Pentagon did say in a statement that they have seen the reports of the social media posts and they are, \"Reviewing the matter\". So, they are looking into this. However, they have not disclosed one way or another whether these images are actually real.Now, a lot of these images -- I should say, one of them that we have seen, they do show some information about the amount of equipment that Ukraine currently has, the amount of training that the Ukrainians have undergone on that equipment, as well as projected timelines for when they might receive additional western equipment. Things that could potentially be useful for the Russians to know. But we should note that the Ukrainians have come out and said that they believe that this -- that these leaks are not necessarily real. And one senior official -- senior Ukrainian official actually posted this morning on his telegram account that he believes that this is basically just a disinformation operation by the Russians. That if they really had sensitive intelligence released by the Americans, then they would not necessarily be releasing it. But regardless of whether this information is authentic or not, he does come at a moment, obviously, when both sides, the Ukrainians and the Russians, are trying to get a better understanding of what each side is planning for this coming spring offensive and counteroffensive, John.",

SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  New information this morning in the death of Cash App founder Bob Lee. We are getting our first look at surveillance footage that shows Lee's final moments in a San Francisco Street. We are not playing the video because it is graphic. But in the surveillance footage, Lee is seen walking alone, gripping his side with one hand and his cell phone in the other, leaving a trail of blood behind him. Lee was stabbed multiple times early Tuesday morning, according to police. CNN's Veronica Miracle has been following this investigation for us. Can you give us a sense if -- at this moment, the police have any leads whatsoever?",

Beyond that, there are really no -- there is no information surrounding the circumstances of his death. How this could have happened? Why this could have happened? What he was doing at 2 30 in the morning in that area? Still a lot of questions remain unanswered.

The proposal would allow schools to limit some transgender student athletes from participating in sports, but would make blanket bans illegal. This pertains to Title IX, the federal civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or education program that receives federal funding.CNN White House Correspondent joins us now with much more on this.

      "sentences": "Well, John, the Biden administration had been working towards this rule change for quite some time as they're trying to seek to offer some guidance to states schools, parents, and also students, as many states across the country have implemented laws affecting transgender athletes.Now, for the most part, transgender kids in elementary school will be able to continue participating in the sports teams that align with their gender identity. But it's when these kids move on to more competitive fields, including high school and college, where some limitations will be allowed. This rule states that schools would have the flexibility to, \"Identify their own educational objectives when it comes to restrictions\". That could include trying to ensure fairness and also trying to prevent sports related injuries. Another thing that they'll have to take into account is the nature of the sport that they're trying to put these restrictions on. Now, this is certainly a hot topic that's been debated over the past few years. And there have been many Republican-led states that are implementing outright bans on transgender athletes in sports. Most recently the State of Kansas taking some action on that. That is something the White House has referred to as legislative bullying. But really, the reaction to this has been mixed. You have Republicans who don't want the federal government to get involved in this matter, but then you are also hearing some skepticism from some LGBTQ advocacy groups. For instance, the human rights campaign has said, \"Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.\" The new rules should be clarified to ensure that all transgender students should be presumed eligible to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity. There is some concern among these groups that this new rule could potentially provide a bit of a roadmap, a bit of a guideline for ways that these students could continue to be discriminated against. Now, this rule will have a 30-day public comment period before it becomes official. So, there's always an opportunity that there could be some changes made going forward. But this really highlights the administration's first decisive action when it comes to this issue regarding transgender athletes in schools.",

The Supreme Court decision that weighs in on this debate over fairness and inclusion in sports. And for now, it's a win for trans athletes in West Virginia. The high court blocking an attempt by the state to enforce a law that would have banned a trans girl from running on her school's cross-country team. 12-year-old Becky Pepper-Jackson, she sued the state when that ban first took effect. Then, earlier this year, a lower court stepped in, and that is when the state took matters to the Supreme Court. CNN's Ariane de Vogue has been following this case and she joins us now.

She cited in favor of laws like this, and that surprised a great many people. It really is something that is dividing both sides.
