      "sentences": "Yes, certainly a big blow for Boeing, Fred, but also a disappointment for NASA. You heard all those NASA officials say today that this was a difficult and tough decision, that they were really disappointed that they had to make it because they wanted this first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft to be a success. But after the flight readiness review meeting in which the top NASA leadership polled various people at NASA, it was a unanimous decision that Starliner was deemed not safe enough to bring those two astronauts home, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.But during that press conference, NASA officials said that Boeing did not agree with NASA's assessment. Here's the official statement that came out from Boeing shortly after this decision by NASA was announced. It reads, Boeing continues to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft. We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return. So, Starliner is now going to undock from the International Space Station with no crew inside, sometime in early September, and that's when the real test is going to take place. We're going to see how this spacecraft fares when it reenters the Earth's atmosphere and encounters those really high temperatures that NASA officials were so worried about. In particular, those thrusters that have been misfiring and having issues, would they have been able to fire at the right time to orient the heat shield on Starliner in the right direction to protect those astronauts if they had been inside. And so, there are some real echoes here of what happened to the Columbia crew back in 2003 and of course, Challenger back in 1986, Fred. And so, I asked the NASA administrator, Bill Nelson, during that press conference, you know, he was on the committee that wrote and investigated the Challenger accident report. He was a senator during the Columbia accident. And so, I asked him how much of those past mistakes by NASA influenced his decision here today. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As it happens, there were five people inside, including the rabbi. None of them were injured. President Macron saying that our thoughts are with the congregation at La Grande Motte Synagogue. This is in the southern part of France, near the city of Montpellier on the south coast, and saying that his thoughts are also with all the Jews of France as well. Everything is being done to find the perpetrator of what President Macron described as a terrorist act and to protect places of worship. He added that the fight against anti-Semitism is a constant battle. Now, it's also worth noting that there's been an upsurge in anti- Semitic, anti-Jewish attacks in France, not just since October the 7th, since the Hamas terrorist attacks, but also this year. In fact, they've almost tripled in the first half of this year. And the initial investigation of this attack this morning says that the perpetrator was reportedly carrying a Palestinian flag and a gun as well. Now, Jewish institutions -- at the best of times, Jewish institutions in France and other countries in Europe, such as the U.K. have more security than institutions belonging to other religions for fear of attacks They were bolstered in the wake of the October 7yh Hamas led to terrorist attacks.

My experience has been with small party candidates is that they oftentimes -- their voters won't support either major party candidate.

Some of the other people who supported Kennedy, traditional Democrats, maybe who didn't like Joe Biden, traditional Democrats who are made prochoice on abortion, I think some of them might go back. But at the end of the day, maybe Trump has a very slight edge with those voters, but it's not going to be very many because this race had been reset.

I think the administration is in a bind on this one. I think they're very reluctant to apply the kind of pressure. And remember, if this were Israel and Egypt in a conflict, Jim, I think the administration's capacity to impose significant leverage and pressure on the Israel -- on Israel would expand. But it's not. It's a conflict between Israel and a foreign terrorist organization declared by statute by the administration. An organization that's the embodiment of an idea, right? Replacement of Israel by an Islamic State and who also holds and is abusing hostages. So, I think administration pressure and leverage 11 months, there's been very little. I suspect domestic politics will edge out whatever pressure the administration thinks that it can impose right now on the Israelis. And then, you've got the Hamas calculation. Now, one final point, I know the Israelis have a real sense of avenging the dead. But they also, it seems to me, have a huge mission in trying to redeem the living. And I think -- I'm not an Israeli, but I sense that's clearly the calculation on the minds of so many hostages. Redeem the living regardless of the cost you need to pay. You can deal with the other issues, Hamas, terror, later. Get those people home.",

Since then, more than 750,000 families have taken advantage of new tax benefits by putting solar panels on their roofs.But there's a surprising group making the most of these incentives. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa talks to faith leaders who are uniting in climate action. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELISA RAFFA, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  After noticing more of her patients dealing with the impacts of longer allergy seasons, more extreme heat and increasing air pollution, Dr. Neha Pathak's search for prescriptions took her down a seemingly unconventional path. DR. NEHA PATHAK, BOARD VICE CHAIR OF GEORGIA INTERFAITH POWER AND LIGHT:  It can have a big impact on your own personal resilience. So, I really looked to my faith tradition to help bolster that resilience for me. RAFFA (voice-over):  Through that search, this physician and practicing Hindu found herself serving as a board member for Georgia Interfaith Power and Light. Her work towards climate and spiritual solutions is more connected than you might think. DR. PATHAK:  So, the first thing we do when we wake up in one of our prayers is to thank Mother Earth for allowing us to step on her all day long. When we take our first bite of food for the day, we thank Mother Earth for providing us this food. RAFFA (voice-over):  As the board chair, Rabbi Laurence Rosenthal points out, the bible has been talking about extreme weather for thousands of years, with examples like Noah's Ark, plagues, and famine.",

One forecast shows the Inflation Reduction Act will lead to a 48 percent boost in solar deployment in the next 10 years. In the two years since the new rebates, Georgia Interfaith Power and Light says it has seen a 50 percent increase in faith communities enrolling in their SolarWise program. When it comes to the climate crisis, these faith leaders agree, the calling is clear. DR. PATHAK:  We have the science. We understand why this is happening.
