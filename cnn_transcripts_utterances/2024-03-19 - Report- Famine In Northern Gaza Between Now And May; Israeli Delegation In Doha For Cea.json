One was a reciprocal exchange of hostages and an exchange for prisoners. The second was a ceasefire, and the third was, indeed, as you indicated, an Israeli withdrawal.

Guarantees not only from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, and Jordan, but also from the United States. At the same time, Rosemary, Israel is deliberating an invasion or some kind of a large-scale military operation in the southern part of the Gaza -- of the Gaza Strip, in the city of Rafah -- near the city of Rafah, which is completely inconsistent or incompatible with ceasefire talks.

This is the U.S. essentially, saying to Israel, well come over and explain to us how you intend to do this, and how you intend to ensure that parallel to whatever it is that you plan on doing. There is also humanitarian -- a steady influx of humanitarian aid. That means that it's all put on hold. Now, there are two ways of interpreting that. One is that the American administration has put on so much pressure that Israel is recoiling from this. And the second is that Israel is not that interested about a large-scale operation in southern Gaza. And this provides a perfect pretext to delay this or even not do this. This, of course, Rosemary, leads to something which is completely different, that maybe we should talk about this some other time. On Mr. Netanyahu, heading for a delivered confrontation with the President Biden, exactly on that point. positioning him, Biden, that is -- Netanyahu positioning Biden some kind of escape goat.

All she knows is the safety of this hospital room. This week that will be torn away. War will become her new reality. I might go back and they invade Rafah, her mother Nima (PH) says. I'll be the one responsible for anything that harms them. If I go back with the twins, where do I go with them? Where would I get diapers and milk? Gaza is not the same anymore. For nearly six months these three mothers have been living, sleeping, and nursing their five babies in this hospital room together. Before the war, their high-risk pregnancies made them eligible to leave Gaza and give birth in Jerusalem hospitals. But now, they've packed their bags after learning that the Israeli government is sending them back to Gaza where Israel's brutal military campaign has made survival a daily struggle. Hannan (PH), the mother of twins says she's scared of going back to Gaza without a ceasefire. There are diseases spreading, infections, she says, it's not a normal life. They will be among the 22 Palestinians set to be bused on Wednesday to the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. Her husband is in the north and Hannan is still trying to find a place to live. Despite that uncertainty, Asma (PH) wants to return to Gaza. My daughter is there. She needs me, Asma says. Every time she speaks to me, she asks when I'm coming back. Every time there is an airstrike, children go to hug their mothers. Mine has no one to hug. At nearby Augusta Victoria hospital, nearly 50 Gazan cancer patients have been receiving treatment since before October 7th, watching from afar as their families endure the horrors of war. For Mohammed (PH), one of the ten who are in remission and being sent back to Gaza, being far away from his son, Hamza, who is blind has been the hardest to bear. But going back is also terrifying. I'm torn, he says. The only wish I have in life is to go back home. I regret even coming here for treatment. I wish I could be with them, because I know how they need me. In a statement, the Israeli agency in charge of their returns said patients who have received medical treatment and who are not in need of further medical care are returned to the Gaza Strip. After more than two months of pushing back on Israeli demands, Dr. Fadi Atrash says he was ordered to compile a list of patients to be sent back to Gaza this week. DR.

The U.S., Germany, and European diplomats were among those criticizing the vote, saying the election was neither free nor fair.David Sanger is a CNN political and national security analyst, and a White House and national security correspondent for The New York Times.

But any viable competition has been exiled or eliminated with some brave souls daring to protest at the ballot box and on the street, so how much support does Putin actually have? Is there any way of knowing that?",

You should not measure that by his margin of victory in this election, which was unsurprisingly well above 80 percent. Every time he has run for office, they've arranged for him to get -- show more and more support. And of course, this term would run (ph) him to 2030 and he's hitting the point where he will, if he completes all of that, I believe have been in power longer than Stalin was over the Soviet Union.The question is, what does he do with this next term?",

And of course, at that same post-election press conference where Putin talked about Navalny, he also threatened a full-scale World War III if any western troops dared to set foot in Ukraine in response to a suggestion recently made by French President Emmanuel Macron. How should NATO respond to such chilling rhetoric and what should we read into that?",

But the fact of the matter is that he recognizes very well that the way that you really get a reaction out of the west is to threaten escalation. He knows that President Biden has been particularly concerned about escalation, that's the reason the president didn't give Ukraine some of America's best weapons early in the war. But later on, he got to doing it.I think that the big crossing point that Putin is trying to avoid is NATO actually sending troops in. I don't think there is much of a chance that the British or the United States would do that. Of course, we did here Emmanuel Macron suggest it, the president of France, a few weeks ago. He was pretty well slapped down right away by the German Chancellor and by the British as well.",

One, because we're finally seeing inflation in the country after years of deflation. And two, because wages are finally going up. So right now, the rate of inflation in Japan for core consumer prices, this includes everything besides fuel and food, is hovering at about 2 percent. That magic number that indicates that the economy is in a healthy spot. An expert I spoke to earlier spoke about just how significant this was that we're now finally seeing inflation.",

      "sentences": "So, this, in addition to the fact that we're seeing wages increase significantly, has really indicated to the Bank of Japan that it was time to end negative interest rates. And in terms of how much we are seeing wages increase, just on Friday, Rengo, the country's largest labor union comprised of the -- of Japan's biggest companies decided to hike up wages by 5.28 percent. This is the biggest pay rise we've seen in 33 years.So, these two key components were finally met. And now, this will indicate just kind of the economic tone, the economic changes we'll see in Japan in the months to come. Now, in terms of consumers and how this will affect people on a day-to-day basis, so experts I spoke to said that the changes we will see in the coming months, this will be very steady and this will be probably several months down the line instead of more immediate changes. But we will probably see a stronger yen riding on the back of this higher rate of inflation and this will probably mean that input prices will also go down. Now, this is extremely significant for Japan because it is very resource poor, about 90 percent of its fuel and energy is actually imported, and about 60 percent of its food is also imported. So once we see those input prices go down, it will mean that the cost of living for people in Japan, people like myself here in the country will also go down. But for foreign tourists, it means that it might be a little bit more expensive for their next holiday, Rosemary.",
