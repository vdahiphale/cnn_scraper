Right now we are in the final sprint before those critical midterm elections and the balance of power in Congress is on the line.Today the biggest names in politics are out on the campaign trail. President Biden and his two predecessors are all stumping today, and they are all in Pennsylvania. And moments from now President Biden and former President Barack Obama, there you see the live picture right there, they will take the stage in Philadelphia to rally for Democratic Senate nominee John Fetterman. And in a couple of hours from now former President Donald Trump will be in Latrobe with Republican Senate nominee Mehmet Oz. Pennsylvania is one of those three toss-up Senate elections and it is a must-win for both parties to have control of the Senate. CNN's Jessica Dean is in Latrobe ahead of Trump's rally. And we begin with CNN's Phil Mattingly in Philadelphia. Phil, we have been talking to you throughout the afternoon. This is a blockbuster rally with both Biden and Obama set to take the stage at any moment. And it just goes to show you, I mean this might be it. This might be the whole ball game here when it comes to control of the Senate, right where you are right now in Philadelphia.",

It is not just the state of Pennsylvania, which Democrats acknowledge is a must-win, a pickup opportunity and really the lone pickup opportunity that they're really focused on right now as they have several other incumbents in very, very tight races.And they're sending out the big guns to Philadelphia for a very clear reason. It is not trying to get Independent voters necessarily, it is not trying to persuade Republicans to come to their side, it is to turn out their base. This is a bastion for Democratic support here in Philadelphia. In 2020 President Biden won this city, this county, Philadelphia County by more than 60 points. This is about turnout for the Democratic base and who better to bring that turnout out than President Biden but also former President Obama. Jim, we've been to several of president Biden's events. They're very clearly focused on issues, on bucking up certain members on specific policy issues. This is major campaign rally. This is President Obama bringing what he has to the table. You know, Jim, very well they have different strengths, they have different styles, but their message and their goal is the same, and the effort tonight is going to be to bring that all to the same place. And more importantly than anything else, get out Democrats to vote, get out young voters in particular. They're playing Meek Mill (ph) at this rally, which I don't think I have ever heard at a President Biden event before to some degree, a recognition that Philadelphia's important, young voters are important and they need them to come out in a big way to win the most important Senate race in just a couple of days, Jim.",

It is hard to get your head around the prospect that here we have Donald Trump who, you know, challenged the results of the 2020 election, incited an insurrection at the capital, fielded his own -- essentially his own slate candidates in Republican contests across the country to the point where you have election denialists, people who won't commit to honoring election results, running in almost every kind of race or public office in this country. We're really in uncharted waters. It's sort of an unprecedented time. Looking at all of this, it has never happened before in our history.

So it is no surprise that this is the location, this is the type of location that he has picked because for Oz, he really needs to run up the score in this more rural, conservative part of the state in order to then stay competitive in some of the more swing districts. So the location makes a lot of sense in that regard. Mehmet Oz has really, after being endorsed by former President Trump, tacked to the middle in this general election. He's really selling himself in the last week. We've been to several rallies with him, but also on television, as a moderate. [17:04:54",

Oz is going to need that base in his corner. He's going to need them to show up big for him on Tuesday, but he's also going to need those Independent and swing voters to also swing his way. And that will be important as well, and to that end tomorrow, Jim, we're going to see him back in the suburbs of Philadelphia with Senator Susan Collins, a more moderate member of the Republican Senate. So it is kind of a little bit of a balancing act that we're going to see, and it will be interesting to see what Oz says and also what the former president says. Now, earlier today Fetterman was in Pittsburgh with former President Barack Obama and he really sharpened his attack on Oz when it comes to his relationship with Trump. Take a listen.

And Karen, I spent lots of time in Georgia as well. We'll talk about that. But let's start with this key race in Pennsylvania, the Senate race between Fetterman and Oz. A recent Marist poll puts Fetterman slightly ahead of Oz, 51 percent to 45 percent, but the polls have been very close throughout all of this. Take a look at this data from the same poll. The top issue for Pennsylvania voters is inflation. So Karen, let me start with you. We got a better than expected jobs report yesterday, but do you think inflation has just been on the minds of voters for so long, gas prices and so on, that this is just a very steep hill to climb for Democrats?",

Who is going to focus on trying to lower costs, which is the argument you're going to hear President Biden make I believe later today and we've heard him make on the campaign trail. And who is going to increase costs for families? We have seen the Republican plan to raise costs around Social Security, Medicare, prescription drugs.The other thing though that I would say, Jim, I've done a lot of work recently with black voters and women voters, reproductive freedom, issues like protecting voting rights, concerns about MAGA extremism actually come up also, not only just about as high as inflation but the level of intensity that voters feel about those issues is very much on par. So I think voters are going to carry a number of issues and questions with them when they go to the polls, and I believe given the record turnout that we're seeing they're voting for Democrats.",

I also -- look, I have to tell you I think having Donald Trump even on the campaign trail, again it reminds voters about the chaos and many of these, you know, Republican candidates who are election deniers. One of the top things they ran on was fealty to Donald Trump. And so again, if you have him inserting himself, whether it is Pennsylvania or Georgia, I think that reminds voters that they want someone who's going to looking out for them, not Donald Trump.

We have seen this movie before where Ron Johnson and a number of other Republicans are setting it up such that if there isn't a red wave, which I don't think there will be, where if he doesn't like the results of the election, well, then something -- you know, then he can be an election denier.

It may take a day or so as we sort these things out, make sure that, you know, absentee ballots are counted and all of the tools of democracy are in place.

There are a lot of issues that still have to be addressed. But Senator Warnock has demonstrated -- not that he is an elitist or separatist, but that he can work across the aisle.

Phil, I know Josh Shapiro is on stage right now, running for governor, but President Biden was just on the stage a few moments ago. I know, you know, you cover the White House so well. A few days ago, President Biden was talking about democracy and how American democracy is on the line in this upcoming election.

It was ticking through list of accomplishments that his administration has been able to deliver. Accomplishments that he said if John Fetterman was in the Senate, that it was a pick-up seat for them, that he would be able to vote to help protect to some degree, particularly if the Republicans flip the House, but also expand on as well. But I think what this was, if you listen to the president and what he was going for here, it was to kind of give the full view going into these final days of what his administration has done, what he thinks they can do and why he thinks both Josh Shapiro and John Fetterman are a necessity moving forward. In Shapiro's case, in particular, the issues of democracy that the president was laying out on Monday are extremely important, particularly given who he is running against. The Democrats feel very good about that race right now, Jim. But when it comes to Fetterman, echoing John Fetterman himself, saying he is strong and gets back up again, trying to underscore the point he needs John Fetterman. And John Fetterman is who voters need to come out and vote for in a couple of days -- Jim?",
