      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to all our viewers watching around the world. I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, the Middle East is on edge after Hezbollah carries out some of its deepest rocket strikes on Israel since the beginning of the war with Hamas. Well, now, Israel is hitting back with hundreds of strikes into Lebanon. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris accepts CNN's invitation for a second presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, but Trump says he's not interested. And leaders of the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan meet to discuss security in the Indo-Pacific region, but comments made by President Joe Biden on a hot mic could make things a bit awkward going forward. We begin in the Middle East, where the barrage of fire between Israel and Hezbollah seems to only go from bad to worse. Israel says it's conducting strikes against the group in Lebanon as we speak. Well, that's after Hezbollah launched more than 100 projectiles into Israel overnight, according to the IDF. The statement says some of them were shot down, but there was at least one direct hit, and falling debris caused fires and left at least four people injured. It all happened after this. On Saturday, Israel conducted some of its most intense strikes in Lebanon since the war in Gaza broke out. The IDF says it hit about 180 targets, including Hezbollah rocket launchers ready to fire on Israel. U.S. officials are warning the possibility of even more escalation is real, and they're urging Americans to leave Lebanon as soon as they can. Elliott Gotkine is keeping an eye on developments in the region. He joins us now from London. Elliott, what is the latest?",

      "sentences": "Yes, thank you for having me on. It appears that Israel has put a significant dent in not only Hezbollah's deterrent capability, but it's also its ability to go on the offensive. The attack on its communications infrastructure on the pagers, walkie-talkies, cell phones, and such makes it difficult for commanders in the field to mobilize fighters and others to receive communications from headquarters to coordinate their attacks.And we've seen now the sort of state of disarray or paralysis that Hezbollah fighters are in, which is why the responses, although significant with the rocket fire in the north going further into Israel than before, have nevertheless been relatively tepid compared to what we've seen in the past or what would have been expected after a Israeli offensive such as the ones we've seen in the last few days.",

The question remains what long-term strategic ends do these serve. Now, at the end of the day, Israel needs to find some sort of peace with its neighbors as its neighbors need to do with it.And do these attacks do these operations bring Israel any closer? Does it bring Lebanon? Does it bring the people of Gaza and the West Bank any closer? It doesn't seem like the answer to that is yes, and especially if there's an attempt or desire to establish diplomatic ties and a peace with the Saudis, which has been floated over and over. None of the operations and none of the fighting that we've seen on the northern frontier or in Gaza seem to bring us any closer to that reality.",

I mean, we've seen the rocket attacks now, but if there's any other further coordination or attempt to do so, Israel has demonstrated that it can infiltrate Hezbollah's supply chain. It could identify where its senior military commanders are. There was one who was killed in a missile strike yesterday, who is a very high ranking commander and also had ties to the U.S. Marine barracks bombing in 1983.So, again, what Israel has showing is that even as well as attempt or desire to retaliate and to take offensive action can be challenged either by Israel disrupting its internal processes or going after its senior commander. So, really, there has to be another way Hezbollah has to find to be able to fight this conflict, and there doesn't seem to be one visible at the moment. And then furthermore, there's a question of the Lebanese people who do not want to be dragged into another conflict with Israel after the one that was fought in 2006 that, that devastated the southern part of the country and left many Lebanese unhappy with Hezbollah's role in instigating and escalating the conflict into what it became.",

You have Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, you have Maronite Catholics, you have Druze. And there's a very fragile, delicate piece where all of these have some sort of a power -- these groups have a power sharing agreement in the government structure.Now, of course, the balance of power depends upon peace if there's any disruption or instability, especially if it's at the hands of one of these groups, then it really incurs the ire of all the others. And that's the delicate position Hezbollah finds itself in. Is it a militia representing the Shia Lebanese population at the behest of Iran, or is it part of the broader Lebanese fabric, which it doesn't seem to indicate that it is if its actions and missions are being conducted at the behest of the Iranian government and its leadership. So, that's, again, the position that Hezbollah finds itself in.",

I mean, the Iranian -- excuse me, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is basically Iran's militia that it operates within the country, its leadership has maintained that Hezbollah in Lebanon operates as an extension of Iran's IRGC. And it is how Iran projects its power in the region. It's how Iran maintains its balance of power against Israel.Now, of course, this has all been compromised since the Hamas attacks of last October, where Iran has faced challenges in maintaining that balance itself. Nevertheless, it relies on Hezbollah to conduct operations. It supplies Hezbollah with weapons, with financing, with training, logistical support, all the things it needs to be the most powerful armed group in Lebanon. And to that end, it serves the needs of the Iranian government, despite Hezbollah claiming that it's really operating autonomously. We know that it is not.",

That move was slammed by the U.N. and rights groups, which blame Netanyahu for restricting press freedoms. CNN has reached out to Al Jazeera and Israel's military for comment. Ukraine said Saturday that it hit two ammunition depots in drone attacks inside Russia. Officials said one of the targeted facilities was a major storage base and a key part of Russia's logistics system. Meantime, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the U.S. starting today. He's hoping to get the help he needs to reverse Russia's advances, including long range weapons and permission to use them inside Russian territory. In the coming hours, he'll tour a Pennsylvania factory that makes ammunition used in Ukraine. He will then attend the U.N. General Assembly this week and meet at the White House with U.S. President Joe Biden. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is challenging Donald Trump to another showdown. The Democratic presidential nominee has accepted CNN's invitation to debate Donald Trump again on October 23rd, but the Republican nominee is not interested. Trump dismissed his rival's challenge while campaigning in the battleground state of North Carolina, and he says it's because of timing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  A lot of people say, oh do it, it's great entertainment. I've already done two. The problem with another debate is that it's just too late. Voting has already started. She's done one debate. I've done two. It's too late to do another. I'd love to in many ways, but it's too late. The voting is cast. The voters are out there immediately. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, in terms of this hot mic moment, right, it really speaks to just how even though the White House has said that this quad summit is not really directed at any one country, that China was featured very prominently during these meetings held over the weekend. During this hot mic moment, you can hear the U.S. president, Joe Biden, saying that he believes Chinese President Xi Jinping is looking to buy himself some diplomatic space. He says, quote, we believe Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China diplomatic relationships. And he's also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China's interest.Now, the White House has refused to comment any further about these comments, Anna, but if you take a look at the joint statement released on Saturday, you can tell that all four countries in the quad are gravely concerned about the country's actions in the South China Sea. They also condemn in the joint statement North Korea's ballistic missile launches, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But, again, no other country is featured as prominently as China. Now, looking back at past quad summits, we can tell by now that a common and reoccurring theme is how these four countries can improve their maritime security alliance in the face of growingly assertive China. But what's interesting and new about this specific summit is how these four countries announced that they would for the very first time conduct a joint Coast Guard exercise. Here's what Biden had to say about that exercise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're announcing a series of initiatives to deliver real positive impact for the Indo-Pacific. That includes providing new maritime technologies to our regional partners so they know what's happening in their waters, launching cooperation between Coast Guard for the first time.

British tech titan Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter and five others died when the yacht sank quickly after a storm hit. 15 people, including Lynch's wife and the ship's captain, survived.Italian prosecutors are investigating the captain and two other crew members on multiple counts of manslaughter and negligence. An official involved in the salvage operation says the vessel is believed to contain watertight safes, containing super encrypted hard drives that hold highly classified information. Survivors or prosecutors at Lynch always kept these drives in a secure compartment of the yacht when he used it. The data may be tied to intelligence work he did for western intelligence services that could now be in the sights of foreign governments. Four sources told CNN. Lynch, who was cleared in June in a U.S.-based criminal fraud trial, was hosting friends and associates to celebrate his acquittal when the vessel went down. His co-defendant died the same day after being hit by a car in the U.K. A source close to the investigation told CNN that security has been beefed up both above and below the water to protect the wreckage until it can be raised sometime in the coming weeks.
