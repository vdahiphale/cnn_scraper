He took on this question by his Republican rival, Donald Trump, and listed what was happening in the United States in 2020, talking about the state of the country, the crippling healthcare system, and the thousands of deaths that occurred over that time. And it is part of the broader strategy by this campaign to remind voters about what it was like under the Trump administration. It's not just the pandemic.
