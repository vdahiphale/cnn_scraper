And so it wouldn't shock me if the two of them were talking.One thing to note, though, you'll notice Donald Trump still has not returned to Twitter. And I don't know the reason exactly for that, other than that, of course, he still has Truth Social.

Remember, the Biden administration's approach here is kind of a carrot and stick approach. They've created these alternative pathways to allow migrants who want to present asylum claims to make them outside of the border. So that's the CBP One app that allows people to schedule appointments, you know, with their mobile phone, or these migrant processing centers in Latin America.At the same time, though, they're modifying the asylum rules with a new rule that will go into infect on Thursday, the same day that Title 42 ends. That new rule has created some fear in these migrant communities that they will no longer be eligible for asylum because they have not made a claim for asylum in Mexico, the country they transited through. And I think that's driven a little bit of a spike in migration. And we've seen it over the last week, week and half, where you've seen an uptick already at the border.",

And, unfortunately, I mean in some ways, if you're doing your job well, you're going to get criticism from both sides.But, look, I think a lot of the frustration, a lot of the current problem, you have to understand, the border is dynamic and it's changed a lot over the years and very quickly. But the threat we face at the border for decades was individuals sneaking into the United States, you know, crossing the border with coyotes leading them in the middle of the night, Border Patrol needing technology, more manpower, physical infrastructure, walls to try to prevent those incursions. It's shifted beginning really in the late 2014 to '15 where everyone presented themselves, surrendered and made an asylum claim. And we had budgeted and resourced the asylum system to handle a very small number of claims, yet here we are basically six, seven years into this and we have not adequately resourced the asylum system so that we can process these claims quickly, remove those people, send them home when they present false claims. As a result of that, we keep creating more demand, right? And this has - there's no end in sight. So while the near term issue is, how are we going to process the tens of thousands we expect when Title 42 ends, I mean, I think Congress also needs to ask itself questions about, why have we not resourced the current threat, which is to the asylum system, and why are we so overwhelmed because we don't have enough asylum officers and immigration judges to process it? Look, Congress -- when you're running for Congress and, you know, when you're running for re-election and - you know, for -- like Senator Sinema, it's easy to talk about, you know, detention facilities. You want to talk about those enforcement things. But the reality is, the shortcomings of late has been to the asylum officers and the immigration judges who process these claims.
