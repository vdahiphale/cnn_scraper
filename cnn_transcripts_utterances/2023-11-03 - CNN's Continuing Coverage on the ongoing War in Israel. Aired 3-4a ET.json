This is CNN's continuing coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in Israel at this hour with a warning that the growing number of civilian casualties in Gaza could undermine international support for Israel in its ongoing war against Hamas. The Secretary and Israeli Prime Minister are expected to meet today. Meanwhile, the Israeli military says Gaza City is now completely surrounded by its forces. Flares overnight lit up northern Gaza in one of the most intense periods of Israeli bombardment since the war began. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, IDF CHIEF OF STAFF (through translator): Our soldiers have been operating in Gaza City for the past few days, surrounding it from several directions, deepening the operation. Our forces are in very significant areas of Gaza City. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Hi Kim, yeah, so there continues to be a very heavy Israeli bombing campaign throughout the entire Gaza Strip, not only north but central and south as well, but the ground incursion with tanks and troops, that seems to be concentrated at least so far as we know in the north. As you mentioned, the Israelis say that they now have Gaza City surrounded. We don't know a lot about their precise movements inside of the territory.For obvious reasons, they don't want to give out locations. But that video that you showed from earlier with the flares overnight, we know that is from an area of northern Gaza called Beit Hanoun. It is just north of Gaza City and as you'll notice on that video you can see on the ground there seems to be some kind of a smoke screen there. Perhaps that indicates there are Israeli troops moving in that area, but we don't know for certain. We do have one marker of Israeli troops spotted on the ground, at least according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. They say that from about a kilometer away from Al Quds Hospital, which is about, or which is right on the outskirts of Gaza City, they say that IDF troops shot at the hospital, wounding a boy and a young man who were outside of the hospital, and also piercing a wall on the sixth floor of the building as well. This is the same hospital that says that it received threats that did receive threats from Israel to evacuate earlier this week. Israel says that it is warned it multiple times to evacuate, ahead of a potential bombing campaign of that site. There have been bombings right around that hospital. Some, according to the Palestinians, have actually damaged the hospital itself. The hospital, though, says, look, it cannot evacuate because there are so, so many civilians that are taking shelter there, so many wounded patients, and they simply have nowhere to go. But the situation inside that hospital, Kim, and others like it is only going to get more dire as this ground invasion continues, the Israelis continue to insist that Hamas is using hospitals as shelters. Al Quds hospital at least firmly denies that saying that it doesn't let anybody in who is armed at.",

It is also increasingly eager to stress the point to the Israelis that they need to operate within international law and they need to limit the number of civilian casualties that there are in these Israeli strikes.Two weeks ago, Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State, didn't give a clear answer when he was asked whether he thought the Israelis were operating within international law. Yesterday before he took off he was asked whether the Israelis had shown restraint. He didn't give a clear answer on that either. But he did say that Israel can and should take concrete steps to limit civilian casualties. And he says that look Hamas is making this tough obviously using civilians as shields but Israel as a democracy has a responsibility to rise to this challenge. [03:05:04] It is also a P.R. exercise that he needs to be careful with as well because, look, many countries in the Middle East, in the Arab world, already see the United States and other Western countries as going out of their way to be outraged for the brutal terrorist attack that took place in Israel, but not showing the same level of outrage necessarily when they see the level of civilian casualties it with on the Palestinian side and so privately American officials have been telling Israel look this operation in Gaza it has a limited time frame before the outrage over the civilian casualties reaches a tipping point.

Here she is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. BARBARA ZIND, PEDIATRICIAN WHO GOT OUT OF GAZA: In the beginning, we were in Gaza City and we were told to move south. There were going to be intensive bombing in Gaza City and there was. That's when I had that initial interview. And, but moving south, there was still a lot of bombing. And so there was, there's really no safe place for the Gazan people. So when we went to the U.N. facility, all the Gazans who were trying to go south, the first place usually, they usually would seek refugees, the U.N. schools, which were already full. So you had 1 million people and we were going to U.N. facilities that were not camps. They were vocational schools and storage centers. And so the toilets for those people, the water for those people was not inadequate for the tens of thousands of people who showed up. We ended up for about two and a half weeks in basically a parking lot that was wardened off from the rest of the people in the -- the rest of the Gazans were staying there.

And Qatar also has a good relationship with or workable relationship with Israel. So it is actually ideally placed to mediate over hostages' releases.

Well, it's been 17 years since Hamas took control of Gaza and Israeli officials say the militant group has spent that time building rockets, training for war and digging a complicated network of tunnels beneath the territory and for Israeli ground troops who are now said to have surrounded Gaza City. New propaganda video from Hamas reveals the dangers they could be facing.Our Ed Lavandera has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SR. U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Hamas propaganda video shows its fighters emerge from underground tunnels in what appears to be the Northern outskirts of the most populated areas of Gaza. Hiding in the terrain, the Hamas soldiers fire away at Israeli units advancing into Gaza. One video shows a Hamas soldier stalking an Israeli tank running up next to it and placing an explosive device on the machinery, then running away. Seconds later, the device detonates. The Hamas fighter then disappears into the ground through a trapdoor. A political leader of Hamas spoke this week about the tunnel's vital role in the Hamas military strategy. We have built the tunnels, he says, because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being targeted and killed. These tunnels, he says, are meant to protect us from the airplanes we are fighting from inside the tunnels. While Israel has unleashed thousands of airstrikes across Gaza since October 7th, Hamas is also trying to show off its air strike capabilities. It released this video of a munitions strike dropped from a drone over Israeli soldiers. It's not clear how many casualties it inflicted on the Israel Defense Force. Several soldiers can be seen running away from the site. The Israel Defense Forces released this Hamas propaganda video, which captures the elaborate maze of tunnels. which stretch for dozens of miles underneath Gaza. The militant organization uses the tunnels to store weapons and to launch airstrikes toward Israel. Veteran Israeli journalist Shlomi Eldar has reported on Hamas for decades. He says the underground tunnels are known as the Gaza Metro. SHLOMI ELDAR, ISRAELI JOURNALIST: They are hiding there. They spend billions of dollars. They build houses, tunnels, path, and venue. It's a project. It's a huge project. LAVANDERA (voice-over): Israel says dismantling the tunnels is the only way to dismantle Hamas. Ed Lavendera, CNN, Tel Aviv, Israel. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The final vote tally was 12 Democrats voted in support of the bill and two Republicans voted against it.So really an example here of how partisan, even a nonpartisan issue has become here in Washington. And the reason why Democrats were against this bill is because of the new speaker, Mike Johnson, and the way he decided to put this bill together. First of all, he decided to exclude Ukraine money. That's something that has been a priority for the White House, but it has become divisive in the House Republican Conference. And second of all, Johnson decided to include partisan cuts to the IRS as part of his package. He wanted to pay for this measure. He didn't want just a straightforward emergency supplemental, which is really unusual. Typically, those types of bills are not conditioned upon anything. So that is one of the reasons why the White House has issued a veto threat for this bill. But it's going nowhere in the Democratic- controlled Senate. And one Democrat, Jared Moskowitz, who did vote in support of that bill in the House, even he was unhappy with how it all came together. REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): I'm willing to give anybody the benefit of the doubt when they come into a leadership position, but this was it. This was his first full week, first big vote, national security issue for the American people, a national security issue for Israel, our number one ally, and he played politics for it so that he could send out a political mailer.",

And you can see that the Senate will try to come up with their own package now here you have a little bit more alignment between Mitch McConnell on the Republican side and Chuck Schumer on the Democratic side that they both agree that aid is needed in Ukraine. Ukraine is facing a winter, they're in the middle of a stalemate, they're going to need more sophisticated weapons, munitions, artillery, and the like. And so you will see some sort of package put forward to offer Ukraine aid and Israeli -- and aid to Israel at the same time. And that is typically what is done. You normally don't tie aid to conditions.
