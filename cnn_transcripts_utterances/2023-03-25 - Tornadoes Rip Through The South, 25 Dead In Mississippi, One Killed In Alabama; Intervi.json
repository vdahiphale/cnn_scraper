I am Jim Acosta in Washington.At this hour, a State of Emergency blankets much of Mississippi where an outbreak of tornadoes has left a trail of devastation and heartache. This is Rolling Fork where the Mayor says the city is gone. At least 25 people are confirmed dead in Mississippi and one in Alabama, and to add some perspective to the scope of the tragedy, consider this, the National Weather Service says more people have been killed by tornadoes in the last 24 hours than in all of last year -- that's across the entire nation. CNN's Nick Valencia is in Rolling Fork, Mississippi for us. He joins us by phone. Nick, I know you're still having cell issues there and live shot issues there because of just all the devastation. It's just -- we're looking at the video now. It's incredible. NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via phone): It is striking, Jim, to see this devastation up close and in person. You know, it's not really an exaggeration to say that there is very little of the town that has remained untouched from the tornado that ripped through here (AUDIO ISSUES). Most of the buildings that we're seeing here throughout the area have been reduced to rubble. There are individuals that we've spoken to that don't understand how they got out alive, considering so many around them perished. As you mentioned, at least 25 people have been killed as a result of these storms. I'd say that we're continuing to see the heavy machinery being brought through these areas to clear out the wreckage. It was earlier that I spoke to one of those tornadoes survivors named Ernest Hall who says that he was asleep when the initial storm came through, woken up by a phone call with a family member asking for help. So he raced across town to a trailer park where we're standing in front of and it is among the hardest hit areas in his neighborhood. And he started to rescue family members, but he said when he came to the house of his mother-in-law, he just held her body. Listen to what he said describing what he went through on Friday night.

I did speak to other tornado survivors here including a man named Elijah Washington who has not survived not one, not two, but three tornadoes in his lifetime. The 65-year old said that he got out with just a scratch on his finger, while other neighbors he knows died as a result of this storm. There is a lot of cleanup to happen here, and the great miracle though, among this community, Jim. It is 2,000 people, very impoverished community, majority Black community.

Joining me now, Mississippi Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson, whose district includes most of the worst damage. He is on the phone with us right now. Congressman, we really appreciate you joining us on such a sad day. We understand that you toured the decimated community of Rolling Fork last night. What did you see? REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS) (via phone): Well, obviously, Jim, it was devastation beyond imagination. First of all, we had no lights in the entire community. People were absolutely stunned at what had just occurred. And so as the night wore on, it was clear that this was something that people had never seen before, but the bright spot, so far, we've seen people coming from all walks of life wanting to help surrounding communities, surrounding volunteer fire departments, the Cajun Navy is already here. So you know, but it's a matter of dealing with the immediacy of what has occurred and try to get this very vulnerable community some stability, and it's a challenge to be quite honest with you.",

We have over 300 Red Cross volunteers in Rolling Forks, Mississippi. But other areas, Silver City, Mississippi, another community similar to Rolling Fork, just smaller, they are in a similar situation. So we're managing it. Our friends will have to help us. I understand that Secretary of Homeland Security will be here in the morning, as well as the FEMA Administrator to get a firsthand viewing of what is occurring, but I'm optimistic. With the proper help, we can come back. I own a hospital in this community. It is offline right now. So we're having to transport our injured over 50 miles away to the nearest hospital. And so maybe I can get my Governor here in Mississippi to accept the Medicaid expansion dollars that could have gotten us the proper emergency generation for our hospital enrollment for it so that we wouldn't be offline. So there are a lot of things we have to work through, but I'm convinced that this tragedy is an opportunity to bring this community back better than what you see right now.",

But as things happen, you know, we had to bring in a generator so we could power up the facility. One of the local farmers loaned us a tractor to generate it last night, so we could have lights in the facility, because as I've said, we had no lights. So businesses from other areas have set up feeding tents. They are grilling and distributing water and other things, just helping.

And according to this source, he is very frustrated. As we should note, these rallies do come as these legal entanglements continue to seem to be escalating. It's not just that potential indictment in New York. We've also seen in recent days of Trump's own defense attorney, Evan Corcoran testifying in front of a grand jury in the Federal Special Counsel probe into those Mar-a-Lago documents.

This is really the heart of their case: \"Unlike almost every single other defamation case, we have, in their own words, the fact that they knew it was false.\" Jim, Dominion has obtained thousands of damning text messages, e-mails from people at FOX News -- Rupert Murdoch, other executives, the show hosts, the producers, factcheckers that pretty much showed that they all thought this Dominion stuff was crazy, but they put it on the air anyway. That's why they think they should win. Now on the other side, you've got FOX News, and its parent company, FOX Corporation, they say that they've done nothing wrong. They say they are fully protected by the First Amendment. Here is what their lawyer was arguing in court in Delaware earlier this week. She said: \"All we ever did was provide viewers with the true fact that those were allegations being leveled by the President, by his lawyers, and in lawsuits throughout the country.\" Their defense is, don't blame us.
