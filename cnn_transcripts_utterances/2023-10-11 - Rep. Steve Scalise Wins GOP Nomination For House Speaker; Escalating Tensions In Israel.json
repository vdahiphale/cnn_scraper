We have been witnessing the buildup of forces over the last several days, amassing along the Gaza border and at other sites. The bombardment of Gaza continues. In less than a week of fighting, both Israel and Gaza report over 1000 deaths. Both sides are bracing for thing to get a lot worse. Obviously, scrambling to evacuate civilians from the crosshairs. A senior Israeli official telling CNN that talks are happening to allow U.S. citizens, and Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, to perhaps exit into Egypt ahead of any Israeli ground invasion. The National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, intimated in a press conference yesterday. He had talked about diplomatic efforts underway to figure out potential border crossings, but we're still waiting on some sort of resolution on that. Obviously, the Egyptian border - - there's the Egyptian border and the Israeli border. They're not going to be able to enter into Israel. Egypt seems to be the only option at this point if Egyptian authorities can be convinced to allow that to happen.There's an urgent push to try to find, locate, free hostages taken by Hamas, believed to be more than a hundred, Islamic Jihad also claiming to have around 30. Unknown number of Americans among them. The top U.S. hostage official is with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, about to depart from Israel and I should point out we are expecting to hear comments from Athony Blinken at any moment. We'll try to bring that to you live. The country of Qatar is also involved, mediating talks between Israel and Hamas regarding the any potential release of women and children. Hamas stated days ago that this is not the time to discuss any kind of hostage negotiation while there is ongoing conflict. That remains to be seen, if any progress on that front with the involvement of Qatar. I want to go on the ground right now with CNN's Nic Robertson, who I believe, still in Sderot at this hour.

So, it appears that these, these guys are not recent to come in. They may well have come in on Saturday, maybe late Saturday, maybe Sunday before the border was beginning to be shored up and have gone to ground with that sole aim of getting out and attacking. So, I think this, this speaks to the issue that, you know, when you have 1500 members of Hamas, their fighters coming in here through multiple holes along this long border fence on Saturday morning. If you have 1500 that have been accounted for, then it's logical that there will be some that are unaccounted for and, and the accounting is still going on.The IDF will be adding another two or three tonight close to here to the tally of Hamas they've found now that I think that they would expect to find more. And I think that's it's it stands to reason you have so many flood in over the weekend that there's likely a few still holding out, hiding out some places.",

And that was very much like the salvo just before, at the top of the hour. They tracked through the sky. I was able to watch them behind, behind John. I can still see the comm trails of where they came up from the Iron Dome launch site. And as soon as I saw those little traces come up that we were catching on the camera, John was catching on the camera. We know because we've seen it for a number of days now, that means there's rockets coming from Gaza.We couldn't see the rockets coming, but those intercepts, those bangs that you heard, that was the Iron Dome interceptors connecting with the rockets. And again, you can't overemphasize it. In somewhere like Sderot, that's so close to the border with Gaza, when rockets are fired from the Gaza, from Gaza, there are literally seconds, seconds, for the Iron Dome to spring into action. And that's what we saw. And it's remarkable as well, because the Iron Dome was, I would say their interceptor missiles were in the sky two to three seconds before the tannoy across the town here came on telling people, you know, danger close, get to the shelter, stay in the shelter. So, you know, the best indicator, if you're under attack in this place at least, is to be able to see the Iron Dome taken to the sky. And that, you know, that's what we saw play out here. And I think we're just, I think we may be seeing rockets coming up from Gaza, just seeing another one coming up. So, I think we might get some more. Yep, intercepts coming up.",

So, the use of those interceptors at this Iron Dome system has proved critically important.And Nic, you talked about rockets still coming from Gaza. It's important to point out, the last time I was reporting from Gaza City during bombardments, during a back and forth between Israel and Hamas, you could see when you were in Gaza City, you could see Hamas rockets being fired from civilian areas, from regular streets, from residential areas, from buildings all around.

So, what they do is they minimize their time on the ground. They'll keep those rocket systems in bunkers under houses. They'll come out into the orchard behind the houses and then set them off and then go back underground in tunnels and into those deep bunkers where they know they can get some safety from the shells that are likely to follow in. And we've just heard a round of explosions coming from Gaza, so it would seem that there was return fire. It sounded like, to me, it sounded like artillery being fired back in.But yes, Hamas hide among the population. And again, to your point, it is very difficult for the Israeli defense forces to target those launch sites without the risk and actual collateral damage, without civilians getting killed and injured. And that's what we've been witnessing over the past few days, the death toll among Palestinians. -- (CROSSTALK)",

We're just learning that there was a meeting between Congressman Scalise and Jim Jordan, who he defeated to get the Republican nomination. LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENTI just want to rewind a little bit back in the room behind me. The House Republican Conference voted to nominate Steve Scalise by a simple majority. That vote was 111 to 99. But that is a far cry from the 217 votes that Steve Scalise will actually need on the floor. So that is what we are watching very closely right now.

And it is simply heartbreaking.Not since ISIS have we seen this kind of depravity. And we will continue to stand very resolutely against it. When I'm in Israel, I'll have the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Herzog, other senior officials. I look forward to seeing our embassy teams as well that's been doing terrific work during these difficult days. We're determined to make sure that Israel gets everything it needs to defend itself, to provide for the security of its people. Already significant military assistance requested by Israel is on the way. That's on top of everything that we've been doing for years, including with the Memorandum of Understanding that was negotiated by President Obama to make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself. At the same time, we anticipate there'll be further needs, further requests. We've already been working closely with Congress on this, and we look forward to continuing to do that to make sure that Israel has what it needs. Second, we will be reiterating, reaffirming the very strong message that President Biden has delivered to any country or any party that might try to take advantage of this situation. And that message is don't. The President has deployed, as you know, the world's largest aircraft carrier group to the region to make very clear our intent to deter anyone contemplating any further aggression against Israel. Finally, we're of course very focused on our own people, our own citizens. We lost 22 Americans. That number could still go up, and it probably will. At the same time, we have a number of Americans who remain unaccounted. We are working very closely with the government of Israel to determine their whereabouts, and if they have been taken hostage by Hamas, to work to secure their release. So, all of these things are on the agenda over the next day or so with Israel, but the main point is this. We stand with Israel. We'll continue to do so.",

Well, he plans to nominate Scalise on the floor of the House to be the next speaker.This is a welcome news for Scalise, undoubtedly, because he will need Jordan support, the backing of Jordan allies in order to get over the finish line. But that doesn't mean that he will have the votes to be elected. In fact, there are a number of members who are simply not there. Some of them are saying that they will potentially vote for another candidate altogether on the floor or they want to hear more from Scalise, want to have meetings from him asking for potential deals, potential concessions, things that we saw Kevin McCarthy have to do to win the ballot after win the speakership after 15 ballots back in January. And in a very in a warning sign to Scalise, one Republican member told me that Scalise will, quote, never be elected speaker. That was the words of this one Republican member. We'll see if that's actually comes out to be true. But a sign of the challenges that the speaker nominee Scalise faces here because of the same issues that Kevin McCarthy faced, a narrowly divided Republican majority where any five members can scuttle your plans and can push you out of the speakership. Now, Scalise will have to figure out behind the scenes how to appease those critics, what deals to make with them in order to get the votes to be elected speaker, because until that point, nothing will get done in this house. It will remain paralyzed as it has been since the ouster of Kevin McCarthy last week until they elect another speaker. No aid to Israel, which the president has called for as soon as next week. No aid to Ukraine, which has been stalled for some time and no action towards avoiding a government shutdown by mid-November. All key issues Republicans say they want to start to tackle.
