Supply has been constrained, and the president made a reference to more than one country that has created geopolitical challenges. Obviously, the reason the initial proposal to really lay out an unprecedented $180 million -- barrels released over the course of six months was because of President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Now you can add OPEC Plus, in particular Saudi Arabia, and their decision to drop their output targets by 2 million barrels a week and a half ago that really helped spur this on.I think it's not just the 15 million barrels, but it's also the president declaring quite publicly that he was willing to consider more releases in the future. Those are both clear messages to the market, so is the administration's plan to try and set a floor for how they buy back to restock the strategic petroleum reserves in the years ahead. One thing to keep in mind here is whether or not this is politically based, you know, White House officials keenly aware of the correlation between gas prices, the president's approval, the Democratic Party's approval.

And the problem with that is, of course, Russia doesn't even have control over much of those areas. So, it's not going to make a lot of difference to the situation on the ground in many cases. Although it will mean that in the areas that Russia does control, that will be a sort of military authority or military government that takes over from the civilian authorities there.More interestingly, I think, is the fact that Russia -- Vladimir Putin has also extended heightened security to areas of Russia proper, like the border areas bordering Ukraine, where there's now going to be travel restrictions, there's now going to be intensive vehicle checks, a much greater presence of military forces. There, of course, have been a lot of attacks from inside Ukraine into those border areas of Russia as well. And so, it's perhaps a response to that. Moreover, across the rest of the country like Moscow, the capital city as well, governors around the country have been given authority to impose special powers and restrictions as and when they see fit. The mayor of Moscow says that's not going to have an impact on the daily rhythm of people's lives in the Russian capital, at least, but there is a concern that this martial law that's been imposed in territories in Ukraine, could be extended if necessary across the rest of the country as well.

CNN has reached out to the Iranian mission at the United Nations for a response.Let's talk about all this now with retired Army Major General James \"Spider\" Marks, a CNN military analyst. General, good to see you again. Let me start here with this declaration of martial law. These four areas, they already have Russian-installed civilian leadership, there's already a strong Russian military presence there, how much does this declaration change daily life for the Ukrainians who are living in these regions? JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Victor, I think it changes it very little. Like we've seen the Russian forces have demonstrated what they're capable of doing on the ground. I don't think that this declaration alters any of that. I think what really Putin is trying to do with this declaration is to create a military isolation zone. He's a limited movement within Russia along the border area. And then within these four annexed areas, or at least he's declared that they're annexed, clearly they're being contested -- quite effectively being contested, is he's creating this isolation zone where it's almost like anything goes. Look, there are rules that govern combat. We know that. There's the moral application of force. We know that. The Russians don't abide by any of this. And so, I think this is Putin's effort. Again, his primary audience is a domestic internal audience. And he is declaring that he's trying to make it crystal clear that this is a military operation, we want to make sure everybody can move off the streets, can have their safe -- they're safe and security zones, but the military is going to be conducting operations. The world, the external audience, the world understands that this is nonsense. And we've been seeing this for quite some time.
