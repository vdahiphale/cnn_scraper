Plus, the debt ceiling cliff, the gulf between Republicans and Democrats widening the default date when the U.S. government runs out of cash getting closer perhaps as soon as June. And the glacier that seems to be U.S.-China relations, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning in a major speech that U.S. National Security Trumps its economic interests amid this growing superpower rivalry. We'll discuss the frosty state of affairs with Eurasia and GZERO media found it Ian Bremmer. Earth Day an increasingly important day too for multinational corporations. IKEA's U.S. CEO, will discuss his firm's dramatic new expansion stateside, as well as its planet friendly policies.

Now a busy show as always and we begin this hour with the latest from Sudan. Leaders at the Sudanese army have agreed to a three day ceasefire proposed by the opposition paramilitary group, the RSF. It coincides with Eid, the Muslim holiday celebrating the end of Ramadan. So far more than 400 people have lost their lives in the conflict, according to the World Health Organization. Nima Elbagir joins us now to discuss. Nima, as we've seen now on a number of occasions proposing a ceasefire and adhering to it are very different things. What have we seen so far?",

This is a town that of course has been a major staging area for Russian forces operated in Ukraine. Only two people were injured according to the Mayor of Belgorod, two women. But as we saw in that CCTV video, the bomb fell on a sidewalk by this very busy road in the middle of town, causing one car just to fly up in the air and land on the roof of a nearby building.

But of course, lots of individuals have access to it. Now here, you're talking about some 21 year old junior IT staff or in the Massachusetts Air National Guard, not working with the Russians, or the Chinese or anyone else just showing off with some of his friends. So I mean the surprise is that this happens as rarely, as it does, at least in a public way. I will also say that on the basis of my conversations with leaders in the G7, none of what I saw from the intelligence leaks was particularly new, and was surprising. So in other words, this was mostly known by almost everybody out there. And the idea that, well, this is disinformation, because the Russians happen to have changed a few of the slides to make it look like they're losing fewer troops, the Ukrainians are losing more, that doesn't change the fact that this is actually real intelligence, and does reflect the actual disposition of analysis of the Americans and others. As to the state of play around Russia, Ukraine, right now, it puts Ukraine under more pressure, because there is there is the fact that the Americans don't actually think that the Ukrainians can take much more land. And if that's true, then at some point, the Americans are going to be shifting towards a how do we start negotiations position, which, by the way, is where the French are right now?

That's why Turkey has had such a significant role in potentially vetoing Finland and Sweden, why it's taken a long time. So if Hungary decides they never want Ukraine in, Ukraine never gets it. Let's recognize that, right. I mean, it's not as if the Americans can just decide this unilaterally. But I think what's more important here is the level of commitment to bringing the Ukrainians into the EU. It's the level of commitment to providing real time defense support, and intelligence support for the Ukrainians, none of which they would have gotten if Russia hadn't invaded Ukraine. So of course, the Ukrainians have lost land. They've lost a lot of people they've been terrorized 8 million refugees that never comes back.

But of course, you know, if you're Trump and you're running a grievance based campaign, the fact that people with a lot of money, don't want the average Republican voter in the base to support Trump is a feature not a bug for Trump's campaign. So it does make him stronger. It is part of why the anti-establishment forces in the U.S. continue to do so well.

I look to the innovators and the helpers and those trying to solve this massive problem. But I'm also humbled by the sheer size of it. You realize the challenge; we've kicked this can down the road for so long, that now over a trillion tonnes of carbon must be pulled out of the sea and sky. And I got an amazing metaphor to help us sort of conceptualize this from a scientist's fisherman in Maine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEIR (voice over): While he was studying robotic engineering at Dartmouth and Earth Systems at Columbia, he realized a manmade monster was destroying his beloved Gulf of Maine, warming it up at a rate now faster than 95 percent of the rest of the world. MARTY ODLIN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, RUNNING TIDE: It's a Godzilla. There's this thing out there and it's like ruining everything that we love or hate. All the good stuff is getting ruined. All the stuff that's free and fun. It's burning forests down, it's stealing our fish. It's devastating our crops, it's hurting our farmers get mad and go kill that thing, right. WEIR (voice over): And right there on a dock in Maine, Marty's metaphor is a light bulb moment for me, a whole new way to think about a giant problem that began when people figured out how to move lots and lots of carbon, that stuff of ancient life. From the slow cycle locked in rock and under oceans, into the fast cycle in the seawater and the sky, and we've moved so much carbon. That monster now weighs a trillion tons give or takes more than every living thing on earth. So not only do we have to stop making the monster bigger, we have to catch it, chop it up and bury the pieces back into the slow cycle was something called carbon removal.",

And he's floating these off in the North Atlantic off of Iceland now as that kelp grows up to two feet a day. The weight of it will then sink down to the bottom of the ocean where that carbon is locked away hopes to scale this up on a grand scale. He also works with oysters, which are big, carbon devouring little machines that nature has designed for us. And I found all kinds of ideas both bio-mimicry that uses earth systems, but new machines that pull this stuff out of the sea and sky and pump it below but we have to pay for this. This is a trillion-dollar industry nobody's talking about; it is essentially building the petrochemical industry in reverse, Big Oil in reverse to try to lock that carbon Godzilla away.
