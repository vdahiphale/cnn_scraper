But early voting is already in full swing across several states. And overnight, fierce debates, candidates in Ohio, Georgia, Iowa and Utah going toe-to-toe in heated rounds, featuring policy arguments and personal jabs, and a new pledge, President Biden promising to keep abortion rights front and center if Democrats can keep control of the Congress for another two years. Let's begin this hour with CNN's Jeremy Diamond at the White House. So, let's pick up there, Jeremy. You have new reporting about how President Biden is hoping to take action on abortion while also keeping the economy front and center. What is the White House saying?",

      "sentences": "Yes, exactly, Bianna. With three weeks left until Election Day, President Biden is doing everything he can to try and push those issues. The Democrats view is it is favorable to them right, front and center in voter's minds. And today, we're expecting, according to a Democratic official, for the president to make a new promise as it relates to abortion rights in a speech this afternoon at Howard Theater here in Washington, D.C. The president will promise that the first bill he sends to the next Congress will be to codify Roe versus Wade, meaning the abortion rights in that Supreme Court case, and that he will then sign that bill into law around the 50th anniversary.Of course, this promise is contingent, the president will say, on Democrats electing more senators, more Democrats to the Senate and also holding on to their major in the House. Neither of those two things are easy feats. We know that President Biden has previously said that he would like to see a carve-out in the filibuster in the Senate so that abortion rights can be enshrined into law. But one of the things that's holding him back from that, not only do Democrats not have a filibuster-proof majority, but even with the current majority that they have, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, two moderate Democrats, have said that they oppose that kind of a filibuster carve-out. So, the president would need another two Democratic senators to join in on that and to be willing to join in on that effort, and also holding on to the House, which right now is not clear that Democrats will be able to do that. We saw, of course, over the summer following the decision by the Supreme Court to strike down Roe v. Wade, a huge gust of momentum on Democrats' side following those decisions. Clearly, abortion rights is something that is galvanizing the Democratic base. But more recently, in the last few weeks, over the last month, we've seen inflation remaining stubbornly high, gas prices beginning to come up again, and most recently polling suggesting that voters are far more concerned about the economy, about inflation, about prices going up than they are about this issue of abortion. Nonetheless, Democrats believe that this can be a galvanizing factor for them with their base, with key demographics, like women in the suburbs. But, again, this going to be a question in the next few weeks, Democrats trying to push this issue front and center and the president today certainly doing his part there. Bianna?",

This is country who has been enriched by migrants from all corners of the world. There is no -- and the problem -- SENATE CANDIDATE J.D.

Meanwhile, Abrams really characterizing what she viewed as the failures of the Kemp administration, arguing that his policies on everything, from guns to abortion, are just too extreme.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE STACEY ABRAMS (D-GA): I believe that we can protect the Second Amendment and protect second graders at the exact same time. Because of the criminal carry law that Brian Kemp signed into law, there is no longer a background check for those who have concealed carry permits. That makes all of us less safe. We know that the right to vote is the only way that we can make the changes we need in the state, the only way we can make the changes we need in this country, whether it is access to the right to an abortion, the ability to take care of our families. We need a governor who believes in access to the right to vote and not in voter suppression, which is the hallmark of Brian Kemp's leadership. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): Just this past May in our primaries, we, again, had record turnout in the Republican primary and the Democratic primary. In Georgia, it is easy to vote and hard to cheat.

But, Karoun, let me start with you on what seems to be a standout theme from all of these debates we've covered. Yes, they talked about everything, from crime to abortion, to critical race theory, but the economy really loomed large. What does that do in terms of where we stand three weeks before voters head to the polls for Democrats in particular who a couple of weeks ago were feeling pretty good about this election? A couple of economic reports though have really dimmed things for them.",

And so Democrats are feeling good when the numbers were starting swing in a more positive direction. Gas prices coming down, then feeling like they had the momentum going into their favor.But I think several polls have shown that the economy issue often swings well for the GOP, just in terms of how they're messaging it. And so this kind of puts us in the situation which most people are anticipating, we're going to be seeing, which is that you're going to have a GOP takeover of the House, ending up with a divided Washington and a divided government in Congress too, most likely. That is going to open the gateway for a lot of these other issues that we're seeing debated. Yes, the abortion issue, yes, the economic issues, yes, security issues, and also just what the relationship is going to be between Congress and the presidency since we have a GOP that has already pledged to try to impeach the president and everybody on down the chain in the cabinet, or at least try.",

It is sort of a reminder to people about Roe v. Wade being overturned, especially when the conversation right now is pivoting back to these economic issues that really hurt Democrats right now.But I think we can kind of say at this point, because Democrats speak too early, it is more a question of how bad is this going to be for them. Obviously, things are moving back in the direction of Republicans. They do seem like they're going to flip the House. But will Biden be able to hold control of the Senate? Will the Democrats be able to do that? That's obviously very much still up in the air and that is why the president is putting this issue out there, continuing to talk about abortion, which very much brings Democratic voters out and could help them in the polls.",

The general narrative is that Republicans just sided with the president. Democrats did absolutely everything they could and they just couldn't withstand the overwhelming support and rally around the flag that the Republicans did around Trump. And we found that that wasn't really completely the case. There were moments where the GOP was so angry at President Trump, especially around the January 6 riot against the Capitol, that they were ready to break with him, but Democrats didn't take advantage of those moments. We also found instances where Democrats had the opportunity to call Republican witnesses, to run down their subpoenas to the courts, to prove that you cannot mess with Congress when it comes to their right to oversee, check, flex their full constitutional muscle against a rogue president, and they chose not to, because they were worried about the political blowback about potential situations at the polls that they found inconvenient.

She wanted it done by Christmas.

And then even after the second, which you could argue was the most important impeachment in our history, given Trump incited a riot on the Capitol, it was done before you could blink. Jamie Raskin was trying to call in Republican witnesses and really wanted to build a case to try to persuade Republicans at a time when Trump was the most vulnerable he has ever been, and instead, we show in the book how he was shut down by his own party. People like Chuck Schumer, who clearly did not want a long trial because he wanted to start working on the Biden agenda, the White House snubbing requests for evidence and to try to bring Secret Service in, in that moment.
