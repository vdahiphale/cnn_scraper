Previous heads of state like Omar al- Bashir of Sudan traveled to several countries that should have arrested them, and he did -- they didn't. But it certainly further isolates the president. And though the Russian authorities and the Kremlin have rubbished these warrants, they are just the beginning, I think. You have on a daily basis, prosecutors and investigators here in Ukraine looking into possible war crimes. And I think this issue, this very powerful and very sad issue of children separated from their parents still to this day, is maybe just the tip of the iceberg.

This is the statement from the National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson.She says, quote, \"There is no doubt that Russia is committing war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine, and we have been clear that those responsible must be held accountable. The ICC prosecutor is an independent actor and makes his own prosecutorial decisions based on the evidence before him. We support accountability for perpetrators of war crimes.\" And as you see there, there is not explicit support for this decision by the ICC. And that is in part because the United States is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court. And in fact, the U.S. has a long history of rejecting the ICC's jurisdiction, specifically as it relates to U.S. personnel, for example, investigating and indicting U.S. personnel. We know that there has been a debate inside the administration over providing support to the International Criminal Court. But interestingly, there is a growing bipartisan consensus that the administration should do exactly that. In fact, in December, Congress passed a new law that removed long standing restrictions on the U.S. providing support to the International Criminal Court, which could pave the way for the Biden administration to provide that kind of support going forward. That still is an open question mark. In the meantime, though, Jake, administration officials have told me that they have provided support to other venues that are investigating Russian war crimes in Ukraine, notably the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office.

I think that the question here is that this a conflict of interest that Biden's family members were receiving these types of payments when he was in office as vice president. And what the -- what he knew then when he was vice president, which I will say the laptop appears to prove that he did no some sort of idea of the business deal, the text messages or emails saying and alluding to that he knew.

It does show a pattern that the Biden family was receiving money directly from China. It looks like it was influenced peddling. And if so, that's illegal. Every American should be concerned about that. This is an issue of national security. This just shows how deep the Biden family was involved in this influence peddling scene. The White House was saying it wasn't true. This is a way chide. The Republicans are just digging. Now we have evidence.

Now there are still redactions. So there are still mysteries here.But I think first and foremost, it was one week after the murders took place that they got a search warrant for Walmart Incorporated, and they asked them for all of their business records in regard to purchases of a KA-BAR sheath and a KA-BAR knife. They wanted all documentation whatever -- whatsoever they can find. And then there is a receipt and return and it shows that they asked for a particular KA-BAR sheath and a KA-BAR straight edged knife which is the knife that KA-BAR which goes back to 1898. This is a very famous company. This is the knife they are known for. And if you remember that probable cause affidavit showed that the wounds they believe were from a straight edge blade. Now I spoke with former today. He said that they believe that -- he believes they wanted a knife, the one they believed was the missing murder weapon to see if it matched at that point of time, one week after the murders, the wounds. Now one week later, they went to KA-BAR, the company itself asking for all of their business records of all of the purchasers of those knives from January 1st of 2022 to the present, which would have been November of 2022. And they go on to ask for surveillance video from a bank that is 1 mile away from the crime scene of the murders in the hours surrounding when those murders took place. Why they want that surveillance video? We don't know but they asked for it. They also asked for UPS truck video, the delivery truck UPS in Pullman, Washington, where Bryan Kohberger lived. And that would have been in November surrounding the days of the murders. Why? They have to have probable cause to get each and every warrant, Jake, and they go on all the social media sites, all of the computers, the forensics, they asked for all of that also from every company. And every company that I'm reading complied with those search warrants.",
