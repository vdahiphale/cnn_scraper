They've been linked to cancer, they've been linked to prenatal development issues, they've been linked to liver effects, they've been linked to immune effects.And here's what the proposed regulation will do. First of all, this regulates just six forever chemicals, just six of thousands, and I will say more about that in a minute. Water systems have about three years to comply, so these regulations could take effect, like, let's say, around end of the year, they would then have three years to comply. And it's unclear what the penalties would be for not complying, and water systems can raise rates if they say they need to in order to comply with these regulations. So, it is possible that people will seeing higher rates. Now, I mentioned that this was for only six chemicals when there are thousands. These are six chemicals for which there is particularly clear evidence, or at least very strong suggestions, studies have shown, that there is a link to human health. But the Biden administration says that they are continuing to look at other chemicals like these to see if they should be regulated as well. Jim, Erica.",

Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court is about to face a federal judge in Texas. So, this is all focused on the approval of a medical abortion pill, and the lawsuit is actually seeking to revoke the FDA's approval of mifepristone, that's one of the two drugs that are used in a medicated abortion. Here's the thing, a federal judge in Texas scheduled that hearing for Wednesday, for tomorrow, after reports that he had sought to delay an announcement at the hearing because, of \"Barrage of death threats\". CNN Legal Analyst and former general prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers joining us now. So, this is getting a lot of attention for multiple reasons. The minute you talk about abortion, you're going to get a lot of attention. But I want to pull the abortion part of it out for just a minute because I think there are some other glaring developments that we should touch on. So, first of all, let's talk about this hearing. So, the judge wanted to keep the hearing secret until basically the night before. Saying he was worried about protests, worried about dissent that would also potentially limit journalist access because getting to Amarillo, Texas is not easy. So, if they didn't actually announce it until tonight for a hearing that's tomorrow, can you -- I mean, does that read to you, like, a partisan judge actively working to limit first amendment rights of Americans who may want to be there to either cover the trial, to speak out wherever they may fall there?",

It's not consistent with the long- standing access of the public to courts. All court proceedings are presumptively open and accessible to the public.They have to be promptly docketed so that people can see that and attend if they wish to do so. That's not just the press, that's also members of the public who might be concerned with the proceeding. Only in rare circumstances is a proceeding not to supposed to be open. So, this was is clearly an attempt to stop people and press from being at this hearing. The judge says, it's for security reasons and so on. But I think we can all see that what it really is, is an attempt to keep people who are very concerned that he is about drastically limit the access of millions of women to medical abortion from being there and from making their views heard.

There's never been an instance where anyone has overturned the ruling of the FDA against the FDA's wishes. And the notion that it has been 23 years and the FDA has repeatedly reaffirmed the efficacy and safety of this drug makes it sort of ridiculous.And also, just the separation of powers issue. I mean, you have here a just in the judicial branch saying to both the executive branch, the FDA who are the subject matter experts here, you have gotten it wrong, and to Congress. I mean, we had the whole huge Supreme Court decision last term, the EPA case versus -- West Virginia versus EPA where the courts had basically that the Congress should have the say over the executive agencies, the notion that the courts are not going to step into the subject matter expertise is ridiculous. So, you know, I hope the judge doesn't do it. His anti-abortion leaning suggests that he might, but we are all on tenterhooks waiting to see.",

But the notion of a single judge issuing a nationwide injunction, having the power to do that is really problematic to a lot of people. You know, there are some potential fixes (ph) here. Congress couldstep in, they could order that any seeking of a nationwide injunction would have to go, for example, to a three-judge panel instead of just a single judge. But this is a lot of power in the hands of one person. And especially when you think about the judge -- that's happening here, he's the only judge in this division. They specifically incorporated their alliance in the Amarillo division in order to get Judge Kacsmaryk because of his anti-abortion views in his lack of hesitance to Trump at them. So, you know, given all of that, it's really important, I think, that Congress does something about these nationwide injunctions in the hands of one person.",

Then women and their healthcare providers would have to find a work-around. I mean, this drug is used as one part of a two-part regimen. It can be done without this drug. Apparently, it's not quite as efficacious if you do it that way, there's bigger health concerns, but it can be done.So, I expect they'll just have to find a way to work around.
