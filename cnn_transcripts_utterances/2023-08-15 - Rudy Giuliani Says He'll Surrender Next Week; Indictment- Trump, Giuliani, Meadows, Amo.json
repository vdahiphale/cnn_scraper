Oher claims the couple saw him as, quote, \"A gullible young man whose athletic talent could be exploited for their own benefit.\" He wants the conservatorship to end, and an accounting of the money earned from his name.

Will it work? We'll see.As for Trump's next move, it's a lot like his previous ones. He is now claiming, finally, he has the evidence, to prove the election was stolen, when he has failed to do so, for nearly three years. Also tonight, there is growing desperation and frustration being felt throughout Hawaii, a week after the deadly wildfires broke out. People are still missing. Fires are still burning. And families are still waiting for word, on their missing loved ones. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, we are learning new details, following last night's indictment, including on where Donald Trump will likely be surrendering. The Fulton County Sheriff's Office says that he is expected to be booked, at the Fulton County Jail. The big question, tonight, of course, is still when. The Sheriff's office said, in a new statement that it is expected, all 19 criminal defendants, named in the new indictment, will be booked there. There are 10 more days, for this group, to voluntarily turn themselves in. Jail's open 24/7. The Sheriff's Office says they can come whenever they want. In the meantime, Trump is focusing on proving claims that he has been making, without basis, for nearly three years now. The former President is now promising to finally reveal evidence, next Monday, about his election fraud claims. Maggie Haberman has reporting on what's behind those so-called plans. And she'll join me in just a moment. It's important to note though, Trump's claims have never been proven, in any venue, or any courtroom. That's something that the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, noted today, after Trump teased that news conference saying quote, \"The 2020 election in Georgia was not stolen.\" Meanwhile, Trump's attorney turned co-defendant Rudy Giuliani weighed in today on when he expects to turn himself in.

It's not just in the law, but it's also in the number of people that are involved. There are names you know, people you would recognize, like Trump's former White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, the former Mayor of New York, turned personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, as well as other attorneys, who you saw frequently, on TV, or around the Oval Office, in the days after the 2020 election. But then there are other lives that have now been forever altered by their connection to Donald Trump, in that time, like the president of a swimming pool company, a Police chaplain, a mixed martial arts fighter. They are all now accused of taking part in this criminal enterprise. Prosecutors claimed that the corrupt organization that was reached, not just from the Oval Office, but all the way to the former publicist of Kanye West, and even a bail bondsman, who was caught on tape, trying to access voting machines. I'm joined now, by a pair of former federal prosecutors, Elie Honig; and Temidayo Aganga-Williams, who was also Senior Investigative Counsel for the January 6 congressional committee, and was maybe on air until 2 AM, with me, last night. Elie, let's start with you. I mean, if you look at the 19 people, one of those faces, Mark Meadows, is now already trying to get his case moved, from the state court, to a federal court. Obviously, that's something we're hearing Trump is also going to try to do. You think they'll be successful? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: It's an interesting and, I think, important gambit, by Mark Meadows. And surely Donald Trump will follow. This body of law goes back to the early 1900s. And it basically says if somebody, who was a federal official, gets charged criminally, by a state or a county, as in a D.A., then if the conduct relates to your job, as a federal official, you can move over to federal court. I think we don't -- I think it's a 50-50 chance if he succeeds. But if he does, here's what it means. It means, first of all, he gets a much better jury pool, because instead of just drawing, from Fulton County, which went 72 percent to 26 percent, against Donald Trump, now you're drawing, from the northern counties of Georgia, some of which went 60 percent, 70 percent, for Donald Trump. But more importantly, if he'd get into federal court, the next move, if they win, they're going to ask to dismiss, on the basis of immunity. They're going to say, \"As federal officials, we're immune.\" That's how high the stakes are.",

I think here, it is a novel issue, whether President Trump was acting under color of law here. But I think the distinction that's really important here is drawing the line, between candidate Trump, and President Trump. And what's clear is that committing crimes, while being a federal official, does not grant you immunity.

It's not clear that those were ones that Trump sent.I mean, what would they be looking for, in those Direct Messages of his? AGANGA-WILLIAMS: Well, at the core of any criminal case is defendant's state of mind. Prosecutors are consistently trying to get into what the defendant was thinking, to show that he had criminal intent. And here, President Trump, still to this day, continues to argue that he wasn't acting improperly, that he didn't mean anything, to do anything illegal here. So Direct Messages, when it's not in the public spotlight, his private thoughts? That could be key evidence against him.",

Joining me now, Asa Hutchinson, the former Governor of Arkansas, a former U.S. attorney, of course, as we noted, who has prosecuted these types of cases. Good evening, Governor, and thanks for being here. You've now had time, to read this indictment. How worried do you think that Trump and these 18 co-defendants should be? ASA HUTCHINSON, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think they're very frustrated that these charges are brought in state court. They see this as something that's going to be all-consuming, and it's going to drag on for some time. So, these are serious charges. It's a difficult environment for them. And there's a lot of work to be done. And the biggest challenge both for the prosecution, and the defense, is that there's multiple, multiple defendants. And that complicates the trial, in every way. I don't see how this case can be resolved, before the election. I think it'll be one of the last ones that will be resolved. And quite frankly, I think the state prosecutor, in Georgia, should have deferred, to Jack Smith, and the Special Counsel, as they have investigated and pursued the indictment, surrounding January 6. That from my experience is what ordinarily happens, whenever you have overlapping federal jurisdiction and state jurisdiction. The Federal jurisdiction usually is deferred to by the state prosecutor.",

And so, it is substantive, in state court. It should stick in state court, in the sense that I don't think it'll be subject to a dismissal. There is a question as whether it can be removed to federal court. But it does fit within the Georgia racketeering charges.

This is now the fourth time that Trump has been indicted. I know we hear, from Democrats, obviously every time that those indictments have come down.

ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I think that there are still a great many Americans, who are going to be very interested to watch these trials. And I'm particularly grateful that in Georgia, that trial is likely to be televised. I've been urging the Judicial Conference, and wrote a letter to that Conference, with dozens of my colleagues, urging that the federal proceedings, be televised, because I think it's going to be enormously important that those people, who have an open mind, get to watch that. It's not filtered, in one way or another. So, I applaud the hard work of the grand jury, in Fulton County, the willingness to go forward.

But here, you have kind of a sprawling, organized criminal effort, to overturn the election.

In many respects, not only was the Congress ahead of the Justice Department, in its investigation, for a long time, but so was Georgia. And now, it's true, the Feds ultimately sought the indictment first. But having put all of that effort in, I can see why Georgia prosecutors wanted to bring it before the grand jury.
