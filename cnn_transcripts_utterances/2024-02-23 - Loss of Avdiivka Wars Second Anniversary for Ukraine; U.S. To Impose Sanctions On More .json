These are known to be increasingly in use on the battlefield and capable of evading Ukrainian air defenses.

There is really three main restrictions that we could see you mentioned one of them, and that is that special plane that's supposed to bring the body to Moscow. Well, one of the conditions on that is that Alexei Navalny's mother is not allowed to announce when the body is to arrive before it has arrived. So obviously, they're trying to keep all that under wraps, allegedly, so that people won't show up at the airport.Another thing that we also discerned is that at the whole time on the ground until the funeral, a member of the Investigative Committee and employee of Russia's Investigative Committee has to be with the family of Alexei Navalny. So obviously, trying to keep the family under wraps as well. Also, allegedly, the body is supposed to be kept either in the Moscow or Vladimir Region and the Anti-Corruption Foundation believes that's because the Russian authorities fear that people could try and storm the morgue, again the Russian authorities themselves haven't commented on this. Another two things that we're hearing as well is that apparently, the cemetery of choice of Alexei Navalny's mother has been denied to her, apparently some arrangement has been made there and they have not yet agreed on a farewell hall either. Obviously, the Anti-Corruption Foundation is saying that Alexei Navalny's mother has been forced to agree to all this under threats. And we did hear some of that from her earlier today when she said that she really wanted all the people who are obviously devastated who feel that the death of Alexei Navalny is a personal loss for them to be able to say goodbye to Alexei Navalny and a volunteer to be able to see his body that has been denied to her. She also said that the authorities threatened her and said time is not in on her side, saying quote, the corpse is beginning to rot. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There was a significantly smaller number of prisoners at the beginning of the war than there are right now.And there was no demand from Hamas at the beginning to end the war when they thought that they were actually on the road to what they called liberating Palestine. Right now, it's much more complicated because Hamas is demanding from Israel to end the war and withdraw from Gaza, while Hamas is still in command of the Gaza Strip, as well as releasing in exchange for hostages all the prisoners in Israel, especially those who have murdered Israelis over the year, and there are 559 of them serving life sentences, and hundreds of other Hamas fighters who have been taken out of Gaza since the beginning of the war.",

And what I would say with regard to Netanyahu and his rejection of the idea is that it's true, it won't happen while he's Prime Minister, but he won't be Prime Minister for very much longer. He's at the end of his political career, the Israeli public is fed up with him and holds them responsible for what happened on October 7, the lack of Israel's ability to defend itself.

And that's a, you know, that's a couple of generations. If you think about it, there's no institutional memory and how to do this. The people who did it a long since retired are no longer with us, unfortunately. And so this is a whole new generation learning how to do it and doing it in a different way. You and I are old enough to remember, as Neil Armstrong and Apollo 11 was on his way to the surface of the moon. If he had relied on the autopilot, they would have gone straight into a boulder it would have been a disaster. But the human being in the loop managed to take control and save the day.

And, you know, NASA has a lot of its plate between the International Space Station, its science mission, and this effort to return to the moon and hopefully one day go to Mars. So it may be, you know, one too many things right now. And that's why I don't know how soon it's going to be that this happens. But I do like the idea that NASA is approaching it this time not to plant flags and the footprints behind, but with an idea of creating a sustained presence on another planet.

So there is a loose partnership there. Of course, notably, absent would be the Chinese and the Russians, who are going their own way. And I sort of have to think about it like how we've explored Antarctica, multi nation effort coming at it from different angles, different parts of the world.
