The White House says one of the Americans being held captive by Hamas is a 3-year-old children whose parents were killed in the October 7th attacks. Israeli officials say more than 200 hostages remain inside Gaza as intense fighting continues there. Of those hostages they say more than 30 are children with the youngest being a 9-year-old baby. Meanwhile, the Israeli army says it's conducting raids deeper into Gaza City, capturing 20 suspects -- terror suspects it says were involved in the attacks. Let's start with CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak in Delaware. Kevin, very interesting that we saw this information emerge earlier this evening with the White House saying that this 3-year-old is one of the American hostages being held by Hamas.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. The timing is interesting. As it appears, there's intensifying pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to secure a deal to release these hostages. You saw large protests in Israel over the weekend of Israelis calling on Netanyahu to do more, and now the White House saying that one of those hostages is this 3-year-old toddler. They revealed that information in a readout of a phone call that President Biden held with the Emir of Qatar.You'll remember, Jim, Qatar is acting as a broker in these talks between Hamas, Israel, the United States, Egypt, all of these partners who are trying to come up with an agreement to secure the release of these 200-plus hostages that are being held in Gaza. Now the White House didn't reveal any more information about this toddler aside from the fact that their parents were very tragically killed in the Hamas attacks on October 7th. I am told that this is the youngest of the American hostages, it is the only minor. We did hear from the National Security adviser Jake Sullivan earlier today that there are nine American citizens unaccounted for, one green card holder, not all of them may be held hostage, some of them may have passed away, the U.S. just doesn't know. But certainly these conversations are very intensely happening among all of these parties to try and secure the release of these hostages. Jake Sullivan today wouldn't put a timeline on these talks saying that he had thought previously that they were close and then it didn't happen, but certainly the talks are ongoing. What the U.S. says is that there will need to be a significant pause if all of those hostages are to be released at the same time. So far only a handful have been released, including an American, a mother and a daughter. The U.S. says that that had been a pilot case and they do want to expand to try and get all of those hostages out -- Jim.",

He's the host of \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS.\" Fareed, I guess I wanted to start off by talking about this 3-year-old American that is said to be among the hundreds of hostages being held by Hamas. Why do you suppose the White House put out this information this evening, as Kevin was just saying a few moments ago. There seems to be maybe -- momentum is not the right word but some stepped-up efforts to get this dialogue going for some kind of pause that's long enough to get hostages out. But what's your sense of it right now?",

There were -- as the Qataris seem to indicate, or as Jake Sullivan indicated, it seemed like things looked a little better a few days ago and now it doesn't look as good.This is one of the most complicated situations, military operations, I think I can recall because the closest comparison is to American forces when they were trying to clear cities like Mosul of insurgents, you know, Sunni insurgents and things like that. And in those cases, you know, you had the same dilemma, do you flatten the block or do you send in American forces, which is a more surgical way to do it, but then American soldiers will be into the casualty. So one of the reasons the Israelis are using so much air power, of course, is they are trying to minimize the casualties to Israeli soldiers, who otherwise would have to go through these buildings. But now you add this layer of complexity, which is the hostages. And where are the hostages? Are they in some of the places where these things are going on? So I think it's a very complicated situation. My guess is the White House is just trying to get out information that would otherwise leak out anyway and kind of get ahead of it.",

And there you had the American army involved, with the Iraqi army involved. This is urban warfare of this kind is very, very tough. And one would hope that there would be a way to say, OK, you know, maybe that is the world we live in.But is there some way to create, you know, kind of humanitarian enclaves like hospitals where you can get electricity, where you can get food, where you get fuel? And if it's not these hospitals, maybe you set up ones in safe zones? Because of course the Israelis say the problem is that Hamas has tunnels under these hospitals or they're operating from them. But surely there has got to be some solution to that. It doesn't seem that we have to resign ourselves to the idea that thousands and thousands of innocent children have to die in a situation where people do have an enormous amount of capacity. You know, the Israeli army is an extraordinary powerful army. The Egyptians could get involved. The French have sent a floating hospital. You know, why not sail three hospital on ships or four.",

We talked to a doctor earlier this evening who works with other medical providers inside the Al Shifa Hospital who said that they just don't have the ability to get out of the hospital, to evacuate, because there's so much intense fighting going on, and that they don't know who's shooting at them. They don't know if it's the Israelis or if it's Hamas.And what is your sense of what's going on with these hospitals, Fareed? Because you heard Bibi Netanyahu reiterate once again today, and we heard these from other Israeli officials, they believe Hamas is running a military operation under the Al Shifa Hospital and under other civilian facilities. As you said earlier, enormously complicated and not a whole lot of information. We're kind of operating with just an information vacuum as to what's happening with these folks. ZAKARIA: Exactly. This is important to state. You know, you don't have -- reporters don't have access into it. My sense is, if what the prime minister is saying is correct, the problem is, Israeli troops could go in and take over those hospitals, but it would be a bloody fight. There would be -- you know, Hamas is in these tunnels, and so what they are trying to do is sort of bomb various parts of it. You know, the parking lot here, the area around it, to clear out these fighters. But apparently they are facing very real resistance. You know, this is a very different Hamas than existed 15 years ago. 15 years ago the weaponry was very crude. Hamas now has really quite sophisticated weaponry. And I think of course the Israeli army is much more powerful, but when you get into this kind of hand-to-hand urban combat on urban terrain that Hamas knows, I think, my sense is that the Israeli army is being very careful about how they proceed. So there's a part of me that feels, why don't the Israel army just go in and take over these terrorists?",

And Hamas is the outlawed pariah, terror organization sanctioned by most countries in the world. Israel is not. Israel is a liberal democracy that is in good standing with most of the world. So, yes, it is held to a higher standard. I don't know that I would describe that as unfair.
