A local journalist says Israeli tanks entered the complex with guns and pointed at the building and there's been an exchange of fire.Al Shifa doctors and Hamas have strongly denied that the militant group operates out of the hospital. But the White House says its intelligence also shows a Hamas presence there.

That's not possible. Now this operation may not be just about distinguishing Hamas operatives from civilians.The IDF spokesperson has also mentioned that there is a possibility there are hostages in or close to this complex and that could be part of this here. But this has elicited a furious response from the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah. They call this a new crime against humanity, medical staff, and patients. Hamas has also come up with a statement saying that the U.S. which had confirmed according to its intelligence, the White House saying in the hours leading up to this that they also believe that a Hamas command node is operating in that hospital. Hamas saying that the U.S. has given a green light to commit more massacres against civilians. Now that timing noteworthy also noteworthy that the U.S. said that it does not support any attacks on hospitals from above. This is why Israel is now calling this a precise and targeted operation. Biden also spoke to the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday about the efforts ongoing to get those hostages out.

So the Chinese said, well, you first got to lift our sanctions before we start talking.Now, due to different reasons, Li Shangfu, the defense minister is no longer defense ministry. She is the former defense minister. So, in a way that opens up the road for more military-to-military communication which is important because there's lots of risky situations that have been taking place around Taiwan, in the South China Sea. So, you don't want those accidents to escalate into something bigger. And for that communication is absolutely key. On a third area, I think the Middle East is going to be quite central to the -- to the talks. And there's -- if you want a comparative advantage for the U.S. to influence Israel and for China to influence, especially Iran. So to try and tone down the support for Iran for Hamas and Hezbollah. And then the U.S. could maybe take actions on Israel to stabilize the situation there. I think the Chinese are specifically interested in the economic issues. The export controls the economic sanctions, the technological sanctions is a hindrance for their economic success. And they want to see that out of the way.",

And for that they also need to be seen to be contributing to achieving peace, or maintaining peace or returning to peace around the world.A rule that the United States no matter how imperfect, but has played over the past decades. So, I think there is an interest from the Chinese side to minimize conflict and to remove conflict if and when it happens. There are issues that are in reconcilable if you want. Taiwan is one of these very big issues that where the two sides don't seem to agree were parts of the United States, not the administration, but parts of the United States on a much more pro-independence course from the United States which is -- which is very toxic for China. So, those are very difficult issues. But nevertheless, I mean, it's -- that they are meeting is very important and it's very significant. It will be much more difficult next year because next year, there are two important election. One is actually the elections on Taiwan which are always -- which always bring tensions along with them.

The report finds that even if countries stick exactly to their plight climate pledges, in 2030, we will still see 9 percent more planet heating pollution than in 2010. It says the current goals are not nearly enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And the U.S. has just given its own assessment, a sweeping new report says that even though the U.S. is slowly decreasing its planet-warming pollution, it's not happening quickly enough to meet the country's targets. And it says the effects of climate change are visible in every part of the country. Well, despite the extreme weather and rising temperatures across the U.S., one city is calling itself a climate refuge. CNN's chief climate correspondent Bill Weir tells us why Buffalo, New York, the city synonymous with snowstorms, is the new climate haven. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  There's an old joke that tells us there are only two seasons in Buffalo -- winter and the Fourth of July. But in the age of global warming, the city wants you to know that now their weather is going from punch line to lifeline.
