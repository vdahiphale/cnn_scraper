After a lot of tension over whether we'd be in a government shutdown right now, House Republicans saw the demands for President-elect Trump and Elon Musk and kind of said, sorry, it's Christmas, I've got places to be.And here's what Republicans finally did agree on passing with Democrat support. It's a slimmed down government spending plan. It'll fund the government through mid-March. It includes important measures like disaster aid and money for farmers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), HOUSE SPEAKER: This is America first legislation because it allows us to be set up to deliver for the American people. In January, we will make a sea change in Washington. President Trump will return to D.C. and to the White House and we will have Republican control of the Senate and the House. Things are going to be very different around here. This was a necessary step to bridge the gap to put us into that moment where we can put our fingerprints on the final decisions on spending for 2025. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And because of a bill passed two years ago, states have been able to replace more than 150 million in stolen benefits with federal money and that helped more than 300,000 low income SNAP households across the country according to the center on Budget Policy Priorities that didn't make it into the updated deal.Let's get insight on how this all went down from a long time member of Democratic leadership in the House, Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina is with us.

Vance, I'm putting up on Instagram at Bill Handel Show recipe for dog meat soup, this is legitimate, by the way. OK, dog meat soup and fiery Szechuan cat stir fry with full instructions on how to cook cats and dogs. Now what's kind of weird is Korean and Chinese.
