A perfect storm how years of conflict and unrest made Libya especially vulnerable during last week's devastating floods.Kim's Russia tour comes to a close, the North Korean leader now headed back to Pyongyang. After visiting Russia's Far East and broken promises we hear from several Haitian women who say they're now struggling to raise the children left behind by U.N. peacekeepers who sexually exploited them. At this hour, Libya now faces a full blown humanitarian disaster after deadly flooding that utterly decimated the city of dead now just over a week ago. Now it's still unknown how many people have died but the United Nations has now revised a previous death toll of more than 11,000. They now cite the World Health Organization's figure of nearly 4,000 lives lost. The portside city looks like it was ravaged by war. But what you're seeing here is a result of heavy rain and flooding. In fact, it was more like a tsunami and that was after two major dams burst during the storm. Surging waters rushed through the city while people slept, killing thousands and washing some out to see. Search and rescue teams pause their work on Sunday for a moment of prayer. Some 9,000 people are still considered missing and treacherous conditions are making the search even more difficult. But as residents return to their homes, some are having trouble post processing this disaster. Here's how one resident described surviving the floods. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ILAM AL-THILBYANI, DERNA RESIDENT (through translator): Feelings, I don't know what I'm feeling, I cannot express it. I saw death with my own eyes. I saw my family about to die in front of my eyes. I wanted to hold on to anything. But I could only say Dear God, save my children and my husband. I saw people dying in front of me. I saw death, a moment that cannot be described as much as I try. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I want to underscore that you led the UN's mediation efforts that did, you know, somehow managed to get a ceasefire in Libya in late 2020. Since then, though, there's been precious little unity, just political dysfunction. So can you just outline how much you think that actually contributed to this disaster in Libya? STEPHANIE WILLIAMS, NON-RESIDENT SENIOR FELLOW, FOREIGN POLICY PROGRAM, BROOKINGS INTITUTE: Well, it certainly did not help. And I think we need to stipulate that, you know, this dysfunction and poor governance in Libya goes back to the also to the days of Mr. Qaddafi regime, his regime was not a paragon of good governance. But since the revolution since his overthrow, Libya has lurched from conflict, to chaos, to poor governance, there have been two civil wars. And in a place like Derna, there has been conflict as recently as 2019, when the city was under siege. And so that just makes the critical work of infrastructure maintenance all the more difficult.",

The thousands, who were swept out to sea, and then, you know, the others, the survivors whose worlds have collapsed.So, yes, this responsibility to protect, I argue, is something that now the international community has to take this on as they did in 2011, where there -- the moral imperative drove a military intervention. What we need now is a humanitarian and a stabilization and the recovery intervention. It's been good to see the international response. It's been very heartwarming to see the Libyan National Response. Libyans are coming together. There's been a tremendous Libyan civilian response. This has to be sustained. We have a climate catastrophe that has been now coincided with a governance catastrophe. And so moving forward with -- Libya -- what happened in Libya is the canary in the coal mine.

And we have imagery of this that just came in drones, including five attack drones. This is according to Russian state media.Now Russia has gone out of its way to publicize this visit. In fact on Sunday we have video of this Russian state media showed Kim waving goodbye after he walked the red carpet to board that personal green armored train of his. North Korean state news agency KCNA, meanwhile, has been hailing the visit on a share a quote from them with you KCNA saying this, quote, a fresh hayday of friendship and solidarity and cooperation is being opened up in the history of the development of the relations between the DPRK and Russia unquote. Now on Saturday, that was when Kim met with the Russian defense minister and with footage of this as well. He met with Sergey Shoigu in Vladivostok and that's where Kim inspected war planes and warships and also discussed military cooperation between North Korea and Russia. And at the beginning of this visit, we'll bring up these images for you. That was of course when Kim Jong Un met with the leader of Russia at the Vostochny Cosmodrome or spaceport where Vladimir Putin said Kim showed great interest in space and rocketry. Now, bottom line, we don't know what was discussed behind closed doors but observers say it is very clear what both nations want. Russia wants ammunition especially now as its war with Ukraine drags on. North Korea wants and is desperate for food aid as well as military technology as it continues quite defiantly its missile and weapons program. Now meanwhile, the United States and its allies in the region have been viewing events that are disturbed by this deepening alliance. Earlier this month, U.S. warned that arms talks between Russia North Korea or actively advancing. Now no deals between these two nations arms deals. No arms deals have been publicly announced. South Korea and the U.S. did say that military cooperation between North Korea and Russia would violate U.N. sanctions and will be punished.

That's the conclusion of a new report which says the overcrowding is forcing officers to put children in separate holding areas from adults. The report's author says some children were separated from their parents for days and did not know how to request a visit with them. A customs and border protection official separating families is a last resort but it happens for safety reasons. It's important to note those separations are different than the ones that happened during the Trump administration when a zero tolerance policy kept families apart. And in some instances, parents were deported without their children. Now American dreamers are facing a new legal setback, a federal judge in Texas has ruled against the Biden administration's efforts to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program or DACA. Now it shields undocumented immigrants from deportation who were brought to the U.S. as children. The order doesn't impact those currently protected.
