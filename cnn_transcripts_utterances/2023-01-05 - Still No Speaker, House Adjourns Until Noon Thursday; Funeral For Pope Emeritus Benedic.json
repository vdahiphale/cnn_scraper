He needs to peel off 16 Republicans who voted against him. There were 20 who voted against him. He can only afford to lose four votes. He does not have those votes yet but they are deep in negotiations. They have made an offer to a group of conservatives to review it. The process could change a substantive, processes change, as I am told, they are moving closer in the direction of some of those conservative opponents and they're getting some positive reactions.Several of them who I spoke to say that they believe that these talks have been very encouraging, said that they potentially could change their vote in support of Kevin McCarthy. But that will not be enough. There are other Republicans who have other demands and McCarthy 's allies flatly acknowledge that there'll be more negotiations to be had, raising questions about whether McCarthy can actually get there by noon, which is when the House will reconvene on Thursday for another vote, or will they try to delay it again? They voted to adjourn on Wednesday night. Will they try to adjourn on Thursday afternoon? That is still an open question as they tried to push to get a final vote here. But, for the Republicans right now, who are pushing for another candidate, there is not another candidate who could get 218 votes in the House. And as a result, the chamber will be paralyzed. It cannot move forward in any way. It can't even govern, can't swear in its members, can't form committees. A significant development that needs to be resolved for the functioning of one branch of government. Can they get there on Thursday? McCarthy is hopeful he can. But he's not there yet.

He resigned from his role as Pope in 2013. Benedict said his choice to step down was made due to his lack of strength of body and mind.And CNN is covering all angles of today's events.

You know, if a head of state comes with an entire entourage with SUVs requiring security, it puts a lot of pressure on the host city. And so part of the point of keeping it simple was so that the Vatican and Rome didn't have to deal with that kind of level of coordination of security and so on.So in fact, you'll see, for example, the United States is sending as their representative the ambassador who's already here, Ambassador Joe Donnelly, to the Holy See. So that's an important part of helping to keep the ceremony simple. The mass will be a simple mass, a funeral mass, but, of course, at the Vatican, nothing is ever that simple. It will still be quite elaborate and a basic funeral mass for a pope. What we'll see in about 45 minutes is Pope Benedict's coffin being brought out from St. Peter's Basilica. It was closed last night, Rosemary. Inside the coffin they put coins from the pontificate, medal from the pontificate, and a scroll which kind of describes the life of Pope Benedict and some of the major points of his pontificate. So we'll see that brought out, put before the altar. Pope Francis of course will then begin the mass. He won't actually be saying the mass, he'll be presiding at the mas. He'll be there but because of his mobility problems, we know he has a knee problem he's been in a wheel chair for some time now so it's hard for him to stand for long periods of time so the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Ray, will be saying the mass. Pope Francis will be technically presiding because he's there. And of course he will give a homily so we'll have a chance to hear from him as well -- Rosemary.",

I think many of his writings will still be studied and pondered over by theologians and experts in Catholic seminaries all around world, you know, 100 years from now, 200 years from now, 500 years from now.I think that of these four cornerstone speeches that he gave in Regensburg, Westminster in the U.K., Paris and at the Bundestag in Berlin during the course of his papacy, all of which were about the relationship between faith and reason, and the role of religious faith in a pluralistic democratic world. I mean I think those speeches will be studied as well as that subject being studied. And then of course, the other aspect of his historical significance that we cannot forget today is the way his papacy ended. The first Pope in more than 600 years to resign and the first really to do so not under external pressure because there was a schism or for an army or whatever. But simply a free personal decision that he no longer have the force to carry out his duties.

And this is a party that has been struggling for the soul of the party, right, since 2015. These are hardline MAGA Republicans, and what's so fascinating is that even though Donald Trump essentially created this group, he no longer has control over it.

And the challenge now is this problem has gotten worse because the margins are slimmer and there are more of these, I'll say, these ultra MAGA types, who are in the House right now.So this is what has occurred and again, this is not a new phenomenon. But this is really the crescendo of this dysfunction, that is now on full display for the American public. You know, John Boehner, they tried to take out John Boehner as speaker, though unsuccessfully. Then of course they tried to get him another time and then John decided to retire. They also worked very hard to undermine Paul Ryan, who is speaker. So this is nothing new, although this is very damaging to the party, it's damaging to the institution of the Congress, and it's damaging to the country that whoever becomes the next speaker, Republican speaker, is going to have a very difficult time securing votes on legislation.

They're raising money off this. This is their moment in the sun. They are getting their more than 15 minutes' worth of glory right now, and they are monetizing it. And so they see there is an advantage to this politically. Now this is not good for the country or for the institution of Congress, or for the Republican Party for that matter. But that doesn't seem to stop them. So in a more functional Congress, what would happen is Republican leadership would say to this 20, OK, we've had enough, we're going to marginalize you and we'll march across the aisle and they talk to the Democrats for votes.

As Ukrainian advisor, Anton Gerashchenko, put it, even the weather is on our side.Just before the year came to an end, the U.K. Met Office said last year sweltering heat, which ran rivers dry and caused the drought in parts of England was the country's hottest on record. Though January is mild, temperatures might provide some relief to the cold. Meteorologists warn, it could offer a glimpse of a concerning and possibly even warmer future. Isa Soares, CNN, London.

We are expecting, as you mentioned, the coffin to come out any minute now. That coffin was sealed last night, Rosemary, inside. They put coins and metals from the pontificate.They also put a scroll. We now have the text of that scroll. The scroll contains biographical information, as well as some of the major points of Pope Benedict's pontificate. In that scroll, they say that he was the son of a police officer and that his mother was a cook in a hotel before she was married a family of modest economic means. They also make reference to the sex abuse crisis, saying that Pope Benedict fought firmly against the crimes committed by members of the clergy against minors and vulnerable adults. So a reference to that period which, of course, was a major one for the pontificate of Benedict XVI, the sex abuse crisis in the Catholic Church. They also mentioned his writings, his books on Jesus of Nazareth, they think are one of the major points of the legacy that this Pope leaves as well as some of his encyclicals. Rosemary?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rosemary, you're absolutely right. I mean, look, when you're talking about an institution that has more than 2,000 years of history under its belt, like the Catholic Church, and it's kind of stood at the crossroads of every significant global drama during that span of time.You don't get the chance to use the word unprecedented very often. But that is absolutely what we're watching here this morning. There's simply never has been a situation in which a pope, not under pressure, not because there was a schism or invading or any or something like that, but by his own free choice, the pope decided to step down and make way for someone else. Spent a decade living in the Vatican then died a -- and only to see his successor preside over his funeral mass. Utterly unchartered waters. And in that sense alone, I mean, this morning is of enormous significance. Beyond that, we are, of course, marking the life and legacy this morning of one of the titans of 20th and 21st century Catholic history, Joseph Ratzinger, the man who became Pope Benedict XVI. He was, for 25 years, the intellectual architect of the papacy of John Paul II for a turbulent years. He led the Catholic Church as a great defender or church teaching and Catholic orthodoxy. And then for the next decade, became almost against his will, a symbol for the more conservative and traditionalist wing of the Catholic Church that to some extent, is unhappy with some of the changes being introduced by Benedict successor, Pope Francis. So a man who just cuts across every important moment in Catholic and world history for almost a century, it is difficult, Rosemary, to overstate the significance of today's events or the life that we are commemorating. CHURCH: So important and Frederik Pleitgen, standing by in Rome as well. And, Fred, this is an historic moment for the country of Germany. Of course, Benedict XVI was born in that country. And it is -- it has been important for Germans to mark him as a pope. And, of course, talk to us about how Germany is remembering him.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Germany is going to send the largest delegation there to the -- to the Vatican today. And if we look at some of the live images that we're seeing there, St. Peter's Square, if you look at St. Peter's Basilica, then to the right of that, that's where sort of the political prominence is going to be. And that's where that German delegation is going to be. That's also, of course, when the Bavarian delegation is going to be.Pope Benedict XVI, of course, very much a German Pope, but also very, very much from Bavaria, and very much love in his homeland of Bavaria. He hails from the small town of Marktl am Inn ,which is close to the Austrian border and spent much of his childhood there as well. So the German government, I think, realize that this is going to -- this a very important moment. Since today is about 500 years since there was a pope from Germany. And so they're sending the German president, the German chancellor, and also the heads of all of Germans -- Germany's constitutional bodies to the Vatican to pay their final respects and to take part in that liturgy and in the funeral service as well. And then also the government of Bavaria chartered its own planes. And they have the current Bavarian governor and the last two Bavarian governors as well. And a lot of other people who have sort of been alongside Pope Benedict XVI is sort of followed his papacy, and also the time when he was the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, which was a really important time for that archdiocese, as well. But I think one of the things that we do have to keep in mind, Rosemary, is that while Pope Benedict XVI, obviously a towering important figure for Germans, his legacy is also one that's viewed very differently in that country as well and very differentiated. One of the things that, of course, has happened in the final months of Pope Benedict life is that he was haunted by those sex abuse scandals from the Catholic Church in his time when he was the head of the Archdiocese in Munich and Freising, when he was the archbishop in that archdiocese. In fact, he himself admitted in the final months of his life that mistakes were made in a certain case of child abuse that took place there, which was awful for the victims that had to endure that. This is the case of a priest from northern Germany, who was brought to Bavaria and then sort of moved around different congregations there, as it was clear that he was abusing children. Obviously, that was something that apparently was known within the Catholic Church there. Benedict himself had said that he did not take part in any of the meetings and then later did have to admit that he was part of one of the meetings that took place where all of this was discussed. So certainly in Germany among the leadership, it is clear that this is a very special, a very important moment for the country, but at the same time, of course, if you look at the legacy of Pope Benedict XVI, then it is a mixed bag in Germany as it is no doubt around many other parts of the world as well, Rosemary.

It's a cypress casket put inside a zinc casket, put inside a wooden casket, it's carried out, will be placed here on the altar for the mass of Pope Francis.At the end of the mass, what's significant about a funeral mass is there's a blessing with holy water on the casket before it goes back into St. Peter's Basilica to be put in the papal tombs in the crypt, underneath the Basilica. With regard to the delegations that are here, I think it's important to say that Pope Emeritus wanted this to be a simple ceremony. And part of what that means is that there is not the usual protocol for major heads of state to come in terms of security, most especially because, of course, they travel with large entourage is that requires a lot of coordination. So you'll see, for example, the United States is represented only by their Ambassador to the Holy Sea, Joe Donnelly, who was here in Rome, rather than President Biden coming over with a large entourage. And that is echoed throughout many of the countries with the exception, as we heard from Fred of the Germany, German delegation and Italian delegation. So they're just bringing up the casket now. And, shortly, there will probably be the rosary said, there are prayers said, by the faithful while they are waiting for the funeral mass to begin. Of course, this has been quite a long process. We've had three days of lying in state with Pope Benedict with the open casket, so people could go through St. Peter's and see him and have a quick moment to pray before his casket. And then last night with the closing of the casket, that also is a big ritual, but it happens behind closed doors. Rosemary.",

ALLENYou know, in public, he was seen as aloof and authoritarian and draconian and all of that. But privately, you'll never -- you would never meet a nicer guy. I mean, he was an extraordinarily humble, shy, gentle, kind person. And so this desire not to draw too much attention to himself, I think, is just utterly in character. I was reading this morning and a cardinal who had been with him the night of his resignation in February 2013, as he was saying farewell to the pope, as he left the Vatican, was crying and Benedict said to him, look, don't worry about it. Popes come and go. What's important is that Christ is always here. I think that was Benedict's ethos and sort of the idea of not wanting to have a big spectacle around his funeral, Rosemary, would be very consistent with that.",

And I spoke to a lot of people who were sort of side by side with Pope Benedict XVI in the time when he was still Cardinal Ratzinger in Munich and Freising and the time that he was a very big figure in the Catholic Church. And they also spoke about the fact that he was very soft spoken, very humble that you really when you spoke to him in person, you would not realize that this is someone who wielded that much power with the -- with the Catholic Church and in the Catholic Church. Certainly someone who was always extremely approachable. [2:55:18] And we've been hearing over the past couple of days, especially from some groups in Bavaria that he was a part of, you know -- that we -- that he was very close to, especially the time -- since the time that he stepped down from the papacy. And they also said, they visited him in the Vatican in the past couple of years, and that he was always someone who they could talk to, who was approachable, who was just very, very friendly. So I think that's certainly something that transcends now. But I also -- I also think that right now, we are witnessing an extremely moment -- extremely important moment for the Catholic Church as someone who was extremely powerful in that body over the last decades, is now being laid to rest.",
