Trump will be heading to a New York court any moment for day three of his civil fraud trial. Labor discontent spreads across the U.S. this time in healthcare. And a tragic night in Italy after more than 20 people dies in a tourist bus accident. And on Wall Street a bit of relief inside for investors after Tuesday's sharp selloff U.S. futures now pointing to a higher open when trading gets underway about half hours from now, stocks were hard hit in the previous session after a sharp rise in global bond yields. The major U.S. averages fell well over 1 percent as benchmark U.S. 10 year yields rose to levels not seen in some 16 years.

Republican Kevin McCarthyousted by hardliners in his own party after he compromised with Democrats to keep the U.S. government open. This is a first in U.S. history, leaving Congress in uncharted territory. Let's break all of this down with CNN Political Commentator S.E. Cupp. She joins me from Connecticut. I guess the big question at this point is who will be the next Speaker of the House and what will be their politics? Just give us a sense here of the enormity of what's going on. S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, as you said, this is unprecedented. It's been tried before and failed. This time it was successful. And Kevin McCarthy basically goaded Matt Gaetz, the Congressman from Florida sort of rebel in the House goaded him into trying this maneuver. I think assuming he could survive it. He said, bring it on. And Matt Gaetz said just did. And he was successful. And so we saw something unprecedented. It's very disorienting and pretty alarming but at the same time, not surprising. Kevin McCarthy is leaving the way he came in, basically in Matt Gaetz's hands. Matt Gaetz, you know, put Kevin McCarthy through the wringer making him go through 15 rounds of votes back in January, and making him concede to some very, I think kind of absurd and handcuffing new rules including that it would only take one person to open votes for a call to vacate. Which is exactly what happened? So there are no clear front runners for this job. It is not a job most people want because Kevin McCarthy, who had wanted to be Speaker almost his entire life, couldn't do it effectively, because the politics of the Republican Conference in the House are such that they are just unable to govern. What you saw was eight people holding an entire House conference hostage.",

And then they'll have to sort that out. But looming over this is Ukraine aid. And the good news is, if you believe like me that the U.S. should continue aid to Ukraine. The good news is there is a big willingness in the Senate, even among Republicans, and all Democrats believe that that is an important thing to do. The bad news is there is decreasing support among Republicans in the House and decreasing support among the American electorate. That creates a sense of urgency to get something done before that support wanes even further. We know having covered, you know, foreign policy and international news, as long as we have, the longer something kind of hangs out there, the less interested American voters are in it.

But as we just mentioned, the chaos on Capitol Hill has left the funding of U.S. AID to Ukraine in limbo. The House can't approve new funding until there is a speaker and the Pentagon warns that the money already approved is running out fast. The U.S. has contributed $113 billion in security, economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine in the past 18 months or so since the war began. Ukraine burned through about $2.5 billion worth of equipment and munitions alone every month. Well CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is on the ground in Eastern Ukraine.

And now there's no sign for instance of skid marks that the driver perhaps slammed onto the brakes. It just slowly goes down, falls 15 meters about 30 feet onto railroad -- railway tracks below. Now investigators believe that perhaps the driver had some sort of health crisis. But when it hit the ground, it burst into flames. And at this point, the authorities are saying 21 people were killed, but not many of them have been identified because their bodies were so badly burned. Burned perhaps investigators say because the battery this was an electric vehicle. The battery so big, may have caused intense flames to kill that many people now, the members of the fire brigade who arrived shortly after the accident, had difficulty actually getting retrieving people survivors from inside we understand some are still in critical condition. Now the Venice prosecutor has opened an investigation. They're looking at a variety of possibilities. But at this point, it's not at all clear how this happened? Among the victims who were on this bus that was taking them to a campsite outside of Venice. We understand were Ukrainian, Germans, Spanish, Spaniards, French Austrians and Croatians two children among the dead.

Now, most of these are those drones, missiles and mortars drones of which, of course, we have heard quite a bit about in this recent conflict. Now, why this relationship, it all comes down to geopolitics, you look at where Azerbaijan sits on Israel's northern border. And you'll understand why Israel wants to be close to them both see Iran as a direct threat. And there have actually been various reports that Israeli intelligence has actually used Azerbaijan as a base from which to conduct operations in Iran. And Israel also gets a decent percentage of its crude oil from Azerbaijan as well. But in recent years, actually, in the last year or so the relationship has actually become a little bit more public. Just in May of this year the Israeli President Isaac Herzog had an official visit to Azerbaijan where he received an honor guard. And during that visit the Azerbaijani President he had this to say. He said Azerbaijan has access to modern Israeli equipment in this area for many years which helps us to modernize our defense capability and to be able to protect our statehood, our values, our national interests, and our territorial integrity? But the recent conflict has increased the scrutiny on the relationship. There was actually recently an editorial in Israel's left leaning newspaper Haaretz where they said that Israel's fingerprints are all over the ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh and the Armenian Ambassador to Israel said Israeli weapons. He actually said this in an interview recently with \"The Jerusalem Post\". That Israeli weapon is being used against civilians in that region. We reached out to the Israeli Ministry of Defense for comment on this -- they Becky, after repeated requests for -- they have repeatedly said that they have no comment on the situation right now, Becky.",
