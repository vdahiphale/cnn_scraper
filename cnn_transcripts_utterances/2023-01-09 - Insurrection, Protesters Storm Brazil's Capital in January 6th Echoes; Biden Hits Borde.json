So, we have rioters leaving behind a trail of destruction, including glass windows broken, works of art damaged and stolen, even works of art and looted weapons from the presidential palace. Inside the Brazilian congress building, the floor was flooded due to the sprinkler system being activated after an attempt to put fire to the carpet. At the Supreme Court, the chairs of the ministers were cracked out and broke off the building. So, that was the situation at the Supreme Court. At least ten journalists were beaten or mugged during this demonstration. Supreme Court also ordered the governor of Brasilia to be temporarily removed from office. They understand they did not enough to stop the situation. Local authorities knew a lot of this information before, so they knew a lot of protesters were coming to Brasilia in a hundred buses driving during the weekend to the country and the police did not do enough to stop this situation.
