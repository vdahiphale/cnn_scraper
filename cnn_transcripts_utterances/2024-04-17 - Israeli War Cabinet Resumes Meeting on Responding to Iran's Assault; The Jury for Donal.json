Seven jurors have now been seated. The seated jurors include an Irishman in sales, a female oncology nurse, a female English teacher at a charter school, a female software engineer, a male owner of an I.T. business, and two male attorneys. The jury selection strategy for both parties taking shape. Trump attorneys spending the afternoon digging into the social media posts of some potential jurors. Two were struck for cause. One for a social media post referencing Trump and quote, \"lock him up\". When a prosecutor asked the juror if he still believes Trump should be locked up, the juror answered no. Trump was seen craning his neck toward him and flashing a smirk. Judge Juan Merchan issued a stern warning to Trump after he visibly reacted to a juror's answers about a video she posted on social media. He warned Trump's lawyer, your client was audibly uttering. I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom. That juror was questioned outside the presence of the others about a video she posted on social media showing an outdoor celebration, quote, \"spreading the honking cheer around election day 2020\". She said it was a New York celebratory moment. Trump's lawyer suggested she was biased. The judge said he believed the juror could be fair and didn't excuse her. Trump's attorney, Todd Blanche, telling those in the jury pool, quote, \"it's extraordinarily important to President Trump that we know we're going to get a fair shake\". One juror said he finds Trump fascinating because he quote, \"walks into a room and he sets people off one way or the other\". Blanche seemed amused with the response. Another juror said she learned for the first time Tuesday that Trump has been charged in three other cases. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass addressed prospective jurors, asking them to set aside any strong feelings. He asked each to consider if they would be able to look defendant Trump in the eye and return a guilty verdict if the case is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Trump appeared to look at the jurors, tilting his head once or twice as they were answering yes, according to pool reports. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Johnson's new plan, split up Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel aid into separate bills and add to it other policy measures, such as a potential ban on TikTok.

If indeed, the GOP-MAGA groups in Congress refuse to pass the Ukraine aid bill, then what will happen is eventually, it's not just about defending against drones, Ukraine will run out of a wide variety of military munitions and ammunition and missiles, to the point whereby they can't defeat Russian attacks.

So, I think that you are seeing real coordination on the part of Iran with Moscow. Iran is selling drone technology to the Russians and allowing the Russians to manufacture these Shahed drones in Russia to use against the Ukrainians.

But now Israel says it must respond. It must reestablish deterrence. They say this attack cannot go unanswered. The only question now is how the Israeli military will respond and when. And so when you see that video, you can really just get a sense of the size and the scale of these missiles and the destructive power that they could potentially deliver. I'm told that the warhead on top of that missile would typically weigh about a half a ton, a half a ton of explosives of destructive power.

And look at the wind here, not just heavy rainfall but 99 millimeters in 12 hours created this, not only here on the roadways but also at the airport, the world's second busiest airport with 87 million passengers every year.So there's the cloud cover thunderstorm, another thunderstorm rolling on by and now this weather is actually into parts of southern Iran and even into Pakistan. But here are the numbers as we go. 99 millimeters in 12 hours. The annual average is less than that which means for the entire year they should have picked only up about 94 millimeters and we got this in 12 hours. So just a tremendous amount of rainfall for anywhere in the world but certainly in places that don't see that much rainfall at any one time. In fact, after 24 hours we were at 159 millimeters of rainfall before it finally stopped and now that weather has finally moved into parts of southern Iran and also even into parts of Pakistan. Some of that could be piling up quite deep. We could see at least another 100 millimeters of rainfall to the east of there into these slightly more mountainous areas of southern Iran and into Pakistan. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Since 2016, there have been four major coral bleaching activities due to just the heat stress on coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef. We're in the midst of another mass coral bleaching event right now.CHURCH (voice-over): Cooler waters can return the coral to its natural color but some are not able to recover and they eventually die. That's where this new technology comes into play. According to its maker, Advanced Navigation, Hydrus is less expensive than most other underwater vessels. While it can't bring back what's been lost, the underwater drone can make a difference in understanding what future coral reefs might endure.",

So they want to get very fine areas of detail of this coral but they want to come back time and time again to track that change.CHURCH (voice-over): Hydrus dives further into the deep blue sea to navigate and study parts of the ecosystem human divers can't quite reach. It takes 3D photos by stacking 2D images of an area or structure and this data can one day build a digital twin reef.",

They can then monitor the changes over time to see how the climate is impacting the coral reefs. Scientists hope this data can lead to better decisions about how to save the coral reefs.
