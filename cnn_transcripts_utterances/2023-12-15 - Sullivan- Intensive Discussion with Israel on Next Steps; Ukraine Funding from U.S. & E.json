And, of course, it has been fascinating to seeing some of a rhetorical arc from the president, starting out at the beginning of this conflict with a full-on embrace of Israel and steadily over the last two months, talking more and more about the plight of the Palestinians and warning Israel about these civilian deaths, to what he has said just this week talking about indiscriminate bombing of Gaza, and just yesterday saying that Israel needed to be more careful. And he wanted them to be more focused on saving civilian lives. All of that amounts to the most critical that the president has been up to this point. And the backdrop to all of that, of course, is this growing pressure internationally and in the United States for the president to do more, to put pressure on Israel to save civilians. It has been fascinating really for the first time in his presidency, President Biden seen up close, at close range. This anger, whether it's outside the White House protests, outside of his House in Wilmington, really a sort of stark contrast for President Biden as he weathers this conflict.",

And then there's still a lot of confusion about what that day after looks like.I should also note that a lot of Israeli officials are refusing to talk about a two-state solution right now, which is just extremely basic, you know, bare minimum bar for U.S. officials. But there is a lot of difference between what the U.S. Is saying and what Israel is saying in terms of post war governance, who will be in charge of not just Gaza but the West Bank, as well. Israel does not want the Palestinian Authority as it is right now, does not want Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, to really have any role in Gaza. And so what the U.S. has said is that they do see a role for the Palestinian Authority. They want a revamped and revitalized Palestinian Authority. What that means exactly, they're not saying. The big question, is there a role for Mahmoud Abbas in the U.S.'s eyes? Sullivan is not going to go meet with him today and tell him to stop down. But Abbas is a deeply unpopular person among Palestinians here in the West Bank, seen as corrupt. Many would like to see him go. At the same time, Poppy, this could be a very contentious meeting not just for those reasons, but also Abbas is furious with the way the U.S. has been acting in the past few weeks, refusing to call for a cease-fire, vetoing data at the United Nations. Abbas has accused the U.S., rather, of taking part in this bloodshed against Palestinian civilians and he says being complicit with Israeli war crimes. So it could be a tough day for Jake Sullivan.",
