Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.What does it mean when a black 16-year-old cannot ring the wrong door bell, without getting shot, or a white 20-year-old cannot make a wrong turn into someone's driveway without getting shot? Or our Second Amendment rights outweighing many of our other rights? Our panel has an interesting take on that. Plus, Fox has to cough up $787 million for their outrageous lies about Dominion Voting Systems. But you know who will never know about this? Fox viewers, because the settlement does not include an on-air apology or correction. The network put out a statement saying they, quote, acknowledge the court's findings about certain claims about Dominion to be false. We'll see if our guests think that spells true accountability. And the CEO of the high-end office furniture company delivered a pep talk to employees that took quite a turn when employees asked about their lack of bonuses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And whether you're talking about when he was born or when I was born or that young man today, we still have blackness rendering you as a member of a suspect class. That is why he found himself with bullet fragments on his brain. It is why we had to mere Tamir Elijah Rice who was shot in broad daylight holding a toy gun in a public park in an open carry state, shot within less than a few seconds because the color of his skin made him a member of a suspect class. It's why John Crawford was shot dead holding a BB gun in a Walmart that sold real guns in the toy aisle because of the fact that the color of his skin made him a member of a suspect class. So, yes, of course, as always, we end up in a left versus right conversation. But this conversation today, at least for one day, should be about the fact that we have to have a stark conversation with America that even today, for all the progress that we have made, there are certain times when certain people see the color of your skin and nothing else, that young man was 100 pounds wet. You know, you go back down to Florida, where you end up with a boy with a pack of Skittles in this pocket who also was about 100 dripping wet, it wasn't the hoodie that made him a threat to George Zimmerman, it was the color of his skin.
