AT THIS HOUR, protesters take to the streets in Israel paralyzing the country as they demand Prime Minister Netanyahu and his push to overhaul the country's judicial system. Towns in Mississippi picking up the pieces after devastating storms over the weekend left over two dozen people dead. And Prince Harry, Elton John, and others take their fight against the British tabloids to a London courtroom. This is what we're watching AT THIS HOUR.And thank you for being here. I'm Amara Walker in for Kate Bolduan. We begin in Israel, which is paralyzed right now by protests over Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to overhaul the country's judicial system. Take a look at this video right now of protesters blocking a highway in Tel Aviv. Police tried to disperse them by blasting them with water cannons. And while Israelis take to the streets in protest, a historic general strike is also bringing the country to a standstill. All flights at Israel's main airport were grounded for several hours, but they have now resumed. Now this is all happening just hours after Netanyahu fired his own defense minister who had called for a pause in the government's judicial reform efforts. Critics say the plan threatens the country's democracy and removes checks and balances on the government. So far, Netanyahu has shown no indication that he will drop it. Let's get straight to Hadas gold, live in Jerusalem with the very latest. Hadas we can see all the action there behind you. Update us on what is happening now and just a sense of the scale of these protests, because remarkably, it's really impacting nearly every sector of Israel.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Amara. Well, for more than 12 weeks now, there have been regular protests hundreds of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets to protest against this massive judicial overhaul plan. But the last 24 hours has brought something different after the defense minister was fired for daring to give a speech where he himself called for a freeze in the reform plan. He's a member of Benjamin Antonio's own government and member of his own party. So this is very drastic step to take.We saw those spontaneous protests in Tel Aviv that I have to say they felt angrier than the protests we've had for the past three months or so. And then this morning, this historic general strike, Israel has never seen a general strike like this in history, it has affected every sector of the Israeli economy, including universities, nurses, and were even McDonald's Restaurants are now closed down as a result of the strike. Even embassies, Israeli embassies abroad, are now closed down as a result of the strike. Israel has never seen something of this scale, bringing the entire country screeching to a halt. And instead, many of these people have come out to the streets here, especially in Jerusalem to protest against this massive judicial overhaul plant. Now, what is a current fear right now is that the other side, the people who support this reform, the right wingers are also planning to come out to counter protests. And there is a big fear that some fringe elements of the right wing plan to be violent. And that's why the only thing we've actually heard from Benjamin Netanyahu so far today is not actually about the judicial overhaul itself. But instead this tweet, he says, I call on all the demonstrators in Jerusalem on the right and the left to behave responsibly and not to act violently. We are brother -- brotherly people. Now, earlier this morning, there were reports of Benjamin Netanyahu was going to be coming out and announcing he was going to halt the overhaul. But we have heard nothing so far from him. In fact, we've only heard from some of his far right wing minister saying that they are vowing to continue for but this calling for the supporters to now take to the streets. In fact, those guys that were just yelling behind me, those are some right wing supporters. So you can already see the mixture of both sides right now on the streets, and this could get very tense and potentially violent.",

So you can see it's not business as usual. But coming through at passport control, baggage reclaim, at customs, it was Ben Gurion, busy airport, working without major issues.And looking behind me here, at the lines of people waiting to get on flights, I'm watching that line work its way down. So it feels despite a few cancellations, it feels like the airport is back up and running. But listening and talking to people here. There are folks arriving saying, hey, we got again today. But what's going to happen in the coming days. Will we be able to fly out? Will we be able to leave?

And there's a concern that there could be extremists among them. So that feels worrying. And I think that gets to the heart of what Israel's President said last week, Isaac Herzog said, look, we feel like we're on the brink of a civil war.When you hear the President of Israel use those words, it really makes you pause. So I think the number of people out protesting, the number of locations where people are coming out, there's a real sense that, that the voice of the people in opposition to all these judicial reforms is being heard but it's not so far being responded to by the government. So my sense at the moment is this is a situation that is tense that could get worse. And I think the general strikes will add into all of that, and I think it's going to be very much depend on the leadership of politicians like Benjamin Netanyahu to slow things down, potentially. And ease this country through what is an incredibly difficult time. It feels difficult right now, tense.",

And joining me now is former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro. He's also a Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council. Ambassador, really appreciate your time. First off, when you see the pictures of these massive protests in the country's main airport being at a standstill for hours, what's your reaction?DAN SHAPIRO, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Well, it was a spontaneous eruption, a very emotional reaction last night to the Prime Minister's decision to fire the defense minister, when he spoke up and said even though he supports the judicial overhaul that's been proposed, he felt pushing forward to it at this time, but actually be dangerous for Israel security. He said so because so many reservists in the IDF, including Air Force, pilots were refusing to serve a government they felt was straying from democratic principles, and because of intelligence about how Israel's enemies might take advantage of this chaos. And while there had been demonstrations, as was said earlier, these felt angrier, there was certainly spontaneity to them. And it's so spooked members of Netanyahu's own coalition, that by this morning, it was clear that he was going to need to announce a suspension of those legislation. We've been waiting all day to hear that announcement. And in the meantime, the general strike has been called which has brought the country to a standstill.",

It's not the only concern, of course, the general stability and the economy. Many Israeli economic leaders, bankers, high tech investors, have said that they don't see the likelihood that Israel's economic success can be sustained in the case where there's a concentration of power in one branch of government and a weakening of the Supreme Court. So there's a lot at stake here that's been motivating these protests. But I do think the security issue was kind of the tipping point.",

And so he's had to spend several hours sorting out the coalition politics to enable him to do what really his own party and just the events on the ground have made inevitable.

But at the same time they had this was what they were given. It was agreed between the two that they need to step to increase governance, the establishment of the National Guard. The new National Guard, which doesn't exist in Israel until now will be approved at the next cabinet meeting.
