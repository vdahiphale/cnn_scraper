This is the end of an incredibly sensitive operation on the ground in Haiti to recover the bodies from where they were -- where Davy and Natalie were killed in Port-au-Prince in a gang-controlled neighborhood to extract them from that and to put them and safekeeping until they could be safely repatriated home.We know that the U.S. officials on the ground had to be in intensive talks with Haitian officials in order to be able to take the bodies into custody even before Haitian authorities had a chance to investigate the crime scene. And we know that U.S. officials had to bring together gang leaders on a conference call to make sure that they could access this dangerous area. An ambulance that had been sent to pick up the bodies was actually stopped by armed gang members on their way. And the U.S. had to try to broker negotiations, probably through intermediaries, in order to make sure that the ambulance would be allowed to pass. The reason for this is because there was a huge fear in the families and even amongst state officials that the bodies of Davy and Natalie, these two young American missionaries, might be desecrated or even held hostage for ransom. So, the fact that that plane is now wheels up is going to be a huge relief for everybody involved.",

We also continue to keep a close eye on that Manhattan courthouse as day two of jury deliberations gets underway in Donald Trump's hush money case. On Wednesday, the panel of 12 New Yorkers spoke among themselves for more than four hours. They asked to see dense pieces of testimony from former tabloid publisher David Pecker, and also key prosecution witness Michael Cohen. The jury also asked the judge, Merchan, to repeat some of the instructions from his hour- long presentation. And this morning, they asked yet again for specific jury instructions to be read to them. And now, the nation continues to wait as seven men and five women decide whether Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, is guilty of any of the 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. Let's bring in our Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz, who is tracking all of this. She is with us from Washington now. Katelyn, obviously, it is anyone's guess how long this could go on. But, anything we can glean from the juries question so far?",

The things that they have notified the judge that they want more information about or help with is they wanted headphones so that they could listen to some of the information evidence that is in a laptop that they have. We also know that they asked for the judge to read back portions of testimony to them which is what is happening right now.[11:05:00] The judge is talking to the jury and the people in the courtroom are being -- are hearing again portions of testimony, specifically from David Pecker. They're hearing a little bit of the Michael Cohen testimony as well. But, David Pecker, if you recall, was the CEO of the publishing company atop the National Enquirer, who sat down with Michael Cohen and Donald Trump in August of 2015 at Trump Tower. That is a key thing that the jury requested. They wanted more -- to hear the testimony again on. And in that meeting, that was when David Pecker testified that he told Michael Cohen and Donald Trump that his world would be on the lookout for negative stories about women that they could help the campaign of Donald Trump that would be upcoming in the following year, and that they were interested, David Pecker was interested in essentially working with the campaign. So, these questions, what can we glean from them, other than the fact the jury wants to pay attention to very specific things that happened over the course of the trial, it does appear that they are trying to hear a little bit more about the campaign aspects of the testimony, a key piece the prosecutors will need to prove as far as intent, did Donald Trump want to help his campaign by providing money to Michael Cohen to reimburse Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet, protect his presidential run. But, exactly what this means where the jury might be in working through the evidence and coming to a unanimous decision, we just don't know at this point.",

That's because the Israeli military has long had its eyes on this corridor, viewing it as strategically significant, not only is it Gaza's border with Egypt, but it's also where the Israeli military believes Hamas has been smuggling weapons in from Egypt, and then using that area to smuggle weapons through tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip, and now the Israeli military saying that they have operational control of this corridor.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (voice-over): On a hilltop in western Rafah, Israeli tanks overlook Gaza's border with Egypt, the Israeli military's latest prize. Three weeks into its Rafah offensive, Israel says it now controls the strategic Philadelphi corridor, spending the length of that seven-and-a-half-mile long border, which the Israeli military says Hamas has used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt denies these tunnels exists. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON (Interpreted): The Philadelphi corridor served as Hamas' oxygen pipeline through which Hamas regularly smuggled weapons into the Gaza Strip. So far, our forces have located about 20 tunnels in the Philadelphi corridor area. We investigate these tunnels and neutralize them. DIAMOND (voice-over): This is the human toll of that military offensive. United Nations says more than 940,000 people have been forced to flee the city in recent weeks. For many, this is not the first time. There is multiple there is no safety. Al-Mawasi is hit. The UN warehouses are hit. The UN schools are hit. There is no safety, Taisir Al Raas (ph) says. You might die at any moment, anywhere. Multiple Israeli strikes on camps for displaced Palestinians in recent days have made that point with deadly clarity, none more so than this strike in northwestern Rafah on Sunday night, which killed at least 45 people and injured hundreds more, according to Gaza as Ministry of Health. The Israeli military has said it did not expect civilians to die and has launched an investigation into the strike, which killed two senior Hamas militants. But, at least three people can be seen on the road outside those structures moments before the strike. The Israeli military targeted these two container-like structures, just steps away from structures housing displaced civilians, which were also destroyed in the blast or the subsequent fire. Four weapons experts tell CNN the weapons used in the strike were U.S.-made bombs. They say these remnants found at the site of the attack are pieces of a GBU-39 small diameter bomb carrying a relatively small payload intended to minimize civilian casualties. But, dropping them in densely populated areas can still have devastating consequences.",

But, certainly, we'll wait to see how those numbers come out.Let's talk about mortgages. Obviously, the housing market has taken quite a bit of a cool off because of higher interest rates, and also because of the price of homes. You have some new reporting on zero- down mortgages.

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Rahel, we know that a lot of people would love to buy a home right now, but they just can't swing it, not just because of prices and rates, but because of the down payment. That can be an insurmountable hurdle. And so, now we have one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, United Wholesale Mortgage, coming out with this new zero-down mortgage program. Now, this is open to first-time homebuyers and lower-income borrowers. It's essentially two loans. The first one covers 97 percent of the value of the house. The second one is the remaining three percent, up to $15,000. But, experts are stressing that you really need to understand the fine print here, because if home prices stopped going to the moon, this could backfire.Now, that second loan is interest free, which is great, but it does need to be paid back in full when either the home is sold, the mortgage is paid off, or it's refinanced. And so, the problem here is that borrowers are going to start off with no equity at all. And so, yes, home prices are going up right now. But, if they start to go down, that means borrowers will instantly be underwater, where they actually owe more than the home is worth. Of course, that's what we saw during this subprime mortgage meltdown. And so, you can imagine a scenario where say someone loses their job or they run into financial trouble and they have to sell their home, well, they still owe that second mortgage even if the home is underwater, and if they can't come up with the cash, well, they could face foreclosure. They could have their credit ruined. And so, that is why Better Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher, he told me that this has quote \"the potential to turn the American dream of home ownership almost immediately into a nightmare\". Now, the company is pushing back here, telling me that this new program is a win for consumers because it helps them get to that down payment. And they say that critics are quote \"uneducated about the state of the industry\". The company also says that they have strong demand. They've seen thousands of applications for this new zero-down mortgage program, even though it just launched a few weeks ago. I think, Rahel, the real key for borrowers is knowing what you're getting into, because this is certainly being pitched as a solution for the affordability problem, but it's not without risks. B SOLOMON: Yeah. It's a great point, Matt, knowing what you're getting into, and as some financial analysts have said in the past, not buying too much house, right, making sure you can absolutely afford the mortgage payments. But, Matt, it's important reporting because it really gets to the need out there right now to o buy a home. But, how expensive it is, especially when you consider down payments? Matt, great reporting. Good to have you. Thank you.",

The NASDAQ is off a little bit more than half a percent, as is the S&amp;P, part of the reason why despite that GDP data we got, which was softer than expected, but we also got some weak earnings from Salesforce, which posted a disappointing earnings report. So, you can see part of that being digested by investors here in the U.S. Let's take a look overseas. Let's go across the pond and look at European markets. You can see solidly green in Europe, which is still open. FTSE 100 right now up about two thirds of a percent, let's call it. The DAX, one quarter of a percent, and Paris up.

      "sentences": "Rahel, I must stress that these results are still coming in, and it's much slower than it was five years ago because of an expanded ballot system that they are dealing with. But, it is very significant at this stage with 22 percent or so of the voting precincts that have been counted. The ANC, the African National Congress, is still below 45 percent of the vote. Now, that's truly significant. Again, I must stress, that will change until the final votes. But, there have been some very smart people projecting that they could fall under the crucial 50 percent mark.Now, if they hold those numbers that you're seeing there, they will get to a point that they have to form a coalition with a more substantial opposition party. They can't just pick up one or two seats here and there from the much smaller parties. And that will be a huge blow to the ANC and certainly to the political reputation of President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had promised that this would be a renewal of the ANC in the eyes of the public. At least at this stage, that doesn't appear to be happening. Another thing to stress is that this new party, the uMkhonto we Sizwe party, which is led by former President Jacob Zuma himself, who has faced scores of allegations of corruption over the years, has eaten into the support of the ANC very significantly, particularly in the coastal KwaZulu-Natal province. They could even potentially take that regional power structure in case it in. This means that you're looking at structures or parties that used to be part of the ANC, in Zuma and Julius Malema that have already eaten into the support base of the ruling party. This is uncharted territory for South Africa. It was long expected, but the ANC's support would erode. I think, at least at this stage, some will be surprised how much it's eroded, and the parliament will have to form coalitions relatively quickly when the final results come out, which we expect by at least Sunday on the weekend.

Day two of jury deliberations are underway in Donald Trump's New York hush money case. On Wednesday, the panel of 12 New Yorkers spoke among themselves for more than four hours. You can see we're now closer to six hours and 43 minutes into deliberations. But, the jurors asked to see dense pieces of testimony from former tabloid publisher David Pecker and also key prosecution witness Michael Cohen.

Let me just first start by, because we obviously don't know what the jury will decide, they don't even know perhaps at this point, we sort of try to glean from the questions what they may be thinking, what's your sense based on some of the questions of where they may be leaning? BRADLEY MOSS, NATIONAL SECURITY ATTORNEY, &amp; PARTNER, LAW OFFICE OF MARK. S. ZAID: Sure. So, if we're trying to read the tea leaves here, which is all we can really do at this point, the questions, the notes that the jurors sent to the judge that were addressed this morning seem to be focusing on sort of a supplemental issue, which is whether or not the falsification of the business records was done with the intent to commit a separate crime, to defraud via unlawful means. That is good news for the prosecution and bad news for Donald Trump, because if the jury has already settled on the idea that there was falsification of the business records and that he had caused it through Michael Cohen, that means the prosecution got over its biggest hurdle, which was Michael Cohen's credibility, and they're addressing the supplemental issue, which bumped it up to a felony, which was the unlawful means and issue.",

A lot of time and resources have been put into this, witnesses called, people's lives disrupted. So, judges will push back on initial problems with the jury reaching a unanimous verdict.

But, he continues to push a tough on crime message, and he also had this to say about black voters. Look.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And a lot of people said that that's why the black people like because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against.

And everyone was like, no, you don't. But, it sort of backfired. Right? She was trying to sort of meet the moment, but it backfired.

The other thing is I think talking about issues that young people really care about, I think there is this tendency to think that on any issue where young people are distinctive, like climate change or gun control that these are the issues that they really care about. And we saw this among millennials and the debate of same sex marriage. It was like, this is a defining issue for the millennial generation, but they really didn't care that much about it.And so, I think the same thing is happening with Gen Z. You look at the constellation of issues, and they're actually not that different in many ways from the general public. First and foremost, they care about inflation and cost of living. And a lot of these other issues that we talk about, the war between Israel and Hamas, just rang really far down the list of political concerns that they have.",
