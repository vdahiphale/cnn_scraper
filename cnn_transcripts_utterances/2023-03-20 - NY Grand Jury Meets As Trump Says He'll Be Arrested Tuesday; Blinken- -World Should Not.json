I'm Jessica Dean.Political lines are deepening, law enforcement is preparing for what would be a first in American history, the criminal indictment of a former president. And the key witness in the case against Donald Trump is expected to be challenged today before a grand jury in New York. A former legal adviser to Michael Cohen, telling CNN he's testifying at the request of Donald Trump's attorneys. Take a look at some video of Costello arriving at the courthouse just moments ago. Robert Costello is saying he's going to offer evidence that contradicts Cohen. Cohen, who once labeled himself Trump's fixer said he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 in the weeks before the 2016 election for her silence on an alleged affair with Donald Trump.",

In 2018, you may recall that Cohen cut a deal with federal prosecutors and he admitted that he acted in coordination with and at the direction of individual one. Individual one was later identified as Trump. The former president has denied the affair took place. But over the weekend, he revealed he thinks he's going to be arrested tomorrow, ending his online post with a call to \"protest and take our nation back.\"The Manhattan DA is not commenting on any arrests. But the NYPD has set up cameras and barricades in recent days around the courthouse. Our sources say that New York authorities are extremely concerned about security and crowds there. Let's get you the very latest from that Manhattan courtroom with CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. She has been following all the developments. Paula, do we know how Robert Costello is going to try to contradict Michael Cohen before the grand jury?",

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, we have some ideas. We know this is a witness that was requested by the former president's legal team. While the prosecutors are in charge of the grand jury, they didn't even have to grant this request. But they did because, of course, if they denied a request from the Trump team, it could potentially have become a thing not great for optics.So, Costello is expected to potentially go before the grand jury if they want to hear from him and talk about what he heard from Cohen when he previously represented him, that he represented him several years ago. And according to a letter from the Trump team to the district attorney, Cohen had waived attorney-client privilege, which is part of why he's able to testify to this. Specifically, he is expected to talk about how Cohen told him that he was not aware of any criminal activity by former President Trump. Now, that, of course, contradicts what Cohen has now said to this grand jury and has repeatedly now said publicly. So, the effort here is to undermine Cohen's credibility because he is really the witness at the center of this investigation into hush money payments that he facilitated to adult film star Stormy Daniels. This grand jury is looking at whether the former president may have falsified business records when he reimbursed Cohen. Now, these are events that occurred approximately seven years ago. It is unclear at this point why this investigation, which has been going on for about five years, has suddenly heated up over the past few weeks. Now, over the weekend, as you noted, the former president suggested that he would be arrested Tuesday and called on his supporters to protest. Now, his own spokespeople came out and said, look, we have no indication from the DA's office that he will be arrested on Tuesday. And as we're seeing today, additional witnesses still going before the grand jury. And I spoke with one of Trump's attorneys, Alina Habba, about what we should expect if he is indicted. And this is what she warned. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think we're looking to see what happens, of course, in Manhattan.And one thing that makes this even more I think, unusual and unexpected is this would be an indictment coming from a county-level elected district attorney. And I think that's going to inevitably inject an element of politics into this. We've already seen the former president and his supporters saying this is a Democratic-elected DA. Now, I know Alvin Bragg personally. I used to work with him. I do not think he is a political actor. I do not think he is dishonest.

It is not a crime, in this case, even if Donald Trump knew about the hush money payments. Prosecutors have to prove in this case that Donald Trump knew that those payments were falsely booked within the Trump Organization. So, that's one theory here.If these were actually hush money payments, but they were falsely booked as legal fees, that would be a misdemeanor under New York law. A fairly minor crime. No one's going to go to prison for that. But you have to prove Donald Trump knew about the way they were accounted for. And then the crime becomes a bit more serious if you can prove that those records were falsified in promotion of some other crime. Here, it would be a campaign finance violation. You have to show that the payments were meant to silence Stormy Daniels in order to protect Donald Trump's political fortunes as opposed to prevent him from personal embarrassment. But it's so important to keep focused on what exactly prosecutors have to show here. DEAN: All right. And, Elie, so if they end up only charging him with those misdemeanors, we've already heard this from a lot of House Republicans. Other Republicans are saying, oh, this is just a misdemeanor. Why are they prosecuting this case? Do you think it's worth still going forward if that ends up being the case?",

But again, it's quite likely even if he's convicted of that, he would not go to prison. But yes, I think this is going to fuel the fire of critics. I think this conduct is far less serious than for example, January 6, and probably less serious than what we're seeing out of the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.And so, it's sort of unusual that the least serious of the conduct seems to be the one that's likely to be charged first.

It's a case of campaign finance part that the feds looked at and passed on, once before. And so, I'm sure there are Republicans calling their congressional offices all over the country demanding some kind of action.So, this is the fastest way for them to get in the game and allow them to tell their constituents, yes, we're doing everything we can here. And I'm not surprised at all that they're going to go forward with it. And, again, I do think it was a key question, why did the Feds pass on this campaign finance thing, and Alvin Bragg, you know, a few years later shows up and picks up that ball?

Before their president, after their president, there is no such immunity.It's important to keep in mind that president -- former presidents are just like the rest of us when it comes to the criminal justice system. I think the fact that a grand jury has looked into this is a sign that our criminal justice system is in good shape. It's very surprising, but not surprising -- it's a little troubling to me that people are already questioning the reasonableness of an indictment that we haven't seen yet. I think it's very important for everybody to wait to see the indictment. Indictment may be a very strong case. In any case, Mr. Trump will be innocent and is innocent until proven guilty. I think it's a very healthy thing for the country that a former president can be indicted if a grand jury reasonably comes to that conclusion. Richard Nixon wasn't indicted because President Ford pardoned him. Bill Clinton wasn't indicted for perjury because he came to an agreement on January 19, 2001, with Robert Ray, the special prosecutor. Ulysses S. Grant wasn't indicted for a Ponzi scheme involving his company because it turned out he was as much a victim as any of the investors of Grant and Ward.

They're running against each other.So, I think pointing out the partisanship of the prosecutor calling into question the Soros back prosecutor, which has been a thing for DeSantis. He dealt with one of those situations in Florida himself, although that was wise. But then reminding people this is still a situation where somebody paid off a porn star over a possible, you know, sexual tryst. And what has DeSantis has been saying on the trail? In my administration, we have no drama, we have no leaks, we don't have any of the chaos, we just get things done.
