One of the things that his camp had said before the election is that they believed that there needed to be high voter turnout for him to actually have a chance to reach the runoff stage of this election.Now we know that the voter turnout was actually low, was about 40 percent of the people who are eligible. And yet he managed to get substantially more votes than the next top conservative candidate. Of course that being Saeed Jalili, about 1 million votes for that is definitely a lot. Now as far as the two candidates are concerned, Masoud Pezeshkian is advocating for better ties with countries here in the Middle Eastern region, better ties with the West as well. Where Saeed Jalili is saying that he wants to continue the policies of Ebrahim Raisi, a president who, of course, was killed in a helicopter crash a little over a month ago. And that would mean a hard line toward Israel and a hard line toward the United States as well. There's several wild cards now going into the next round. First of all, Masoud Pezeshkian has definitely had a very good showing. But one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that, in the end, more people voted conservative in the election than voted moderate in this election because, of course, there were three conservative candidates. On the other hand, we've noted that the turnout for this election was low. And the big question is now heading into the second round, is whether both camps will be able to hold and mobilize more voters to have a higher turnout in the next round of elections to see who's going to become next president of this country.",

Obviously, the Iranians have a lot of proxy forces that are loyal to them in the greater Middle Eastern region that they could mobilize. So the Iranians would definitely continue to take a hard line toward Israel. They also had said, after their embassy in Damascus got hit, presumably by the Israelis, that they would now hit back at Israel from Iranian territories if they're from Iranian territory, if their forces in the Middle Eastern region get attacked again. So that's not going to change. As far as the U.S. is concerned, however, Masoud Pezeshkian, of course, calling for a detente, calling for better relations. Iran's supreme leader has already said he's skeptical of that. One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that the Iranian president and certainly the foreign ministry also, they can effect change as far as Iran's foreign policy is concerned. But they have to do that in conjunction with obviously the military, with the Revolutionary Guard and especially with the supreme leader, who has to sign off on any sort of foreign policy moves, at any moves, quite frankly, that are made in this country. So they would have to convince the supreme leader to do that first and then try and get better ties with the U.S. And then of course, the big wildcard in all of that is who is going to be the next President of the United States? Because I can tell you one thing, a lot of people here, of course, going to vote in their election but a lot of people have kept a close eye on that debate between president Trump and President Biden as well, Kim.",

Various names would be put forward and, most likely, the more than 3,900 delegates from across the country would discuss, debate and eventually decide on a new candidate. All of them right now are currently pledged to Biden and approved by his campaign. But if they can't agree, if it gets really nasty and grinds on, well, then maybe the additional 700 super delegates, deep-seated party insiders and elected officials, could be key to settling the matter. They normally cannot vote on the first ballot for president if it would change the nomination but they can vote on subsequent ballots. But that scenario raises questions, too. Would voters who took part in primaries feel pushed aside and alienated from the party if a new nominee was chosen? Would a new choice be able to mount an effective campaign in the roughly 10 weeks from the end of the convention until Election Day? And, who would be the choice? There are several big names that could likely be considered but not until the party decides how it feels about Vice President Kamala Harris. Plenty of Democratic voters and party leaders would see her as the natural heir to the nomination. And if she is not chosen, her disappointed supporters could also become a deep problem for the party in November. For now, Biden's advisers and other top Democrats are pushing back on the whole idea of him dropping out. And according to his team, the president is still looking forward to a rematch with Trump at the next debate in September. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett filed a dissenting opinion. Donald Trump's legal team expects to use this ruling to attempt to get his obstruction charges dismissed.

As you said, this case has been cited thousands of times. It is an important power, if you would, that agencies have to interpret statutes.And the ruling from the 1980s, that said that agencies are entitled to some deference when a statute might be ambiguous or it's not exactly clear what Congress' intent might have been, that we should give agencies some deference in doing their job. Do it playing the role of protector of the air and the water and investors. And now, there's a good chance that they will be hamstrung in their efforts to protect the American people in many different areas. Some people may think that's a good thing, that agencies should have their powers curtailed. But it really shifts the power of the federal government to do a lot of things from the executive branch, which is supposed to enforce the laws, to the judiciary, which will now oversee virtually every act of a federal agency. Or at least has the potential to, if people challenge agency regulations. BRUNHUBER: So before we go, I want to ask you about this, because this will affect a great number of American cities and many people as well. The Supreme Court will allow cities to ban homeless camps. I mean, there're about half a million homeless people in the U.S.; 40 percent of them I understand sleep outside in places like under bridges and parks and so on.

Now as you mentioned, this is the third time that we are seeing the port being -- the pier dismantled in less than six weeks. And of course, U.S. officials have previously said that this pier was designed and established as a temporary measure but it has been plagued with issues since it was established. It is now currently being transported to the port of Ashdod in southern Israel temporarily. It's unclear when the pier will be back up and running. But of course, there has been growing criticism from within the U.S. We've heard from lawmakers criticizing the Biden administration for wasting taxpayers' dollars on this pier, which clearly has proven ineffective at times. We've been hearing from humanitarian organizations, which have called on the U.S. and other allies to focus more on preventing obstructions at crucial land crossings into Gaza, rather than on this maritime corridor, which, again, has been plagued with issues. And what we're also seeing now at this pier is a pileup of humanitarian aid. Now since its establishment, we've seen more than 8,000 metric tons of aid being carried through via the pier established by the United States. But currently what we're seeing is a pileup of aid deliveries on this coastline because there are difficulties and challenges with the actual distribution process, particularly now for the World Food Programme has been forced to suspend its distribution operations on the ground in Gaza because of the security situation. And we have seen continued airstrikes and military offensives around areas deemed to be humanitarian zones. We have of course, seen numerous humanitarian workers killed as a result. And this has really stoked concern amongst humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies, around the safety and security of their workers on the ground. So we are seeing now this pileup of a that isn't being distributed. And in fact, at those land crossings into Gaza, which are still being blocked and obstructed, we are still seeing trucks queuing up, waiting to bring in vital aid to the Gaza Strip. And this is coming of course, as U.N. backed experts are warning of a spread of famine across the Gaza Strip. So this is a desperate situation. And what we're hearing again from aid organizations, as we have done for the last few weeks, if they want to see more of a focus on unobstructing those land crossings rather than on trying to keep this pier up and running despite the continued problems that it is clearly facing.",
