The storm surge from Hurricane Milton is starting in Florida. And Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu have had a direct phone call, their first since late August. It is Wednesday, October, 9th. I'm Lynda Kinkade in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, conditions along the Gulf Coast of Florida are quickly deteriorating as Hurricane Milton approaches the shore. Take a look at these pictures coming to us right now. These are live pictures of Fort Myers, Florida, which is already getting hit with torrential rain as you can see. The storm surge has started to arrive, and Milton's outer bands have spawned several tornadoes. Emergency officials say it's time for people in its path to now shelter in place. We know that Milton's size has more than doubled since yesterday, and it is producing sustained winds of 210 kilometers an hour, making it a Category Four storm. Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to CNN earlier urging people to heed the warnings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Unlike anything we have seen before, we've got a lot of tough, strong people in Florida who have been through a lot of hurricanes, tornadoes, but this is not like anything they've dealt with before. So if they have been told to evacuate, they must evacuate. We expect that this is going to be catastrophic and deadly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is no way you can get out if you aren't in an evacuation zone safely at this point. There are a number of bridge closures, a number of road closures, and we understand that for at least certain parts of the Gulf Coast in Florida, Emergency Services have been shut down. The wind is simply too strong. The peak rainfall has begun here. So we're talking about roughly a foot of rain that is expected as Hurricane Milton passes through. You're also talking about 140-plus mile an hour winds, a potentially 15-foot storm surge, that for Tampa Bay, which is behind me right now, would be devastating. We are expecting between eight and 12 feet here. That 15 feet is a bit further down in Sarasota. The other major concern, Lynda, across the state is tornadoes. You're talking about 90 tornado warnings just today that is across the state. Again, that's more than Florida's ever seen in a single day, and it's very widespread. There was a tornado that touched down in Western Broward County, that's on the southeast coast of Florida, that is hundreds of miles from where we are right now and where Hurricane Milton is set to touch down. Aside from that, you've also got the leftover from Hurricane Helene. The leftovers, the debris that has not yet been cleaned up. We've seen a ton of it around where we are.

Buteven though the wind in the center might go down, the ocean is not going down at all, because, like you mentioned, we have a storm that is double the size of what it was yesterday. The tropical storm force winds now extend 310 miles across. That is more than two times what it was yesterday, right? It was an intense hurricane, but it was small. As the winds have kind of wavered, the storm has gotten bigger, and what that means is that more people will get in on these damaging winds. They will have a far -- a much bigger arm, more reaching. We have gusts already up to 47 miles per hour in St. Petersburg, gusts nearing 50 miles per hour in Naples and in Miami. These outer bands today have been nasty. We have had the most tornado warnings for the state in a day. I mean, it has just been incredible. And a lot of these warnings have had a tag for considerable damage, because the tornadoes have just been so discreet and just so dangerous, causing damage. I mean, look at all of these little nubs that you see, these discrete cells, those are all capable of tornadoes. This is common with a hurricane, but today we have seen it on steroids, a lot of these tornado warnings. A Tornado Watch in effect until nine o'clock this evening for most of the peninsula. Again, the wind field we're very worried about because it is wide. Hurricane force winds will extend across the entire peninsula. You have 110-plus mile per hour winds possible from Tampa down to Fort Myers in the purple, but the hurricane force winds get all the way to the east coast of Florida. That's how wide reaching this is. And because of the wide reaching wind field and the intensity that the storm has packed since yesterday, it is going to drag the ocean with it. That is the storm surge, and that's why these numbers are not coming down. Nine to 13 feet from Sarasota down towards Venice, you've got that eight to 12 feet of storm surge that could funnel into Tampa Bay, even as far south as Naples and Marco Island, storm surge could get up to eight feet. This is the un-survivable part. This is the most deadly part of any hurricane, is the storm surge, and this is what officials are so worried about. This front that's been dragging Milton into Florida will exacerbate a lot of these problems. It's what's causing the wobble a little bit north, a little bit south that we've been watching all day. It's also going to funnel in more moisture for the heavy rain, and could increase some of the winds as well. We'll find that center coming on land sometime around midnight tonight, you know, maybe an hour before or after, so overnight hours, then it treks across the state, through the overnight into tomorrow morning, dumping all of that heavy rain. I mean, rain totals could get up to a foot, six to 12 inches in some locations, that would cause flooding, even again, well inland, not just at the coast, and it could cause flash and urban flooding, even in the city, even places that are not near rivers or near the ocean. So we have this high risk in effect today for the rain from Tampa through Orlando again, from coast to coast. This high risk is very rare. It's only issued four percent of the time, but it's responsible for 40 percent of our fatalities and 80 percent of the damages. So again, we've got water that would be powerful from the ocean, but also from the rain -- Lynda.",

They talked about, you know, President Biden offering condolences about October 7th to Prime Minister Netanyahu, they talked about the, should be a proportional response so there, we have no details about what was discussed about that response. Israel's response to Iran's missiles fired here just over a week ago. We know that President Biden has previously said that he doesn't want to, he doesn't think it's appropriate to target Iran's nuclear site or is it appropriate, he thinks, to target their oil production facilities. So what does leave? Possibly the implications that one might infer that are being talked about are a like-for-like military target, military sites, but really this. The readout from this call has given us no clues whatsoever. And I think, perhaps, the best insight we have about where the mood within the Israeli government may lie at the moment was what you said from Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, went to the intelligence headquarters after that phone call and is reported to have said that that would be a powerful strike, it would be a precise strike. He noted that Iran's strikes on Israel hadn't been precise. It would be surprising. He said they wouldn't understand what happened or how it happened, alluding to some sort of stealth operation, perhaps. But very clearly, what hasn't changed here at all is Israel's intent to strike back and how much pressure and influence this direct conversation has had on the Israeli prime minister to meet the United States' wishes that it doesn't escalate tensions further in the region. We don't have a sense of that. And I think, realistically, we may only have a sense of it after Israel has struck back at Iran. And then we can measure against what the prime minister was believed to want, to be able to strike the nuclear sites.

There are about 400,000 people have been affected. New evacuation orders have gone into effect. Hospitals in the north have been told to evacuate. And the message from US officials today -- and it's not clear that this precisely was communicated this way by President Biden to Prime Minister Netanyahu -- but it's an obligation to abide by international humanitarian law, which is to make sure there's enough food, make sure there's enough water getting through, make sure all the humanitarian requirements of the people in Gaza, particularly Northern Gaza, are getting what they need. And I think, if you measure the pressure that the United States has put on Israel in the past to achieve that, and the lack of results therein, it does seem to indicate that, even when President Biden has applied what he believes is a lot of pressure, what his critics say isn't enough, it doesn't bend the will of the Israeli government very far. That's how it appears. And Doctors Without Borders, MSF, today have said, as far as Northern Gaza goes, they have supplies that they could, that they would like to be able to distribute, but they can't get into northern Gaza. Other U.N. agencies are saying they haven't been able to get into northern Gaza for over a week to distribute aid. So, that impression of a humanitarian constriction and pressure on the population there to move yet again in the face of another offensive, really, the fact that that's going on does fly in the face of the rhetoric that we hear from the White House and US officials, that it is, in a large part, as far as we see, has little effect.",

The thing is, historically, because of theprevailing trade winds blowing offshore, this part of Tampa, St. Pete, its dense population center, has never taken a direct hit in modern history. It's been since the great storm of 1921 that this region took a pounding like this. And back then, just for perspective, there are about three-and- a-half fewer, three-and-half million fewer people in this region. And the seas were a foot lower. As a result of planet cooking pollution in the atmosphere, as we all know, I talk about it constantly, every second of every day the equivalent of about 10 to 12 Hiroshima sized atomic bombs is being absorbed by the ocean. All that warm water is hurricane fuel. And it doesn't necessarily mean for more for hurricanes, but the ones we get one after another now are shattering records. They just set a storm surge record here less than two weeks ago and the forecast is that they will shatter it today. Just to give you a perspective of where we are in terms of altitude here, spin around for me, guys. Spin around this way. My PJ Carlos can't hear me over this wind. This would be about -- this would be about a 12-foot storm surge right to here, to give you perspective. Out at the end of that pier is a very nice fine dining restaurant called Tik. I was trying to Google if it was built to category five standards because it is about to get tested. And even if the wind speed, Lynda, dies down, people get hung up about the wind speed, the categories, those sorts of thing, the inertia, all the physics, all of that energy from category five winds 500 miles from here has been pushing this mountain of water this way. So we're really worried about St. Petersburg being cut off from folks leaving to the north. All the bridges around St. Pete and Tampa had been closed once those winds get to 40 miles an hour.
