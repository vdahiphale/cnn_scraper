We have lower health expectancy. Infant mortality is a much greater, greater obesity rates. So, I mean, in some, healthcare is bad but expensive, and it results in a lot of despair and anguish across American households. What I would argue is the rage is targeted at the wrong people. It shouldn't be targeted at the CEOs. For profit companies are doing what they're supposed to do. It should be targeted on our legislators, who, despite 70 percent of America wanting universal healthcare and price caps, consistently block them. Why?

And I went naked about seven years ago. I've saved about $350,000.00 in health insurance costs, which will buy a lot of health care.

SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D-MN) JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: You know, I would've loved to see him stay on for his full term. Christopher Wray is someone that was appointed first by George Bush to be Head of Criminal after 9/11. He then went on to serve with great distinction, appointed by Donald Trump himself, FBI, served through President Biden's turn. He exemplifies the motto of the FBI -- Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity. So of course, I'd like to have seen him stay on, but I understand his decision. He wants to leave on his own terms. And there was no sign out there that President-elect Trump was going to keep him on. And this way, he gives a month to say goodbye to his frontline workers. He supervises over 30,000 people across the country and also, to put his affairs in order. And I think it was the right thing to do, given the remarks that the president-elect has made about not wanting to keep him on.",
