We then see Nichols run off, only to be stopped at a second location and be given a fatal beating. And before we show you just a portion of it, I just want to take a moment and just reaffirm that Tyre Nichols about his personhood, to show you a little about who this man was. Our Sara Sidner has that story for us.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In Memphis, candles burn for a life snuffed out, the life of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols being remembered where friends say he felt the most free, a skate park. Twelve years ago, Nichols seen here doing what he loved. Twelve years later, he ended up dead. Officials say beaten by five men sworn to protect and serve. Nichols family wants people to know more about Tyre Nichols than how he died. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROWVAUGHN WELLS, TYRE NICHOLS' MOTHER: Nobody's perfect, OK? Nobody. But he was damn near. My son was a beautiful soul and he touched everyone. SIDNER (voice-over): Nichols had his mama's name tattooed on his arm. He wasn't just her beautiful boy. He was also a father who loved having fun. His friend who knew him in Sacramento told a local newspaper, \"He had such a free spirit and skating gave him his wings.\" He worked at FedEx but had other dreams, photography. In his own words he posted, \"People have a story to tell, why not capture it instead of doing the norm and writing it down and speaking it?\" It turns out what led to his death was captured on camera.

As you and Shimon alluded to, what we saw on the video tonight was the deadliest possible combination of what was done to Tyre Nichols, and then what was not done for him that really jumped out of Shimon right there.

First, I thought to myself did they not recognize the gravity of his injuries? They must have known because they just inflicted this upon him. So he is essentially, you know -- and he's dying, John. I mean, there's no other way to really say it. He's critically injured and there's nobody really doing anything there. They sit him up a couple of times, he slumps back over. I do see him move his legs once on his own. He seems to be in a state of what we call agonal breathing, which is typically a sort of breathing pattern when somebody who's just in near respiratory distress. And even when, I think the paramedics or the EMT, I couldn't quite figure out who first got to him, again about a half an hour later, they're the first people to bring out a bag and start assessing him, doing things like looking in his eyes to see if in fact he has evidence of brain swelling. Something you can do by looking at the pupils, assessing his breathing. You start to see some of that, but it's pretty far along. There's just no sense of urgency given how critically injured he obviously is.",

But the thing about the brain, John, is that you see all those blows to the head, and what you imagine is this brain, which is essentially a fluid medium, it's basically mostly water. You imagine it starting to swell, and when it starts to swell like that, the brain, unlike any other organ in the body, has no place to really go because it's encased by the skull. So what happens ultimately is that it goes downward, and that's called herniation, and that is something that can lead to brain death, which is a real consideration here.Again, I'm sure the hospital, St. Francis, I believe, where he was taken, probably assessed him. They have the answer to some of these questions. Did he have that brain swelling? Did he have bleeding in other parts of his body? Did he have obstruction of his airway when he was essentially being knelt upon face down? They probably have the answer to these questions. But brain swelling and that pattern that we saw where he was lapsing in and out of consciousness, that sort of fits. The injuries, the swelling, and then that loss of consciousness that we saw.",

And joining us now is CNN law enforcement analyst Michael Fanone, who nearly lost his life defending the Capitol on January 6, and CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams, former deputy assistant attorney general.And, Elliot, I do want to start with you. First off, you're new to this discussion here, and I think everyone who's seen this video has had the same visceral human reaction. That is one thing. There is the legal case that will need to be made in a court of law with the charges that have now been filed against these former officers, which do include second degree murder. Based on what you have now seen on this video, and as someone who has prosecuted cases before, will that be easy to prove in court?",

And again, I know we all feel the same way viscerally and as human beings, but as a defense attorney, what on this video would you use to defend officers? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYSTBut if you want to talk about second degree murder, what you're looking at, talking about that as a knowing killing is do you mean to tell me in the event that you literally kick someone in the head multiple times, the person happens to be 140 pounds, right? You all are burly gentlemen who use the word gentleman loosely, who are actually out here doing this job. Not only do you kick him in his head multiple times, but you're sucker punching him multiple times as well. You're hitting him with the ass multiple times. You mean to tell me that a reasonable juror cannot conclude that those are actions and activities that would lead to death, that you don't know and appreciate the nature of your conduct such that it may have that result? And so, I think all cases are hard but I think a skilled prosecutor can make that case in this particular situation. And so, I think what happened, John, last point, and that's this. You know, you could talk about and relate it to Rodney King but here's the difference. When you had Rodney King, what they were doing is looking at what strikes and movements, et cetera, that Rodney King was making so that they, that is the officer could put it in context with an expert witness. You tell me in looking at the videotape of a defenseless Mr. Nichols on the ground, what furtive movements he was making that would justify the conduct, no immediacy of danger, such a gross disproportionality of force being used, completely unreasonable conduct, and a failure to act. I think you can certainly secure a conviction under the right set of circumstances.",

Just the force that these officers use, that at least nine blows. It really felt like watching the video came out of nowhere there, leaving one to say, what are they thinking? What could they be thinking with a human being? What did you see?MICHAEL FANONE, AUTHOR, \"HOLD THE LINE\": I'll tell you what I saw, John. At the outset of that video, I saw an intense, chaotic situation. I saw police officers trying to gain control of Mr. Nichols. I believe that those officers' actions clearly escalated that situation.

In the wake of all we saw tonight, now we could see as the five ex-cops charged with second degree murder in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols go to trial, as other investigations pan out, and as Memphis in the country come to grips with all of it. Andrew McCabe, I do want to start on the investigation. Talk to me about that because there is an investigation ongoing. I'm sure the video will be the key piece of evidence in all of it. Well, what else is happening behind the scenes? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTORBut there's also a parallel federal investigation that's looking at this through the lens of determining whether these officers unlawfully denied or impinged upon Tyre Nichols constitutional rights. And there's all sorts of constitutional rights that appear to have been violated by the pretty obvious horrendous acts they inflicted upon him in that beating. I should also say, John, I think one of the things that will characterize those investigations as they go forward and ultimately the perception of jurors or people who sit in judgment over the officers is that second interaction, the beating in the second interaction, it is replete with -- there's like a vindictiveness to it, right? There's a -- it almost feels like a retaliation from the way they beat them, the things they said while they were doing it, the threats, the taunting. You know, it comes off as if these men are getting back at Tyre Nichols for embarrassing them, for resisting their authority, for making them chase him. And it's so over the top that it appears on its face to be unreasonable. It is that unreasonable standard that will work against them in both prosecutions.",

I want to actually step to the side, because you can see this white sedan that he was driving, because that is the place where he ultimately encountered Israeli police who are responding to the situation and where he was ultimately shot and killed. Now, Israeli police are identifying the attacker as a 21-year-old Palestinian, a resident of East Jerusalem, and they are calling this a terrorist attack, in fact, one of the worst, they say, that they've seen in recent memory. And this attack is coming not in a vacuum. It's been a very violent two days in this region. Thursday was the deadliest day for Palestinians in the West Bank in over a year. There was an Israeli military raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military say that they were targeting Islamic Jihad militants. At least nine were killed in that attack. We know at least one of them was a civilian bystander, a woman in her 60s. Another Palestinian was killed later in the day in further clashes elsewhere. And then later that evening, rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, and Israel responded with airstrikes. So already the tensions were sky high here. Officials were already concerned about things spiraling out of control. And then this attack tonight. Seven killed, at least three injured.
