We want to get straight to CNN's Omar Jimenez live in New Orleans right now. Omar, quick turnaround for you. I think you were in the neighboring state, Mississippi, last night. What are you seeing now that you're on the ground there?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, so here in New Orleans, we are just outside the French Quarter here. So just over my shoulder here, you see this line of state troopers and then about a block from where we're standing, they've of course got all this area blocked off. That is where officials have been investigating the scene. That is likely the focal point of where all of this happened.We, of course, haven't been able to get over there to sort of cross verify with some of the videos that we've been seeing. But over the course of this, we have seen coroner's vans come in and out over the course of even just the few minutes that we've been here. We've seen investigators, of course, go in and out of this caution tape. So still a very, very active scene. But then of course, as this is happening, we still have a lot of people. This is obviously a very big tourist area as well, lot going on in the area. So people are still going about their days, trying to stop and see what's going on here as well. All of this, as we're starting to learn more about who this person, who this suspect may have been, or any potential motivations. For example, law enforcement sources are now telling CNN, as they tell our reporters, Priscilla Alvarez, Evan Perez, and Holmes Lybrand, that an ISIS flag was found with this vehicle. And then on top of that, those sources also tell CNN that there were explosives, potential explosives found in a chest as well with this vehicle on top of that. So, all pieces in this investigation that are moving forward into how, not just how this happened, but also why, what potential motivation would there have been to plow into a crowd like this in the early hours of 2025, here in New Orleans as people were likely celebrating the entry to a new year, this attack unfolded, person drove into this crowd according to law enforcement. 10 people killed, over 30 injured. And just from the videos that we've seen from the scene itself, just unbelievably harrowing as people in some cases clearly trying a process in real time what they were seeing, potentially, of their loved ones in, again, the opening moments of 2025. We've heard some information from law enforcement so far. For example, they do say, the FBI says, they are investigating this as an act of terrorism. There is still a lot to learn though, of course, in regards to the nature of how this unfolded and again, potential motivations leading up to this. We do expect to hear from law enforcement a little bit later this afternoon, potentially with more details as well. But again, as I mentioned, this is -- for those that have been to New Orleans, they know Bourbon Street. This is one of the busiest, if not the busiest parts of the city, especially on a night like New Year's Eve where people come, they celebrate. Not to mention you've got a big football game going on in town tonight between University of Georgia and Notre Dame, so a lot of people in town for that. And even as I'm talking, you can't see it because it's off camera, to this point, but the crowds have just stopped. They have their cameras out, they're filming. They're also watching to see what is going on here, again, as people wonder not just how this could have happened, whether there were barricades up or not, or whether they went around barricades as law enforcement have described, but of course, why this happened in the way that it did in the opening hours of 2025, Phil.",

For that, I want to bring in CNN Andy Scholes. Andy, we've been hearing from universities, from the conference, from law enforcement throughout the course of the morning about what they're planning, given this huge event that is coming less than 24 hours after the attack. What steps are being taken right now?",

And if you've ever been to a big event in New Orleans, there are cops, security officials just all over the city because everyone stays in the French Quarter for these big time events at the Superdome, and then you walk down Poydras Street to get to the event. So as you can imagine, all those Notre Dame fans, all those Georgia fans, probably going to be feeling a little uneasy this morning making that walk to the Superdome. But officials try to ensure those fans that it is going to be safe. Take a listen to the superintendent of police earlier this morning.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
