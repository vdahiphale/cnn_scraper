One is the perception of profound disunity within Israeli society and the Israeli government that has not gone unnoticed by people like Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah. Israel's greatest strength has actually been its internal cohesion even more than its military power. There's a real perception in the region that that cohesion has in some ways been broken.The second factor, of course, is that for the last almost 16, 17 years, there's been relative quiet on Israel's northern border after the 2006 war. This breaks it. The interesting factor here is the possibility that these rockets, what came from Hamas, not from Gaza, but from Lebanon. And that's really interesting for a variety of reasons. A, Hamas in Lebanon, but B, the question whether this was done with or without the perception, with or without the permission, excuse me, of Hezbollah. If it's without their permission, then it says something about the state of chaos in Lebanon. If it's with their permission, then you've got -- it tells you that Hezbollah is using Hamas as a front to attack Israel and to break that 17-year truce. This could be the beginning of a new war on Israel's north.",

The opportunity for him now is he can use this as an occasion to say what we really need is a constitution for Israel. The state of Israel came into existence as basic laws but not a formal constitution. We need a constitution for Israel that limits or at least clearly sets what the parameters are between the executive, the judiciary and the legislature in the country.If he's able to do that, it solves -- it does two things. It kicks the can down the road because there's going to have to be some kind of constitutional convention. It also potentially makes him the father of Israel's constitution. I think Bibi has always seen himself in historical terms. He's the longest serving prime minister in its history, and the idea that his legacy could be bequeathing Israel some kind of constitution, something that's going to appeal to him. So I think that's the smart play. However, he made some really basic mistakes in the first few months of his of his latest tenure, so you can say, you know, this is the smart play.

It makes it harder for those in Republican leadership to break away from Trump and offer an alternative. That's clearly a problem for the country.We've had a couple of years where outside the United States people looking in have said oh, well, maybe that was an aberration. Maybe now we have the U.S. governance sort of as usual. What we're seeing is this is very deep. It's very lasting. It's very structural.

This country has consistently underestimated his political appeal and his political strength. And so I've been an opponent of Trump from the beginning. I never wavered.But this prosecution makes me heartsick. It's a weak case. Of all the cases that could be brought against him it's by far the weakest. As Ian said, it's inevitably going to do more to hand him the nomination than to deny it. It makes life very difficult for his potential opponents. And finally, unfortunately, this is a game that two can play at. Don't be surprised if five or 10 years down the road, some conservative prosecutor in, I don't know, Oklahoma or Texas brings a weak case against the former Democratic president.

He brought everybody in. It ended up being a much less provocative meeting than it might have otherwise been.But let's be clear. One other point, it's been a really good week for China. Right? I mean, you have a former President Ma from Taiwan with a weeklong trip meeting with a bunch of leaders in the mainland China. The meetings went very well from China's perspective. You have French President Macron as well as van der Leyen from the European Commission with a very strong trip, with a bunch of French CEOs talking peace and negotiations on Russia, Ukraine with Xi Jinping directly. And then, of course, you also have China continuing to lean in to the Iran-Saudi Arabia negotiation.

Also, we have to draw the lesson from Ukraine. Ambiguous signals from the West over the security of Ukraine tempted Putin's invasion and we cannot allow that to happen a second time with a country every bit as vital as Ukraine is to Western security.If I were the Chinese leaders, I would be drawing very sharp lessons from Ukraine and from America's willingness to defend what it sees as its core vital interests. After we withdrew from Afghanistan, I was afraid that Russia and China would take that as a symbol of American hesitancy and weakness. Clearly that hasn't been the case in Ukraine, also the addition of Finland to NATO this week. And we shouldn't tempt them with ambiguous signals with Taiwan.

And in contrast, you see dozens more, 89 to be precise, that saw trade as part of their economy stay the same or even declined.

They more often than not stayed nearby. And just to give you a piece of data. The average good that travels abroad travels 3,000 miles. That's about the distance from New York to Los Angeles.

This is the pieces and parts and components that come together to make that iPhone or that refrigerator or that laptop or that piece of furniture, anything else that's moving around the world. And that's where regionalization happens.

The last place is China, so that's what the sign says, and that's what the trade deficit says when we look at the United States.

And what we've seen in commerce is that ties to your neighbor, that integration, the trade between them, especially when it comes down to these components or parts that that really brings economic strength because you gain economies of scale. You gain specialization. You gain access to different labor markets or skills and the like. And so, you can make things that are highly innovative and quality but for cheaper prices. And that's where North America -- we see some areas where this has really worked. Automotive is one. We have very deep regional supply chains and a thriving automotive industry.

And I have to again thank my mother or the circumstances because what happened after my life was thrown and our life into disarray -- look, we knew -- don't cause trouble. Just study hard, right? We can't cause her more trouble.And then when I end up in university, I'm the only woman in engineering. And then you're like, whoa. People will remember every time I put my hand up. So, I better really study hard. So, that idea of knowledge would become a shield. But eventually around when you say a world of men, it turns out you're better prepared and more thoroughly ready, and therefore you compete very well. But to your point all along my whole life I always said, please don't look at me as a -- as a -- as a woman, right? Just judge me for what I do.",

And those that are in these positions don't look like that. And I just want you to know that because I hate to see something hold you back.So in the moment -- and I was much heavier and I didn't do anything. I eventually would take care of this for my health, which is the right reasons. But I have to tell you the last part of that when you said, how do I feel? You do recognize over time I would feel this sense of a role model because so many people will say, I can't be these jobs. There's no one up there like that. And this idea that you cannot be what you cannot see would really sink into me over the years. And then I would start to embrace the fact that, no, wait. I want a lot of women to see that this is absolutely capable. So I then realized, wait, you're saying you don't want to be recognized as a woman. It's not about you. It's not about you.
