A new national poll shows Donald Trump and Joe Biden running even. And as of now, criminal indictments have not tanked Mr. Trump's chances of becoming the once and future president if he's on the ballot.And it's the vice president on the line. A former business partner tells Congress that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone 20 times. Democrats say, it was all part of an illusion. Republicans see it as a Biden lie. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, we are closely watching for any indicators that a federal indictment against the former president is coming. The grand jury that will make that decision whether or not to charge Donald Trump with January 6 related crimes is back in today. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is live outside the federal courthouse here in Washington. Katelyn, what are you seeing there at this hour?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana. This courthouse is collectively holding its breath to see what happens with the grand jury today. The grand jury that has been investigating January 6, and the 2020 election, with the help of prosecutors from the special counsel's office, directing all those witnesses and evidence before the grand jury.For months and months, they're in today. And this is two weeks after Donald Trump told, he was very likely to be indicted for his activity after the election as he was trying to maintain a grasp on the presidency when he had lost the election in multiple battleground states, and ultimately, the electoral college vote. And so, there's a lot of anticipation. Here there's been a lot of momentum in the previous weeks, putting the grand jury in a position where they are very likely to be asked by the Justice Department to look at that indictment that they've prepared against Donald Trump, and to potentially approve it and send it into the court system as formal charges against the former president. We do not know what the grand jury is doing at this moment, only that they are here in this building. We have not seen any prosecutors from the special counsel's office on the ground yet, that doesn't mean that they're not here. They have plenty of ways to get into this building very secretly. And the grand jury, they themselves operate in total secrecy when they are convened. And so, we will not know exactly what comes from this grand jury until there is a choice made by both the Justice Department and the court to make public and indictment. But we are waiting to see not just what happens with the grand jury, but what exactly the Justice Department wants to do here, Dana, with a possible case against Donald Trump related to the 2020 election. Like I said, the investigation has been sweeping and there's a lot of ways that they can put a case together, whether it's against Donald Trump, for Donald Trump and many others. So, we just need to keep our eyes on the court today. Dana?",

A majority of registered voters in this country saying that he threatened democracy. And yet it's a tied race, as you said. Now, we should know, not only is it the fact that it's a national poll, which again, is instructive. It's not irrelevant obviously. It's also a national poll 15 months before an election. So, there is a lot of time here.I would know one more thing about this poll. It's not particularly new information, it shows a remarkably consistent picture. For months now, this has been a margin of error rates, this potential rematch between Biden and Trump. And this is just yet, another poll in a litany of polls that have suggested that. So, the question is, well, then why? Why if all the economic indicators are so good for the Biden White House, that inflation is easing, that the Fed is going to sort of pause on the interest rate hikes. But all those things are going in the right direction that that soft landing, avoid the recession. That Donald Trump is the major leading contender for the Republican nomination. That's the one we hear that the White House prefers to run against. They think Donald Trump and the matchup against Trump makes for an argument about MAGA extremism. So, if all that is working in Biden's favor, and it's still a dead heat race, you got to ask the question about why.",

But you know what, I'm not going to vote for Donald Trump. And they're banking on that. Because I mean, I think another thing that's interesting, not even from these numbers. When you looked at the small dollar donors that Biden didn't get the enthusiasm gap that we're starting to see among Democrats, that's going to be the issue, right?

Republicans and Democrats in the room say that Devon Archer testified that on at least 20 occasions, Joe Biden spoke on speakerphone to his son Hunter Biden, and Hunter Biden at the time was with business associates.Sources also tell CNN that Archer shared no evidence directly connecting President Biden to his son and his son's business dealings. CNN's Zach Cohen joins me now. So, Zack, what more do we know about what went on behind closed doors? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Dana, neither of us are shocked that Republicans and Democrats were out there claiming victory following this testimony behind closed doors by Devon Archer. But if you look at the substance of what we are learning about what Archer actually told the committee. It seems pretty clear that both parties also agreed that he did not deliver the kind of impeachment worthy evidence that Republicans were looking for from their witness. Now, what we do know is that Archer did not provide a direct link between Joe Biden the president and Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings, nor did he have any knowledge of this bribery scheme, something that's the foundation of a claim the Republicans have been out there touting for months, without any evidence to support it. Now, the most controversial piece of testimony, though, seems to center around those 20 plus calls where Joe Biden was put on speakerphone according to Archer, and while Hunter Biden was surrounded by these business partners. Democrats say that Archer told the committee that business was never discussed during these calls. There were more like pleasantries, even talking about the weather. Republicans have not contradicted that claim, but rather dismissed it as unbelievable, even though it is based on testimony from their witness. So, all in all, we are looking at these two conflicting narratives that come from the same piece five-hour testimony and from the same witness. Archer for his part, his lawyer released a statement saying, all Devon Archer did was exactly what we said he would, show up and answer the questions put to him honestly and completely. Mr. Archer shared the truth with the committee, and we will leave to them and others to decide what to do with it. In the aftermath of yesterday's testimony, though, Republicans making clear they have no intention to stop investigating both Hunter Biden and vis-a-vis Joe Biden. And they even announced a new inquiry into Hunter Biden's plea deal agreement just yesterday as well. So, you know, Republicans making clear their intentions are to keep investigating Hunter Biden, and by virtue of that President Joe Biden.",
