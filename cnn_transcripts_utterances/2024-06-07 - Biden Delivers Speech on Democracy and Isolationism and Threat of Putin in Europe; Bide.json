Tonight, President Biden delivers a powerfulspeech on democracy, warning of the dangers of isolationism and the threat of Vladimir Putin in Europe. This just shortly after Mr. Biden apologized to Ukraine's leader for aid delays. A closer look at the state of that crucial relationship. And the rise of far-right parties could have a major impact on European elections this weekend, our interview with a 98-year-old holocaust survivor who is urging young voters to shun this movement and not forget this past. But first tonight, it was a dramatic call to defend democracy. U.S. President Joe Biden returning to Normandy to deliver stark message that the fight against tyranny continues 80 years after D-Day. The symbolism was unmistakable. Mr. Biden hailed the American heroes at Pointe du Hoc where U.S. army rangers scaled a 100 foot cliffs during a critical moment in World War II. The president says the current generation needs to meet the moment in order to preserve freedom. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to bring in Bobby Ghosh; who is a senior editor for \"Bloomberg\" and joins me now live from New York. Bobby, welcome to the show. So, I think it's fair to say in the last kind of two days, 48 hours, we've heard two speeches from President Biden, both with democracy as you heard Christiane saying at the heart of it. Democracy abroad and democracy at home, what stood out to you from what we heard and how effective and sense of urgency was his speech, given what -- we're five months from a U.S. election?",

But as Christiane pointed out right there, this was primarily meant for domestic U.S. audience and to some degree to an audience in Europe, specifically to an audience of American allies in Europe, NATO, and a few other non-NATO members who are close to the United States like Ukraine. There will be certain amount of reassurance that the American President is reaffirming his country's commitment -- there has been anxiety in those parts. I was in London only a couple of weeks ago, and there's a quite a lot of anxiety in Europe about where America will stand and whether America will stand with Europe should there be a change in presidency here after the election? So, there'll be some reassurance for that audience. The larger global audience on the other hand, I'm sure will not be quite as persuaded. The global south to use the expression has some doubts about Biden's commitment to democracy, they've heard him give the sermon often enough, but they judge his actions just as much. And some of his actions run contrary to this message of democracy. He has - - we could argue it is for real politic reason, but he has embraced non- democratic figures, because like the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, he has embraced liberal figures like India's Narendra Modi. So, they will balance off his rhetoric with his actions. And I think there will be somewhat less convinced.",

One of the things that he said is that he believed that Russia's economy was still going strong despite the fact that of course, Russia is one of the most sanctioned countries in the world. The Russians are expecting some pretty significant economic growth. He said a lot of the things that the Russians had been importing before war now made in Russia, and he's outlined some of that as well. Essentially what Vladimir Putin was talking about was a sort of alternative world economic order, which he believes, of course, Russia, and he himself could be at the helm of. As far as the war in Ukraine is concerned, the Russian President there also saying that Russia continues to make advances. He says that since the beginning of this year, that the Russian military took away 47 towns and settlements away from the Ukrainians. He also says that right now, there is no need for further mobilization. He said that Russia now has enough troops, enough people who are signing up to go to the military and fight on the frontlines. He also qualified some remarks that he made earlier, which had of course, been quite remarkable, where he had said that in light of the fact that for instance, the U.S. is now allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied weapons to hit Russian territory. In a limited capacity, why Russia wouldn't have the right to also give weapons of the same class to the adversaries of the West to put them under military pressure.

And we have been hearing from U.S. officials that they are putting any pressure to bear that they can on those in the region that could influence Hamas to agree to it.

And the day after the ceasefire, what does Gaza look like? And we haven't heard this from Mr. Netanyahu. We've been hearing it from the U.S. side as well, pushing the Israeli prime minister for this. So we know that 8.40 p.m. on Saturday night, Benny Gantz will be making an announcement. We also know, according to U.S. officials close to these conversations, that U.S. officials are trying to convince Benny Gantz not to walk away. They do not want him to be walking away at this point. But what will happen if he walks away is the coalition itself is not expected to fall. Netanyahu will still have a majority, although it will be far slimmer than it was before. What it does is it means Benny Gantz walks away from the war cabinets. And this is really a key institution at this point for making some very important decisions. So that could have a very destabilizing impact and, of course, an isolating impact on Netanyahu, Isa.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well -- yes, this could be a very controversial moment here on Capitol Hill. Netanyahu has notaddressed Congress since 2015. And House Speaker Mike Johnson was really the driving force between trying to secure his appearance in front of Congress. But he needed buy-in from all top four congressional leaders, including the Democratic leaders. Now, they did ultimately sign off on the invite. Netanyahu did accept. But the Democratic leaders are looking at this speech very differently than their Republican counterparts. I want to read you part of the statement from Chuck Schumer. He is the Senate majority leader. He said, \"I have clear and profound disagreements with the Prime Minister, which I have voiced both privately and publicly and will continue to do so. But because America's relationship with Israel is ironclad and transcends one person of prime minister, I joined the request for him to speak.\" Now, Schumer is the highest-ranking Jewish Democrat in the United States, highest-ranking lawmaker, I should say. But he has also called for new elections in Israel. And some of his members in the Democratic Party disagreed with his decision to sign on to this invite. So we could see some of them, many of them, protest this speech. There could also be some disruption. So this could be a contentious moment here on Capitol Hill that comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Israel.",

There's also 200,000 leaflets in bags tied to the balloons denouncing the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong- Un. Park Sang-hak is the founder of the group behind this latest launch, Fighters for a Free North Korea. He's been doing this since 2006, and this latest balloon deployment is in direct response to about a thousand trash- filled balloons sent from North Korea. PARK SANG-HAK, FOUNDER, FIGHTERS FOR A FREE NORTH KOREA (through translator): We send money, medicine, facts, truth, and love, but to send filth and trash in return? That's an inhumane and barbaric act. VALERIO (voice-over): Park defected from North Korea in 2000, and he remembers in the early '90s when a balloon similar to one of these popped above him, and he secretly collected a leaflet from South Korea. It told him of a better life, and he says it told him the truth. SANG-HAK (through translator): South Korea is not an American colony or a wasteland of humanity like I learned in North Korea. North Koreans are filled with anger and hatred and only sing military songs, but South Korea is a gentle country.

Now, Farmer Kim has told us that during moments of heightened tension in the past, the South Korean army has kept him from entering about half of his property because it is so close to the DMZ in order to keep him and others safe. VALERIO (voice-over): The question now, how will North Korea respond, especially after a show of force by the United States? A B1B bomber on Wednesday flying over the Korean Peninsula, and for the first time in seven years, engaging in land target practice with live munitions. We asked Kim if he wants to leave. His answer, \"I want to move to somewhere else, but I can't afford it. We're very upset that the balloons are making our daily lives inconvenient in our areas seen as a war zone. It's very unfortunate. There's nothing we can do. If I could, I would want to stop them. But it's difficult.\" So for Kim, there's no choice.
