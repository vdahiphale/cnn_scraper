You know, when they said, the number in Ukraine is going to be a much higher number of death, is going to be a much higher number than you're hearing. You know, they're big buildings. This is what I did very well. And these are very long buildings. They're 15 to 20 stories high. They're massive buildings. I was surprised at how big. And they're flatten like a pan cake. One or two bombs hit them, and they just collapse. And they'd say nobody was hurt. Well, nobody knows who was in those buildings. There were a lot of people in the in those buildings. They're going to find that when they start doing the removal. Many more people are being killed in the Ukraine war with Russia than is being reported, and that includes soldiers.

In this term, everybody wants to be my friend. I don't know.My personality changed or something. But I had -- as you know, I had Sundar from Google, but I also had Sergei. Nobody reported that. Sergei is the owner, the primary owner, along with his friend, as you know, and Sergei was here also. I can't believe you didn't pick that one up. Nobody picked that up. But I will tell you, No, it's a big difference. The big difference is that the first time everybody was fighting me on all fronts, and we had a great administration. We got the biggest tax cuts in history and rebuilt the military, too much of it was given away to Afghanistan Stupidly given away, horribly given away. I think that's one of the reasons that Putin went in to Ukraine. When he saw the stupidity of Milley and these guys. They're stupid people, very stupid people. If he didn't -- if they didn't do such a big, you know, we were pulling out of Afghanistan, but I would have pulled out with dignity and strength. They wouldn't be having parades, I guarantee you, showing our equipment that they left behind, because we weren't going to leave any equipment behind. Not 10 cents. We were going to take every screw and every bolt. So, yeah, the biggest difference is that people want to get along with me this time. Well, they've gone through four years, and you know, it wasn't easy for me, but it wasn't easy for them either. And that's a great thing, though, getting along is a great thing. So, Tim Cook was here. I think he's done an incredible job at Apple. And he talked about the future of Apple. It's going to be a bright future. But we have many others also and not in that business. And we do have Jeff Bezos' Amazon coming in, sometime during the week. Look forward to that. We have a lot of great executives coming in, the top executives, the top bankers. They're all calling -- and honestly, in the first, I don't know what it was. It's like a complete opposite in the first one -- and the press has covered that fairly actually for change.

And we are going to start where we just left off with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago wrapping up an extended Q&amp;A with reporters.The first time we've seen that since winning reelection. And he has been talking about a slew of things, his cabinet picks, the borders, foreign affairs, the drones over New Jersey, whether he privatized the post office, TikTok, all kinds of things, including, just now we heard him asked about whether or not Bashar al-Assad should be forced to leave Russia. And he said he hadn't thought about that. Talked about Zelenskyy and Ukraine, got to be prepared to make a deal. He commented on everything from the Duke lacrosse scandal and very, very, very many other issues. We want to start where this started, which is on the economy. And Donald Trump tried to plug $100 billion investment from a Japanese tech billionaire. CNN's Alayna Treene is there in West Palm Beach, right by the president-elect resort. Our fact-checker Daniel Dale is also here. Alayna, such a wide-ranging news conference. Where do you want to start?

I know that it was not entirely clear if he was going to be taking questions when reporters went into the room where he was giving this announcement about that major investment from the SoftBank CEO.It was $100 billion with the promise of trying to create 100,000 jobs. That is double what this same group SoftBank announced in December of 2016 after Donald Trump first won his election for the White House. But again, I want to get into the Q&amp;A part and in that news conference, because that is where Donald Trump actually made a lot of news. One thing I want to talk about because I know this has been such a big focus on so many people's minds, is what is happening with the drones over New Jersey, my home state. I know my family is worried about this too. Donald Trump said that he didn't want to get into whether or not he's been briefed on it, but he argued that he believes that the government knows exactly what is happening and that they should be identifying what the cause of this is. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I will argue that what Donald Trump said there is very much not the same from what we have heard from these exact government officials over this week.And we did hear from DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas this weekend addressing this. We also heard from many FBI officials and those at DOJ. All of them kind of trying to assuage the concerns of voters who are seeing these drones, while also arguing that they have a right to be concerned. Mayorkas said this weekend that there's no question. People are seeing these drones that they have promised the federal government will give more assistance to New Jersey state police, but also said that they're still trying to find answers on this. They don't believe that this is a major national security concern, something Donald Trump also just argued in that sound that you heard. But that, again, they still need to get to the bottom of this. And so, this is something that I find, you know, very interesting to see whether or not, as we continue reporting this out, whether Donald Trump is actually getting his own updates on this. Some other big areas that he went into. TikTok, I think he addressed, you know, really publicly for the first time, his stance on TikTok. He had wavered on this over the campaign trail. We know in the past Donald Trump had threatened to ban TikTok. That has since changed. Donald Trump said today that he has warmed up to TikTok because he believes many young people voted for him. So, they will be looking into it, but seemed, you know, less inclined to do so. That's just two things that he said in a number of topics that he addressed today at that press conference. Dana?",
