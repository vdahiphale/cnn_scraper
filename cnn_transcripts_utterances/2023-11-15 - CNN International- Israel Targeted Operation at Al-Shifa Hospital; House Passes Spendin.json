The account that we've just had from a Palestinian reporter, from the Rafah news agency there suggests that they might be in more than one location. He said that the soldiers are in buildings and departments. They're conducting search and interrogations, trying to bring out young men, essentially part of the work here. The IDF said is to try to distinguish, obviously, Hamas from civilians.Now the IDF is at pains, given the pressure they're under to do more, particularly from the U.S. now to protect civilians, to specify to be very -- to emphasize that they are doing their very best. They say they've called in medical teams, Arabic speakers and they did tell us that they warned the hospital that they were coming. Take a listen to the spokesperson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: When approaching the hospital, we indeed informed the administrators to keep away from the windows to make sure that the patients and civilians inside the complex keep away from the windows and take cover.

They say now Hamas has seized on it, even blaming the U.S., saying that the U.S. had given Israel a green light, they say to commit more massacres against civilians. A reference most likely to the fact that the White House had confirmed in the hours leading up to this -- according to their intelligence -- they also believe there is a Hamas command control nod at the hospital. Something that, as he said, Hamas is denying. Although it's hard to imagine the circumstance where they would actually confirm that.But meanwhile, of course this is not empty -- this hospital. There are thousands of civilians. The estimate from the Hamas controlled health authorities earlier this week was 7,000 displaced peoples and 1,500 medical staff. And on Monday we heard that about 700 patients were still there, including some of the most vulnerable. So this is going to be a major test, a major point in this conflict and a test, as I said, of, of Israel's commitment to do more to protect civilians.",

There has been no care and no attention and no precaution to prevent civilian loss. I'm sorry, the context is horrific, horrific. And let's go to your question.Hospitals are civilian objects protected under humanitarian law. When there is a threat, when there is evidence that is to be provided that the hospital is being used for military purposes, in that case the hospital loses its civilian status -- it's protected status. And at the same time the nurses, the doctors, the 700 patients, the 7,000 civilians who have sought shelter in this hospital have to be protected. This is not happening. The level of terror among the civilian population in Gaza is unspeakable. It's incredible that international community has not called for a ceasefire now. Israel is not capable, is not capable to protect civilians. This is clear. The rest is just condescending and enabling -- enabling this massacre of civilians in Gaza.",

There is no way that Israel is going to protect civilians.And again, I mean you're talking of -- you're asking me about babies taking into incubators away. I don't have this information. But babies have already died because they were taken out of the incubators because there was no fuel. There was no fuel.

Ahead of the summit, both China and the U.S. announced an agreement to tackle global warming by ramping up renewables, and that was a positive note of collaboration to tee up the big leadership meeting.

Now on Tuesday, we heard from the U.S. President Joe Biden. He said that he's looking to normalize communication. He also said that the U.S. doesn't want to decouple from China.
