      "sentences": "Wolf, this is an unprecedented surprise attack on Israel that the likes of which this country has not seen since the Yom Kippur War that happened 50 years ago almost to the day also happening on a Jewish holiday, the Simchat Torah today, it is Shabbat as well. But since 6Now, it's been quieter in the last few hours. But just to give you a sense of the scale of the numbers, we hear from the Israeli military, at least 3,000 rockets have been fired so far today. This is we're approaching, I think hour 10 of this conflict, that 2021 war that lasted 11 days between Israel and the Hamas militants. But there were some 4300 rockets fired just in those 11 days. So we are approaching that number just in 12 hours or so. And as we speak, I'm continuing to get alerts of sirens going off mostly in southern Israel. But what is more concerning, as you noted, is these infiltrations of militants. And as we speak, firefights are continuing on the streets in certain towns and villages, especially in southern Israel. We also understand from the Israeli military that certain bases were infiltrated as well as the border crossing. Army bases, we're talking about at least two army bases had militants infiltrating. We are hearing harrowing reports from Israeli civilians who have been barricaded themselves in their bomb shelters, in their safe rooms, in their houses in southern Israel, as they believe there are militants firing right outside their door or even entering their apartments. These civilians have been going on the airwaves calling, pleading, begging for help. We, as you know, know that there are at least 40 Israelis who have been killed, more than 779 wounded. This is from a combination of rockets, rocket shrapnel, as well as from gunfire from that very graphic video that we saw that you shared. We also have claims from Hamas that they have captured a number of Israeli soldiers. There also some reports civilians have been captured as well. We have no official confirmation of that from the Israeli officials. They have said nothing so far. But we have seen videos of what appears to be at least one Israeli soldier being pulled out of a tank by militants. We don't know the status of that Israeli soldier. The Israeli military already responding with multiple airstrikes targeting the Gaza Strip. We do not yet know -- I have a confirmation of Palestinian casualties in the Gaza Strip. We also know the Israeli military is calling up 10s of 1000s of reservists because this is not just going to be the typical scenarios, you know airstrikes that we've seen on Gaza. They say that they're going to be sending soldiers to Israeli towns and villages in order to try to protect them from this militant infiltration. Hamas has called this operation the storm of Al-Aqsa, this is a reference of course to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, is also known as Temple Mount a place so holy to both Jews and Muslims here in Jerusalem. But Wolf, what's really interesting about this, that there wasn't sort of a specific trigger point. Typically, before these sorts of conflicts, there's been a major raid potentially police entered the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, there's been a major capture of a militant, a high ranking militant of some kind. There has been rising levels of tensions here over the past, you could say year and a half, especially across the occupied West Bank, there have been some incidences at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound. There's been some incidences along the separation fence between Gaza and Israel. But there was not a trigger point and that's why this is being seen as such an intelligence and security failure on behalf of Israel to not have seen this coming. And just the fact that militants entered Israel, Wolf, by things like paragliding into Israel by land, by sea, and they are still on the ground in Israel engaging in firefights with Israeli soldiers as we speak.

So Iran will have a lot of levers to pull on this one. But and this isn't important but, that the IDF, or whatever they may say in public know in private, that there's essentially a kind of understanding between Hamas and Israel of kind of mutually assured destruction. Hamas does have, thanks to the Iranians, a really vast armory of rockets with which they could threaten every inch now of Israeli territory. The Israelis, of course, have the defense capability, perhaps to deal with a great deal of that.And it made it very clear indeed to Hezbollah and its other elements within the Lebanon, that if they do get attacked in any serious way from the Lebanon by Hezbollah, that the Israelis will not hesitate in really returning. And I've used the phrase, it was once used to me by a very senior Israeli officer to the Stone Age, they would take out every single piece of infrastructure in the country. So, that is a very high stakes game. But the concern for the Israelis is the extent to which, as you point out there, it will escalate on the West Bank, and indeed, from Israeli territory itself. We've got large numbers of weapons in the Palestinian community within Israel, that in the recent past has been used in sort of Indonesia (ph) gang warfare, not for political ends but that could turn in theory. There's no sign yet, though, of that occurring. It's very interesting too, that Hamas clearly hasn't coordinated this attack. At least doesn't appear to have been coordinated with any of its elements or allies on the West Bank, which is relatively quiet, although largely sealed off from Israeli territory, as we speak. But for now, I think the Israelis keeping a very close eye indeed, on Hezbollah. And in all probability, Wolf, as you know, sending private messages in a method by third parties or through their own means of communication to Hezbollah set warning Hezbollah in no uncertain terms of the consequences of getting involved in any way in what is going on in Gaza. But that certainly is the kind of doomsday scenario that they will also be and we know have prepared for exactly that eventualities, Wolf.",

Coverage this hour, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is now underscoring U.S. support for Israel after this morning's surprise attack by Hamas that has killed at least 40 people and wounded hundreds of others. Secretary Austin met with top U.S. military officials just a little while ago including the commander of the U.S. military Central Command.We're also waiting to hear directly from President Biden. The White House has issued a statement condemning this attack on Israel by Hamas. CNN Military Analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling is joining us right now. General Hertling, thanks so much for joining us, sir. We're watching all of this unfold. What's a bit surprising to me, this looks like it was a major surprise that the Israeli military intelligence community was caught off guard. But what's your sense? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I believe that intelligence was certainly lapse this morning, Wolf. It was problematic in terms of the kinds of things that Hamas has been doing with regard to operational security, which is hidden a lot of the intelligence from the Israeli Intel forces, and even from the U.S. as well, this is something that should have been seen. There was a comment issued by the Shah of Iran, I'm sorry, the Supreme Leader of Iran a few days ago saying that Palestinian forces were ready for these kinds of things. This is something that should have been picked up. And given the multi domain operations, we're talking about air, land and sea is, as Israel has reported, and the amount of conventional activity, as well as the reports of denial of services in the cyber community. These are the kinds of things that you normally pick up before an operation, and it just wasn't done this time. This is very different than things we've seen Hamas do in the past.",

And yes, that is a very good weapon system, it's very good at protecting the citizens of Israel. But when you have a massive attack, like we've seen this morning, with anywhere between two and 3000, missiles and rockets coming in, no matter how good your air defense system is, it can't knock down all of them. And as Hadas earlier mentioned, you're not only getting the effects from missiles that strike, but you're also getting the effects from those that are broken up in the air and then come down and cause the kinds of fires like we're seeing on the screen right now.But the amazing thing about this attack by Hamas this morning, is the fact that they were able to have so much conventional artillery, ballistic missiles, cyber, air, land and sea, as the Israelis have said, all synchronized into a fight. This is going to cause the Israeli defense forces some real challenges in the next few days. And as other reporters have begun to say, we don't know who else might join in the fight. We've already seen the support by Iran, there had been some combat comments out of Russia saying they support Hamas in these actions. We don't know what Hezbollah in Lebanon is going to do, what's going to happen on the West Bank, or even from inside the State of Israel with the Arab and Palestinian populations that are spread throughout the country. This is going to be different than what Israel has faced in the past. And it's fascinating that it comes on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War of '73.",

So, we have the charge in the embassy in Israel sort of connecting ourselves with this operation.Now, the Defense Department has a lot of people there and they will get the information. But given the current situation not only in Israel, but in our own government, we are going to be challenged to react to this given the chaos that's going on in Congress right now. We don't have a leader in Congress to bring things to the floor about what we might do as a nation to support Israel. Now, there are certain things in effect that will continue on. But this is going be very challenging not only for the various militaries of the world, but also for the governments that deal with this while we're dealing with several other crisis.

When you're talking 40, 50, a hundred deaths and many people being captured that's very significant. It's the equivalent of a 9/11 attack on the United States where we lost thousands of people. So, this is certainly a dynamic that we've got to continue to consider and how challenging this is for Israel, the state of Israel with enemies on all sides. And the fact that there are going to be more and more damages and certainly more and more casualties. This is going to be a tough one, Wolf.

Also known as Temple Mount to the Jews, a place so holy for so many. But today we had several rounds of air-raid sirens. We heard several explosions in the sky. Those could have been interceptions or impacts by rockets. These were just several of the more than 3,000 rockets that have been fired thus far since 6In comparison in 2021 and the entire 11-day war, Wolf, 4,300 rockets were fired in the span of 11 days. We've had 3,000. We have not even hit 12 hours of this conflict. But even more concerning is those infiltration of Palestinian militants as we speak. In addition to the rockets continuing to be fired from Gaza into Israel they are continuing firefights in Israeli villages and towns between Palestinian militants who have made their way into Israel fighting with Israeli security. We also have reports of Israeli soldiers who have been captured. Potentially also Israeli civilians who have been captured. No confirmation yet from the Israeli military about any soldiers or civilians being kidnapped or captured. But we have seen videos from Hamas saying that they have, for example, pulled an Israeli soldier out of a tank. We know for fact some Israeli military vehicles have been commandeered and taken into Gaza. In terms of death toll, 40 Israelis and potentially others have been killed. More than 770 wounded as a result of combination from rockets as well as militant gunfire. And we are getting new numbers in from the Palestinian ministry of health in Gaza. They are saying as a result of Israeli action 198 deaths and more than 1,600 injuries. We do not know yet from those numbers how many were civilians, how many were militants. But we know the Israeli military undertaking airstrikes as we speak against what they say are Hamas targets in Gaza. You know that we've seen civilians in Gaza fleeing their homes, trying to take shelter in U.N. schools. Unlike many Israelis who have access to bomb shelters in Gaza, those civilians do not usually have access to fortified bomb shelters. So, they are very much at risk there. And there is this -- the expectation that this will be a very severe response from the Israeli military. They are not taking this lightly. They are calling this a state of war.

They are common ideological bedfellows but have different agendas when it comes to Israel. They want to fight their own fights, not each other's at this stage.",

Saying that the U.S. embassy there is closely monitoring the security situation as a result of rockets that have been fired from Gaza across southern and central Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and the infiltration of Hamas militants. Obviously, the top priority for the State Department is the safety and security of U.S. personnel and U.S. citizens in the country as all of this unfolds.Now, the statement also goes on to say that the U.S. embassy is aware that there have been casualties as a result of these incidents, and says that U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. Now -- as of right now, obviously, this is a very fast-moving situation. It remains unclear just how long the shelter in place is going to remain in effect or if the U.S. embassy is going to try to take steps to remove personnel from Jerusalem. But at this point, they are telling personnel to stay in the embassy, because as we have seen, Wolf, there have been attacks in Jerusalem, which doesn't happen very often, but this is clearly a source of major concern right now for the State Department.
