It claims at least 70 fighters, who crossedinto Russia's Belgorod region and carried out an attack on Monday, have been killed. The rest it says, have been pushed back into Ukrainian territory, Moscow refers to the attack as Ukrainian. Those two groups of anti-Putin Russian nationals are claiming responsibility. Ukrainian officials acknowledge the attack but deny any direct involvement. About 100 civilians have been evacuated from the affected areas. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv. He joins us now.

He says there are still Ukrainians inside the territory. They do continue to hold parts of Bakhmut and intend to stay there and try to defend the territory. He also said, from a Ukrainian perspective, despite the fact that this was such a tough fight and continues to be such a tough fight with great losses, of course, on the Ukrainian side, they believe this has been a success for them. They believe they've been able to draw on large parts of the Russian military not just Wagner but other units as well, destroy a lot of arms, kill a lot of Russians. They think that has helped them as well prepare for the big counteroffensive that, of course, so many are waiting for and have been waiting for, for such a long time.",

Of course, it comes on the heels of the Russians denying U.S. diplomats consular access to Evan Gershkovich over the course of the last few weeks here, two times. They also denied what was an appeal from Gershkovich's side, to try and serve this pretrial tension time on house arrest instead of in a jail. Because they rejected that, he is serving this time in jail. We'll watch to see what kind of images we get, of Evan leaving the courtroom and entering the courtroom. The other thing, just because he has been denied this consular access twice, by U.S. diplomats, we'll be watching if U.S. diplomats are allowed into the courtroom. You'll recall the last time we had appearing, the U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Lynn Tracy, was in the courtroom. She was able to exchange some words with Evan.

According to sources, he made threats at the scene regarding the White House. We're only about 200 yards from the White House.

Initially there were concerns that there might be explosives in the truck. For that reason, they evacuated that hotel, the famous Hay Adams hotel. They briefly evacuated the hotel when they thought that there might be explosives inside the truck but the FBI searched the vehicle and found no explosives in the truck.
