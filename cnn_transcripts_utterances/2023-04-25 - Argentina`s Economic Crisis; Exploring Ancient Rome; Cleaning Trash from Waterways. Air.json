      "sentences": "Holding torches and banners, they march down some of the most iconic streets of downtown Buenos Aires, the capitalof Argentina. The march, organized by worker unions is the latest in a series of antigovernment protests. Workers like Sylvia Sarabia (ph) say the government is not doing enough to alleviate a galloping yearly inflation that reached 104%, the second highest in Latin America after Venezuela`s 501%. Those who have a formal job get wages under the poverty line, she says. That`s why these protests are so big. Workers say the government of Argentina is taking money from the working class to pay the International Monetary Fund. President Alberto Fernandez admitted there are problems to be solved, but pointed to 30 months of job growth in the country. Last month, Argentina reworked a $44 billion loan with the IMF, obtaining nearly 10 billion in fresh cash in exchange for measures to strengthen public finances and start reducing persistently high inflation. President Fernandez is calling for unity, asking his fellow Argentines to please look towards the future. He says his finance minister is working on the issues and blamed some of the problems on the country`s drought. But for many people in Argentina, it`s hard to have that kind of optimism when they don`t even know if the next paycheck is going to allow them to make ends meet. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Italy, no city on the planet has as many fountains as Rome, where you`ll find more than 2000 of them. Up next, a story about trying something new with something very, very old. Thousands of objects not making it into the Colosseum`s new museum. They`re now on full display. The Colosseum, the ancient Roman amphitheater in the center of the city best known for gladiator games, first opened in the year 80 A.D. Now its storage facilities full of artifacts are open to visitors at tiny museums all around the city. Let`s go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What do you do with 500 Roman era coins? With limited space in the site`s new museum, the Colosseum is trying a new hands-on approach. Warehouses and storage facilities brimming with artifacts are currently open to visitors. These former shops and market stalls have been converted into temporary museum space to hold the leftover artifacts that didn`t quite fit into a new museum that opened in 2021. Until the end of July eight visitors at a time can reserve a special tour, guided by an archaeologist, who will let them hold these important historical finds. Many of which have not been on display in 30 years. In this way, the people have direct contact with the ancient culture and materials archaeologist Roberta Alteri says. After that, their fate is unknown. The popular pieces will upgrade to the Museum, and the rest will go back to collecting dust in the warehouse. Alfonsina Russo, the Director of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, says she hopes the project gives people a better understanding of daily life in ancient Romero. ALFONSINA RUSSO, DIRECTOR OF COLOSSEUM ARCHEOLOGICAL PARK (through translator):  These artifacts tell the story of daily life, how they carried out activities, and above all, to bring these objects that would otherwise have remained hidden in our warehouses.",
