      "sentences": "Hollywood goes dark, an unprecedented strike shutting down productions, actors now joining writers on the picket line, which has not happened in more than 60 years.I'm Sara Sider with Kate Baldwin. This is CNN News Central. We begin what is happening in Russia in a new interview with a Russian newspaper, President Vladimir Putin appears to be attempting to divide top Wagner fighters from their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Putin said the private paramilitary group simply does not exist. Russia's president was referring to the legality of the mercenary group as he described a meeting with senior Wagner fighters and their boss. The Kremlin says that meeting happened just five days after Prigozhin led a failed rebellion against Putin's military. CNN's Alex Marquardt joins us now from Dnipro, Ukraine. Alex, what more are you learning about this conversation that Putin says he has and the fact that he's saying they don't exist legally anyway?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, Putin certainly does appear to be trying to weaken Prigozhin here, and he's dabbling in a bit of legalese. I think what he's saying here is two things, that on the legal front, mercenary groups are illegal, and then when it comes to Wagner, at least in Ukraine, that they no longer exist. And that's something that the Pentagon said yesterday as well, that their troops are still in Eastern Ukraine, but that they are not operational.Major questions remain, Sara, to what extent Wagner will continue to operate in Africa and in the Middle East, where they have for years, what is the fate of their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, that is still very much in the balance. But Putin did give this fascinating interview to this Russian newspaper, Kommersant. Here's a little bit of what he said. I want to quote from it. He said, we do not have a law for private military organizations. It simply does not exist. There is no such legal entity. He then goes on to say that it is not an easy question. He also details that extraordinary meeting that happened five days after this Wagner mutiny on June 24th. He says that at the Kremlin, Putin met with 35 commanders from Wagner, including Yevgeny Prigozhin. And he said to these commanders, you guys can keep fighting. You can keep fighting under the commander that you've had if you want to. And, apparently, according to Putin, the men at the Kremlin were nodding along and then Prigozhin piped up and he said, no, the guys do not agree with this decision. So, apparent division, real division on full display between Putin and Prigozhin. Putin did not detail what happened after that, but it is apparent, Sara, that he is trying to marginalized, sideline Prigozhin, while at the same time keeping the door open for these very capable Wagner fighters to join the Russian military and keep fighting.

Hard line Republic s pushing a series of controversial changes that now threaten to sink the whole thing.The bill is known as the National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA, and it authorizes funding and sets the policy agenda for the Department of Defense. Put simply, they have to pass this bill and they do it every year. And it usually passes with wide bipartisan support. But the addition of anti-abortion, anti-diversity and anti- trans measures has changed that today. CNN's Manu Raju is on Capitol Hill tracking all of this. So, Manu, the changes happened late into the night. Where is this going this morning?",

And at the moment, they are confident that they will have the votes to pass it, even as Democratic supporters of this bill have essentially revolted and are expected to vote for this. In large part, almost all of them expected to vote no.But those changes that included nixing the Pentagon's policy that provided reimbursements for military service members or their family who travel out of state for an abortion, that is now would be killed as part of this bill. Also going after transgender veteran health care, also killed as part of this bill, and dealing with the diversity and equity programs at the Pentagon, also eliminated as part of these series of amendments. And as a result, the Democrats who indicated before that they plan to support what has traditionally been a bipartisan measure are indicating that they will vote against it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JASON CROW (D-CO):  I'm not going to support a bill that that directly attacks the men and women who have sworn an oath to defend this country and give their life to this country. REP. TED LIEU (D-CA):  It's now become an extreme, radical defense authorization bill. REP. NANCY MACE (R-SC):  I'm still pissed off. I'm still frustrated. If we want to show America that we can come together and that we care about women, we got to stop being assholes to women. We got to start stop targeting women and do the things that make a real difference. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She did vote for that amendment, claiming that it was essentially out of the Pentagon's bounds to reimburse people for elective procedures.But the fact that that amendment was added is the reason why we expect a large number of Democrats to ultimately vote against it, including the Democratic leadership. Now, even if this bill passes the House, which we expect it to happen later this morning, this version is unlikely to reach the president's desk, given the Democratic-led Senate and the White House's opposition to many of these provisions in there. But this will set up a huge clash in this coming year over these key national security priorities and also a real indication of how Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the House, runs the House and runs its conference, does cater to the whims of the right, but trying to keep his conference in line.

It's just next to the box that you're in, Manu. But we were also looking -- Manu, thank you so much. But we were also looking at just before that, I think, was a live look at the House floor, and we saw Adam Smith, who is the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.

It has now got a lot of amendments. Do you, in any way, support the defense bill as it stands right now? REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA):  Absolutely. I do not support it at all. The Republicans, the MAGA, extreme Republicans, have forced into this bill basically hijacking our national security bill to put in place some extraordinarily bad policies that are going to make it very, very difficult for the American military to operate. The gentleman that was on just before me was correct. American military has to be the very best. But in order to be the best, you've got to be able to recruit. And 50 percent of the American population, between 18 and 30, that's the prime age for our new recruits, they're minorities. The military has to understand diversity. They have to understand equity. We need women in the military. The prohibition on getting an abortion, let's say somebody, a naval officer is raped on a ship, cannot get an abortion. This is just outrageous. It is going to harm the military. We've got to get rid of these extremist policies and go back to basics. The basics is being able to recruit into our military at least half of our population and the other half being women. We have to be able to have policies in place that provide the services necessary both to recruit and to put into the military the rest of this program. Hey, these people have tried to eliminate funding for Ukraine. There were numerous amendments. Fortunately, they were defeated. But the same group that is forcing in these social policies into this bill also tried to remove funding for Ukraine. It is outrageous. Democrats are going to -- yes.",

They need to understand the history of slavery in this country. They need to understand that women need to have access to all kinds of reproductive rights and programs.

But then you hear from SAG-AFTRA, you've heard from the union that represents, you said, the over 160,000 actors and the president, Fran Drescher, drawing a hard line yesterday.And it's not just about artificial intelligence. It's about more pay. It's about what does the future of production look like in the age of streaming. And the actors and writers alike, they are demanding that they be met closer to where they want to be, and that's why they went on strike. So, like you said, I'll be there at some of the picketing and the locations this afternoon. It starts at 12:00 Eastern. But I also just want to point out to you that there was a real big issue with A.I. that came to the forefront yesterday, and it's that there was a proposal by the AMPTP that represents the studios saying, okay, here's what we're going to do. When it comes to extras, we will offer one day's pay. We will scan the actor, and then we will be able to use their likeness in perpetuity without ever paying more than just that one day rate. And that's one of the things that you heard Fran Drescher and others take issue with saying we're being taken advantage of. And so the AMPTP, though, is drawing their own hard line.
