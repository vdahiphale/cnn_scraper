In the past, it would have been with the queen, of course, who was this towering figure on the international stage, the longest-serving head of state. Now, it's King Charles, the beginning, really, of his monarchy and his opportunity to show how he's doing things slightly differently.So, as you say, they are going to discuss climate change, they're going to have a meeting about that, which in itself is very unusual, because Queen Elizabeth never really discussed what was going to be discussed in those meetings. Charles is handling things differently and wants to work on with the key figures who can actually have an impact on climate change, the president of the United States, to discuss that issue. The key thing about this probably from our end is that everything went very smoothly. The two men appear to get on very well. This is all about reiterating the long-term, strong, as the Brits would call it, special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. The U.S. is by far the most important bilateral party for the U.K. -- partner for the U.K. in the world. It's really important that we can solidify that relationship with the U.S. while Rishi Sunak is dealing with some prickly issues, really, in that, particularly in the -- how they're handling the war in Ukraine. Political issues, I mean, you could argue climate has become a political issue as well around the world, but this is something Charles is not going to let up on. In the past, these moments have been a bit awkward for President Trump, for example, getting a bit lost. But Charles very much in control of this moment, showing the inspection of the guard, allowing President Biden to inspect that guard, and it all went pretty smoothly. So, now they've gone in for tea and for a discussion about climate.",

Max Foster, we're going to continue checking in with you through the hour.And new this morning, we are now hearing from the Kremlin that Yevgeny Prigozhin met with President Vladimir Putin after his short-lived mutiny at the end of June. Remember that attempted coup? Well, we're told the meeting took place on June 29th, that was five days after the rebellion. CNN Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen joins us now.

And I think it is something that certainly shows that Wagner -- the Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin and his fighters, certainly, of huge significant to Vladimir Putin if he was willing to meet with Yevgeny Prigozhin just five days after that mutiny.So, obviously, one of the things that we heard from the Kremlin today is no one really knew where Yevgeny Prigozhin was. People thought that he might have been in Belarus, then of course, the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, he told our own Matthew Chance last week that actually Yevgeny Prigozhin was back in St. Petersburg in Russia. So, now the Kremlin coming out and saying that on June 29th, so just a couple of days, five days after that mutiny, Yevgeny Prigozhin and 35 commanders, as the Kremlin put it, were inside the Kremlin. Now, apparently, Vladimir Putin gave his own assessment of what they called the special military operation, which is obviously Russia's war in Ukraine, but then also about the mutiny itself. And then also, apparently, this according to the Kremlin, offered his thoughts on possible further deployments. Now, the interesting thing about all of this is they said that 35 commanders took part, including Yevgeny Prigozhin. They did not say whether people from Russia's defense ministry took part. Of course, one of the things that we know is that Yevgeny Prigozhin was on his way to Moscow on June 24th specifically to try and go after the defense minister and Vladimir Putin's top generals. So, obviously, all of this directly also in defiance of Vladimir Putin. Now, we're learning that Yevgeny Prigozhin was in fact in the Kremlin. It certainly seems to show that despite the fact that Yevgeny Prigozhin has now been discredited on Russian state media pretty much since that happened, the fighters that he commanded and controlled still seem very important for the Kremlin leader, guys.",

We're getting a sense that he is looking at things that he needs to change in order to maintain his power. It's also a situation, I think, where Prigozhin either has something on Putin, or he's got enough leverage where he can actually control some of, not only the narrative, but also what Putin does next. Think about what they have, for example, in Africa. You know, you've got the Wagner group all over Africa. You've got them in Syria. That's a huge arm of Russian foreign policy that's sitting right there. And if that is, somehow, stopped or doesn't work as well as it once did, that creates a real problem for the Kremlin.

And then, like, this foreign policy security arm in Africa, Wagner. These things start to weaken as the ripples, kind of, go out on these concentric rings.

You know, there was the investment into the ammunition recently that was controversial. I think the White House is going to try to make sure that them and Europe are on the same page.I was in Munich at the security conference earlier this year, and there was a real sense, a palpable sense that this is an important year to really turn the page on the war in Ukraine. If they're at the same point next year, at this point, if they think that the support in their own countries may have to shift. And so, I think the U.S. is going to have to push on the, kind of, offensive right now. And they're going to try to make sure that them and Europe are on the same page right now, because the political picture looks a little murkier come next year. I think that's why you're seeing the investment in ammunition right now. And that's why you're seeing the White House use this U.K. meeting as the, kind of, first step to make sure that they have a Europe that's on the same page going into what is going to be a very sequential year. For sure -- especially before an election. The White House is thinking about this next year as a way to -- as a key moment for the war, because they don't want there to be a push back domestically on the amount of investment they're doing over in Europe.

The incident is under investigation and we will continue to cooperate with NCIS and appropriate authorities.\" Now the NCIS is the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and they declined to comment citing respect for the investigative process.

They said the 14-year-old's grandmother went to authorities and reported the girl missing on June 13th, but she told deputies that her granddaughter had actually ran away from home on June 9th. That's when authorities then put her name on multiple missing persons databases, but it wasn't until the 28th that military police actually found the 14-year-old here on base.
