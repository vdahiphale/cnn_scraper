The big news today in former President Trump's hush money trial is that Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer who is expected to link Trump directly to the alleged reimbursement payments, will testify on Monday. Court is over for the day today but just before it concluded, Trump's defense asked the judge to put a gag order on Cohen after his recent social media posts attacking Trump, the judge denying that request. CNN's Kara Scannell has been inside the courtroom every day of this trial.And Kara, the judge rejecting the gag order request for Cohen, but he did tell prosecutors to tell Cohen to stop talking about the case. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Brianna. So the lawyers for Trump brought this up at the end of the day, and they were saying that earlier this week, Michael Cohen had posted on TikTok, and in his post, he was wearing a T-shirt that had an image of Trump that - in an orange jumpsuit behind bars. They asked the judge to extend the gag order in the case to cover Cohen. But the judge has said all along that he doesn't have the authority to tell witnesses what to do in a case, but the prosecution said that they have repeatedly asked the witnesses, not just Michael Cohen, to refrain from making public statements about the trial or Donald Trump, but they can't control their witnesses either.So the judge then said to the people, he said, \"I direct the people to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements about the case or Mr. Cohen and - Mr. Trump, and that comes from the bench, and you're communicating that on behalf of the bench.\" So just short of being able to directly order Michael Cohen not to do something, he's saying he wants prosecutors to tell them that the judge is saying from the bench that he firmly doesn't want him to say anything. Of course, Michael Cohen is expected on the witness stand on Monday, where he will begin his testimony, and he is the center person in this case. He was in the middle of the hush money payments that's at the issue of this case, and he's also involved in the reimbursement. He's expected to testify that he and Donald Trump met in the Oval Office in February of 2018, and that is when, according to prosecutors, this alleged reimbursement screening was hatched, and it is this reimbursement, the cover-up of the hush money payments that prosecutors say resulted in those falsified business records, those 34 counts that Donald Trump is facing. So his testimony is expected to last a few days, but prosecutors said today in court that it is possible that they will rest their case by the end of next week, Brianna.",

But first, Elie, just that Allen Weisselberg piece of things, considerations here are what? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Well, prosecutors are worried about the missing witness and this is a factor in a lot of trials. They are worried correctly that the defense is going to stand up and say, where's Allen Weisselberg, folks? He's the one in the middle of this. You heard so much about him. They're the ones with the burden of proof. They didn't call him. And what they want to do, prosecutors, is be able to explain to the jury why they didn't call him. Now, the fact that he's in prison makes it more difficult, but that actually doesn't take someone off the board. People are brought in from prison to testify all the time. And what prosecutors want to do is get in evidence of his severance agreement with The Trump Organization, which, first of all, pays him, I think it's $2 million. Second of all, has a non-disparagement clause. Now, I don't think a non-disparagement clause can legally prevent someone from testifying in court under subpoena. I mean, imagine if it did. But prosecutors want to have some reason to explain to the jury why they didn't hear from Allen Weisselberg in a way that's not used against them.",

And the first one, I think, was Jeff McConney, former Trump Organization executive, walking through checks and invoices and books. We have this testimony from Jeff McConney and Deborah Tarasoff, two Trump Organization employees.It might have put jurors to sleep, but prosecutors can't establish a case about financial improprieties without getting those documents in. People have sort of a law and order or \"Perry Mason\" notion of how trials work, but witnesses like this were critically important. Another one that I would point to is the denial of a mistrial and I think America got its introduction to the concept of a mistrial this week, where an error happens at trial that is so grave that it deprives the defendant of his ability to have a fair trial. The defense made the argument this week that Stormy Daniels' testimony, that got into all kinds of salacious details about sex and positions, and pajamas and all that business was so - sorry, Jackie, but was so prejudicial to the defense.

And the argument they made was that it jeopardizes ability to get a fair trial. The judge denied that, rightly so, because he can instruct the jurors later on to disregard some of that other stuff. But it really was a big moment, I think, in, frankly, American legal history, all of this. And I think the last one I would point to is Stormy Daniels' the second day of her testimony.And the first day, I think, was pretty effective as a cross- examination, because what the defense did was attack her credibility by sort of saying that she'd signed a statement saying that she did not have sex with Donald Trump. She made a statement publicly that she did not. And also that she had financial interest in doing so, in engaging in all this behavior. They could have stopped right there and cut things off. Instead, they brought her back for a second day of cross-examination and got into all this stuff where she was quite effective at lobbing shots back and saying - one of the questions was, you've made money off of this. And she said, yes, just like Donald Trump. And it just sort of - I think she had the defense on their heels, as opposed to their toes, and really got the upper hand that second day.

What the sheriff's office is saying about claims that the deputy went to the wrong apartment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:18:10] KEILAR: Israel's security cabinet has just approved expansion of its military operation in the Southern Gaza city of Rafah. This follows President Biden's threat to withhold some weapons from Israel if it launches an offensive there. But the white house says it's not seeing indications of a large scale invasion of Rafah at this point. A defiant Prime Minister Netanyahu says Israel is prepared to stand alone and fight with its fingernails in its campaign to wipe out Hamas. Despite Biden's ultimatum, Israel has stepped up its ground operation around Rafah and continues carrying out airstrikes in the city with ceasefire talks on hold.

That a ground operation involving I think it was nine or 11 soldiers, as they said, hit a hornet's nest, a Hamas hornet's nest is how they described it, inside of Rafah.And they say nine of those soldiers were lightly injured. One was a bit more seriously injured. They say those soldiers got stung. That's kind of metaphoric language, but it comes down to the same thing, that the IDF is going to find themselves, if they're not using those heavy weapons, then the soldiers are likely going to be in greater harm's way than they would have been previously. Not exclusively, but that is a potential. And, of course, that can have a potential backlash for the prime minister of Israel, too. If there are higher troop casualties in the Rafah operation than, let's say, the operation in the north of Gaza, then this could turn sentiment against them.
