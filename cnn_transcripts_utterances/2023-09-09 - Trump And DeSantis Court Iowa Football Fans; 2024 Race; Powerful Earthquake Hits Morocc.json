And you can sense it as these candidates make their way through the crowd. So what they are doing right now is that they are both seated inside the stadium. They are, indeed watching the football game, trying to take part in the spectacle of all of this. But the undercurrent of all of this is their rivalry, the presidential politics rivalry. DeSantis is seated in the crowd with Iowa's popular Republican governor. Donald Trump is seated inside a stadium box. Now ahead of entering this particular stadium, what we saw is more of the sort of, you know, rubbing elbows with the students, trying to pose for the best presidential picture in this caucus state. They were tailgating, Donald Trump was at a tailgating party at a fraternity where he was signing footballs, he was throwing footballs. He even flipped some burgers. And as he walked around the stadium and walked into the stadium, he was greeted by very loud cheering. DeSantis, same thing. Also trying to tailgate, meet with people. He had a number of campaign stops ahead of coming here to the stadium, and what you heard DeSantis talk about is not just football and what this day means for Iowans, but he spent a good deal of time talking about how he's ahead of Trump on the number of visits to the state. He's been here eight times since he announced. He talks about how he's been to more than half of the 99 counties here in Iowa. I want you to take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): And I'm actually starting to hear a lot of people say because you're showing up, I'm supporting you, because that's the way you got to do it.

We're talking about Kelly Loeffler, Perdue, and Lindsey Graham. She sat back and looked at how will this play out in a court of law and decided not to move forward.

And depending on when that turn happens, will make all the difference when you're talking about impacts, if any, to the U.S. East Coast. With this traveling well north of the Caribbean, we're looking at basically large swells, high surf, and some rip currents across some of the Caribbean islands. But we're not going to see really many more impacts than that. We are looking at that turn. But look at all of these forecast models we look to determine what the forecast is going to be, really spread out.

It says this -- we're going to show it to viewers: \"We call on all states to uphold the principles of international law including territorial integrity and sovereignty. We welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine.\" What do you think, General, is Ukraine right to be annoyed about this? Looking at this statement that we just read, where is the talk of the war crimes? Russia's been credibly accused of war crimes. It just sounds like the G-20 did not go far enough, not being tough enough on Russia. GEN. WESLEY CLARK, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I agree with that, Jim. And I think Ukraine is right to be concerned. I know Jake Sullivan and the president are proud of what they got. I'm sure it was a tough fight to even get that into the G-20. But these nations don't understand the lessons that the West learned from the Second World War and the Cold War. Aggression has to be forcefully stopped. That if you let it get going, you get a wider war. That was the lesson that came out of Munich in 1938. And it's the lesson that our policymakers have held for 70 years. But you know, new nations like India and others that are new on the diplomatic scene relative to World War II, they don't have that historical memory. They're not following the lessons. And by not condemning Russia strongly for a war of aggression, they're inviting more trouble in the future. The United States has probably done all it could do. But my sympathy's with Ukraine on this. They're right. This is a war of aggression. It's terrible war crimes being committed.
