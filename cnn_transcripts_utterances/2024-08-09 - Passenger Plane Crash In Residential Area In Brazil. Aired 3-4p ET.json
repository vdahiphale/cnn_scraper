As you look at this video of the plane falling, bear in mind the lives on board. It crashed into several houses. You can see the residential area. It is 62 people on board, 58 passengers and four crew members. We heard from President Lula of Brazil in the last hour or so. Let's play this out. Is it voiced or do you need me to translate? Let's listen to this. First, I have to be the bearer of very bad news, and I would like everyone to stand up so that we can observe a minute of silence because a plane has just crashed in the city of Vinhedo in Sao Paulo, with 58 passengers and four crew members, and it appears they all died. I want to ask for a minute of silence for the victims. That was President Lula in the last 40 minutes, 45 minutes, I should say. We have still yet to hear from the airline VOEPASS. The plane is an ATR-72 flying to Sao Paulo, a flight that will normally take one-and-a-half hours. We have a team of reporters and transportation experts trying to help us make sense of why this happened. But first, let me go to CNN producer Marcelo Medeiros reporting for us from Atlanta. Marcelo, what more are you learning? What are you hearing from Brazilian authorities this hour?",

Clearly, there could be major engine or propeller failure for propeller for example, goes into reverse. You could get that sort of scenario. I'm only speculating. I'm not suggesting I have inside information that it was a propeller problem or an icing problem, but clearly the Brazilian authorities will put together an international team. This aircraft is manufactured by Airbus in France and Italy. And so they'll have the manufacturer of the airframe, the engines, the electronics, and also of course, the airlines and the aviation authorities from Brazil. Brazil is a sophisticated aviation country, so there'll be -- there'll be capable of carrying out this investigation with some help from both the French and the American authorities.",

It didn't develop a full rotation like we see in the videos. But yeah, it doesn't have the best safety record, but I certainly wouldn't call it a particularly dangerous aircraft. But clearly, this thing was totally out of control. Fall turboprop aircraft, not the ATR72. And they're very -- the engines are very powerful. And of course, propeller settings are very critical. So, if you have a -- I'm not suggesting that it had a propeller failure. If you have that, you can get into that kind of spin that is obviously difficult, if not impossible, to recover from.

If it was a stall, you'll see a degrading of their air speed and you'll also hear a warning as it gets critical called the stick shaker. You know that that sends chills through every pilot. If you're flying an aircraft, but particularly a turboprop, and you get the stick shaker, you need to take action immediately. And the ATR72, there's about 800 of them out there, has had some issues with this. But you know, how it got into that precarious situation we simply won't know until we get the data recorder and the voice recorder. They'll probably be flown to France. The French and the Brazilians will download them together and we'll have a picture of the story clearly quickly.

First of all, it's difficult to get aerodynamic control to recover, aerodynamic control, and you don't have much time. You can't pull out at 500 feet above the terrain if you're falling at those speeds. So they would have had to react and get control at 10,000 feet or thereabouts. I'm guessing.

So that will be one of the first places that investigators will look and the NTSB and other safety organizations studied how challenging it is first to know that you're in an icy condition. And then secondly, to take the steps necessary to get out of it and to protect your aircraft and your passengers. We did a long study on what they called drizzle droplets, which are particularly dangerous.

Now, the VOEPASS flight that crashed near Vinhedo, Brazil, began losing altitude as we look at this video, a minute and a half before crashing, that's flight tracking data from FlightRadar24. This is what it shows. The plane had been cruising at 17,000 feet until about one 1:21 p.m. local time when it dropped approximately 250 feet in 10 seconds, and then climbed approximately 400 feet in about eight seconds. Eight seconds later, it lost just under 2,000 feet. That an approximately one minute. It began rapidly descending, roughly 17,000 feet, which is what were talking about in just one minute. And the last data transmission from the plane was 1:22 p.m. So, Peter, let me go to you from what we've just outlined that the cruising 70,000 feet dropping 200 feet in ten seconds and then climbing back up, dropping again in eight seconds.

I don't know that we can eliminate a problem with the engine superpowers yet. As Peter said, this is all very, preliminary. But yeah, when you dive in climb, that suggests that this is not simply a case of loss of power. It would be going trade down normally, not straight down, but they would be descending. But when they climb back up, that sounds like there's a controllability problem and icing can certainly give that to you. I've been in icing in a light plane -- yeah, it really does affect your ability to control the aircraft and you have to keep to speed up like, like Peter said, you don't want to pull those up if you've got icing, you want to get the speed faster than it can regain control.",

      "sentences": "Well, those movements of the aircraft and those speeds would definitely indicate to me that there was some typeof icing problem that was the cause. You can see that when that first initial happens, what happens is the aircraft, you think of icing is disrupting the airflow over the wings. But in fact, it's the weight of the aircraft that changes when you have a lot of icing. So if you've been flying all that distance and then the weight gets to a point where the aircraft simply can't carry it, that's when you get that initial stall and then initial drop that was mentioned. And then to pull up, to go back up, it could be either some of the wing, some of the ice broke off when that happened, and then the aircraft rows or the pilot may have reacted thinking, oh, my gosh, were dropping and then tried to react by pulling up. So when that happens, then you get a secondary stall. And this is where the power on stall happens. That you're trying to power, you're trying to pull yourself out of this dissent. And when that happens, the aircraft goes into the power on stall. In other words, you don't have enough air going over the wings to create the lift that you need. And so the engines are trying to pull the aircraft forward, but it can't. And so that's where you start getting into situation where the aircraft begins to fall and that's that 2000 foot drop that we are talking about. There. And that's where it becomes pretty unrecoverable. Couple of ways to get out of that is to continue to reduce power that your nose down, and then that gets the airflow over the top of the wing. However, if you're already at a lower altitude, you may not have enough altitude to recover in that way in addition, it takes, it may take a minute or two for the pilot to understand what's going on, what's happened here. So that indicates to me that that's again, it's too early to tell and the black boxes and the information that we'll get, we'll tell us what's going on here, but that would be -- it seems into indicative of an icing condition.",

Obviously, even someshowers around but there was nothing really to see whether wise at 17,000 or 14,000 feet. So the issue was what was going on up there and the air was saturated. We're talking about the possible its ability of 100 percent relative humidity below freezing temperatures, making snow, it could -- didn't come down. It would be rain because it would melt on the way down there. But that's what's going on up there. And we've talked about this word stall and I don't want people to think like your car stalls. When you stall the plane, you stall the wing, a plane flies because the top of the wing makes the air go faster than the bottom part of the wing. And Bernoulli principle says that that will lift the plane. Watch this, this is with no wind going over the plight the paper at all and by blowing on the top of that paper, it lifts the paper itself the same way, the air lifts the top of the wing to the plane. That's your vector going up. And what you see on the ground is the fact that the plane had no forward speed. It went into the ground literally almost maybe five or ten miles per hour, but maybe even less than that. You need the wing air to go over that arch of the top of the wing to get lift the back and that plane had no lift whatsoever.",

But once we do, that will absolutely show us what inputs took place. Now, eventually, it overwhelms itself, because if there's no forward motion, if you can't get speed going, and there is no evidence in that picture in that in that video of speed, I think the Brazil to Paris Air France 442 crash where the plane was coming down, but they when back up again and then they went back down again because they were able to get some momentum going. Isa, here, they're going to know what happened, why the plane would have had such a dramatic stall in -- I mean, I heard what Chad said about the weather forecast.

It's quite hard thing topractice because you can't really stall the aircraft to the point of catastrophe, but absolutely. Now, the more complex the aircraft becomes the more the different flying surfaces can cause stalls. A tail stall, a wings stall, all sorts of reasons, a loss of power stall, and an icing stall, all these reasons. But the fundamentals remain at some point, there is not enough air over the wing. This is the wing, which is the wing going through and through, through the air. And there is not enough going across it to create the left, the plane has slowed. So this is the wing comes through the air it goes across it and it normal circumstances, that's what will create lift. If you lose that weight, that air over the wing, then you have this stalled. But, but, Isa, this is not just stall. This is -- this is this is a dramatic, catastrophic, this plane essentially came to a stop in the air, and the reason why, it's initial approach to an airport that is well serviced, the weather is not dreadful, and all of a sudden this happens. Now, was it mechanical? Was it structural failure? As David Soucie suggests, was it icing to the de-icing and the anti-icing of the de-icing equipment on the wing fail. Did the pilots -- crucial moments for 442 again? Didn't pilots are crucial moments make errors of input to the controls. We know that that can happen. But the ATR is a -- it's a tricky plane to fly, but it's a very well-known plane. It has been around for a long time. It's tricky in certain circumstances, and in this particular case -- yes, go ahead. I'm sorry.",

If you look at previous crashes ofthe ATR and there have been several notable ones, the mind escapes me to bring to four, but there are numerous occasions and -- but why, but why do airlines like it? Because of its cost basis. It is an easy plane to, if you will, cost-wise to fly because you're and once you go from ATR, you're going to larger planes, larger planes are more expensive to buy and to run, put jet equipment on. The 717, the Airbus, the small airbus or 220, all of these are much more expensive. The ATR fits that niche market of these types of routes and that's why it's popular, used to be much more popular plane in Europe and it is today. But as I say, the trickiness is that the aerodynamics of the ATR, which are well-known, but they do require certain and finessing in certain situations, whether this was one of them. But if -- the horror -- let me just pause for a moment and think of the horror for what happened here because from flight level 170, 17,000. How -- you've got the numbers there. How long was it from top to bottom?",

The ATR plane 72, Richard was talking about a well-known plane. There has been criticism over it. But this is the moment that you see the plane falling out literally falling out of the sky. We know it fell about 17,000 feet in just one minute. It fell in a residential area. What we're hearing from our teams is that luckily, no one on the ground has been hurt or I should say has died a result of it. VOEPASS, the airline, has said, VOEPASS used all means to support those involved. There is still no confirmation of how the accident could or the current situation the people on board. Let's get more on this. I want to bring in David Tokoph. He's president and CEO of MBA Aviation. He joins us from Arlington, Virginia. Welcome to the show. Just from what -- you know, what we've been showing our viewers, 17,000 feet in just one minute. That is absolutely terrifying. What can you tell us about the ATR 72 plane? Because as I heard from some of my guests, it has a bit of a checkered past.",

We also see the footage of how it felt of the wreckage and it almost looks like pancaked on the ground.

Now, the investigators are going to start by looking at a speed that and that's available to them. You know, every aircraft has a transponder. They report to ground stations and they'll use that data, determine what contributing factors led to this event. They'll also then gather the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder from the wreckage. And then they'll be able to start to piece together what occurred and ultimately come up with -- trying to come up with the causes of the accident.",

Because I know what we heard from our Richard Quest, you know, aerodynamic stalls is something pilots are trained on from day one. So there are other potentially, potentially I should say other contributing factors here.",
