Certainly, they hope that at the very minimum, President Biden could get an agreement from Israel to open up access to humanitarian aid and to further secure the Palestinian civilian life.As I said, it is practically if not completely unprecedented that an American president arrives in the region and then gets canceled by a very, very important Arab coalition of allies. Allies not just of the United States but actually, allies of Israel. That would be Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority, all of whom are declared allies and have peace treaties with Israel. So this is a really, really difficult thing. And clearly, given what we're hearing -- and we have been hearing before this disaster in Gaza -- before this latest disaster in Gaza, we've been hearing very, very strong narrative of what's going to happen from all the Israeli officials -- whether they are the prime minister, the IDF, the prime minister's spokespeople -- that this is the sharp, hard end of the spear. That they are going in because this is different than it's ever been. But, of course, with that comes a lot of warnings from many military analysts, many former militaries, current military officials that this will be massively difficult. And because it is in an urban environment, trying to separate the enemy -- the terrorists from the people is going to be incredibly difficult. So we are going to see more and more of this kind of mass casualties. We are going to see it if the past is any prelude to what's about to unfold. Secondly, we have experience. We have experience in Fallujah, in Mosul. We have experience in Raqqa. We know how difficult ground wars are. And people are warning the Israelis that in the -- in the heat, in the emotion and the anger of having been attacked on 9/11, the United States went into a highly misguided war in Iraq for which it is still paying.",

The sky lights up. It is an incredibly massive blast. It erupts on the hospital grounds sending a huge cloud of smoke into the air. Now, this is video. We know what this video is of. We do not -- from our analysis, at this point, we're not able to independently verify what caused that blast. But we pause to consider that massive explosion and how much human life we are looking at expire in the instant that we replay. Hundreds of people are dead. Joining me now is IDF spokesman, Major Doron Spielman. And Major, I very much appreciate your time. Obviously, I was with you the other day at a military base looking at some of the weapons that you have seized from Hamas. I want to begin by asking you your reaction when you look at that video and you see that massive explosion. I know you've seen it yourself from your own sources, but we're showing it to the world now. In that moment of an explosion, hundreds of people die. How do you react to that? MAJOR DORON SPIELMAN, SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, first of all, if we look at this entire war that we're looking at right now, even if we go back to the very beginning, it was the senseless massacre of Israeli civilians. In this case, it's Gazan civilians that were massacred once again by Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The loss of any civilian -- man, woman, or child -- wherever they are in the world is an enormous tragedy. However, when I see that video what I understand, once again, is how Hamas is trying to play the entire world. It goes back to the ISIS playbook. They committed that atrocity. It was their rocket. We have clearly proven this to the world. And yet, Hamas, right away, without having any proof whatsoever, announced to the world that it was Israeli, and the world ran with this in the media. And my question is and our question is how could the world take Hamas as a credible source when we saw the massacre of men, women, and babies just over a week ago? This was Hamas. It has their fingerprints on it. It is them who shot this rocket.",

You have that. You've put that out.You've also put out your view -- your trajectories. I'm sorry, I was looking for the right word. Trajectory of rockets that were coming out and showing that 450 rockets fired by Jihadist groups in Gaza have misfired and landed in Gaza since this war began 12 days ago. Major, just a very simple question. Do you feel confident that every single rocket coming out of Gaza -- every single one -- that you know where it's coming from and obviously, generally, where it's going because of your Iron Dome? Do you feel that you have 100 percent visibility?",

      "sentences": "So, first of all, what I can tell you is 100 percent -- every rocket coming out of Gaza is aimed at innocent Israeli civilians. Not a single one of them is aimed at a military target. They're aimed at our cities.They're aimed at mothers and fathers and children having breakfast in their home. They're aimed at hundreds of thousands and millions of Israelis who are constantly under attack. And that is where those rockets are aimed. We have invested a ton of resources higher than any other location in the entire world in trying to pinpoint rockets and trying to disable them. That's where my tax dollars go. In the Gaza Strip, their funds and their tax dollars, and the money they get from Iran is going into rockets, not into protecting their civilians. That is the enormous moral divide between Israel, who is concerned with its own civilians, and Hamas, who are trying to kill as many civilians. And at the same time, put their own civilians at risk. This was clearly a Hamas and Islamic Jihad rocket. It was fired at 6:59. You don't need us to talk about it. I'm holding up this piece of paper. This is an Al Jazeera screenshot. Al Jazeera was running live. Now, no one is going to say that Al Jazeera are going to be marching in any parades on behalf of the state of Israel or that they're (INAUDIBLE). Al Jazeera, on live footage, showed the rocket taking off from Gaza, showed the explosion just around the same time -- just a minute or two before Hamas went out and claimed to the world that this was an Israeli attack. There were no Israeli weapons fired in that area whatsoever. We released audio footage of two Hamas terrorists speaking between themselves in Arabic in which they acknowledge that they realize it's a rocket of Islamic Jihad that landed on the hospital. This is the fingerprint of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. They were the ones who committed this. And what I can be 100 percent sure about is that they will never tell you the truth if they shot this on their own civilians.",

And because the fuel was in the engine still -- because it had not reached its target in Israel to kill Israeli civilians -- the blast was enormous.We also can confirm by that audio conversation between the two Hamas operatives that they're saying -- one is saying to the other it was fired by Islamic Jihad in the cemetery behind the hospital. And the other one was asking are you sure? He says yes, and it landed on top of the hospital. Take Israel out of the picture. You have Al Jazeera footage. You have Hamas operatives discussing this. We know from our own radar the trajectory of the rocket. This was a Hamas and Islamic Jihad rocket. What I don't understand is when it comes to Israel and we claim that babies were beheaded and bodies were mutilated, the whole world asked us to prove this. We have to go to enormous strides to try to prove the death of civilians. Here, in Gaza, when Islamic Jihad bombs their own citizens people take this without any proof whatsoever.

They were begging and pleading with the administration to intervene not now, but even last year when the event around the Aqsa mosque were happening. Where during Ramadan people were being attacked and harassed by both settlers and the army. They -- I think Arab leaders are frustrated because they see the same approach by the Israelis, backed by the Americans, that this conflict can be managed and can be, in any way, contained without a political solution, which they indicate as the main reason why we are here at the fifth round.

A statement that there's no civilians in Gaza. The army, I believe, some military official two days ago on CNN said we are not fighting Hamas but we are fighting civilians.So these kind of statements complicate President Biden's mission but also in the eyes of Palestinians and the wider region -- the people who are protesting in Jordan, and Turkey, and Egypt -- they are telling us we look at the statements and the deeds of the Israelis and we don't believe what happened. Also, they indicate and they are telling us look, it happened in 1996 when Israel struck a U.N. compound in Lebanon. They said it was Hezbollah and then it turned out that it was Israel.

There's not someone you put up -- you know, Byron Donalds might throw his name in and Elise Stefanik. Those votes are not there. This just underscores how broken the House Republican Conference is.

It could run the way that we promised our voters. That does not exist. You cannot have 20 people or 18 who won Biden districts and also keep the Matt Gaetz's and the Freedom Caucus guys happy. There's got to be somebody in the middle that people can support but it doesn't exist.
