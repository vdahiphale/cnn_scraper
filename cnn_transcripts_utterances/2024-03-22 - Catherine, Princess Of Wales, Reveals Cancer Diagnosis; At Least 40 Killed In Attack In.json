In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful. However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I'm now in the early stages of that treatment. This, of course, came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family. As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be okay. As I have said to them; I am well and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal; in my mind, body and spirits. Having William by my side is a great source of comfort and reassurance too. As is the love, support and kindness that has been shown by so many of you. It means so much to us both. We hope that you will understand that, as a family, we now need some time, space and privacy while I complete my treatment. My work has always brought me a deep sense of joy and I look forward to being back when I am able, but for now I must focus on making a full recovery. At this time, I am also thinking of all those whose lives have been affected by cancer. For everyone facing this disease, in whatever form, please do not lose faith or hope. You are not alone.

And that was a big step for her and very powerful. And she would have made that decision, she would have had to sign off on it. I want to do it in this way. I want to do it on my own. I don't need Prince William in this. I need to own this.So I think that would have taken a lot of building up to it, another explanation for why we haven't seen much of her recently. But we've just heard from Buckingham Palace, a spokesman just sent me a note about the King - from the King. So His Majesty is so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking, as she did. Following her time in hospital together, His Majesty has remained in the closest contact with his beloved daughter-in-law throughout the past weeks. Both their majesties will continue to offer their love and support to the whole family through this difficult time. I think it was quite a unique experience, wasn't it, for Kate and Charles to be in hospital together and having pretty similar experiences, going in for one procedure and coming out with a completely different diagnosis. But he's very much - looking at that video she put out today and really paying tribute to her and the way she speaks of the children. And clearly he feels that she's getting all of her priorities right there, Anderson.",

Because you do realize they are vulnerable like everyone else, but they're projected as this brand which is sort of invincible in a way. It's been around for a thousand years and we're so used to the Queen being around for so long. And shortly after the King takes the throne, we found out he's got cancer.And the thing about Kate is she's this vision of vibrancy. She's very sporty. She's very energetic. She's very dutiful. She's a fantastic mom from everything that I've seen, really hands-on. And it's - I think it's a shock. When the - when we heard the Queen was ill, that was a shock, even though she was so old. But it's just - this vulnerability, someone that's in your life, you don't know them personally, but they've been part of your life for so long and they might not be there. And then you kind of figure out, what if Charles and Kate weren't there. It's that sort of processing. So I think it is very personal for a lot of people. And as Kate spoke to in her video, I think about other people who've suffered from cancer. This is something I really saw when the Queen died, that people connected with that moment because through - people who've died in their own lives. And I think people now will be thinking of people who've suffered from cancer in their own lives. And looking at Kate as someone that's vulnerable to that, someone you wouldn't expect to be vulnerable to any sort of illness. It's just this vision of vibrancy. So I mean, less said as far as I'm concerned about the distasteful, like upsetting conspiracy theories that boiled up in recent times, they now have the reason for why we didn't see them. Interesting that pretty much the only thing I didn't see online in recent weeks was speculation that she could have cancer. But I think everyone needs to step back a bit and really think about not just what they're putting online, what they're consuming online and just sticking to the facts. On CNN, we've had lots of discussions about this. We want people to get the facts. And it's an incredibly hard story to tell because there have been so few facts. But now we know why we weren't being given information. I think it's understandable that you'd want to protect your kids, frankly.",

But when he talked about prostate cancer, the numbers of people going in for testing, for checkups went up dramatically in the United Kingdom. This may also have a similar effect or people be more aware of forms of abdominal cancer. With that in mind, Max, I want to bring back in Dr. Otis Brawley, a professor of oncology and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University.Dr. Brawley, I'm sorry we were interrupted before, we had breaking news out of Russia. But I just want to continue the conversation because, again, the palace is not saying what form of cancer this is. But it was - in Catherine's words - major abdominal surgery. And that after, according to her, after the surgery, doctors discovered this cancer and chemotherapy started in late February. Just for people - I talked to a doctor in the last hour who was talking about colorectal cancer and how now the recommended age for having tests done for anybody, checkups done for anybody on that has been lowered. Can you just talk about the forms of - I mean, what - potentially what kind of abdominal cancers there are and when should people have something checked out? DR. OTIS BRAWLEY, PROFESSOR OF ONCOLOGY &amp; EPIDEMIOLOGY, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY: Sure.

And then we try to go back and look and see if there's any evidence of disease that might be present.Again, I stress these are chemotherapies that are given to people who have had surgery and after surgery have no evidence of disease, but they fit into a category in terms of the disease that they have, that there may be some disease present that the doctors just can't find. And so we will give the chemotherapy. In colon cancer, it's given over a period of about six months. In ovarian cancer, it's given over a slightly shorter period of time.

The hall now engulfed in flames. You see the images there. It is unclear whether more victims or potentially shooters are inside.What we do know is that CNN has geolocated a video showing four armed attackers opening fire inside a shopping center just outside the concert hall. This is a screen grab from that video. We're not showing you the entire video, just off screen is the moment a group of civilians can be seen huddling together as the men fire at them. A number of them fall to the ground. Then attackers can then be seen shooting out the glass doors to the hall and moving inside. Now, in a separate video recorded inside the hall, you can also hear the sound of gunfire. Our Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance joins us now live from London. Matthew, you were just in Russia earlier this week. What are you hearing about this situation now? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOGBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, I only came out yesterday, so it's astonishing to look at these dramatic images and see the chaos and the bloodshed that's unfolding. It really - I mean, it's not in Moscow City itself, it's just on the outskirts of the city. So formally, it's in the Moscow region, but it's very close to Moscow. It's a major sort of conference center and shopping center and concert hall as well. The Crocus City mall, it's called. And you can see the scenes of chaos there, the billowing smoke above that building, according to Russian state television, the roof of the building has collapsed as a result of fire and explosions that were heard earlier inside. You see those images there of an auditorium, because it was during or as a concert of a Soviet era band called Picnic was about to start. And so a lot of people have gathered in that concert hall to watch them play, but the attack took place, as you say. We're looking at approximately four people that we can see on video that have been carrying out this attack, firing automatic weapons towards people. There have been explosions in the area as well. There are lots of ambulances. Dozens of ambulances have been sent by the local authorities. I think the figure I read was at least 50, possibly more ambulances being sent there. And that gives you an indication of the concerns the authorities have about the casualties. We're talking about preliminary figures of, according to the TASS news agency, which is the state news agency. I think you mentioned it already, 40 people - 40 confirmed dead. And obviously, this situation is still ongoing by the sounds of it. We don't know whether the attackers have been killed, whether they've been neutralized in some other way. And we don't know how many people are still trapped inside what looks like a burning concert hall on the outskirts of Moscow, Anderson.",

I mean, I was actually at that theater, the Dubrovka Theater, the Nord-Ost siege it was called, when that storming of the theater took place by Russian special forces.[15:25:09] And obviously there are parallels. I mean, look at that auditorium. It's a very similar auditorium back in 2002, where the Chechen militants took those hostages, 850 hostages before the place was steamed. Everyone was sort of put to sleep with a gas, a sort of undisclosed substance, which ended up killing quite a lot of people because the doctors outside didn't have the anecdote to it. And so that was sort of like a sort of fumbled, mishandled operation to end the siege. At the moment, it's not clear whether there are hostages inside this or what the situation is inside. But look, you're right, it was Chechens that carried out that 2002 attack on the on the Dubrovka Theater inside Moscow. Russia has a long history of problems with terrorism from the North Caucasus, from Chechnya, from Ingushetia, from places like that. And I know that within the past few weeks, Russian special forces have been carrying out raids against Islamists, Islamic militants inside Ingushetia, which is a Russian republic very close to Chechnya. It may well be linked with that. It's not clear. If it's anything other than Chechen separatists, though, or Islamists from inside Russia, I think it will be a very new departure. For instance, if this has anything to do with Ukraine and there's no indication at this stage that it is. But if it is, I mean, that would obviously be a very new sort of situation that we haven't seen before inside Russia.
