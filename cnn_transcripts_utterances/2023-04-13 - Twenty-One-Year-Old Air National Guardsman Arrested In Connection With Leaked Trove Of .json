This is the street where the suspect, Jack Teixeira lived with his mother. The arrest went down late this afternoon. Cameras were up above as it all happened. You could see the suspect being taken into custody by the FBI, hands above his head, wearing red shorts, slowly backing into the custody of FBI agents. I also want to let you know what we know about the suspect so far. His full name, Jack Douglas Teixeira. He is 21 years old, member of the Air National Guard, Airman First Class. His duty title: Cyber transport systems journeyman, basically an IT specialist. He entered the Air National Guard back in September 26, 2019. One of his friends, telling my colleague, Evan Perez that he was recruited into the Air National Guard back when he was in high school. Also, as you were mentioning, he was the leader of this online group on Discord where they shared mutual information that they were interested in, things like gaming, guns, also sharing racial memes, and according to what Federal investigators are saying, he also shared a great deal of confidential information -- classified information. Now the questions come why someone in his position and his rank had access to this type of classified information? This is something that those inside and outside the Intelligence Community are going to be discussing for some time. Meanwhile, his legal troubles are now just beginning -- Anderson.",

The Defense Department of the Intelligence Agencies has the biggest number of people with security clearances that what might allow them access to these documents, and they've run into problems before. You'll remember the Chelsea Manning, and one of the discoveries from that case was just how many people have access. They tried to institute some changes in the wake of that. One thing to prevent outside flash drives from being allowed to enter department computers. Also, things like monitoring searches, and seeing what is actually printed out. But clearly those measures put in place after Chelsea Manning did not work here, and we are learning tonight that the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has already called for yet another review of what kinds of people have access to this and why.",

That's quite possible. We don't know. But look, I mean, it's kind of a Catch 22 here because it is important, you know, it's important for people to recognize, the Air National Guard is the Air Force. It is not a different thing. And so anything the Air Force needs, the Air National Guard needs, and so some of that is Intel around the world, different areas. You know, I fly an RC-26, we do a lot of counter drugs, so we need to know a little about cartels and what's going on in South America, and so that stuff is important. I'm not sure though that every military unit needs to know the high level details, for instance of you know, how much air defense is left in Ukraine. I'm not sure why that's a benefit for a fighter unit.   So certainly, we need to, I think, go back and go over what is the Intel that's present, but also at the same time, let's not hamstring our ability to fight a war because of this weak link in that chain.",

The State's Attorney General is alleging, and he denies, that he and his children his company gave false financial statements to enrich themselves. In addition to barring the former President and his three oldest children from serving as executives in New York, the suit is also seeking $250 million. CNN's Kara Scannell joins us now with more.

So another time putting these two rivals head-to-head as they've been sparring for years over this investigation, which led to the lawsuit in September. Now, we're also told that, you know, this marks a shift in the strategy, as you said, the former President did not answer questions back in August when he was deposed, then he has -- then the lawsuit was filed, and now they're in this discovery process. Now, as this case is heading toward trial, at a trial, a jury could have what is known as an adverse interest, that is to hold everything that Trump has declined to answer to against him, that goes to the heart of this lawsuit. So this is a strategic move by Trump's team to now answer questions, although it is not without risk, because the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, which announced the criminal charges involving the hush money payments last month, they are still investigating the same issues that are at play in the civil lawsuit, that's the accuracy of these financial statements. So it's a suggestion by the Trump team that they feel strongly that they've got a good case, that they can't -- he can't incriminate himself from the Federal prosecutor's standpoint and their burden of proof, but it certainly is a risky gamble that they made today -- Anderson.",

This is the home base of Donald Trump's business empire. It's where he built you know, Trump Tower and owns leases at this skyscraper behind me on Wall Street.So significant at stake here even though the former President has moved to Florida.

One of the reasons the Supreme Court will often take cases is because they need to clarify when there is this duel going on. But make no mistake, it's not a coincidence that there are cases being brought in places like this specific district in Texas and also being challenged in other places across this country.And so a lot of this was foreseeable. The timing of it as it came down and the opinions coming down, I doubt where it all coordinated. But it also tells you, this is exactly why it'll be the fast track, because the nation can't really rely on what to do on the status quo at this point in time. Remember, that Washington case didn't apply everywhere. It applied only to those states where the attorneys general for those states actually brought a case, which means talking about 16 plus Washington, D.C. There are 50 states in this union. And so where there will be conflict, the courts got to come in and address it, but they're going to have to come down to again. When you're talking about the Dobbs decision in Roe v. Wade, that was a constitutional matter, the constitutional right to have access to abortion. This will be far more administrative about whether you are going to give deference to an agency or not.",

You know, we're almost at the end of the court term. They have a lot of big cases they're trying to grind out, and they're unusually behind, very much behind, way behind any other term in modern memory. So do they want to put this on an expedited basis in front of them right now and add it to an already very big load? Or do they want to grant a stay and say, we're going to hear this in all due time and consideration in the fall when the court resumes for the next term? But for now, the status quo, which was the status quo before the judge in Texas ruled, will remain the status quo because everything he did and everything that the Fifth Circuit did were going to put on hold. Or they could do some permutation of that. A permutation would wreak further chaos, I suspect, and the court has to know that. So I don't know how they're going to view this.
