And they say that they did discover classified materials at his Wilmington home, but say they did not uncover any at this Rehoboth property. Now, once this became the subject of a special counsel investigation, about ten days ago, the FBI conducted its own search of the Wilmington House. It lasted nearly 13 hours and they did uncover additional classified materials. So, it was very much expected that the FBI would also go back to the Rehoboth home even though the president's attorneys had already looked there. And the big question today will be will they find any additional classified materials. We know from our sources that investigators are still going through everything that they retrieved from the Wilmington home ten days ago. As of right now, it appears that dozens of documents have been taken from the former office and the Wilmington home. And the big question today for us and for investigators is whether additional classified material will be found in this home. Now, we have also learned that our searches could potentially happen at other, as of now, undisclosed locations. Another big news is Special Counsel Robert Hur, the man who will oversee this investigation going forward, today is his first day on the job.",

      "sentences": "All right. We should note the search continues. That is CNN's latest reporting.M.J. Lee is at the White House. You look at the president's personal attorney, his statement, Bob Bauer, in response to this, it begins with the words, today with the president's full support and cooperation. That's been a consistent message from the president's team that they are cooperating here. Tell us their view of this latest search. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Jim. Let me actually begin by reading a part of that statement that we just got from Bob Bauer, who was the personal attorney for the president, who is taking lead on this issue. He said today with the president's full support and cooperation, the DOJ is conducting a planned search of his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, under DOJ standard procedures in the interest of operational security and integrity 37. It sought to do this work without advanced public notice and we agReid to cooperate. I think you're absolutely right, that the words, full support and cooperation, is really key here and very telling. They are very much wanting to emphasize that the president himself consented to the search and that this was a planned search that they are basically on board with. This has really been the White House's theory of the case in dealing with this matter. It's really, at every turn, emphasizing that they are cooperating with the DOJ's ongoing investigation and that they are really not going to stand in the way if they proceed to conduct extra searches, as we fully expect them to do. And what they have said all along is when this investigation ultimately wraps up, that they are confident and obviously hopeful that what the investigation will show is that these misplaced classified documents were misplaced inadvertently. Now, it is just hard to overstate how sort of careful and tightlipped this White House has been in talking about this matter overall. They are not answering questions about any details. They are not giving a play-by-play of the investigation as it's going on. So, even if there were a future search, we absolutely do not expect that the White House will give anybody a heads-up, that that is going to happen.",

It's significant if they find more documents just because the scope of the problem here depends in large part on the nature of the documents found and how many there are and where they are found. So, if we don't yet know the full universe of them, we are not fully aware of how bad it is essentially.And then the other is the cooperation obstruction issue. One of the major things that distinguishes this from the Trump investigation is all of the obstruction that happened on the Trump side. It's the fact that this is a voluntary search and they are cooperating suggests there's no obstruction. But you do wonder why they are going back in. I mean, there's a reason that they didn't want to just go with the searches that have been conducted to date. So, to know really what's going on, we, of course, need to know more about why they went in and what they are finding.",

So, let's they do find documents here, how at least politically damaging would that be for the president given that his camp, his team, his lawyers had initially said they found nothing?ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: This is exactly when me and my colleagues surveyed a group of former and current Democrats in Congress as well as just national leaders in the Democratic Party. This is exactly what they said they were fearing when it came to the political implications of this story, sort of the updates that could come in the weeks to come. We know that there's going to be a prolonged investigation here. And you're going to have more headlines of either a search of documents, increased FBI involvement, as we saw with yesterday's story as well of an FBI search. And even today now with the president's residence, a sitting president's residence, we haven't seen polling data that it will impact voter or that it currently has impacted voter sentiment at this point. We do know that, in fact, based off a CNN poll still that there are voters that draw distinction between this and what happened with President Trump and his handling of the documents. But when it comes to the Democratic apparatus, there are those that fear that this could cast a shadow as we get to a likely potential reelection announcement for President Biden as we get to a state of the union address, and as we have a White House strategy of talking about some of the legislative achievements that they passed as well.",

From a legal perspective, which is more likely to draw an indictment or a charge? Is it the holding of the documents or the refusal to return them?",

So, another legal issue putting aside obstruction of justice is, were these classified documents taken and mishandled intentionally? And that's another distinction between the Trump two cases and this current case, at least as far as we know now is that Trump knew he took them, he intended to take them. He still insists he should have been able to have them, whereas Biden, very clearly, is saying it was unintentional, it was a mistake, he's happy to turn them back, he wants to them all turned over. So, that willfulness is really the key element to whether there will be charges putting aside the obstruction on just the document retention and handling side.",

And then once August and training camp rolls around, they start to get the itch again. But I do believe Brady this time when he says this is for real.You can see the anguish and the frustration on his face throughout the 2022 season, both his team was struggling, it didn't look like they were having a whole bunch of fun out there. And then, obviously, off the field his marriage ending in divorce and having all those issues off the field. I think it just wore on him too much. And he's accomplished everything you could possibly accomplish in the NFL. So, I think this time it's certainly more believable. I don't think he has anything up his sleeve, like he did last year when he was trying to join the Dolphins' front office. It does seem that this is finally the real retirement for Tom Brady.",

And otherwise, he played 16 games or 17 games every single season, and then two or three more in the post season. He showed up every Sunday for his team. He won everything there is to be won, all of the records as well. He redefined what it means to be an athlete after 40.40 is supposed to be when your body falls apart. He not only continued to play until he was 45, but he thrived. He was the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl after 40, and he won two of them.
