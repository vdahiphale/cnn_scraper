      "sentences": "Yes, we're awaiting what will be a historic and unprecedented and highly controversial vote when the House moves ahead to impeach the Homeland Security secretary, the first time ever a Homeland Security Secretary has been impeached, charged with high crimes and misdemeanors, and only the second time in history that a Cabinet Secretary has impeached, the last one about 150 years ago, the secretary of the war, William Belknap, at the time being the only one with that distinction.The Republicans are pressing ahead to charge Mayorkas, contending that he has failed in his duties in trying to secure the border with Mexico, charged that Democrats furiously oppose and say that Republicans are abusing the impeachment process to go after Mayorkas on policy grounds. But this vote is expected to be razor thin. There's already this narrow House Republican majority. They cannot afford more than three Republican defections in order to move forward on these charges. We do expect two Republicans to vote against it. A handful of members may have not said how they will vote, but House Republican leaders are confident that they will get there. Now, this also comes as the House GOP leadership is pressing ahead with the standalone $17.6 billion package to fund Israel. It will provide emergency aid for Israel. This is also controversial because Democrats wanted to tie this to Ukraine, to Taiwan aid, as well as the new border security package that was negotiated in the Senate with the White House. They want this in all one package. Mike Johnson has instead pushed for a standalone bill. The White House has threatened to veto it because of this effort, and House Democratic leaders have come out opposed. We expect that bill to fail. They need two-thirds majority in order to get that through, because Johnson himself is facing pushback from the right flank over that Israel package because of concerns that it does not cut spending. ,So that is likely to collapse. Wolf, we do expect when the Mayorkas impeachment vote happens, if in fact he is charged with a high crime and misdemeanor, the Senate controlled by Democrats will ultimately kill that effort, dismiss those charges, and he will not be convicted of a crime, Wolf. But this comes at a time of high tension on Capitol Hill. In addition to the Israel aid package collapsing, we expect the border security deal that was cut with the White House, along with the Ukraine and Israel aid in one big package, to also fail tomorrow morning when the Senate takes up that measure amid Republican rebellion and deep division in the GOP ranks on that issue. So, so much happening, Wolf, but at the end of the day, so much also collapsing amid infighting here in the Capitol.",

We cannot accept former President Trump's claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes. Former President Trump's stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the president beyond the reach of all three branches.In a statement today, the Trump campaign argued that without complete immunity, no president could properly perform their duties for fear of retribution. If immunity is not granted to a president, every future president who leaves office will be immediately indicted by the opposing party. But the court also rejected any suggestion that prosecuting Trump in this case would have a chilling effect on future leaders. Past presidents have understood themselves to be subject to impeachment and criminal liability, at least under certain circumstances, so the possibility of chilling executive action is already in effect. Trump is vowing to appeal and the Supreme Court will likely have the final say. The justices, though, were already set to hear arguments on Thursday in another case with huge implications for Trump on whether his actions after the 2020 election disqualify him from the 2024 ballot. (END VIDEOTAPE) REID (on camera): With Trump expected to appeal this decision, the issue is really now timing. How long will it take the high court to make clear what they intend to do with this case?

They can either appeal to the whole appeals court that's called an en banc, or they can appeal to the Supreme Court.Now, what they said here was that -- and, typically, when it's appealed to the full appeals court, the clock keeps running, right? So, they only gave the foreign president a week to appeal to the Supreme Court, which really incentivizes going there, as opposed to keeping the clock running. One more thing they did was that they wrote this in one voice as opposed to having one judge write it and having two agree with her. No. They said, this is the opinion of the court, we're not signing it. That is one voice that made it a lot less likely that there would be dissent on the court, or that other judges on the court would want to take it up and overturn it. BLITZER: And it's interesting. Jamie Gangel is with us. Trump is obviously railing against this Court of Appeals decision. On Truth Social, he said this.

It's clear with respect to the issues it takes on as to whether or not a president who, in some circumstances, could have immunity from civil cases, should have immunity in the criminal context. It acknowledges that this was an issue of first impression for the court. This has never, has happened. The court has never had to take up this position. But it really analyzes the issue of immunity and it lays out the historical reasons why the former president's arguments really just don't have any merit and any basis.

And there have been strategic meetings with Homeland Security officials and senior White House officials leading up to this. But, of course, the secretary really became the face of President Biden's border policies, and he is -- he fielded intense criticism from Republicans and sometimes Democrats about the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.

But even so, House Republicans have moved forward as administration officials expected they would, in what is, Wolf, an exceedingly rare move, as you just mentioned. It hasn't happened in over 100 years. Again, the last time this happened was in 1876. And so that is something that administration officials have also reminded reporters of.",

Congressman Hal Rogers was in a car accident. He is in the Capitol here with a neck brace voting today. Others had some other issues, but they came back to vote. That changed the numbers.

We had expected Democrat Al Green to not appear for this vote, which is why we thought three Republican -- they could afford three Republican defections. It appears that Al Green has showed up and is voting against this, which has changed the math completely.Remember, I have been saying, it all depends on the absences. Absences, we're going to be absolutely critical here. And because the one Republican no vote is Steve Scalise, the House majority leader who has health issues, has been undergoing health issues for some time, he was not expected to be here. They had expected one more Democrat not to be here, Al Green. Three no votes on the Republican side would have been enough to get this through. But because Green has come back, this is now tied 215 to 215. And that means this vote will fail if it stays this way. This vote is still open. That means there may be some efforts here by the Republican leadership to try to twist some arms and try to urge those three Republican no votes to vote yes, to change their vote, to get this over the finish line. But if this gavel comes down, Democrats are on the floor right now yelling at the presiding officer to bang the gavel down and close this vote so they can kill it. But there's going to be an effort here by the Republican leadership to try to flip the vote to yes. But even if they kill this now, Wolf, it could be very short-lived. When Steve Scalise comes back, he's expected back sometime maybe later this month, maybe by March, they will have the votes. As you can see there, one more Republican vote would make it 216 to 215. So, this could be a short-lived victory for Democrats, but one they would undoubtedly cheer if this 215 to 215 tie stands, which would mean this measure to impeach Mayorkas would fail, Wolf.",

But he's under pressure. As you can see, there's a lot of stress on the floor when things are taking an unpredictable turn on the House floor. You see this drama play out right in front of your eyes. And that's exactly what's happening here as they're probably trying to figure out what they should do. Can they keep this vote open? They could keep the vote open as long as they want. They are the majority. It's a five- minute vote. Technically, they should have been done several minutes ago, but they can decide to keep this open for hours if they wanted to. But we'll see. Maybe if they can convince those three Republicans, if one of those three Republicans, to vote yes, then it'll be time to just bang the gavel shut, take the loss now and come back later to impeach Mayorkas when Steve Scalise returns to the chamber. But, undoubtedly, a major twist here, Wolf. The Republican leadership was confident that they would get the votes today, even as they knew it would be by the slimmest of majorities in this razor thin Republican-led House majority. But because of the Republican defections, the one absence and the Democrats being in full attendance here, that is enough to scuttle their plans of right now to charge Alejandro Mayorkas with high crimes or misdemeanors unless something changes here in the next couple of minutes, Wolf.",
