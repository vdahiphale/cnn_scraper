Investors areconcerned that unrest could prolong Zero COVID and the country is seeing an uptick in cases despite lockdown measures. Zero COVID is having economic effects far beyond China. A violent revolt among workers at Foxconn is threatening Apple's supply chain after rising COVID cases at its factory and a revolt there over pay. Analysts say the measures could lead to a shortage of iPhones this Holiday season and cost the company over $1 billion a week. Marc Stewart joins us now. Marc, so we did see declines in markets around the world. First, I want to focus though on the US. What is it about China that has US investors so rattled?",

We've seen declines all day long.Look, whether you are in New York, or London or Hong Kong, there is this universal feeling, this universal agreement among investors that stability and certainty will bring good results. But right now, these images that we are seeing out of China do not exude any of that and that is why things are so rocky. In fact, the Dow right now, oh, wow, down close to 500 points, it actually went down to the last few minutes since I last looked. I was talking to a portfolio manager today about the situation in China and what investors are going to want to see to bring some kind of stability and there are really two narratives that are at play, two narratives that are conflicting each other. It was just weeks ago that we had some hints and overtures from the Chinese government, that the Zero-COVID policy would perhaps relax a little bit, would wane away, people will be able to move. But now when we see protests like this, and we hear the discussion about more of a stringent Zero-COVID Policy once again, it's a very hard thing to reconcile. So until investors hear some kind of clear roadmap, at least from the Chinese government, we may see some turbulent days ahead -- Alison.",

And the financial ramifications of this are very significant. I was looking at some data from the US investment bank, Jefferies. Its analysts estimate that these disruptions at that plant in Central China, the Foxconn plant could result in $1 billion in lost revenue per week. So any kind of disruption to the manufacturing process certainly can be problematic. Also, real quickly. I also want to point out that Apple stock today has suffered. It was down. It has been down throughout the day and that is distressing, certainly because of what's happening with the Foxconn situation, but this is a staple of many people's investment portfolios. It's often seen as a blue chip stock. So, it also hits close to home to Americans, especially as they look at their retirement account.

Even there, there are more localized protests, it was completely clamped down the minute it started to be persistent and get out of hand. So I would expect to see a huge crackdown put in place by Xi Jinping. Now, he may do it in a very sly sort of way. He can blame it on the local authorities and say, well, I was about to lift up the COVID, but the overzealous local authorities have gone crazy in implementing policies in a way that I didn't anticipate. So that might be his face-saving way of backing out of COVID and at the same time, tamping down on the protesters to say, you guys are just misunderstanding the way the central government wants it implemented, and the way it is being implemented at the local level.",

The population itself is starting to shrink pretty dramatically, and the one way that China will be able to maintain its growth that it had in the past is through productivity and investment. But Xi Jinping in his latest speeches have said, innovation will be done in the interest of the central government. In other words, centrally directed innovation, that's an oxymoron. You cannot direct innovation. Innovation happens by the incentives of the marketplace, and every country that has tried to do state control investment incentives fails in finding the best investment. So the kind of productivity growth that China needs to grow the way it did before is somewhat in question and the population growth that gave its tailwinds in the past is also not there. So those are the kind of headwinds that we think will keep China in a very difficult position going forward.

Analysts at Adobe Analytics say today could surpass a new record set on Black Friday, which saw more than $9 billion in sales. That's more than two percent higher than last year. Higher prices are responsible for some of that growth and they are taking a toll. Retail analysts say Americans are dipping into their savings and going into debt to make their purchases. Buy now pay later orders skyrocketed 68 percent last week. I want to bring in Matt Egan to talk more about this. Matt, great to see you. So one thing that came to mind here when I saw these latest numbers of the online spend is right before we got to Holiday shopping, we were talking about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, a possible recession, and consumers not feeling so great about the economy.

Now, to the extent that today's numbers and Black Friday's numbers show that people are actually ramping up spending, ramping it up more than anticipated, I think that would be a cause for concern if you're sitting at the Federal Reserve, and it would give them another reason to, you know, continue to raise interest rates. People are expecting the Fed is going to slow the pace of rate hikes, go from 75 basis points, the last four meetings in a row to 50 basis points in the meeting coming up in about three weeks, but we'll hear more from Fed officials including on Wednesday, Alison, Jay Powell is scheduled to give a big speech where perhaps he will drop some hints about what the Fed is going to do next, and maybe he'll weigh in even on some of these consumer spending numbers.",

In October, Amazon, Walmart, and Target held competing savings events that helped bring online prices down to 0.7 percent from last year. Those heavy discounts stand to eat away at profits, though. And that's not the only problem for retailers, they are also dealing with excess inventory from supply chain problems and wavering demand, decades high inflation, which impacts consumer spending and product costs and higher competition from experiences that weren't available during the height of the pandemic, like dining out, and concerts.

Are they interested in more of the items that you might need to enjoy new experiences? It seems that's the trend at the moment.

Now part of that represents the fact that restaurants is in that aggregate, gasoline is also in that aggregate.

The first one iswages, which comes from labor, market, and job creation and we know that the labor market is still expanding, we'll get the next report on Friday. The consensus is looking for another 200,000 jobs to be created. So, income is still flowing in. That's a critical part of what drives spending. The second source or as you mentioned, these pandemic savings, which there is still a large outstanding stock of pandemic savings, but by our estimates, consumers have worked off in the US maybe a third to a fourth of the pandemic savings. And obviously, that differs depending on different income cohorts and demographic groups. And then the third one is credit cards and after a period following the pandemic, where consumers pay down their debt and did not actively use their credit cards, instead, really actively used their debit cards, that has changed and there is more credit card usage when you look at the data from the Federal Reserve's monthly report. But I think it is those three sources of purchasing power that we need to pay attention to that are all helping to fuel consumer spending. Now, they are going to shift as we look forward into the year ahead. We know that the Federal Reserve is trying to moderate growth and slow down job creation and wage growth, so that dynamic is going to change. We know that some of the pandemic savings are being used up and even credit conditions could potentially change. But these resources are still very powerful right now for the consumer.",
