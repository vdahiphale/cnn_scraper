So, one of his attorneys, Joe Tacopina, spent many minutes on television over the weekend, talking about all of the options that they might have once the team is able to actually see this indictment brought by the Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg against Donald Trump.And he says that one of the options will be to challenge the law to ask a judge to throw out the case. Potentially also another option is to challenge on the timing of what is being charged here. We know that there are -- some of this case is based around camp the campaign of 2016 for Donald Trump hush money payments that were made to Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet before the 2016 election and also some financial entries related to the Trump Organization related to that hush money payment. There's a possibility that because that's 2016 Donald Trump's lawyers could step up and say that's way too long ago. Can't bring that in court now it's 2023. It's past the statute of limitations.

That he can politicize everything. That he can use the excuse he's running for president to try to delay things, to try to influence the proceedings and use that vehicle as a defense mechanism. And it's unprecedented, of course, because of the attention he can draw.But I think the judge is again going to have cut through that and square the guy away. And say, listen, you're not in charge. But I think the rule of law is at issue here and with Trump playing with the process and belittling the process. In particular, it even puts more emphasis on the importance of a proper process. And that's what this DA is doing. He's following it by the book. Mr. Trump doesn't play by the same rules everybody else so he's not playing by the book. And he's as you know, going to give a speech, apparently after he is arranged when it gets back to his estate in Florida. So yes, the rule of law, it's foundational to our democracy.

The Secretary called for his immediate release. Secretary Blinken further urged the Kremlin to immediately released wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan.
