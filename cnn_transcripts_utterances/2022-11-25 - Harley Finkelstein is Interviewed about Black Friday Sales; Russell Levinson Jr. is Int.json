There are more physical stores that are open. And there's been better capacity planning. And so we're seeing a lot more stability, I think, than before. If you go back to last year, Shopify saw, during the four days, like Black Friday/Cyber Monday, but 47 million shoppers shop across our stores. They sold - they sold about $6.3 billion of sale. And we saw a peak of $3.1 million happen on -- per minute on Black Friday. That was the peak. So, so far what we're seeing today, again, it's still very early, Black Friday has really just begun. But yesterday peak sales were about 1.52 million per minute at around 6:04 p.m. last year. That's up from about 1.49 at the peak last year for Thanksgiving. We're also seeing that the average cart price is up relative to last year. We're seeing our average cart price around $109, compared to $105 last year. If you think about what product categories are doing really well, there are five that are - that seem to be really hitting out of the park. The first is apparel and accessories. The second is health and beauty. Third is home and garden. Fourth is food and beverage. And fifth is electronics. So, you're - you are seeing healthy shopping across a lot of different verticals.

So I'm - I don't think the president, from what I know and what I watched, or Barbara, used their faith to further their political aims or goals. I think they were shaped by their faith, grew up in the faith, they were shaped by their relationship with their Lord and - and their faithfulness in such a way that that played out in their -- in his policy making and the way in which they took on very important service initiatives throughout the country.And, you know, I think if you look at the chief ethic of the Judeo Christian faith, which is what they were adherence to, they were faithful Episcopalians and that chief ethic is love and charity and kindness and the way in which we should deal with others. I don't think they saw political opponents. I don't think they ever saw them as enemies. I think they saw them as opponents. But I think often they found a way to work together with those folks.

Certainly looks like a great catch. They called it a touchdown. But upon review, they said it was incomplete. The ball hit the ground. Patriots couldn't believe it. Henry saying afterwards he thought he had his hands under it the whole time. Pats had to settle for a field goal there. They took a three-point lead. With the game tied in the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins to Adam Thielen for the score there. That was his third TD pass of the game. Vikings take the lead for good. They would win, 33-26.
