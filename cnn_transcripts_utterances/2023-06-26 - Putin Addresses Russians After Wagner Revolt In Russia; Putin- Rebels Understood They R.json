And that would have sent chills through the Kremlin. That's not what they want to see on the streets of their own city.And so, in an attempt to sort of regain some credibility, Putin in this very short speech, you know, gave some time to making it clear that it was him that gave the order to make sure there was no further bloodshed. And so, you know, he knows that Russian people, while they may have supported the critique of Yevgeny Prigozhin, supported his, you know, kind of condemnation of the way has been conducted by the military top brass. He also clearly understood that Russians are not supportive of the idea of more Russians being killed. And so, I think that was probably an attempt by Vladimir Putin to, you know, sort of like, you know, show himself to have been the hero of the moment, rather than the president who looks incredibly weak as a result of this.",

He really needed to after the brief, but brazen armed rebellion that we saw over the weekend. Putin saying, quote, all the necessary actions to neutralize the threat were taken to stop the Wagner mutiny.He called it a mutiny. He also said that Wagner troops may choose to sign contracts with the Russian military or go to Belarus. Clearly trying to appeal to some of them there. Back with us now, we have CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson. Interestingly, he did not say Prigozhin's name which is something that is a pattern for him when he is not really wanting to elevate an enemy of his.",

That he's tried to have killed. Who is in jail? Who's going through a horrendous series of trials in Russian courts at the moment. Alexey Navalny a very different figure to Yevgeny Prigozhin. Yevgeny Prigozhin is a brutal thug and killer. Alexey Navalny is a champion leader of Russia's putative opposition that Putin had locked up.So when Putin doesn't mention Yevgeny Prigozhin's name, you know that that guy has gotten to him, that he is a problem. And that this is something that Putin is clearly struggling to deal with. He likes to set the agenda. He likes to set the tone. He's trying to cast himself as a savior of the country right now. But he's got a big problem. We spoke about it before. He did not have Yevgeny Prigozhin rounded up, taken off the streets, when he could have done it, when he was in Russia, in a known location on Saturday. Now, it's so clear that this has now blown up to become a huge, huge issue for him.",

Major Spencer, good to have you on. I wonder, imagine yourself serving in the U.S. military. And a private army crosses the border, takes over a city with essential functions in running a war in Ukraine, and then drives two-thirds of the way to the capital. There's a deal that supposedly defuses the situation. But then you have the president go on national television -- international television and say -- accused that group of mutiny and betraying the country. Looking at that, is there any sign that the dispute is over for Russia?MAJ. JOHN SPENCER (RET.), URBAN WARFARE STUDIES CHAIR, MADISON POLICY FORUM: No, absolutely not. And if I was a soldier, especially a Russian soldier in Ukraine, I would be very concerned, very worried. Morale is already low and now they're getting messages about what's happening to this force that's been in Ukraine gathering power. Because that's really what this is about for both Putin and Prigozhin is power and money. And Prigozhin has been the lap dog and done a lot for Putin. But specifically in Ukraine, you have almost a year Russian forces didn't take a single piece of ground outside of Bakhmut which Prigozhin built himself up to be able to take that rubblized town that he took.",

I mean, he's had to give this brief speech to punctuate this moment. He had no choice. He had to do this. He had to get out there and have this moment where he was narrating this moment.

It didn't create an opening tactically on the front line but it definitely creates openings in the psychology of the Russian forces, on the command and control. I mean, Prigozhin went to the headquarters of the Ukrainian war for this. Ukraine, I'm sure there will be both militarily, politically cognitively trying to take advantage of what Prigozhin has really mixed up and done here.",

I mean, I think this is a bit of whiplash for Russians that are watching what has been a leadership vacuums in terms of hearing from Vladimir Putin and the generals leading this war over the past 24 to 48 hours. And this speech, I have to say, was a bit oversold, given that it was pegged as something that would define the future of Russia.What in fact it was, was a speech that most of us would have anticipated in the early hours of this mutiny, Friday, Saturday. Where was this Vladimir Putin that we just saw right now? I mean that would have made more sense. And now what's interesting is, A, what happens with Yevgeny Prigozhin -- whose name he did not mention. Sort of the way he does not mention other detractors and opponents' names. And also, what is the future for Wagner? I mean, on the one hand, you could view this as an olive branch that he offered some of the soldiers who he, A, accused of treason, but at the same time offered them an opportunity to sign with the ministry of defense. Go home to their families even, or to go to Belarus. And remember, that is in contrast to what Yevgeny Prigozhin has been saying that Wagner is alive and well, that it's just relocated to Belarus. So, I think the next few days should be interesting. I do question why Vladimir Putin waited so long and would impact at all this could have on his hold.",

We had the Belarusian opposition leader on this broadcast about an hour ago, saying she's seen no evidence that Prigozhin's forces are actually in Belarus, and has some doubt they will end up there. I mean, you have Putin's characterization. He's not afraid of the truth. Lukashenko is Putin's puppet here. I mean, should we acknowledge that perhaps we don't know what the next step is for Prigozhin and his forces. What is the most unlikely outcome for that?",

I mean, this is a Frankenstein-type of scenario that Vladimir Putin himself has orchestrated and developed over his 23 years in office. So, whether you think you can believe Dmitry Peskov, or Vladimir Putin, or Yevgeny Prigozhin, or Alexander Lukashenko. I mean, I think it is with a healthy dose of skepticism that we should be interpreting anything that we hear from them.This -- it does appear, took the Kremlin and caught them off guard. And now there's a game of catch-up. And the big question is, was Russian intelligence aware of what Yevgeny Prigozhin was planning to do? This was sort of in the open. He was very public about his animosity and the vitriol he felt towards the leaders of this war. He didn't directly go after Vladimir Putin but he took it to a next level on Friday. We haven't seen him before question the validity of this war itself. That having been said, there are thousands of Wagner mercenaries sort of hanging in the balance now. Vladimir Putin suggesting that he has quelled this revolt. And has stepped in to avoid further bloodshed. That was similar to what we heard from Yevgeny Prigozhin. Remember he said it was his decision as to why they turned around from Moscow. So, now it's just a matter of who blinks first. I want to see what happens in the next 24 hours, if we continue to hear from Vladimir Putin. I think it was interesting because some had expected that perhaps we would hear from him some change in military leadership. Whether it was Gerasimov, whether it was Shoigu who he was replacing, that didn't happen. And I think at least yet. And I think that is notable.",
