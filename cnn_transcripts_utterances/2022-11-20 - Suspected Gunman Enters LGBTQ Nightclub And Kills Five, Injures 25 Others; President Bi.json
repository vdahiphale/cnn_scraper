The components of inflation on a forward looking basis seem to be easing.

I think the other reason that Black Friday has become a little bit less symbolic in the minds of the consumer or the shopper is that discount periods seems to be getting longer. I feel like seeing signs that started Black Friday started last Friday, extending toward the end of this week. And there are other big Amazon Prime Days for example which have captured the shock and imagination. But I do think this year we are likely to see particularly big discounts and I think cashes from that discounting is going to extend beyond the traditional Black Friday period into early December.There's just so much excess stock sitting out there. I think the time to scoop up discounts, that end-of-the-year season, that Christmas season, may even extend over to early week after Thanksgiving. FISHER: All right.
