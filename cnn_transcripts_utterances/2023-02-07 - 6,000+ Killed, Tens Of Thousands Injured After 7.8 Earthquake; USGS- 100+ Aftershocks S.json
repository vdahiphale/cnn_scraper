Thank you for sharing a very, very busy news day with us. 6,000 plus death, 6,000 plus grief running over Turkey and Syria, hoped to running out as rescue crews continue to look for thousands still lost in the rubble of a monster earthquake.Plus, tonight the president tells the country what he's done and where he wants to go. Advisors promised a classic Joe Biden speech, but his State of the Union collides with big global challenges and the complications of a newly divided Washington. Plus, a secret briefing, Congress gets access to intelligence about that Chinese balloon. It's a brand-new CNN reporting raises questions about why the Pentagon was so slow to shoot down that suspected spy in the sky. But up first for us, a dramatic, harrowing race to find survivors. It's barely more than 24 hours after a massive earthquake hit Turkey and Syria, already again more than 6,000 are dead. And the aftershocks still creating treacherous conditions for rescuers, trying to reach victims trapped in the rubble. More than 5,000 buildings have collapsed, falling tragically, faster than many people could escape. In the devastation, there are though moments of hope, like this one. A young girl rescued after 24 hours, buried beneath concrete and bricks in Istanbul, and crews pulling a teenage boy from the rubble lowering him to safety. Turkey's president has now declared a three-month state of emergency in the hardest hit areas, and President Biden has pledged to provide assistance, that part of a massive international response and rescue effort now underway. Our CNN's Becky Anderson is live for us in Gaziantep, Turkey. Becky, tell us what you're seeing?",

It's great to have someone with your experience on the scene. We'll stay in touch Becky and your crew. Thank you so much. I'll obviously continue to track that dramatic story, the tragedy in Turkey and Syria.Back to Washington now and Joe Biden's big night ahead. In just hours, the president addresses the nation. The Congress serves as his stage. The bullet point, his achievements, his plans, and his early case for reelection. The setting is the same, but this will feel very, very different tonight. The biggest reason why we'll be right on the - right third of your screen, that would be the House speaker. Now Kevin McCarthy, and his descendants underlines the new divided reality here in Washington. The speech we are told by White House officials will track familiar Biden themes, featuring calls for unity, his bottom up, middle out approach to the economy and a body of evidence to connect the dots, the White House says between Biden's policies and what they see as remarkable signs of American progress. Let's get straight to the White House. Our chief correspondent Phil Mattingly is there. Phil, a big night for the president to look forward, but he wants to look back a little too.",

      "sentences": "Yes. When he talk about that progress, I think there are key components that White House officials point to as underscoring that key progress, whether it comes to the economic side of things, a legislative agenda that really hasn't really been matched over the course of the last seven or eight decades in terms of the scale of the accomplishments.And to some degree, a public health crisis that is, at least in the waning moments. At this point in time, even though the country is still grappling with it. And it's the effort, that I think you're going to see from the president tonight. To really bring all that together to capture the moment of not just what's happened in the next two years. But what can happen in the next two or potentially six ahead as he waves that reelection announcement in the weeks ahead. When you talk about who the president's audience is, I think that's also important. Yes. The in-person audience will be the members of Congress, 535 of them Republican and Democrat. The real audience is the eyeballs at home for a primetime address. Those millions of Americans that maybe aren't paying attention every single day to what the president has done, or the legislative items that he's passed or the agenda that he's now in the midst of implementing. And I think you'll also be able to take a look at what the key elements of this speech are when you look at who will be sitting with the First Lady tonight. You obviously have the parents of Tyre Nichols, who was beaten to death by police just a week or two ago, viscerally watched by Americans on television. You have the Ukrainian ambassador, that will be a central focus of the foreign policy elements of the president speech Bono, Paul Pelosi. As the president talks about taking the temperature down from political extremes ism and obviously the Monterey Park shooting hero. Mass shootings, which have obviously developed over the course of the last several weeks as they have for the last several years will be a key component as well. Overall, though, I think the thematic issues will be familiar to us. We are not necessarily the audience. The audience is the American public as the president tries to underscore very clear progress, but a job not done yet, a job he wants to finish in the two years ahead, and perhaps the six, John?",

With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's MJ Lee, CNN's Melanie Zanona, and Cleve Wootson of The Washington Post.And so, MJ, let's stick, you covered the White House. The president tonight is going to talk about police reform. He's going to urge Congress to pass an assault weapons ban. He's going to say they should reinstate and expand the child tax credit. And he's going to say one way to bring more money into Washington is to raise taxes on billionaires. Zero chance on almost all of those things, if not all of them in Congress, because there is a speaker Kevin McCarthy over his shoulder, but the president will make the case. The question is they have any realistic hopes at the White House of getting anything big done legislatively in the next few years?",

People have been through two plus years of COVID. Couple years of inflation. They just have, they're exhausted. And they have questions. So, Jeff Nussbaum, who a veteran democratic speechwriter, he's written for President Biden as well, says this the New York Times. Joe Biden has to say the same thing a thousand times before the world catches up to him.That's actually meant just a compliment, in the sense that Jeff's point is that Joe Biden is not a flashy orator. He's not going to say something that you're going to remember the line, like you might have Barack Obama or somebody else, but that he's just consistent and resilient and tough. Biden's often underestimated. The question here is can he start to break through with the country, so you can start to feel a little better?",

There's also a disconnect between what the Biden sees - the Biden administration sees, as you know, historic progress that they've made and what Americans see. You have like 62 percent of Americans saying they've done very little or not enough.And so, you know, will Biden be able to sort of hammer home the fact, you know, just the things that they've done in a way that average deal on the street is able to understand and sort of take with them through the coming months as these fires continue.",

He has tried to strike a calmer tone. I think part of the strategy is to calm the markets. Part of the strategy is also set up a fall guy in case things go sideways.But when it comes to tonight, it will be interesting to see how these Republicans react if they actually heed McCarthy's advice to behave. We'll see whether that pans out - right, exactly. But you know, with the debt ceiling, I'm very interested in what tone President Biden strikes on this, because behind closed doors, it seems he has struck a more conciliatory - a conciliatory tone with these talks that are very early on with Kevin McCarthy. But how hard does it go? Does he continue to insist no conditions on hiking the debt ceiling? Does he, you know, chastise Republicans as MAGA Republicans? Does that poison the well? I mean, there's going to be a lot of pie in the sky talk tonight, a lot of pomp and circumstance, but the debt ceiling is the most important thing that they have.",

The number of times, again, that White House officials have been using language like the Unity agenda, you know, it might feel a little bit less appropriate for the President in front of every member of Congress to use that kind of language. But at the same time, it is really important for him politically, as a political messaging tool to contrast Democrats and himself from those very House Republicans that he often does criticize.

And then secondly, obviously, over the last couple of months, there has been a real effort to try to reset things with Beijing. That is now the rearview mirror. We don't know.

There's a desire to put on a united front. I think Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that there is a benefit to putting on that united front against a foreign adversary. That is why the resolution that Republicans were initially considering, it was going to criticize Biden, now it's going to criticize China more broadly over the spy balloon.There's also this select committee that they put together, and they are trying to show united front, the chairman and the ranking member, a Democrat and Republican without a joint statement. They're saying that they are hopeful that they can embody that type of bipartisan relationship, but it's going to be tough. I mean, there's concerns about Republicans using this as a platform to bash Biden. There is concerns about this fueling anti-Asian rhetoric, but the chairman is very cognizant of those concerns. He purposely changed the name of the committee to say Chinese Communist Party, instead of China to draw that distinction. But we'll see. I mean, it's going to be a tough road ahead for them.",
