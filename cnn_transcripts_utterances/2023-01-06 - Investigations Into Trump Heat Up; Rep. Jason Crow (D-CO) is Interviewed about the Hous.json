This losing streak now continuing in its eighth day, continuing even after the federal government avoided default on its debt. ROMANS (August 7, 2011): They Standard and Poor's downgraded the U.S. from a AAA to AA Plus rating. HARLOW (August 6, 2011): And this has never happened in the history of the United States. KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (August 7, 2011): They already feel fed up with Washington politics, even on this side of the planet, because it's having a true economic impact here in Asia Pacific. Tokyo is the largest stock market here in Asia. It is also the second largest holder of U.S. debt. LEMON (August 6, 2011): The guy from S&amp;P said that, you know, hey, Washington couldn't get their act together fast enough.

There's a debt ceiling that has been set to keep borrowing in - in control, and Congress keeps spending and cutting taxes. And so spending just keeps rising. And then they thrash about how to - what to do with that debt ceiling. And it gets raised again, and again, and again. But that uncertainty every time - every time that they try to raise the debt ceiling or they fight about it causes a loss of reputation in the U.S. And the U.S. is the safe haven for the world.

Listen, it's very interesting. I mean you heard Harry tell Anderson that he, you know, was -- he didn't see. And so he didn't really say that he was bigoted, but he said he didn't see what he saw until he met Meghan, which is typically the case when people - you know, especially white people get into interracial relationships, they see things that they didn't normally see.

But more so, actually, when he left the royal fold and he's looking at it effectively from California.So we're getting lots more detail. Also lots more revelations. I mean you made headlines, Don, around the world yesterday with your comments about many of these revelations being gauche. Since then far more detail. Everything from how Harry lost his virginity behind a pub, injured his private parts on an expedition to really serious matters, to him killing 25 Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, which has really blown up here because former members of the military are saying you don't reveal details like that, it creates a security threat. So, there's so many things coming through. But this is before the publicity round, effectively. This is promotional parts of the interviews which aren't running until the weekend and leaks from the book, many of which came out of a Spanish version that went on sale accidentally.",
