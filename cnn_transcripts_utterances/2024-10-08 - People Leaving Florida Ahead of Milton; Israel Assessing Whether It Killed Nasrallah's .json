Israel's military is assessing whether it killed the man replacing the late Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. TikTok attacked. The social media app is accused of harming the mental health of young people. Putting teens at risk with endless feeds of content. And motoring mania. Would you spend $1.8 million on a sports car? The makers of this one say only those with a need for speed should buy. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, hundreds of thousands of people are leaving Florida ahead of Hurricane Milton. The storm is set to hit the state's central gulf coast Wednesday as a Category 3 hurricane, bringing with it a dangerous storm surge as well as tornadoes. It's back to being a Category 5 storm right now. Here's Governor Ron DeSantis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL):  You should be executing your plan now.

They're being so blunt in their messaging that they want people to head north and get out of here. And I do think that people are heeding the message. That is clear from traffic cameras. We've seen the backups on the interstate, people rushing for days now to get out of town. I'm hearing here in Davis Islands, this is a neighborhood of Tampa, and it's been -- here, this is a busy road, but further in the neighborhoods eerily quiet. I mean, this is a vibrant neighborhood, but so many places are boarded up. It seems that so many people have packed up and left, which is such great news. And the numbers speak for themselves. Helene was a wakeup call. But now, with Milton, they could be looking at double the storm surge. With Helene, that was five to eight feet of storm surge in the Tampa Bay. Here, we're looking at 10 to 15 feet. That is unsurvivable. That is above more -- most buildings in the roof area. This is why authorities are saying, take this thing seriously, get out.

Also, Netanyahu wants to have a cabinet vote on what they should do. The nature of the response to Iran's strikes last week. And we've also heard from the State Department saying that they object to IDF troops raising an Israeli flag over a southern Lebanese border village that they appear to have taken control of. They say it is inappropriate, that they want the IDF to stick to the terms of what they said they were doing, which was limited incursions, and not giving the impression that they are taking and holding territory inside of Lebanon. And to the west of there, the IDF also increasing their military operations along that northern border, creating another closed military zone very close to the coast there, another division brought into that area, stepping up the military operations across the border. Not clear how long they'll go on, how far they may go into Lebanon, but an indication that operations, IDF military operations all the way along that northern border are increasing and the response from Hezbollah into the west of that northern part of Israel, into the northern part of town of Haifa, the port city there, a large number of missiles, 105, the IDF saying, coming into Haifa and into the Upper Galilee region as well. Those missiles impacting in the northern suburbs of Haifa. Two buildings taking direct hits in those residential areas. An elderly lady treated for minor injuries, and the home front command now telling residents in the north of Haifa, in those suburbs there, that the schools will have to be closed because of the risk of threat, another indication that military operations have spread not only from the sort of eastern part of that northern front with the Lebanese border, but all the way across to the west now.
