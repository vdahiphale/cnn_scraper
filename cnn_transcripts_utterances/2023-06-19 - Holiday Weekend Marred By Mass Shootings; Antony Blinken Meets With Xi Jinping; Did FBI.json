They do everything from research to have underwater photography and video. And then on one of these subs that can hold as many as five people. And, sometimes, they do take tourists on those -- on that sub as well. The company releasing a very brief statement, saying that they are exploring and mobilizing all options to bring their crew back safely. And their entire focus is on the crew members on the submersible and their family members. But, right now, we are trying to gather more details to figure out sort of where this was, what exactly it was exploring. It is in that area where the Titanic went down in 1912, but they do other sorts of research and take people to sort of see canyons in very, very deep. The Titanic is about 3,800 meters deep. The sub or the submersible that they may have been using is a newer one that they seem to have launched in 2021 made of titanium and carbon fiber. They are desperately trying to reestablish contact with it and figure out if they can bring people home safely -- Boris.",

But then the attorney general himself had publicly stated that they would be following the facts as they led them. And CNN here, our own reporting has been for several months now that, even in 2021, as the Justice was -- Justice Department was faced with an onslaught of Capitol rioter cases in court, something that they had never seen the likes of an investigation like this before, they were approaching it with the full green light to take an investigation the whole way to Donald Trump, if they needed it. But they needed to follow the facts and the law, as Merrick Garland was publicly announcing at this time. So, \"The Post\" now is illuminating some really interesting meetings and discussions that were taking place at a fraught time at the Justice Department. How hard do you go for Donald Trump early on after the Capitol riot? And now, looking back, what we know is that the prosecutors, even before the special counsel came in to formally look at Trump as part of the January 6 investigation, they came in and they were trying to follow the finances, the money early on. Was there an infrastructure built to fund or help rioters who came and did violent acts on the Capitol grounds? That investigation continues now under the special counsel. We know there's a financial aspect to it. And we also know, Jim, that the special counsel investigation, as soon as it was appointed in November of last year, moved very fast and got lots of testimony, including from Mike Pence, the former vice president, something that would have been unheard of in other investigations, very fast.",

I mean, if you remember, right after the Capitol, insurrection, the U.S. attorney acting at that time publicly came out and said, people should be charged with seditious conspiracy. The Justice Department had to take up a month or even a year, several months, to get to the point where they were able to charge that. And they were able to ultimately prosecute both members of the Proud Boys and members of the Oath Keepers and obtain convictions for that. So, this was a long process still under investigation now.",

Trump also cannot post about it on social media. CNN's Evan Perez is joining us now on this. I think, Evan, that the team, his team expected this. So perhaps that's not surprising.

So anything under this protective order that his team has agreed to, by the way, with the special counsel, anything they get -- this is the unclassified part of the discovery that they're now going to start getting. Anything he sees in those sessions with his lawyers, he's not allowed to disclose. And that goes for him and his co-defendant Walt Nauta. And, obviously, the next step is for the Justice Department to begin start -- to start sharing some of the classified materials that, right now, his lawyers are trying to get their approval for a security clearance, so they can start reviewing this stuff. But this obviously is a standard part of the process in these cases. When you have something like this ongoing, it's very routine to have these orders. But, as you pointed out, it is Donald Trump we're talking about. And that's one of the issues that will be obviously something that the judges are now going to be overseeing. [13:10:07]",
