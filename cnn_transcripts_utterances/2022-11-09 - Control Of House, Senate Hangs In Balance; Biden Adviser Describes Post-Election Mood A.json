So, Congressman is it -- I mean, it's unclear, obviously, who will ultimately win control of Congress. What is clear is that there was no red wave. Do you think Republican leaders are reassessing the role that Donald Trump has in the future of the party? Because it seems like this is an opportunity -- if they are ever going to do that, this is an opportunity to do that.REP. ADAM KINZINGER, (R-IL): Well, I hope so. I was here on January 7, basically thinking that this was the time to reassess whether or not Donald Trump was the future of the party. I think, you know, the question that remains is -- so Donald Trump is going to throw Kevin McCarthy under the bus. I'm just like, put that down in red right now and underline it. The MAGA base is going to throw this on Kevin McCarthy, the question is does the rest of the Republicans have the courage to stand up for Trump, or do they want to get acquiesced to him? Because we all know him, he's not going to take the blame for this, at least in his own mind. This is certainly a rejection of the MAGA base. It's also a huge message that candidate quality matters. And I think in Wisconsin, look, there's a message to Democrats. I think a moderate Democrat would have crushed Ron Johnson in Wisconsin.",

He's going to try to throw DeSantis under the bus. He's certainly going to go after McCarthy. And if he's able to do that successfully, and he has been over the last number of times, then again, Ron DeSantis is going to have kind of a short-lived victory here.I think it's important, though, this is not -- you know, Ron DeSantis. winning big was huge and congratulations to him. It's not necessarily a message that we saw last night, though, that the rest of the country wants necessarily Ron DeSantis type I guess, leadership, I call it. I think he has a real opportunity to take the Republican nomination to win the presidency, but it's not going to be kind of this in-your-face thing that we've seen from Donald Trump.

We don't have to talk about the border. That's not the case. I think a lot of these candidates won despite that still being a big issue and looking forward to 2024, that's going to be important. Now, what will be interesting, Anderson, is if there's just a very, very slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives. This is like way out of -- out of the left field. But there is a possibility then if you can get two Republicans, for instance, to vote for a certain candidate and get the Democrats to vote for a moderate Republican-type speaker. You can have a really interesting speaker of the House race. I'm not predicting it. I'm just throwing that in people's ears, that if it's that tight, you can do something pretty unusual on that.",

We have Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, Alice Stewart, former Pennsylvania Congressman Charlie Dent, and Karen Finney.Abdul, I want to start with you. Does last night's results -- which were better for Democrats than expected, does that basically embolden President Biden in a second term? Does -- do you think that that increases his inclination to want to run again? DR. ABDUL EL-SAYED, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I want to say two things about that. First, I just want to compare this to historical records, you have not seen a president's party perform this well in their first midterms in recent history. I mean, you can go back all the way to Reagan, right? And you still don't see this kind of performance. But I will tell you, it will definitely vindicate the president's potential decision to run, which will be the big announcement that potentially Donald Trump -- potentially could make that he's been teasing. I think if Donald Trump decides to run, I think that will pull Joe Biden back into this race. And I will say this. Barring the narrative that we had about the midterms coming into this midterm election, you have a lot of momentum for the president, whether it was a number of legislative victories, whether it was the sort of climbing up of his approval rating. And so I'm really interested to see what happens in the coming weeks about how people start to feel about President Biden.",

But the key question, as you pointed out, among Democrats, would they want to see Joe Biden run again? And a majority of them said, yes, they would. So if he has the support of the party, then I could see him giving that more of a consideration.On the flip side, Donald Trump is bleeding support from the Republican Party. As these numbers came in last night, I'm getting texts and messages from key Republican donors saying Donald Trump is an anchor on this party, it is time to turn the page, he has lost the House and the Senate and we're losing key races and key Republican donors. And these are not Trump haters. These are Trump allies that are saying it's time for the Republicans to move on and -- move on to someone who is not an election denier, not looking at the past, and they're also putting pressure on the RNC to make sure that we put Donald Trump in the rearview mirror.",
