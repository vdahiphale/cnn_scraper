      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster. Here are some of today's top stories.Around 270 million Americans are dealing with temperatures at or above 90 degrees Fahrenheit this week. Cities in the Midwest and the Northeast, including Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, could see days of record-breaking heat. Some areas are expected to be 15 to 20 degrees above normal. At least 11 people are dead, and more than 60 missing after two migrant shipwrecks appeared off southern Italy. Officials say a wooden sailboat carrying migrants began sinking on Monday, and a second boat caught fire and overturned. It's believed 26 children are amongst those missing. Thailand will become the first country in Southeast Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. The Kingdom's Senate approved a marriage equality bill a short time ago. The bill passed overwhelmingly, with 130 senators voting in favor and only four against. It still requires endorsement from the king, which is considered a formality. Now we have new details on the Israel-Hamas war and a massive anti- government protest in Jerusalem. Israeli police say they arrested at least nine people after thousands gathered outside the Knesset, and then marched to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home, calling for new elections. Authorities say those detained were arrested on suspicion of attacking police and trying to set a fire. Meanwhile, there appears to be deepening political rifts within the Israeli government. Benjamin Netanyahu disbanded his war cabinet, announcing the Security Cabinet will now decide matters regarding the conflict. This comes more than a week after opposition leader Benny Gantz withdrew from the war cabinet. CNN's Paula Hancocks is live for us in Jerusalem. How do you read all of this going on at the top of the government? Is it chaos?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, it certainly seems as though there was a fair bit of communication issues yesterday when this all came about, and on Sunday. We do know with the war cabinet itself, this was effectively a three-person team. You also had three observers, but you had the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister, and then Benny Gantz, who has since resigned because he says that Netanyahu does not have a day-after plan.So that appears to be the reason that that has been disbanded. Now, there was pressure from the far-right elements within the coalition to be able to fill the void of Benny Gantz's departure. And that would have been problematic, certainly when dealing with the Biden administration, who would not necessarily support these far-right elements making decisions on the war in Gaza, certainly internationally as well. So that could well have been part of the reason why that was disbanded. Benjamin Netanyahu now saying that there will still be smaller groups that he will create to try and make the more tactical decisions. But the security cabinet, which is larger, will make the decisions on the day-to-day strategy. Now, we heard as well from Matt Miller, the State Department spokesperson, saying that the U.S. and the Biden administration does not believe that this will change the fundamental assessments of the war between Israel and Hamas. So an internal political change, it appears, to try and deal with the departure of Benny Gantz.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so this is something that the Israeli military decided over the weekend. It will be a pause that's a road going into Gaza from the Kerem Shalom crossing, where we were yesterday, and then up the Salah al-Din Road, which is like the north-south artery of Gaza. Now, the military said it was to make sure that there could be safe distribution of aid.But we have spoken to international groups on the ground, the U.N. as well in Gaza, and they have said that sometimes it is simply too dangerous to get to this crossing to be able to access these areas because of the sense of lawlessness within Gaza at the moment. And then just last night, we had another reminder of how dangerous it is for those trying to move trucks around. We heard from the European Hospital in Gaza that eight volunteers were killed in an Israeli airstrike as they were trying to get to some of the commercial trucks to move them to another area. Now, we've reached out to the IDF for comment on this. We haven't heard back at this point. But it just underlines the dangers of trying to distribute aid within Gaza. It's not just getting the aid into Gaza, which still is problematic, we hear from many of the U.N. agencies and international aid groups. But it is then trying to navigate the dangers of getting it around to those who need it, not just from Israeli airstrikes, not just from fighting between Israel and Hamas. [04:35:00] But also, you do have looting. You have gangs that are in Gaza because the rule of law has broken down over the past eight months of this war. So it is an extremely dangerous place to be. We've heard from the U.N. that it is the most dangerous place on Earth for a humanitarian aid worker to be at this point -- Max.",

That benchmark, 2 percent of each country's annual economic output. And now 23 countries out of 32 members are currently meeting it.That's more than double the statistic from just a few years ago. And that statistic was a point of ongoing criticism from former President Donald Trump and the current GOP opponent. During Stoltenberg's visit to Washington, he made remarks outlining several priorities for the alliance as the months proceed. Those include allowing NATO to take a leadership role in the deployment of military aid and the training of soldiers for fighting on the battlefield. He also said that more costs need to be imposed on China for its material assistance of Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine. But this all comes amid far right movements on both sides of the Atlantic that currently challenge the status quo of the alliance, as well as continued bloodshed on the battlefield in Ukraine. Now more than two and a half years at war. With war still raging, President Biden told Stoltenberg he wished he could stay another decade. Stoltenberg's term is set to expire this year, with a top Dutch official expected to take his place. And of course, President Biden, too, will face voters in just a few months.

Here's what Murthy told CNN about his push. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: I'm quite aware of the fact that this is a complicated issue and that it may be hard for Congress to take action on this. And I'm also aware that this is a challenging year for Congress to act. But the truth is, none of that matters to our kids. None of that does anything to assuage the pain and struggle that parents are going through right now. It is our moral responsibility as a society to take care of our kids. And in that mission, when it comes to social media, we are not doing well. We are failing. But we have a chance to get it right. And that's why I believe that to put kids first means passing the kind of legislation that would protect them from the harms of social media now, because our kids cannot wait.

You know, you have to always be looking at something and watching something. There's always a piece of news. And so it creates that kind of, you know, attention deficit disorder that's a real issue where everyone's paying partial attention, continual partial attention to things. And so, again, I think something like there are some very big issues about young men and being isolated, young women feeling self-esteem issues on these platforms. And so the question is, how do we handle that? What's the best way to do it? And there is some regulatory relief here. It's just a question of what should be. And the last thing is it runs into the First Amendment, right? We should be able to do and say and watch what we want. And so that's another issue. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
