And you have Benjamin Netanyahu having to balance all of those voices.He is under pressure from the families. He's under pressure from many people within Israel as well that believe that this is the time for a deal to be done. The opposition leader, Yoav Lapid, saying that this should be pushed forward, that the deal is on the table and it should be taken. But then on the other side, these far right ministers have said that if there is a ceasefire and the objectives have not been accomplished, those objectives being the complete destruction of Hamas, then they will pull out of the coalition. And that would bring the coalition down in Israel. Back on Friday, the U.S. President Joe Biden, when announcing this proposal, acknowledged that there is very differing -- there are very differing views, saying that there are many even within the coalition who will not support this. But pointed out it is time to end the war. And we are hearing that from many different sectors. We have, in fact, for months been hearing that from many different sectors. But there is a sense that this is a key time. Experts and analysts saying if it doesn't happen, if it doesn't have a positive reaction from both Israel and Hamas at this point, then there are concerns where the next deal may come from.

And we've heard from a U.S. senior administration official that this proposal is very similar, in fact, almost identical to a proposal that Hamas had put forward in the past. So the expectation is that both sides, Israel and Hamas, would agree to move forward to the proposal. From Hamas's point of view that would then go back to the mediators, the Qataris and the Egyptians, and then they would be able to look at the exact timeline and when that six week ceasefire could start.Now, many sides want it to start almost immediately to try and stop what is happening in Gaza at this point. Certainly, we've heard from many countries supporting this proposal, notably as well, so they can get some humanitarian aid into those who desperately need it within Gaza as well. So what it needs is the definite yes from Israel and from Hamas. And at that point, then those mediators, Egypt, Qatar and also the United States can get back together and set out an exact timeline of when the ceasefire would start.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I mean, originally it was a red line for the U.S. to allow Ukraine to use American-made weapons to strike inside Russian territory at all. And now we see that they have loosened those restrictions after many of its European partners already did so, as well as amid pressure from NATO countries and the NATO secretary generals.Of course, it's possible that yet again, the administration shifts its posture to allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory using American-made weapons or simply in other areas along the border. But for now, the U.S. says that its policy has not changed, that they do not want Ukraine to use long-range American weapons, those ATAKMS, for example, to strike deep inside Russian territory because they don't want to see the conflict escalate and spread beyond Ukraine. They say that they are allowing Ukraine now to use the weapons to strike just narrowly over the border there so that Ukraine can basically defend itself against these missile attacks that Russia is launching from Belgorod from right across the border. So that, for now, is the policy. And Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, he spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today, and he said that he does think that that's going to make a difference for the Ukrainians amid this major Russian offensive on the city of Kharkiv. But again, that he does not believe that now is the time for Ukraine using those weapons to strike any further into Russian territory. But Secretary of Defense Austin, you know, he met with Zelenskyy, and they discussed the battlefield needs yesterday here in Singapore, the need for additional air defenses, which Ukraine has really been struggling to find. Those air defenses are running short, really, and not only in the U.S., but also among the U.S.'s allies, so kind of scrambling to find every last air defense system and munitions that they can to help protect their skies. And also, Zelenskyy, of course, he met with Asian leaders here. He's trying to expand that international coalition of people of international partners that support Ukraine and their fight against Russia. But importantly, he was not able to meet the Chinese, who are, according to the U.S., supporting Russia's defense sector and fueling the war in Ukraine. He did, however, get important buy-in from the Philippines, as you mentioned. He made a surprise visit there earlier today. The Philippines, a key Asian partner that says it will be attending that peace summit that Ukraine is holding in the next two weeks in Switzerland.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Max. As you mentioned, whale meat is not very popular in Japan right now. In fact, consumption is at an all-time low.But Japan is trying to revive the shrinking industry for really three key reasons. The first, because it says that actually whaling is sustainable, according to its own research. Since Japan left the International Whaling Commission in 2019, Japan is limited to hunting whales in its exclusive economic zone. And it says, according to its own findings, its own research, that there is an abundance of whales in its territorial waters. Now, the second reason they've identified is that whaling has a long history and is very culturally significant in Japan. And this is partially true. Some regions in Japan have been hunting whales for a very, very long time. Now, the third and final reason is that Japan knows and recognizes that whale meat is not very popular right now, but it thinks it can boost popularity in the very near future if it can change public perception. I spoke to some industry insiders about how they were looking to boost consumption. This is what they told me. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Marvels of the deep blue are to others a meal. Whaling in Japan is poised for a major comeback with the launch of this vessel.",

And it just goes to show how Japan is not only continuing to hunt whales, but also is trying to revitalize this shrinking industry in a very, very big way.MONTGOMERY (voice-over): We get a tour of the ship led by Hideki Tokoro, the president of Kyodo Senpaku, the whaling company that made it. He doesn't hide his fondness for whale meat and rejects the idea of changing his business model. HIDEKI TOKORO, PRESIDENT, KYODO SENPAKU (through translator): We will not switch to whale watching unless it is eating whale while whale watching, which sounds very chic. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): This ship hunts whales in Japan's territorial waters before getting served in the country's supermarkets, school lunches, food carts and vending machines. But public appetite for whale meat, just one percent of its former peak according to government data, is still far from satisfactory for Tokoro. And with the launch of this expensive new boat, Tokoro says bills are piling up. But even if the new boat sinks him into bankruptcy, Tokoro insists there's no plan B. Internationally, whaling is criticized as a brutal and unsustainable practice that once pushed many of these mammals to the brink of extinction due to centuries of overhunting and may still carry environmental consequences today.",
