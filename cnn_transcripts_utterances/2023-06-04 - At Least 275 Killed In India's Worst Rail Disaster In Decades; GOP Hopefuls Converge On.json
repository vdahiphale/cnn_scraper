That has been clear for the last several days and it certainly was over the weekend here in Iowa where most of the leading Republican presidential candidates introduced themselves to Republican voters and made their case to why their vision, their message is the best to win the party's nomination and go on to win back the White House.Of course, all of these candidates are seeking to be the alternative to former President Donald Trump. He was the only candidate who is not in Des Moines on Saturday for Senator Joni Ernst's annual Roast and Ride. That is a political event featuring a side of barbecue, some motorcycle riding as well as political rhetoric. Now, it is clear these Republican voters, most of the ones we talked to, say that they are indeed looking for a change. They are indeed looking for someone, the strongest candidate to win back the White House and defeat Joe Biden's policies. It's unclear, of course, at this point who that may be. But one of the contenders, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, she made the case to voters why she believes her time is now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've got to start doing this in a way that we can win a general election. It's time for a new generational leader. We've got to leave the baggage and the negativity behind. We've got a country to save. Don't complain about what you get in a general if you don't play in this caucus because it matters.

In fact, Donald Trump's name did not come up at all on Saturday during hours of speeches by these Republican candidates but he does loom large in that race. Of course, he is the leading contender at this point. Others are vying to be his alternative.Now, Haley will be answering more questions from Iowa voters tonight here in Des Moines at a CNN town hall at Grandview University. She has been making the case for the last several months here, in fact, holding more campaign events than most any other candidates, but she is certainly is trying to make up for some ground here trying to really get her name better known among these Republican voters. But as the summer begins, as the field grows, there is no doubt Republicans are hungry for change but they are also open to considering a wide variety of candidates. Iowa, of course, has a great tradition of humbling frontrunners and elevating challengers. That's exactly what Nikki Haley hopes happens. This race is just getting underway.

On Tuesday, we will see him have a full cabinet meeting. Vice President Kamala Harris attends. As you can see on the screen.

There is one sort of little epicenter which is a small town on the border between Ukraine and Russia. It's called Shebekino. And once again this morning we are getting reports from there that there has been shelling, cross border shelling coming from the Ukrainian side towards the Russian side. But it's actually a pretty large area down there in Belgorod region which in itself is a pretty vast border area. We are seeing reports of attacks. And you're absolutely right, Victor. Yesterday the local governor said that several people were killed in that shelling. And, of course, lot of people have already been evacuated as well. So, certainly a very difficult situation seems down there for the Russians and the Russians also having a lot of problems coming to terms with that. And that in itself is a pretty big deal because Belgorod is one of the most highly militarized areas of all of Russia. There is a lot of military bases in the city itself and the surrounding areas, so that's pretty significant that the Russians can't seem to stop the shelling of their territory and some of those cross border raids as well. You're absolutely right to point out that the Ukrainians continue to say they have nothing to do with that and there are anti-Putin Russian groups. So groups of Russian fighters who here in Ukraine fight on the side of Ukraine against the Russian military who are saying that they are responsible for that. At the same time Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of this country, he did come out yesterday and he said he believed that Ukraine was ready for the offensive but he did sort of caveat that as well because he also said, look, all of this is not some sort of game. He said that he believed that an offensive could be a very long time but that they are fairly certain that they will come out victorious in all of that. So, certainly some pretty interesting words there coming from Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And you do still have, however, the Russians firing back. They do, of course, still have a very large and very potent military. One of the things that we saw overnight here in the Kyiv area is that once again there were air raid sirens, there were missiles and drones apparently launched towards the Kyiv area. The Ukrainians, however, are saying that their air defenses managed to take all of those out before they even reach the area of the Ukrainian capital.

The Russians don't fly a lot over Ukraine. And to use the term air superiority, I think, kind of shows that he, you know, is concerned about the Russian capabilities, but he also knows that Ukraine has some capability to down Russian aircraft should they fly in an area that affects the counteroffensive. So he has got possibilities. Those possibilities, you know, will allow him to move forward, but he could do better if he had more robust air defense capabilities and eventually, of course, aircraft.

GELJE SHERPA, GUIDE (through translator): In places where it was rockier, we could not drag him. We had to carry him on our backs with difficulty. TODD (voiceover): New details of the rescue, which occurred on May 18, are just coming to light. The rescuer, 30-year-old Gelje Sherpa, says he was ascending Everest toward the summit with a Chinese client when he came upon the stranded climber after midnight. He said he convinced his client to abandon their quest to reach the summit in order to save the man. It was important for us to rescue him, even from the summit. Money can be earned anytime. Left like that, he could have died. We have saved his life by quitting the summit. TODD (voiceover): After Gelje Sherpa hauled the man alone for those six hours. Another guide joined the rescue. Then a helicopter airlifted him down to base camp.",

And to carry another person down 2,000 feet of steep and treacherous terrain requires confidence, sure footing, and lots of skill.TODD (voiceover): The particular area Gelje Sherpa traversed during the rescue is known as the Death Zone, because temperatures can dip to minus 86 degrees Fahrenheit. One Nepali government official said it's almost impossible to rescue climbers at that altitude. Even the experienced Sherpa, experts say, was at serious risk.",

The climbing season on Mount Everest is short, extending only from March to May. But in this season alone, Nepali officials tell CNN, 12 people have died and five are missing, making it one of the deadliest climbing seasons on record. The Nepali government says a record number of permits to climb were issued this season, 478.

Climber Conrad Anker says clients pay between $40,000 and $250,000 for a guided climb up Mount Everest. The Sherpas get a bonus of about $4,000, he says, plus possible tips.

And so, ultimately, it becomes extremely difficult just to put one foot in front of the other. So, what Gelje did at that altitude really demonstrates that physical, tremendous physical strength and ability as well as that psychological resilience.And I think what happens on Everest is what you see is you see the worst of what you also see the best of human nature. And I'm sure your viewers have all heard of stories on Mount Everest where climbers will walk past other climbers who are dying for their own personal glory. Well, the flip side to that is what Gelje just did on the mountain, his heroic effort in terms of what he did to save another human's being's life. And it's not only Gelje. I think we can't forget the helicopter pilot as well, who also risked his life to rescue, you know, the climber from Camp 3 and to bring him down to base camp. So, really these acts of human kindness from the Sherpa people really do reflect their real selfless and their humble nature. You know, Sherpas take big risks on the mountain for the Western climbers and they're often in the shadows of Westerners.",

There are still more work that is needed to ensure because I think the issue, the fundamental issue that we're seeing at the moment, is this increase in the number of inexperienced climbers who are on the mountain, climbers who come to the mountain who are unprepared.
