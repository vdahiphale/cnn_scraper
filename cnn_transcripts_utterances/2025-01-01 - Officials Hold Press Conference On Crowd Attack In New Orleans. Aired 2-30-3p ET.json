Today, from that time two years ago, we have driven our murder rate more than 50 percent down. So we have a track record. But this is different because it's terrorism. Now, I want to thank all of our law enforcement partners. You're fabulous and we appreciate the partnership. But last night, three of our officers engaged this terrorist who shot at them. Three of the officers returned fire. Those officers did not run in fear. I liked what the mayor said this morning. New Orleans police and all law enforcement is built, we are built for dealing with evil, with things that would cause us -- others to be in fear. But instead, our officers -- and last night NOPD, particular, stood strong. They did not run. They did kill the terrorist. We have two officers, indeed, who received gunfire. They will be OK. We have personally gone to see them. But this is leadership for you. And I promise, as the chief of police of this fantastic city, that I will be strong and firm and fearless. Thank you. GOV. JEFF LANDRY (D-LA): Thank you, Chief. Thank you. And wrapping it up, I want to just close with a couple of things. I want to thank Senator Kennedy and Congressman Carter. I want to thank again all of our law enforcement officers out there. I want the families of the victims to know that I will be issuing an executive order that, tomorrow, when Notre Dame plays Georgia, every flag over every state building in this state is going to be at half- mast in remembrance of them. But remembering something else, that fear in this state is a liar. And these folks right here are going to make sure that justice is served. And for the citizens out there that are saying, well, man, do I really want to go to the Sugar Bowl tomorrow? I'll tell you one thing. Your governor is going to be there. That is proof, believe you me, that that facility in this city is safer today than it was yesterday. And we are -- and as we come to additional events in this city, I know in speaking with Senator Kennedy and Congressman Carter and FBI, acting director, and incoming administration, that they are going to ensure that this city has the resources necessary to protect our citizens and our guests. And so with that, we'll take some questions.",

That was some kind of press conference that we were watching there out of New Orleans following this attack, where a suspect drove through the French Quarter and killed at least 10 people overnight here.Officials -- and so many of them -- it was really an extraordinary sight. And talking over each other. Sometimes bumping into each other. There were some interesting dynamics at play. We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk though about what we learned, which is a lot of new information. I want to bring in our Evan Perez and our Tom Foreman, who are on set with us. We also have former Boston police commissioner, Ed Davis, with us, and former FBI Agent Breanna Fox. Just to touch on some of the headlines of what we saw, Evan, and I could see it on your face because that was an extraordinary press conference.

So multiple suspects that are being investigated, that are being looked at for possible involvement with this.And so the issue here now for the FBI is, you know, we haven't had an attack like this in some time where you have more than one person involved. Usually, we have - you know, you have a lone world-type of attacks. And one reason why they're frankly more common is because it's easier to carry something out when it's just you. You keep that thing - you plan to yourself. The minute you involve other people, there is the possibility that it would be found out by law enforcement. And so, you know, the extraordinary thing in there in that press conference, let's just pause for a second, is to have the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI having to go around a Senator there who really was serving no -- really no good purpose. No -- providing no real information for the purposes of this, of this press conference, in order to answer questions and to provide that information. That is extraordinary. I think what you're seeing, though, is obviously a local -- local officials who are very, very defensive about some clear problems with the security of that evening. Right?

As you also had -- Tom, and I just want to be clear, you have ties to New Orleans. You spent many years there. There's also this huge concern ahead of a big tourist event, which was supposed to be tonight. It's now being postponed to tomorrow. We just learned the Sugar Bowl is being postponed tomorrow. There's also this huge concern about proceeding with that -- and that we saw that on display. TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, absolutely. And look, I mean, like you, the whole notion that they kept coming back with this incredulous, look, I only drove on the sidewalk, like we've never heard of that. And that's happened in numerous attacks like this. People have been on the sidewalk. Important to note the idea of using vehicles as weapons in terrorist attacks started steadily growing, really started picking up in like 2015, 2016 and just kept going all around the world. There's reason to worry about this. This is why they were replacing the bollards, because they knew it was a threat and then fell short of it. Yes, you talk about the events coming up, Sugar Bowl tomorrow night, now big crowd for that. Mardi Gras actually begins next Monday. That's the first parade. There will be Mardi Gras events from then until Mardi Gras, which is in early March this year. The Superbowl is coming up in February. After all of that, there will be Jazz Fest. These things bring millions of people to this town. And they're very good at handling crowds. But what you saw today was they knew they had a problem. They all kept saying, well, we're going to fix it. But the question is, you knew this was happening. You knew it was happening now.
