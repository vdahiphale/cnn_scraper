At the moment, that is a major problem because right now, the Rafah crossing into Egypt which is currently the only route in or out of Gaza, it remains closed. There are four 30-foot missile craters that are still blocking the roadway along with cement slabs placed by Egypt. And in Gaza right now, there is no electricity because of a lack of fuel and no water being pumped because of the lack of electricity. The World Health Organization warns that public health crisis in Gaza is imminent. Secretary Blinken says the president will also work on securing the release of hostages held by Hamas. On Monday, Hamas released the first video that we've seen of the hostage, this woman, 20-year-old Mia Shem. CNN is not showing the video itself, but CNN's Anderson Cooper spoke to her family last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And he said this just a few days, didn't he, that he had one word for Israel's enemies or other groups seeking to exploit the current situation by escalating the conflict -- don't. And I think that we're going to see President Biden repeating that. So that's the message to the world. The message to Israelis, Israeli -- Biden putting his money where his mouth, is to show that his support -- when he says the U.S.'s support for Israel is ironclad, he means it. So he will go there and I think that Israelis will be assured to see the president of the United States in Israel showing that he has got Israel's back and that the United States will always have Israel's back. While he's there, of course, he will also be discussing the humanitarian situation and that will also show I would imagine he hopes that the U.S. is not blind to the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip right now. And I suppose finally, this is also a message to the American people in particular Jewish voters perhaps or voters who support Israel in the United States, that their vote, that having the Democrats and President Biden in charge in the United States means that the relationship with Israel will remain as it is. And that would perhaps put page to the Republican claims that the Democrats are somehow softer on the Palestinians and do not support Israel in the same way that Republicans do -- Kasie.",

General, thanks very much for being with us this morning. Can you help us understand the difference between -- we've sent two carrier groups now. Now, they're going to send, you know, a contingent of 2,000 marines to the region. What does that say? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER OF U.S. ARMY FORCES IN EUROPE:  Well, these, Kasie, are prudent steps by the department of defense to get capabilities in place that will help deter Iran from expanding the war. But also in case there was a requirement to evacuate American citizens from Israel, the marines you talk about, they belong to the marine expeditionary unit that is typically afloat in these regions that would be there to help evacuate people or provide some sort of aid. So I think these are present steps by the department.",

HODGESamount of combat power, but you need two carrier strike groups if you anticipate that somehow Iran made the mistake to launch anti-ship missile at a U.S. aircraft carrier, you have to have enough protection for the ships at hand. And so the requirement to be able to launch strikes against targets inside Iran or elsewhere, as well as maintaining a 24/7 combat air patrol over control over the carriers, it would require the aircraft from two strike groups. So that's the reason for having two there. But that's a significant amount of capability. The Pentagon obviously is also delivering certain munitions that the president has agreed to provide to Israel. And at the same time the Pentagon has to keep -- is keeping in mind that we're supporting Ukraine. This is -- I think this is a two front war. Russia benefits more than anybody from this Hamas attack on Israel because it distracts and I think that these are connected via Iran, Russia's only real ally. So the Pentagon I think is probably looking at this in a strategic way, how do you help Ukraine win, how do you make sure Israel is successful, and how do you make sure that Iran does not expand the conflict.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, the timing of the ground operation whenever it starts I think is going to be driven primarily by the intelligence that they are able to build up over the next few days. They are not just going to drive into Gaza. They understand that Hamas is hoping that they will do that, that Hamas will be waiting.So, I think they are going to be very deliberate in how they do this. Obviously, they are very concerned about the 199 or so hostages that are there. So other than getting the hostages, there is no time pressure to hurry up and go. So I think having the president come is a positive thing because it will demonstrate American commitment, but it also will remind everybody that the U.S. has strategic interests in helping to prevent this turning into a blood bath against innocent civilians. Of course, that's the opposite of what Hamas wants that. So I think the president's visit will signal support, restraint, and also I think, you know, that the president is human and he will come away from this understanding also exactly the situation. I don't think -- now, I have to say that I don't imagine Israel would launch a ground operation while the president was there. I mean, it would not be a good visual and it wouldn't make sense. So again, I don't think that they are on the clock. They don't have to attack in the next couple of days. But we'll see.",

Egypt further insists that the Palestinians should not leave their territory and face permanent displacement. China, meanwhile, is sending a special envoy to the region next week and calling for calm. As around the world, revulsion to Hamas' recent atrocities risks being eclipsed by protests against the operation in Gaza. And along the Israel-Lebanon border, Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been skirmishing. Israel evacuated 28 villages along the front here in case of outright war. An invasion of Gaza could trigger just that. Once again in the Middle East, there's global division over what the problem is and fear of some of the solutions. Sam Kiley, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Let's see if that works and has a big impact. It's obviously going to be something around humanitarian aid and also having safe areas for civilians. If that works, I think that will reflect well on Biden on the global stage. If is it doesn't, it could be disastrous. This would be associated with whatever comes up. But I think it is interesting -- I mean, certainly, Europeans are looking at it as a big test for western power on the global stage.
