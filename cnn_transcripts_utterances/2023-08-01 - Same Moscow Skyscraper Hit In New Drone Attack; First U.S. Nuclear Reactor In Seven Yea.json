The coup leaders are also accusing France of planning military action to free President Mohamed Bazoum, who's apparently being held inside the presidential compound. CNN's Larry Madowo has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): France is denying that it's planning and military intervention to free after President Mohamed Bazoum. In fact, the French foreign minister saying it's absolutely not true that it's considered that, that response is necessary because the Niger (ph) junta in Niger has claimed that France has been meeting with former officials asked officials to try and get military and political authorizations to carry out military strikes around the Presidential Palace to free Bazoum. To understand exactly what's going on, it's important to pay attention to what two key Western allies are saying about the situation the French and the Americans. The U.S. State Department has still not classified this as a coup, a technical definition that will require it to stop military support as well as aid. In fact, a U.S. State Department official telling CNN that they still consider this a domestic dispute between the presidential guard and President Muhammad Bazoum. So, some Western allies essentially believe that there's a path to restore President Mohamed Bazoum to the presidency. But for ordinary people, they worry about the likely effect of the sanctions announced by the Economic Community of West African States for a country that's already had been through so much turmoil. BOUNTY AMADOU DIALLO, RETIRED TEACHER (through translator): I think the sanctions were initially taking the heat of the moment, and then apparently dictated by outside powers, because Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea were in the same basket as us before, but we didn't sanctions them as heavily.

That plot was foiled. It's not entirely clear how there is some reporting out there that CNN has been unable to verify.

But here is typhoon Khanun. This is the storm that is really concerning for places like Okinawa, north of the Philippines, east of Taipei, and also east of China. Because the storm is no -- it's moving to the west now will likely not continue either stall stop or possibly turn a little bit to the right and spend days over the islands here very close to Okinawa and the like. Why don't you know where it's going to go, because this is what the model runs look like. Some of them take it to the south, some of them all the way to the North. And some just really just stop it there in the middle. So possibly day after day of wind, waves and of course, the possibility of very, very heavy rainfall. If this thing does stop, and then just keeps raining for days or hours, we are going to see some significant flash flooding even in these low lying islands. So rain after rain after rain could be in some spots in the ocean could be a half a meter to a meter of rainfall. That's not out of the question, if this thing's just sits there and stalls and rains and rains and rains. So yes, it's heating up. The water is warm, and the storms are in play. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There's not nowhere in the Holy Cross, any reference to banning music, where even to music at all. But to my perspective, the banning of music may indicate to two things. First, the ignorance of the Taliban about the teaching of Islam. And secondly, the Taliban are aware of the power of music that are -- that music is came about to deliver the most important messages to the far, far places and to make any messages understandable to the wider community of Afghanistan.

But as CNN's Clare Sebastian explains there are still many signs that have economists worried.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, on the surface, this looks like a sign of resilience in the Euro area, a modest growth rate of 9.3 percent compared to the previous three months after flat lining in the first quarter year of shrinking in the one before that. Overall inflation also fell to 5.3 percent in July, which is exactly half its peak rate last October, when of course the war in Ukraine had caused energy prices to skyrocket. That shock now clearly receding. But dig into the detail. And there are still worrying signs. GDP growth seems to have been driven by just a few countries. Ireland grew by more than 3 percent. France by half a percent. Well, on the flip side, Germany, Europe's biggest economy was flat, and Italy actually contracted. And as for inflation, that top line number also not a whole story. Core inflation and when you strip out food and energy didn't change at all in July compared to June, and it's still more than twice the European Central Bank's medium term target. But for economists, all this just really adds to mounting concerns as data in recent weeks has shown business activity dropping, business loans falling to a record low as banks tightened credit standards and an ongoing decline in economic sentiment. [01:45:00] Well, (INAUDIBLE) say means recession is still a risk. And this will definitely raise the stakes for the European Central Bank as it tries to balance that risk with persistent inflation.
