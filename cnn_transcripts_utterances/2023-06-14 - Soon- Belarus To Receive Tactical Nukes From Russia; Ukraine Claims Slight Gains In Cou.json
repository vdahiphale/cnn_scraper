But Ukraine says it has clawed back some of its territory in the Zaporizhzhia region.In the meantime, a key Putin ally, Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, says his country is about to receive tactical nuclear weapons from Russia. CNN's Sam Kiley joins us from Kiev. Tactical nuke, Sam. This is a huge development.",

      "sentences": "Huge development with a huge impact with the president of Belarus claiming or saying that they have the capacity greater than the nuclear weapons that were used in anger in the Second World War to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nothing quite concentrates the mind like that kind of a prospect.He has said that the weapons would only be used in the event that his country was invaded. But the interesting thing here -- and it's not clear whether or not the Russians, who will retain control over those nuclear weapons -- in other words, whether or not his boasts are Russian weapons in Russian hands controlled by Russians, who will decide if they ever get used, how they would be used. But it is very clearly intended -- and he makes no bones about it -- to rattle the Europeans into stepping away from the very fulsome support that they've been giving to Ukraine in the prosecution of this war, and lately, of course, in the early stages of this counteroffensive. So it's not unanticipated. It's not a surprise. They have flagged that they would be doing this -- Russia and Belarus -- but it does look like the movement of the weapons is now imminent.",

So the really important aspect of this is the increasing temper of operations from the Ukrainians on what we're calling the Zaporizhzhia front or the southern front that runs east-west from Ukrainian held Zaporizhzhia to Donetsk, which has been controlled by the Russians since 2014-2015.They were doing probing attacks. The scale of the attacks is now increasing somewhat. There are significant casualties on both sides. Some NATO-supplied American-type equipment, Bradleys, MRAPs, the armored vehicles, have been destroyed. This was anticipated by the Ukrainians. I've spoken to senior Ukrainian officers, who privately concede that counteroffensive that they have planned, and that we're seeing in the early stages of, are going -- is going to result in some significant losses for the Ukrainians. I think it's very important, therefore, that United States has recently just announced another tranche of military aid, including replacement Bradley fighting vehicles because they have had some Bradleys destroyed. And that's important in a military sense, but also in terms of morale. The fighters here know that they are getting this important support even as they prosecute this war.",

It is a huge concern across Texas.Right now, temperatures are in the mid-80s to low 90s across Corpus Christi. When you factor in the humidity, the heat index, temperatures feel like triple digits. Temperatures are going to warm more for the next couple hours. We have excessive heat warnings, excessive heat watches in effect, heat advisories for a large chunk of the state. And this is going to stay for several days. We have high temperatures today reaching mid and upper 90s. Again, when you factor in the heat index, it's going to feel like the triple digits. Highs tomorrow are even warmer. Look at Laredo, reaching 110 tomorrow. Temperatures will be 106 in Del Rio. And 100 degrees in Austin. And then here are your high temperatures for the next couple days. They stay very warm. Dallas close to the century mark. Houston, triple digits. San Antonio, triple digitals. With so much of Texas feeling the extreme heat, that's what's putting strain on the power grid. Temperatures get warmer progressively through the weekend. Triple digits by the time we're Sunday through Tuesday in Dallas. And we're also going to see the same for Houston with temperatures staying in the triple digits for at least six days or more. It is a serious situation. Another serious situation is the severe weather threat that we're dealing with today, across especially the south. We could see wind gusts in excess of 80 miles per hour. Very large hail, larger than three inches in diameter, as well as isolated tornados. We have several rounds of severe weather that's going to be going on throughout the afternoon and evening hours, even into the overnight -- Brianna?",
