Repair crews are up against bitter cold, heavy, rain and strong winds, which are hampering efforts to restore power supplies. Half at the capital Kyiv is reportedly in the dark following Russian missile strikes two days ago. And the weather forecast is bleak. This just gives you an idea of what they could dealing with in the days and weeks ahead. Residents have also been told to prepare for more blackouts. And just to give you a broader sense here, doctors in Kyiv carried out a heart surgery on a child by flashlight after the hospital lost power half way through the procedure. The U.N. human rights chief says Russia's attacks on the Ukrainian energy network is causing extreme hardship for millions of people. And NATO's secretary general had this to say a short while ago.

There was some surprise, really, that Putin's military machinery didn't go after the critical infrastructure on day one of this campaign, perhaps because they thought they would win it quickly rather than what they're trying to do, which is cripple Ukraine's ability to function, to function as a democratic nation, to function as a pro-European democratic nation. That ultimately is the Russian aim. And, therefore, going after the infrastructure is to be expected. It is part of the military campaign that the Russians inevitably are waging here. I think from the Ukrainian perspective, consternation coming from the United Nations from NATO, describing this as a humanitarian crisis or even a widespread of abuse of human rights is being treated with the degree of kind of eye-rolling from Ukrainians who were saying, well, yes, duh. What we need is surface-to-air missiles to stop this happening. And it's surface-to-air missiles have been relatively slow in coming, particularly the very sophisticated Patriot-type missiles that they're demanding. They're saying, if we get the right missiles, we will be able to protect our airspace and then we can more effectively prosecute the campaign on the ground, Julia. But for the rest of the country, these are now almost routine levels of steady state denigration of the national infrastructure, particularly the energy infrastructure. Seven mass attacks by cruise missiles by Russia coming almost weekly right across the nation. Most of those missiles do get shot down. Those that get through denigrate and -- degrade rather the national infrastructure to generate energy and make life a lot harder for Ukrainians. But it could get an awful lot worst. What the Ukrainian government is saying is that we are getting things back up and running pretty quickly. We are managing to get power to those locations where it is most needed. But life gets a little bit tougher with every week that goes by, and, of course, temperatures drop as the weeks go by too and winter begins to deepen, Julia.",

      "sentences": "Yes. these games really are coming thick and fast. This is the first day of the second round of group stage matches,as you are aware. We got our attention back on Groups A and B. I'll give you quick mention of what's going on with the Qatar game against Senegal. Qatar Coach Felix Sanchez had said he just wanted his team to bring their A game to this match after such a disappointment in their long-anticipated first ever World Cup encounter that set this tournament on the way on Sunday. But I have to say, they are currently one goal down at halftime to Senegal. They had quite a strong penalty shouts turned down and I think they're playing better than they did on Sunday but still not completely winning over the fans or the pundits at this point, a long way to go with that one. But in terms of the match that has been completed already today, an incredibly emotionally encounter between Wales and Iran. The Iranian coach, Carlos Queiroz, in the buildup to the match, had said, please just let my boys focus on the football. They have said their piece in terms of the antigovernment protests. They have shown solidarity to those who are suffering at home. We saw how that all impacted them in that opening defeat to England. They were beaten 6-2. But against Wales, they were very much regrouped. It was a really dogged performance from Iran with a lot of emotion from the crowd who booed the anthem as it was played before kickoff. As you mentioned, Wayne Hennessey sent off for Wales with six minutes to go. Iran very much took advantage, so took the victory, 2-0, and now have given themselves a great shot of making it out of the group stage into the knockout rounds for the first time in Group B. It really does set up a sensational finish to that group. They take on the U.S. next week. But ahead of that, England against U.S. later this evening. It's very difficult for me, I'm afraid to say, to be neutral with this one. High hopes for the England team, ranked fifth in the world. Many people's amongst the favorites for this tournament. Gareth Southgate has said they still need to be better than that performance earlier in the week against Iran. They won't make it through with a game spare. Harry Kane has been declared fit to play. But the U.S. are thriving on that title that they've been dubbed as underdogs and hoping to case another upset against England, as they did in 1950 and 2010.",

Right now, shippers are grappling with high fuel cost, tight spending budgets. And here in the United States too, potential rail strikes that could impact up to 40 percent of cargo imports. There is some good news though. Just take a look at the fall in shipping costs over recent months. You can see that peak was back in September of last year. That's something my next guest knows all about. Flexport is a logistic tech using the cloud to simplify the supply chain using digital technology. And while they don't own any ships, planes or trains of their own, it is their software that is driving freight around the world. Ryan Petereon is the founder and co-CEO and joins us now. Ryan, some logistics for the 21st century, I think, if I can say that. I also think that probably over the last two and a half years, you have seen and done it all with the challenges that we have seen. Just explain and put that fall in shipping costs into perspective for us please and tell us what you are seeing currently. RYAN PETERSEN, FOUNDER AND CO-CEO, FLEXPORT:  Yes, good morning, everybody. I think it is great news. So, Flexport is a logistics technology company, we help thousands of brown ship all of their products into the United States. And so our customers are feeling a huge amount of relief that shipping prices have come down, as far as they have. Last year, you saw a peak of almost 20,000 shipping containers from Asia to the U.S., long run like the last 20 years. You can really think it's more like $2,000 is kind of the rule of thumb and we are back there. And you need that. You need something that is much more sustainable. These businesses, the economic models are built off of affordable shipping and sort of the thing that we take for granted, it has feeling so much economic prosperity around the world for the last few decades. And so we are back to relative normalcy there. And also transit times last year, you saw those famous images of the ships waiting off the coast of Long Beach, where there was like 100 ships at a time just sitting there and waiting. That is all gone away or for the most part, has gone away. And so the transit times for getting product from Asia to the U.S. are back to almost normal. It's still taking a little bit longer.

So, we do have data everywhere, but our samples are much more rich on those bigger markets. What we are seeing is -- and we have a small economic steam. So, for every single shipment, we see the commercial invoice, which tells you what exactly is inside this container or on the air freight pilot. What is in there? What is its value? It is really, really granular, rich data. And we have got a small economics team that analyzes all of this to say what is happening in the world. They also read over 1,500 company reports to get a sense of where people are, with inventory levels, looking at government data, GDP and other sort of consumption data. And they picture that they are painting is that actually we saw, so far, in the last 90 days, we see a 1 percent increase year-over-year in real dollar terms, meaning adjusted for inflation in consumption of goods. So, that does not mean we are not concerned about a recession. I certainly personally am quite concerned. I think the interest rate rises is going to will be a big deal. People are kind of spending through their savings right now. And that is not a great place to be as a society, spending through your savings. So we are quite concerned. But Flexport has an incredible data picture, and what we are seeing so far from our data is consumers holding up, people are still spending. And now on the shipping side, brands are overstocked and, therefore, shipping a lot less. We have got about 20 percent less imports year-over- year entering the port of L.A. than year prior.

It I think it's important to make that distinction and to really understand the fundamentals of bitcoin are not necessarily the fundamentals of every other cryptocurrency. There is a lot of -- what crypto has created is a free market where people can create their own tokens, create their own monetary policies and a lot of them have tried to copy the fundamentals of bitcoin and not succeeded. So, what happened with FTX is they created their own token and had it in decentralized entity. It was centralized finance more than it was decentralized finance. They used a token that they created to do it. But it was the furthest thing from bitcoin. It looked way more similar to a central bank printing dollars than it did a set monetary policy of creating, this set monetary policy, this set technology that was the same technology for 8 billion people, like bitcoin. Bitcoin is based -- there's only 21 million of them. And every ten minutes, a block is discovered and everybody has the same rules, everyone has the same code base. It's this beautiful financial system that's available to everyone in the world. And there are these imitators that have tried to co- opt it and create their own scams that are not bitcoin, or almost the antithesis of bitcoin, and why bitcoin was created to actually stop the centralized monetary policies from happening.
