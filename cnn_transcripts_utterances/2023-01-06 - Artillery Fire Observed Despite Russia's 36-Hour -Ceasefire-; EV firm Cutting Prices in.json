A full report just ahead, plus, border reorder historic weekend ahead in China, Beijing officially scrapping quarantine requirements for tourists. The Chinese border with Hong Kong also set to reopen even as Chinese COVID cases continue to surge and employment well still pretty buoyant. The U.S. is out with the first big economic report of the New Year. The all-important U.S. jobs report showing that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December, that's a bit higher than expectations. The unemployment rate, also falling unexpectedly to 3.5 percent wage gains though they moderated. We also saw downward revisions to the past two months of data. Let's take a look at reactions on global markets, U.S. stocks. Look at that green arrows across the board DOW, NASDAQ and S&amp;P futures all up about 1 percent. Europe, as you can see in the green as well. European Investors also getting some encouraging news on Eurozone inflation this session. Happy Friday for Investors, at least at this point, let's get straight to those jobs numbers. Matt Egan is with me now. So Matt, walk me through this report. I mean, it doesn't seem to be quite uneven recovery. What industries are adding jobs? What industries do you see if at all, pulling back?",

There's really something for everyone. You know, on the cooling side wages, you mentioned that wages did slow down significantly they were revised lower for November. That is good news, if you're worried about inflation, if you're sitting at the Federal Reserve. It's not good news for workers of course we're struggling to keep up with the cost of living. But also some parts of this did come in a little hotter than expected payroll growth. You mentioned 223,000 jobs that, was ahead of expectations, although it is a slowdown from the prior month. The unemployment rate, I mean, 3.5 percent that is tied for the lowest level in the last half century, pretty amazing, that we're still seeing this really low level of unemployment. Now as far as sectors, a lot of parts of this economy are still adding jobs, leisure and hospitality continues to add a lot of jobs up 67,000, healthcare, 55,000 construction, retail manufacturing, all of them adding jobs. On the negative side, we're not seeing many industries, outright lose jobs except for professional and business services that's, down by 6000. Most of that was driven by temporary help. Also, technology information was down by 5000. We've heard about all these layoffs from Amazon and Salesforce and other major companies. That is starting to show up a bit in the jobs report. So I think Rahel, big picture, this looks pretty mixed. But right now Investors are happy with what they see.",

I don't think that this report is going to satisfy the Fed in terms of giving them an all-clear sign to stop raising interest rates altogether.

For example, the Chinese Center for Disease Control Rahel, it reports that only six people in all of China died of COVID on Wednesday and Thursday of this week. The World Health Organization, it says that those numbers are under reported.

U.S. stocks up and running as we lookat PPR there, opening their ringing bell, they're ringing the bell, professional bull riders. And if you were an investor in this market, maybe you feel like you've been pulled riding this market to lots of twists and turns. Investors today are reacting to the all-important U.S. jobs report and green arrows across the board with the NASDAQ up about six tenths of 1 percent starting the day in the DOW and the S&amp;P closer to about three quarters of 1percent. But there is a lot of session left so we'll see how the day shapes up. And the major averages again solidly higher, up more than half a percent Wall Street also currently on track to finish the week with gains like in the first week of 2023. There's also a lot of year left in 2023. So we'll see how it all shakes out. The December report, the December jobs report showing the U.S. added 223,000 jobs that was a bit higher than expected, the unemployment rate that ticked down a bit too, but wage gains. And this is what I think Investors are really keying on to slowed a bit and that's potentially an encouraging sign on inflation. That said, today's numbers come after a whole host of data this week pointed to a continued strong and robust labor market, including solid reads on private sector employment growth and job openings. Fed numbers were out in force Thursday, making it pretty clear that their fight against inflation is far from done.

So I think that's important to put in there as well, because the public sector has been hiring up where there's been acute staffing shortages, most notably in public education. What we saw in this jobs report was that leisure and hospitality is still leading overall gains and trying to catch up on what was lost during the pandemic. We are seeing participation also come up with the unemployment rate coming down. That was good news and welcome news, after we had seen a reversal in that trend during the fall. And I think that's important too. But one of the more interesting issues is that participation among both men and women, although prime age women have reached the peak, they hit basically in February 2020. They're still lagging the G20 countries along with men, and that is something that just can't happen.

Diane, can I ask for wages, they appear to vary certainly by industry. And I think there was a lot of talk about how much excess savings we have. But I wonder if there is a group at the lower income, who perhaps maybe they're making more, but they're still not making a lot and they have tapped through their savings. And I just wonder is there enough focus on the people at the lower end of the spectrum who are probably not still sitting on a lot of savings?

Our analysis suggests we're down to as of the late fall, we've drained over half of thesavings that we accrued almost half of the savings, the excess savings we accrued during the pandemic via both stimulus checks and what we weren't spending things on. The bulk of that drawdown came in the bottom 40 percent of income earners. So not just the poorest but the bottom half of the middle class as well. And is starting to move up the economic food chain, the overwhelming majority of excess saving is concentrated in the highest income earning households, those are the households less likely to tap their savings to spend. They also had better incomes, of course and better wealth. But that is important because you won't have as much of a tailwind on consumer spending going into 2023. We did get an extra boost at the end of the year in terms of consumer spending, because of the fall in prices at the gas pump. That really helped out those workers that were at the lower end of the wage scale, because it's their commute costs went up, they were really squeezed. We actually saw a contraction in retail sales in November. I think we'll see better numbers in December. But as we move into the year, the bottom line is that the slowdown in wage growth for low wage workers is where it's occurring. And in fact, those are the workers that were burned the most by inflation overall. And we can't rule out a secondary shock in energy and food prices come the second half of 2023.",

Now, it's at an extremely low three and a half percent. And that's wonderful. But that's not what this many people participating as even were in the prime major labor force in February of 2020. And so clearly, this is still a very mixed bag, even though it is a much better economy than we saw in a better recovery, more rapid recovery than we've seen in the past. It has come with that singe of inflation. And that's something that the Fed is still very worried about a lot easier to get from six to 4 percent core inflation than from four to two.

So imagine if youcontinue purchasing something in from the fashion every day, from the fashion brands, it will be not sustainable. But actually, it takes way less resources to produce a digital dress. So you can actually move some of your consumption into the digital only reality. And actually, your consumption habits will become more sustainable, because you can still continue to have your physical wardrobe. But then you will have your digital wardrobe. And you can explicitly mention that this dress is from my digital wardrobe and I purchased at DressX and despite its designed there. Actually, overall, it can make your wardrobe way more sustainable because like there is a problem of overconsumption in the fashion industry for people because we tend to consume a lot. And we're not saying that let's purchase last physical items. Let's go just - those physical items with more thoughts about do we really need them to wear on a daily basis?

Southwest warning today that the operationalmeltdown that had suffered during that massive and deadly U.S. storm last month will cost the firm as much as $825 million. The price it will pay in terms of reputational damage while that could be much higher. Pete Muntean joins me now. Pete, well, good to have you. I mean, it's only been a few weeks since that meltdown. What are we learning in terms of how much of that is lost revenue because of those flights or other expenses?",

And we're really getting this fuller picture of how bad this meltdown really was for Southwest Airlines 16,000 flights, Southwest canceled between December 21 and December 31. So when you total all that up a hill, there was about 140 people on average, on a Southwest Airlines Flight, we're talking about 2 million people had flights canceled on them. So when you really sum all that up, it's really not all that surprising that these losses are between 725 million and $825 million for Southwest in the first quarter. The interesting thing here is that Southwest says sure its revenue went down; its expenses went up because they had to pay out employees and compensate them for overtime. Because all of these planes and all of these flight crews were out of position. And then also the amount that Southwest was spending on refunds went up, we have not seen the totality of how much southwest will pay out to passengers. We're still learning about that. And they're still paying out people, right as we speak. So we're not totally sure in the end, how much southwest will really pay here. There's still some lingering questions out there. Will they be paying out folks for last bags, a south west - folks, about $3,800 for each check bag, so long as they can prove what's inside. Still some check bags out there that are still not returned to passengers two weeks after this meltdown started. And then also will the airline be fined by the U.S. Federal Department of Transportation. So there could be some more expenses that Southwest has to incur here for this big meltdown. 10 times bigger than its most recent meltdown, a real huge and staggering amount that Southwest last year well, almost a billion dollars.",
