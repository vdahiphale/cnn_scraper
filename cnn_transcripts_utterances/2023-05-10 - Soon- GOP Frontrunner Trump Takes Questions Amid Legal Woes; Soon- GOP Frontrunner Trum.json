I'm Erin Burnett in New York tonight, along with my friend Wolf Blitzer in Washington.Former President Donald Trump is set to arrive just moments from now at his first town hall of the 2024 election in New Hampshire to answer voters' questions. The former president looking to broaden his base as he attempts to win back the White House. He's leading all the other declared and non-declared Republican primary contenders by a wide margin in what are extremely early polls. But it comes at a time when Trump is facing mounting legal troubles, Wolf.",

Jean Carroll.And just one month ago, the former president was indicted by the Manhattan district attorney. The stakes are very high tonight for the former president of the United States. Let's go right to CNN's Kristen Holmes who's at the site of the town hall for us in New Hampshire. Kristen, how are Donald Trump and his allies feeling heading into this critically important night?",

Trump and a small group of advisers are on their way here to the town hall. And the advisers I've spoken to say he's as prepped as he's going to be.We obviously have to keep in mind that Trump is not your traditional candidate. There weren't an extensive amount of preparation that went into this last-minute cram session. However, his advisers are urging him two things. One is to stay on message, talk about policy, the economy, immigration. And, two is to stay measured. As we know, Trump can act viscerally to things when he doesn't like them. They are expecting tough questions, not only from CNN but also from members of the audience. They are taking Trump out of his comfort zone, out of that conservative media bubble that we've really seen him in for the last five years. And they believe that they have to do this if they are going to win, if Trump is going to win. And we're watching closely here tonight, it's not just how Trump responds but also how this audience responds. These are Republican voters. We want to see what it is that they want to know from the former president and how they interact with what he is saying. Do they care about these legal battles? Or, like so many Republicans, particularly in Washington, do they tend to ignore that and focus on other aspects of Trump? So, that is one thing that we are watching very closely. The other, of course, will be Trump's reaction himself. Not just the words he says, but also how he physically reacts to the questions. Can he stay calm, can he stay on message? His advisers are certainly hoping so. They believe this is a risk that they are taking, but one that will pay off.",

Back with me as well, and also here tonight, former deputy press secretary in the Trump White House, Hogan Gidley.And, Hogan, good to see your face again. So, Ambassador, let me start with you, though. We're extremely early. So it's hard to use the word frontrunner because you have people who haven't even declared. But nonetheless, the polls -- the current polls show Trump far ahead of others. This town hall is part of what seems to be a new strategy to try to broaden himself out beyond his stalwart, but not big enough to win a general election base. Liable for sexual abuse and defamation, that's the latest yesterday, and possibly more could be coming. So, does this change anything in the race for a nomination? SCOTT BROWN (R), FORMER U.S. SENATOR: First of all, I think it's important that CNN's doing this. I think it makes him step outside his comfort zone. It gives -- I'm glad he didn't succumb to some of the outside pressure. That being said, the allegations and the outcome from yesterday are serious. Not anything any person, including the president, wants to have hanging around, especially with the incredibly poll numbers, 36 percent, obviously with President Biden, 58 percent don't want him to run again, 32 percent questioned his mental acuity. So there are very serious problems with the president now, the sitting president, and, quite frankly, a lot of these distractions that you're seeing really open up the door for the Democrats to potentially win again.",

It was when the Mar-a-Lago raid happened. The American people don't like it when a government or a judicial system is weaponized against a citizen, regardless of how they feel about the particular citizen, and this is another example of that, and I think as of right now, it's not going to hurt him. Now, what that does in the future, how the Democrats use it, how other candidates use it in a primary, that remains to be seen. But right now, it's rallying the base around Donald Trump and saying this is a man who is vilified for years in the White House, all the things turned out not to be true, and this could just be another log on that fire, another witch hunt, another attack on a man, we did not do anything wrong.",

It's something that I see in focus groups, conversations with Republicans. When it's inside the family, they'll say his mouth gets him into trouble. The stuff with the women, come on. You know, they'll say that. But when it feels like it's coming from the outside, they feel like they have to defend him. It's almost like an antibody response. So, what I'm going to be curious about tonight and as we move forward is how do Republicans react when Donald Trump, you know, says the sorts of things he's prone to say that get him into trouble. Do they say his legal troubles make him risky, his legal troubles make him risky, him letting his mouth get the best of him. And we can't risk another four years of Joe Biden, or do they say, hey, I'm standing with this guy because the world is coming after him.",

McCarthy right now could lose four Republican votes and any party line vote could only lose three Republican votes, making things much more difficult the past legislation.But if there is an effort to try to expel him which could occur after the House Ethics Committee moves forward, that could see significant Republican support.

The former New Jersey governor and potentially presidential candidate, Chris Christie, seizing on the jury's verdict, launching Facebook ads like this one today.

He has to address the fact that he has a number of legal claims that are either pending, indicted or perhaps forthcoming. How does he convince any base, any potential party to make a broader tent that he could serve as the head of the executive branch and enforce the law and have all these matters against him.",

Some of his closest advisers I've been talking to over the last couple of days, they do not think this is winner for him.So my guess is he's not going to dwell too much on that because this simply is not a winning issue for him, but of course, he'll be asked hard questions about this and so many other things.
