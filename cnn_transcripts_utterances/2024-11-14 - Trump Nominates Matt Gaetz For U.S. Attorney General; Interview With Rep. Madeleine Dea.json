      "sentences": "Good morning to you. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington.And we begin this hour with my new reporting on what may be the most shocking presidential Cabinet nomination in decades. It is sending ripple effects through Washington. Of course, that's exactly what Donald Trump wants, picking Matt Gaetz for his attorney general. A source familiar with Donald Trump's thinking tells me the president- elect met with at least two other candidates in person, but didn't -- wasn't happy with him. They didn't check the boxes. So he quickly pivoted to settle on the MAGA loyalist Matt Gaetz because -- quote -- \"Gaetz will do all the things Trump will want him to do.\" The same source tells me that Trump believes Gaetz is -- quote -- \"going to want to go after career employees disloyal, as deep state, and ensure the retribution stuff\" -- end quote. Joining us now is Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean. She is a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Thank you for coming on. The attorney general, of course, is the nation's top law enforcement officer. Based on what my source tells me, is president-elect Trump putting his enemies on notice? REP. MADELEINE DEAN (D-PA):  Well, it's good to be with you, Pamela, from a very busy week here this week in Washington, D.C., as we came back to session and welcomed 30 new members to our caucus. What this tells me, this appointment tells me, is that the president is rewarding loyalty. Does it put others on notice? Probably. He's talked openly about a hit list, an enemies list. But what I would like to say is, the job is on the Senate to actually take a look at this nomination, to do the investigation, to see if he has the two characteristics that I think an attorney general needs, which is integrity and independence. From my work near Mr. Gaetz these last six years, I would say he fails on both fronts. He has not shown independence from Trump's lies. He has not shown the understanding that the attorney general must be independent. It is not the law firm of the president-elect. And, on integrity, I have sat with him on the Judiciary Committee where he, whether it's on committee, in hearings, in markups, or on television, spews misstatement, lie, conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory. So I would suggest the Senate take a very close look. I don't have a say in it. But we will also see whether they recognize he lacks those two qualities. It's very important to the top law enforcement official.",

But you have Trump allies in the Senate, Josh Hawley, Senator Tuberville coming out and saying, look, there was a mandate for Donald Trump by the American people with his election win,and we should do everything we can to get his nominees through.There is a line of thinking, even in the House among his allies, including from Speaker Johnson, that this is who Donald Trump wants. Someone like Matt Gaetz can reform a DOJ they see as weaponized. What do you say to that?",

We absolutely know that.All the more reason why a strong Democratic Caucus will provide the checks that we possibly can. It looks like it's going to be a very, very close majority. But I do want to say something else. There's a backdrop that you know of, which is you notice that at the time that he got the nod from President Trump, he immediately resigned from the House. Strange timing of that, because, as we know, the Ethics report was due to come out shortly. So Mr. Gaetz tried to cut off the results of the Ethics investigation into him on many different corrupt charges, including trafficking of a minor, sex trafficking of a minor, misappropriation of funds, bad behavior on the floor of the House, frankly. So I call it the Texas two-step, except he's from Florida. But he resigned immediately, hoping to forestall the Ethics Committee. I hope the Ethics Committee releases its report, so that we know exactly what they found in terms of that sitting congressman's behavior.",

      "sentences": "And, as you know, Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.Speaker Johnson claims that his resignation did not have to do with this Ethics report. But there are certainly many in the House, including yourself, who really just aren't buying that. What do you know in terms of the discussions about releasing that Ethics report? Because there are these growing calls for that to be out there, especially if he's going to be potentially the attorney general. [11:05:10] DEAN:  I don't know, but I think you're exactly right. If he's being considered and will be questioned by the Senate for attorney general, I think they have a right to ask for that report, to say, what did you find? What did you know? What do you know? It's relevant. I think the FBI will have to be doing a background check. So it's relevant. I don't know what the Ethics Committee will do. They're an extraordinary committee. You know they are equal in numbers, Democrats and Republicans. So they may be well-persuaded that, because of the integrity of this institution, because of us upholding our oaths, that they might need to release their work. They have worked on this for many, many months. So I'm hoping they will come forward and transparently show us what they found and then let the chips fall where they may. The takeaway from these appointments is that Mr. Trump, president- elect Trump, is rewarding loyalty. It is open corruption. We saw in the first administration of Mr. Trump he tried to surround himself and he did surround himself with very credible Republicans to work with him, most of whom got fired, dismissed or quit. This time around, he's just going with loyalists.",

The question then becomes, what about recess appointments, something that Donald Trump himself basically seemed to preeminently push, saying that that's important and that whoever the Senate leader is should do that.",

I also think that, with recess appointments, I fear that what will happen is a bunch of acting leads of different agencies and all loyalists. I think about Mr. Gaetz in the clip you just played. That is what we have seen here year after year, railing at our institutions, trying to tear down Americans' faith in institutions. And he's had friends like the speaker doing the exact same thing, so, now -- in order to shake our faith in our institutions and so that people will become more loyal to the power that Mr. Trump is wielding. I hope the American people see through it, most importantly. I count on the Senate to do its job and to make sure that people who are disqualified, unqualified, lack the integrity and independence are not confirmed.",

He -- remember, he was -- he did serve any administration at the -- at the end of the administration, there was a period where Trump -- where he wanted Trump to install him as deputy FBI director.What he doesn't seem to understand or didn't know is under federal law, the deputy FBI director is required to be a career official. It can't be a political appointee. And then he also wanted to get sent over to CIA, which also got blocked. And so he is ready to come in and essentially burn the place down metaphorically, I guess we should say. But here's the thing. I mean, I think the way for this to happen first is that Christopher Wray has to either be fired or he has to resign because he does have to just over two years left on his 10-year term. Is Trump going to be the first person to fire two FBI directors? Remember, he fired James Comey early in 2017. And so we anticipate that this is going to be a big decision for Chris Wray. Does he stay and make Trump fire him or does he leave before the incoming president takes office? I think those are the big questions. And the other thing, Pamela, you and I have been talking about this in our reporting over the last few days. There seemed to be this behind-the-scenes battle between what we -- what people call team crazy versus team normal. And the normies thought that they were -- they had the upper hand because Marco Rubio and some of the initial picks. And then, of course, it's been blown up in the last couple of days. The question is, does this important job, does this go to team crazy or does it go to team normie? And we will find out because the -- that's where this is now headed.",

I was told just by a source last night that there is an effort under way to come up with a list in the Pentagon, for example, of people who were against Trump, someone that they could potentially -- people that could potentially be targeted. Same with Gaetz as potentially the A.G. Of course, he's got to get confirmed and all of that.

She did a tour in Iraq, a tour in Kuwait. She was deployed to the Horn of Africa, supporting special operations mission. So she certainly has some level of military pedigree as a lieutenant colonel that I don't think many people would necessarily dismiss. Now, she has been very skeptical of wanting to involve U.S. troops in foreign wars. And there's a ton of data that would suggest the vast majority of the American people in both political parties actually would agree with that. And so I can certainly see how the president- elected his team would make a concerted effort to not only support her selection, nomination, and ultimately confirmation, but would say these are the things that we would point to suggest that she is a pretty good pick.",

One of the things that I found, Pamela, spending a lot of time with people in the military owning a firearms company, when you serve and you have seen men and women and your friends die around you, you are very, very skeptical to get involved in conflicts that may send troops to various parts of the world. And so I would argue that her background and her experience was certainly potentially bold well and her ability to do the job. Will there be a learning curve?

The skepticism that we have heard thus far as it pertains to some of the nominees has really only singly pertained to Matthew Gaetz for a whole litany of reasons that we have covered on this network. I'm also not going to diminish Tulsi Gabbard's military service record. I do think if the woman could be the first woman to graduate at the top of her class for officer candidate school at the Alabama Military Academy, I damn surely believe she can learn what's necessary to run DNI. And so I think we need to be very careful with diminishing someone's record merely because we may have ideological or political differences there. She is going to be vetted like everyone else. Republicans in the Senate and Democrats will have an opportunity to ask her very tough and challenging questions. And if she gets through those questions well, which I believe she has the capability of doing so, then she will be confirmed.
