They have suspended now all university education for women until further notice and have now reportedly ordered some schools for girls to be shut down. The announcement led to protests near Kabul University. Women marchers could be heard chanting either everyone or no one, and one for all.Earlier Secretary of State Anthony Blinken underscored his support for the women of Afghanistan and said there would be consequences to the Taliban if they do not change course.

He spoke a little earlier today giving a press conference on this issue and said that the Taliban had come to this decision based off of violations of the Taliban's Islamic values in his words. Namely dress code violations by female university students and also what we described as unsanctioned interaction between men and women at universities. Take a listen to what he had to say.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NEDA MOHAMMAD NADEEM, TALIBAN MINISTER FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (through translator): Those female students going to universities were instructed to obey full hijab which was also not implemented unfortunately. Islamic emirate was looking that this may be implementing today or tomorrow, but unfortunately after 14 months, it didn't happen. Girls were going to universities with clothing like women go to wedding parties. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, since their take over last year, we have seen women's rights and freedoms being eroded on all fronts. Back in March we saw secondary school girls, that is sixth grade and above being told that they weren't allowed to return to secondary school despite months of closure.And now in a concerning new development we have learned from three principals from three separate girls' schools in Kabul that they were ordered by Taliban officials to close the schools indefinitely. Now it is worth noting that the schools are currently closed for break until March which is the beginning of the new academic year. But this is a concerning development and it's still unclear how far reaching this policy will be. And of course, we have seen frustration and anger both within Afghanistan and beyond in response to these new restrictions. We've seen protesters taking to the streets. University students and women activists protesting in quite a remarkable show of opposition on the streets of Kabul. But we've also seen widespread condemnation from the international community. As you heard there from Secretary Antony Blinken, but also other members of the international community, the United Nations, the G7 nations and the European Union. Human Rights Watch has described this as a shameful decision.",

We want to pay attention to this temperature here, and the windchill that of course, is what it feels like on your exposed skin, and what I'm going to do is advance this here about six hours, just before midnight. There comes the arctic air crashing in, and we drop a whopping 30 degrees, and that's not as extreme as some of the other locations. We had a 43-degree temperature drop in Colorado and in Wyoming yesterday, just incredible.So, now let's start paying attention to Atlanta because overnight and into Friday morning, that's when your temperatures start to plummet very quickly so you can see how this advances east ward. This is dangerous cold, and when we're talking about windchill values, negative 70 and some locations across the plains, that means that the potential for frostbite exist, certainly -- Victor.",

Thank you, Derek.New York's Republican Congressman-elect George Santos says that next week he will address questions about the recently uncovered discrepancy in his resume and the ones discovered in his life story. Santos claimed his grandparents fled the holocaust, changed their names and converted to Catholicism to escape Nazism. But genealogy records reviewed by CNN, they contradict those claims. CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GEORGE SANTOS (R), NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN ELECT: Look, as I always joke, I'm Jew-ish. JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Throughout his campaign, Republican Congressman-elect George Santos would refer to himself as half Jewish or a Latino Jew, often telling his grandparents' story. How he says they survived the holocaust as Ukrainian Jewish refugees and converted to Catholicism changing their surname to survive.

His misrepresentations of his family history first reported by the Jewish publication \"The Forward,\" and his story contradicted by numerous sources reviewed by CNN's K-file. Records from the Holocaust Museum, and the International Center on Nazi Persecution which keeps records on Jewish refugees shows no mention of Santos' grandparents. One genealogist who helped research Santos' family tree at CNN's request said there's no sign of Jewish and/or Ukrainian heritage, and no indication of name changes along the way.",

The university records do not reflect anyone with that name having attended NYU. While a spokesperson from Baruch College cannot find anyone with his name or birthday ever attending the school. The record of his work history also murky. His campaign bio mentioned stints at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Neither Citigroup nor Goldman Sachs have any records of his employment. Santos listed on his 2022 financial disclosure, a salary of $750,000 and claimed he made the same amount last year. Income, he says he earned from the Devolder Organization which he says is his family's firm. A search showed the firm was registered in Florida last year. The state temporarily deemed it in active for failure to file required annual reports. CNN found Santos' filed the required report Tuesday. Santos's attorney said Santos represents the kind of progress that the left is so threatened by a gay, Latino immigrant and Republican who won a Biden district in overwhelming fashion. The Nassau County Republican committee chair all the issues being raised serious. Adding, every person deserves an opportunity to clear his or her name in the face of accusations, and I look forward to the Congressman- Elect's responses to the news report.",

      "sentences": "Well, Victor, Wall Street is not happy. And this is a classic case of good news for main street being traded by bad news at Wall Street. That's because the better the economic news, the more that investors fear that the Fed is going to have to keep raising interest rates and that is what investors are most concerned about right now.I think the good news is, that even though the Dow is down almost 400 points, 1.2 percent, you can see in the chart, we're actually well off the worst levels of the day. At one point the Dow was down 800 points. Look at the Nasdaq now. Nasdaq off by around 2 percent. So, significantly more, but also well off its worst levels of the day. Let me run you through some of the economic numbers. Because we did get good news this morning. Turns out the economy grew faster than we realized this summer. Q3 GDP coming in at 3.2 percent. That's pretty solid. That is well above the government's original estimate of 2.6 percent. And it is a nice rebound after back to back quarters of negative GDP to start off this year. And then let's talk about the jobs market, because, you know, you and I have spoken a lot about these layoffs that we've seen in tech and media. But in a lot of ways that's not showing up in the government statistics. Initial jobless claims they remain very low. They're around a two-month low. That is a sign that a lot of bosses, they don't want to let go of the workers they have, because they're worried that they won't be able to get new ones. We have a worker shortage right now. And so, that is a good sign. And I think if you zoom out it looks like in a lot of ways this economy has been able to take a lot of punches this year, right. I mean, the war in Ukraine, higher inflation, these monster interest rate hikes from the Fed. And yet if you look at today's numbers, nothing about today's numbers suggest an eminent recession.",

You know, even before this storm, experts were warning about sticker shock when it comes to heating your home. That's in large part because natural gas prices have soared. And natural gas is the most popular way to heat homes. So, if you look on the screen we see natural gas, if you rely on natural gas to heat your home, the government is estimating that it's going to be 25 percent more expensive this winter than last winter. Heating oil, 45 percent. Now, the key, though, is that that is just sort of the base forecast.If temperatures are colder, then you're going to see even higher costs here. 10 percent colder winter would mean natural gas, home heating costs, 37 percent more expensive. Heating oil, 52 percent more expensive.",
