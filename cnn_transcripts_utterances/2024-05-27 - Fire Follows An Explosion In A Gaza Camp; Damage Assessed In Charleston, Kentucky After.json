You are watching \"ONE WORLD\".Residents in Rafah are describing their shock, fear and anguish after what they say was a terrifying night in the southern Gaza City. One Palestinian man says that he felt an explosion that shook the entire area, followed by a raging fire in a densely populated displacement camp. The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 45 people were killed, 200 wounded in the Israeli strike on Sunday. Video obtained by CNN, as you see here, shows tents on fire. The Israeli ministry says it was targeting a military compound and that two senior Hamas officials were killed. Egypt, meantime, condemning the attack, while French President Emmanuel Macron says that he is outraged and is calling for an immediate ceasefire. Qatar says the strike could hinder hostage release and ceasefire negotiations set to resume in Cairo tomorrow. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem, joins us live now with the latest. I mean, the video is pretty shocking. Israel is saying that they targeted these two sort of senior Hamas commanders, but the collateral damage here has really surprised a lot of people. We're talking about dozens of people killed, women and children, among them. How are the Israelis justifying this attack, Jeremy?",

Depending on where you are in the U.S., your Memorial Day is either very stormy or extremely hot. That's because a line of severe storms pummeled the southern United States this weekend and is now moving towards the East Coast. Take a look at this destruction. This is the damage left in Charleston, Kentucky, after a tornado ripped through the area. Kentucky saw four of the 21 people who lost their lives in this weekend's storms. Most were in Arkansas and Texas, where tornadoes left cities in ruins. Other parts of the south are dealing with scorching temperatures. The heat index, which measures how the body actually feels in the heat, could hit 115 degrees Fahrenheit in some parts of the southeast and the Gulf Coast, as well. Our Ed Lavandera filed this report from one of the hardest hit areas of North Texas. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This is a subdivision where dozens of homes are just demolished. Emergency officials say seven people were killed here. Four of those victims were children. In fact, we spoke with the relative of one family that was just devastated by this. These cars and this debris that you see behind me, that is an area where a mother and two of her children were found dead by the woman's brother-in- law. Their home was catapulted more than 100 yards, and it landed here just in -- that's the remnants of what you see there. And those victims were found there just minutes after the storm blew through here. In all, some 100 people were injured, as well. There was a convenience store along Interstate 35 where more than a hundred people were scrambling to get out of the storm's path, only to find themselves directly hit by the storm. The building collapsed. Those people had to be rescued. But right now, in what is becoming stifling heat, families are out here trying to clean up the pieces and what is left of this debris field. And families simply just, in some cases, just kind of stunned as to where exactly you begin to clean up after this. We've seen people coming in with heavy equipment and just piling everything together, as you see behind me here. And right now, the biggest need that families here need is temporary shelter. So, the work is being done to get these people housed while they rebuild. Also, clothing, because as you can see, everyone's belongings have just been strewn all over the place. The Red Cross officials say that the storm system here in Texas kind of cut a path of 150 to 250 miles along, throughout North Texas. So, the damage and the devastation are very intense in places like this, but also quite widespread, as well. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There are not only difficulties for Ukrainian forces trying to hold those defenses, but of course, for Ukrainian civilians, as we've seen day after day over the course of the last few days. Around the country in Kherson and Donetsk yesterday, but also in Kharkiv, that strike on Saturday now believed to have killed 18, Zain, as you said, but that number likely to rise. It is only 30 percent of the rubble that so far has been sifted through by Ukrainian officials who described it, as hell. So, more likely to come in terms of civilian loss of life as a result of that strike and more pressure being brought to bear by Russian forces along many different parts of the front lines. And this, of course, is behind President Zelensky's visit to Spain. It was delayed, Zain, because of that opening of the Kharkiv front. He was meant to go earlier this month. It was delayed till now, a billion euros worth of Spanish aid to be given to Kyiv. It is the 10th such bilateral deal to be struck between a Western ally and Ukraine and will involve, we understand, much help towards air defenses, Patriot systems, but also leopard tanks. It is that help with air defenses that President Zelensky has so desperately been pleading for. And that is also, of course, been brought to the forefront of everyone's minds as a result of what's happened in Kharkiv over the course of the weekend. Had Ukraine had better air defenses, said President Zelensky, speaking before the weekend as a result of attacks on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv, these kinds of attacks and loss of civilian lives could be better prevented. It is also the backdrop to the important conversation that's now begun, Zain, amongst allies about whether or not to give the green light to Kyiv about using Western-supplied weapons on Russian soil. The debate was launched publicly by Jens Stoltenberg himself on Friday, the NATO Secretary General. He repeated from Sofia in Bulgaria today, his urgent plea that NATO reconsider what had been a pledge so far that none of its equipment would be used against Russia in light of what's been happening, which is the Ukrainian defenses being put so severely on the back foot and on such a substantial line of growing front lines.",

The prosecution will go last. Why? Because the prosecution has the burden of proof. And what you're going to hear and see are the battle of two narratives as it relates to the prosecution. They are going to focus on the issue of motivation -- motive. You don't have to establish motive, but certainly inquiring minds want to know why would the former president engage in falsifying business records? Why? So, that it would enhance his election prospects. There was this \"Access Hollywood\" tape. Prosecutors will say in which Trump was bragging about sexual assault. And with regard to that, it really rocked his campaign on the heels of that. And right after that, you have this Stormy Daniels revelation. What revelation? That he was having an affair with a porn star. We can't let that out. And so, we have to quell, quiet that story, get it out from public view. How? Because I'm going to have my fixer orchestrate a deal. And in that deal, we're going to catch that story, kill that story, pay her for her silence. And in doing that, we have to reimburse Cohen. So, we're going to falsify these records. And even though Trump didn't mess with the ledgers themselves, the invoices themselves, he was involved in orchestrating and conspiring to cover it up. And as it relates to that, he was doing it to boost his election prospects. He met with Cohen in the White House thereafter. They certainly weren't talking about him being appointed. That is Cohen to attorney general. What else can they be talking about? Reimbursements. And we know that Donald Trump signed those reimbursement checks in his own Sharpie pen. Ladies and gentlemen, he's guilty. The defense certainly has another point to make and will have a lot to say in that regard. Like what? They will say that you're going to rely upon Michael Cohen. He's the only direct connection in this case, which establishes that Trump was involved in any such deal. No, ladies and gentlemen, the defense will say Michael Cohen went rogue. This is a person who cannot be trusted. He has lied to everyone. He lied to Congress. He was convicted of perjury. He's lied to his business associates. He's lied to those around him. He's lied to his wife and he is lying to you. He is the only direct link and to the extent defense will argue that you have to and can only convict based upon his word, which is no good. You should take that word and do what belongs to it and is to disregard it. And so, to the extent that Michael Cohen acted on his own accord without the President's involvement at all, he is not guilty. Those will be the narratives we'll see. Of course, Zain, we only have a couple of minutes to talk about it. They will make these statements, prosecution, three hours, defense, three hours, a lot more than what I have to say here. But the essence of what they will argue is contained within what I just spoke about.",

I do have to ask you about, you know, one of the one of the key issues that's at the sort of crux of this case, but shouldn't really be. And that is whether or not Donald Trump did actually have sex with a porn star. I mean, obviously that is not the issue here, but the defense made a huge deal about it when they cross examined Stormy Daniels. Obviously, so many so many Daniels said that they did have an affair happened near Lake Tahoe back in 2006. The defense said that, you know, she's making that up. She lied about that.

      "sentences": "So, Zain, that's very critical. And why is that so important? Because the way it works in doing these jury trials is you have to have 12jurors who make a unanimous assessment as to the guilt or lack thereof. If 12 jurors come together and they say guilty, then, of course, Donald Trump's guilty. Nothing to see here. And he ultimately spends for right. Well, could spend up to four years in jail. That'll be a judicial determination. That is, a judge will determine whether or not to sentence him to that. However, if you don't have that unanimous agreement, if all 12 jurors do not agree he's guilty and you have one or more holdouts, that represents a mistrial. A mistrial is when the jury does not reach a conclusion or render a verdict unanimously. And the essence of that is that will result, in my view, essentially in Donald Trump's exoneration. Why? Because now you would have to try the trial or try him again. And there's little time before the November election to have that happen. So, he will certainly not be tried before November. And if he's not, here's the issue. If he gets elected, are you really going to try him four years later? Because you cannot try a sitting President during their presidency. So, it would delay the trial for four years. If he does not get elected, will prosecutors have the stomach, the wherewithal or will even be the level of interest to pursue him moving forward? So, I think this notion, which could happen of a mistrial, which is when one or more jurors hold out, if that does happen, that certainly would be a tremendous victory for Donald Trump.",

James, it's easy to sort of understand in theory, right, theoretically, that nowhere is safe in Gaza. We hear that all the time from various officials who have visited Gaza and, of course, from the people who live there. But when you see a strike like this happening in Rafah, where so many displaced Palestinians have congregated and you're seeing tents on fire so much in the form of class war damage, women, innocent children losing their lives in the blink of an eye, it really underscores just how much every single day is a gamble.",

Some of them are extremely hungry. A lot of them don't know where their next meal is coming from. A lot of them are dealing with disabilities.

It gives me a chill, because I've sat with those mothers, and I've sat with mothers who will explain that thebombings are so loud, and I know that, because where we stayed was on the border of Rafah and the adjoining city, Khan Younis. So, when the bombardments are hitting and you start to learn if a bombardment is half a mile away, a mile away, all these things you thought you would never understand, and you lie in bed and it feels like you're lying in a coffin, because you just don't know, because we can't believe the language. We can't believe that somewhere is safe. We know that's not true. This current offensive now that we've seen over three weeks in Rafah was called, quote-unquote, a limited offensive. And we've now seen half of the entire population of Rafah who were told to go there, 800,000 people leaving. So, the mums I talk to say things like, there is no lullaby. There are lullabies in Palestinian, in Arabic, that they sing. They say, James, there is no lullaby I can sing to my child at night that will get them to sleep through this. Because the mums know not only are they dealing with the immediacy of bombs and attacks and drones night after night, but they've had seven months of this Zain. So, we are in uncharted territory when it comes to the psychological well-being and the state of these children and of their parents. So, the ultimate front line support for any child, yes, UNICEF is there on the front lines, dangerously close. But the absolute front line is a mum. But the mums are shattered. They are physically exhausted. They've lost everything. They've lost a sister. They've lost a child. They've invariably seen a husband killed. They don't -- they no longer have that psychological capacity to do what they know they need to do. And they're aware of that. And then, Zain, if you've got a child who's eight or nine or ten, that child at some point in the last few months has looked into their mother's eyes and had that terrifying realization, as older children have told me, that I've now realized that mum can't protect me. So, across the board, parents know they can't protect their child. And as you say, there is nothing worse to strip away from a parent than knowing you can't do that. Children know their parents have lost that ability to protect them. And then you have something like last night, this indiscriminate attack on a tented area that engulfs --that engulfs a whole array of tents and people.

Psychologists will tellyou the longer a child is exposed to this level of trauma, and I don't think we've ever seen a place where every single child is experiencing trauma. The longer they are exposed, then the more trust that they lose in everyday life, in institutions, the idea that there is some sense of safety. They come to learn that the world can be a terrible and a dangerous place. Unfortunately, there are then clear economic impacts to this. We know that those children, the longer it takes to get them help, the less likely they are to go out and be able to have that job and earn an income. These things matter. Gaza is a city of children. Any demographer's aim will tell you that if you can get it right in Gaza, then you have a demographic dividend. Right now, we are the antithesis of getting it right for these children. So, they are living in an environment whereby they've lost loved ones. When I was there last month and I'm sitting with children in tents, just like these tents that have burned down, children who have had amputations, children who have not spoken for several months, such is the level of trauma that they're dealing with, or a child who's lost a mother and is living now with an auntie and no other surviving family. These stories aren't unique. They are in the thousands and thousands. The only chance for that child to get well, and it would take a long time, is of course to be in a place of peace, of safety, of water, of sanitation, of loved ones. These children have nothing even resembling that right now. They are in the worst possible place to even think about recovery. So, as long as this continues, then we are, as I say, we are seeing children entering a level of trauma that we've not seen before. It's why of all the children I go back to, Zain, of all the children, when you think of, you know, what does their life look like, that little boy Omar on one of my first trips to Gaza, who had lost both his mother and his father and his twin nine-year-old brother, and as we spoke, he consistently closed his eyes. And I asked his auntie why, and she said he is just so terrified of forgetting what his mother and father looked like. He knows he's lost them on earth, but he doesn't want to forget them in his memory. That's what children are trying to do. Children are trying to cope amid this hellish existence.",

But many feel that the ANC will be forced to form some kind of coalition to keep on to power here in South Africa beyond the 30 years they've already done so. Zain.",

She is gettingsome 350 rand and another 200 rand, so maybe $50 from the government each month in a social grant. That is critical for her survival. So, there's that issue of survivability in a country where the economy is struggling. And yes, there is definitely a generational divide. Those who remember directly the scourge of apartheid, the racist system they had to live under, will have a very strong and powerful pull towards the ANC. The youngest South Africans, many I've spoken to, who were born after 1994 at the birth of freedom, have a less profound link to the ANC. That legacy is fraying over time, and they just need to look at the overall numbers, you know, the record unemployment, the desperate inequality in this country where very few have very much and the vast majority have very little. That is a recipe for moving away from the liberation movement and the party. I think one of the key things to watch here, Zain, though, is turnout. Well, many people just not show up at the polls because of this apathy? I think that will be critical for the opposition parties and, of course, for the ANC. Zain?",
