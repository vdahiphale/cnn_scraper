I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Ukraine has once again come under a withering barrage of missile and drone attacks by Russia. Kyiv, Kherson, Kharkiv and Odessa have all been attacked as Russia tries to wear down its air systems. Moscow has also ordered the evacuation of residents from occupied areas close the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, raising serious concerns about its safety. For more than a year now, Ukraine has defied expectations with its resistance. But senior leader, including the defense minister, are now trying to manage expectations about that much anticipated counteroffensive. The key, of course, its support from nations like the United States. But there seems to be a sense that the NATO alliance is calling for visible results before providing more weapons. Terry McAuliffe is the former governor of Virginia and a long-standing friend and colleague an ally of President Biden. He's joining me now from Kyiv. Welcome, Governor. FMR. GOV. TERRY MCAULIFFE (D-VA) AND FORMER CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Christiane, thank you. It's an honor to be with you.",

We've got the nation and public private partnerships rebuilding our airports, our railroads, our roads, and we did a lot of work on the port. So, I came over in a private capacity. I have spent seven days here. I have driven 1,900 miles in seven days. We've gone from Warsaw all the way through Ukraine. I spent time on the front. I was up in the battle zone. And I met with NGOs here. I met with government ministers here to talk about rebuilding. We've got to plant the seeds now in order to get ready to rebuild. They've lost, as you know, 1,000 schools, 600 hospitals, and they need help. And so, I wanted to come over. So, I can now go back to the United States of America and I can say, here are the priorities given to me by the ministers, by the business. I visited manufacturing plants while I was here. I went to see Save Ukraine, which it just breaks your heart to see these children from displaced homes who -- from the war zone, they lost their home. Their home had been demolished.

And at some stage, we would be, once again, faced with the dilemma of whether we can live with Iran, with a bomb, or bomb Iran. And so, we would eventually get to that stage unless we find the solution. And, you know, it's true that it's difficult to deal with unsavory, murderous regimes. But if we wanted to apply that logic, for instance, to the Soviet Union and say that as long as the Soviet Union was engaged in violations of human rights or policy or foreign policy that was problematic from the western perspective, we would never agree to arms control deals with them, we would be living in a much more dangerous world right now. And a regime like the Iranian regime that cannot be trusted even with pellet guns, as you have seen, it has blinded hundreds of peaceful protesters in the past few months, how can we just trust this regime with the deadliest weapons out there? And so, I do believe that regardless of the nature of the regime, there is a need to find a solution to this nuclear crisis.",

You have -- we've seen a tremendous number of problems with nursing homes that the regulations that exist have done nothing to prevent. One thing I'll point out about nursing homes, and that is that private equity has gone into them quite substantially, an estimate of 11 percent of nursing homes in the country are owned by private equity firms. That's probably low because you don't always know these are secretive organizations, and you don't always know who owns it.

The CEO will be paid if the stockholder benefits. And it really has been a shareholder-centric approach to capitalism. Well, I think you can agree that in those -- in that period of time, the gulf between rich and poor in this country has vastly increased. So, I don't think that's a benefit. I don't think it's the only motivating -- I don't think it's the only cause, but I do think it is a cause. And I think that during the earlier, you know, '70s and up to about '85, 1985, the middle class in this country was growing in its wealth that it held. It had a growing percentage of wealth, but that all changed around about the time that these takeovers started, pensions began to be obliterated. You had to do your 401(k) yourself, which is very hard to do. So, I think we look at that trajectory and say, OK, what's changed over that period? A lot. We had offshoring. We have companies escaping the tax system in this country by going overseas. But I think this is a piece of the puzzle, and that's why I think it's really important to look at it.
