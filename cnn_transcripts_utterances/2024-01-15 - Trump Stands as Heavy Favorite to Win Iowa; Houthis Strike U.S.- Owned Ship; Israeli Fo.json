      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, it's caucus day in Iowa. FormerPresident Trump is the heavy-favorite to claim an early lead in the 2024 Republican presidential race as voters battle fiercely cold temperatures to make it to the caucus sites. Also ahead, belligerent actions by the Houthis in the Red Sea as U.S. own ship is struck by a Houthi missile in the last few hours, just days of course, after U.S. led strikes against the group. And charged with inciting hatred, this Israeli footballer has now left Turkey after an October the 7th tribute during a match, we'll have more details from Istanbul for you this hour. But first, the first votes in the 2024 U.S. presidential race are just hours away in Iowa. Rivals Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis are making their final pitches to voters before the Republican caucuses begin. Record-breaking sub-zero cold could impact voter turnout. Donald Trump holds a massive lead in the polls, but he's warning his supporters not to get complacent and urging them to brave the weather conditions no matter what. CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from Des Moines in Iowa. And Alayna, just for our viewers watching from around the world, it's negative 18, right? This is bitterly cold, just set the day for us. How are the candidates feeling besides bitterly cold?",

They are worried that turnout could be impacted by the weather. Now I know from my conversations with Donald Trump's advisors, that this is a concern of theirs in part, because one of the biggest goals of theirs and part of their ground game strategy here in Iowa is to turn out as many voters as possible, specifically, first time caucus goers and their concerns are that maybe people will stay home because of the weather. Of course, it's a concern that they share with the other candidates. But that was really Donald Trump's closing message to Iowans this weekend. He told them, do not get complacent. I need you to come out and I need you to show up and caucus on Monday. Take a listen to what he said in Iowa yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So you've got sort of an old school organizational effort versus riding late momentum. One thing we learned in the \"Des Moines Register\" polling over the weekend, also is that Haley is somewhat dependent on Democrats and independents to come into the Republican caucus, change their party registration and vote for her. And there are some people who are skeptical that those folks are going to be as enthusiastic as are the voters for Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis. So I don't know, but that margin between Trump and number two, and then between number two and number three, that will then give birth to some narratives tonight.

I think expectations for her a little lower in Iowa, but much higher in New Hampshire. So for DeSantis, Iowa is the alamo(ph), for Haley, it's New Hampshire. And if either one of them does well in those states, they probably have a way to keep the ball bouncing, and if they both fall short to Trump in those states, well, at that point, Trump's got a pretty good argument that this race is over.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (on camera): Well, it was very confusing for about the first hour after the attacks, even the police couldn't understand properly what had happened, because this is unusual. Some people calling it even the first time of an incident like this where there were two attackers attacking simultaneously in the same type of attack, 17 people were injured, one person, a lady in her 70s, was killed in the attack. And these two from about a 100 miles away in Hebron, the police say stole vehicles and then attacked different areas in this middle class town. But roughly or almost precisely the same time, and that's where the confusion came in. And they actually struck three different locations. This is one of the locations and you can see the force of the impact on this vehicle, the side of that vehicle, the far side that smashed up by the force of the impact, but perhaps where most of the casualty has occurred appear to have been at a bus stop where people were waiting for a bus. One vehicle we were looking at before had smashed into the side of the road near that bus stop, and it's not the first time that attackers attacking Israelis in their cities have taken vehicles and tried to ram into them at bus stops.

And certainly, also seems to be a fairly out-of-the-range of a lot of the air defense systems that the Ukrainians have as well. So it's unclear how this was done. What we're hearing from the main general of the Ukrainian, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, he posted something on X, the former Twitter where he said that this happened in the Sea of Azov, and he congratulated the Ukrainian Air Force, indicating that it might have been some sort of surface-to-air missile system or some other Ukrainian Air Force assets that was behind all of this. However, Isa, we do have to mention that both of these planes pretty key for Russia's aerial campaign against Ukraine, especially the A-50 Beriev, which is the larger of the two planes that was hit and the one that the Ukrainians are saying was downed by this Ukrainian operation. It's an airborne early warning and control system that essentially allows the Russians to monitor the battle space, but also direct its own fighter jets to more effectively fight against Ukrainian positions. Now, the second jet, the second plane the Ukrainians say did manage now an emergency landing at a Russian airfield. There was a photo that later emerged or the tail-fin of that plane, seemingly-badly damaged. What we've also obtained is audio apparently from a jet that was escorting these planes, asking for emergency clearance for the -- for the Russian plane to land. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In Gaza, it's a day by day struggle to stay alive, whether that's from constant Israeli airstrikes or simply from a lack of food, water, as well as medicine. More than 24,000 Palestinians now have been killed by Israeli attacks, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. But it's also a conflict which has had reverberations around the entire region. Exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border continue to this day with no sign of stopping. And just in the past few days, an escalation in the Red Sea.
