Now it took another 20 hours after crossing the border traveling first to Aswan, Egypt and finally taking a train to the capital Cairo where she is now the trip in total was around $200 which may not sound like a lot to some people but keep in mind the GDP per capita in Sudan as of 2021 last year, data is available was only around $750 per person annually. After detailing her journey, she offered this advice, put your money in different places so not all of it gets taken. If anything happens. If you are stopped by anyone at a checkpoint and they are asking for anything, please cooperate. Your life is more important. Stop to buy food and carry plenty of water as there aren't any shops or restaurants after you leave Khartoum and she said the trip was long it was scary and tiring, but worth it in the end.

This is the lawsuit from Smartmatic. Another voting machine company that's asking for more than Dominion even asked for. Smartmatic has sued for $2.7 billion.

That's essentially on the front lines between Ukrainian held territory and Russian held territory and an important frontline, too, because most analysts think that if Ukraine is to attain the strategic success it clearly needs during this long heralded counter offensive in the spring and summer, it essentially needs to try and cut off the Crimean peninsula held by Russia since 2014, occupied by them since then to the rest of occupied Ukraine and the Russian mainland too.That could be a significant blow to the Kremlin's plans for Ukraine. Now we don't know exactly how far advanced Ukraine's military maneuvers are here, and there are some restrictions as to what we are allowed to tell you without ramifications. But at the same time, it's important to point out that we have also heard Ukrainian officials suggesting the reallocation of Russian troops, one official suggesting that perhaps they've moved in greater number towards the coast of the Azov Sea out -- on the outskirts of the town of Melitopol, a key place that Ukraine is going to have to recapture, if indeed it has success in this counter offensive.
