For many, these are disturbing scenes. Nine year old Ohad Munder, being embraced as he is set free. An old woman, being carried by a masked man as Palestinians cheer. Of the 49 long days of captivity in Gaza, aid workers from the Red Cross drive them through the border into Egypt, and to freedom. Egyptian television shows a convoy of vehicles heading to the crossing. Then the hostages, including ten Thais, a Filipino, and 13 Israeli women and children disembarking for checks. The Israeli military posted this grainy video of the moment they all finally reentered the country. A stuffed, says the Israeli prime minister, towards bringing all hostages home. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We just completed the first return of our hostages, children and their mothers, and additional women. Each one of them is a whole world. But I emphasize to you, the families, into, you citizens of Israel, we are committed to return all our hostages.",

We have seen in previous hostilities, even small misunderstanding scan, sometimes, lead to them not going through. I think this deal has been offered, and on the table, for sometime. The parameters of which were a pause in fighting, a release of some Palestinian prisoners, release of hostages. It took a while for the Israeli government to agree to that arrangement, but I think that once these things are started, it can develop momentum.But let's be clear that, you know, human beings are not bargaining chips. Whether they be hostages that are held by Hamas authorities, whether it be Palestinians whose basic need for aid, and a chance to survive in their homes not being demolished contingent on other actions. We need to address these core issues today. Cease-fire, or not, unlawful action should stop, hostages should be released, aid should be allowed in, unlawfully detained Palestinian should be released. The reality here is that we have this current arrangement. The best hope we can have is that there continues to be progress made on these issues because it is an untenable situation on the ground.",

In fact, it's 73 since October 17th. And so, this raises questions and fears about a wider regional war, one that could potentially draw in U.S. forces.Now, the attacks we saw on Thanksgiving Day, there were four specific ones in Iraq and Syria. Some using drones, some using rockets, you can see there on the map, there were two against bases in Iraq, two against U.S. sites in Syria. We're told by the Pentagon that there was no damage to infrastructure, there were no casualties. Jim, on the same day, just yesterday, we also saw U.S. destroyer in the Red Sea, the USS Thomas Hudner shooting down what are called one- way attack drones that were fired by Houthi rebels. It's not clear whether the Hudner was the target, but that's down in the Red Sea. This was really racing question whether what the U.S. is doing in terms of deterrence is really working. Now, the U.S. has struck back, but only four times in the past few weeks. We saw the U.S. carrying out air strikes in Iraq earlier this week, against two sites that were linked, that are linked to an Iran- backed group. We have also seen U.S. hit eastern Syria three times. The Pentagon saying yes, in fact these strikes, what they're doing, in terms of posture in the region is working in terms of deterrence, because the conflict has not spread wider than it currently is, Jim.",
