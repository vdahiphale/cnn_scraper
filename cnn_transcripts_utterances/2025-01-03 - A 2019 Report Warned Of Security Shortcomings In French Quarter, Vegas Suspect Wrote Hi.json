KAYE (voice over): The city's more permanent barriers are bollards like these, portable steel structures that were designed to prevent vehicles from entering Bourbon Street. They move up and down and can either lay flat or be raised to close the street to traffic when needed to protect pedestrians. Despite warnings years ago that this area was at risk for terrorism, including vehicular attacks, the bollards were not used.

One of them says, \"Time to wake up. We are being led by weak and feckless leadership, who only serv to enrich themselves.\" Another excerpt says, \"Why did I personally do it now? I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\" And then another excerpt says, \"We are the United States of America, the best country people to ever exist.

You just need a vehicle, a foot to punch an accelerator, and a crowded street to drive down very fast. And yet take a look at Jabbar's tactics and techniques here. He is combining the ramming attack. He's got secondary weapons, the firearms, which he shoots it out with police. He's got remote controlled devices that are attached to radio receivers in two separate IEDs on either end of the set that he's built for this carnage, and he's got this rare explosive compound that he could make at home and a bomb factory at an Airbnb where you see traces of this powder that was there, as well as traces of it found in filter paper at his home in Houston.

And I would just like to say, I wouldn't necessarily agree with characterizing this as the judge indicating no legal penalties. What the judge did indicate is he telegraphed in the decision that he was prepared to sentence President-elect Trump to an unconditional discharge. Now, while that sentence won't include incarceration or any ongoing specific obligation to the court, what it does do is it cements the felony verdict by the jury. And if it holds, it will ensure that Donald -- that President-elect Trump will be a convicted felon for the rest of his days. So that's a pretty potent decision. Under the circumstances, I think it was kind of Solomon like. In the sense, on the one hand, the judge did what I just said he indicates he wants to do what I just said he's going to do. So he's standing behind the jury verdict. He's standing behind the rule of law. But on the other side of the coin, he is not imposing any penalty or obligations on President-elect Trump that would any way, shape or form interfere with the ongoing transition process. Or interfere with his ability to become -- to do his full duties as commander in chief and president of the United States. Additionally, it opens up avenues of appeal for President-elect Trump, both in state court and federal court. So, I think there was something for everyone there, but most importantly, the judges standing behind the jury verdict, which is someone who was at that trial for all seven weeks. So over 20 witnesses testify and hundreds of documents and evidence, and I think it was a sound verdict based on the law. And for the judge to walk away from that verdict, I think would have been an injustice. So I think the judge covered a lot of bases there.",

      "sentences": "Well, I don't know what I expected, Anderson, but I agree with Judge Grasso that it was the right thing to do. I might have expected, actually, Judge Merchan to sentence a fine, at least. There's no question that the writing was on the wall, that there was going to be no prison time and no supervision imposed. I thought he maybe could have imposed a fine, but I think this is cleaner, because what happens if you impose a fine and then President Trump refuses to pay it. Like, how do you go after the president for a part of a criminal sentence?So, I think this is the better way to go. There's also no question that a fine would have meant nothing to President Trump anyway, because you can only fine him maybe 5,000, maybe as much as 170, but still that doesn't mean much to him. So, I think this was the right way to go, as Judge Grasso said.",

      "sentences": "Though it might go unheeded here on Bourbon Street, the U.S. surgeon general is sounding the alarm about drinking and an increased cancer risk. In a new advisory, he links alcohol consumption to at least seven cancers, mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, breast, liver, and colorectal cancer. He's calling for warning labels on bottles of alcoholic beverages, similar to those on cigarettes. I want to talk about it more with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and former Baltimore Health Commissioner.Dr. Wen, it's good to have you back. What are your thoughts on this advisory? Do you think alcohol should come with warning labels? DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Look, I think it's reasonable, Anderson, for the surgeon general to issue an advisory because when there is new evidence, you would expect that our nation's top doctor, that our scientific agencies change their recommendations. And in recent years, there has been emerging evidence that is linking excessive alcohol in particular, but also even moderate alcohol use to several types of cancers, including breast cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer. So I think it's good to give people that information. Some people are not -- it's not going to change their habits at all, but some people, it might actually change what they do. So for example, the surgeon general cites studies that indicate a woman's lifetime risk of getting breast cancer if she drinks very little or not at all, is 11 out of a hundred. But if she drinks one glass of wine or some other alcoholic drink each day, her risk increases to 13 out of 100. And then it further increases to 15 out of 100 if she's drinking two alcoholic drinks a day. And so I think some people will look at that and say, look, I have a family history of breast cancer. I want to reduce my risk in every way. And so I'm going to reduce my consumption of alcohol. So I see this as empowering people who may not know about the risk of cancer and alcohol to make better choices. But still, I think that the focus needs to be on cutting back on excessive alcohol, not for people who are drinking a glass here or there, but for people who are really drinking heavily on a regular ongoing basis.",

      "sentences": "It is frustrating though, cause I mean, I remember a couple of years ago, you know, allegedly we were told about studies that claim moderate drinking one drink per day for women, two drinks per day for men could have positive impacts on cardiovascular health. I started actually drinking like a red wine every day for those very reasons. Now, I mean, I stopped doing that a while, long time ago, but, were those studies incorrect?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a really good question. It seems like the jury is still out on that question that the data are mixed, if anything, about whether there are any protective effects of alcohol. It's to the point though now, Anderson, where I really don't know of any medical professional who would say to somebody who isn't drinking, oh, you need to start drinking because it's good for your heart. There are so many other better ways to improve heart health than drinking. You could, for example, increase your physical activity or eat healthier foods or cut ultra-processed foods than to start drinking alcohol.And again, I think the focus really needs to be on cutting excessive drinking. We know for example that binge drinking, which is for women drinking more than four alcoholic drinks on one occasion, for men drinking more than five or five or more alcoholic drinks on one occasion, binge drinking is associated with particular risks, including higher risk of accidents and injuries and drowning. But also your body is essentially bathed with alcohol all at once and it's toxic to organs. And so I think that medical professionals really are focused on people who are binge drinking, people who have alcohol use disorder, who think that alcohol is affecting their lives, They're unable to quit or experiencing negative impacts from alcohol in their social life, their work life, I think we have to do a lot more to help those individuals.",

Matthew was killed here on Bourbon Street. He worked at the Superdome. He was just 25 years old, out with friends, and he never made it home. We're going to hear from his brothers coming up.

Last night, we told you the names of eight of them. Today, we learned four more.Terrence Kennedy, he was 63 years old. Everybody called him Terry. Grew up in a family of nine brothers and sisters. One of those sisters remembers his laugh. He was funny, could light up a room. She also said he was loving and kind. We also remember Elliot Wilkinson. He was 40 years old. His brother says he had a hard life and struggled with mental illness. Good hearted. That's the term his brother used for him. He also leaves behind his mom, his sister, and a daughter. And our thoughts are with them tonight. Also with the family of Nicole Perez. She was 27, a mom with a five- year-old son. Her family said she woke up every morning at 5.30 a.m. walk to work. They called her an example of a hardworking person going through the roughest times in her life and very dedicated to her job and very dedicated to her son. We don't have a picture of the fourth person, we learned was killed. Brandon Taylor was his name. He was 43 from Harvey, Louisiana, just outside the city. Two other people have been identified as well. The coroner says one was a British citizen whose name is being withheld at the request of the family. The other is a woman still in the process of being identified. All are said to have died of blunt force injuries. A vigil for the victims is planned for tomorrow in the French Quarter. Again, 14 people died here in all. That includes 25 year old Matthew Tenedorio, whom we told you about last night. He worked here in New Orleans. Earlier today, I spoke to his two older brothers, Jonathan and Jeremy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
