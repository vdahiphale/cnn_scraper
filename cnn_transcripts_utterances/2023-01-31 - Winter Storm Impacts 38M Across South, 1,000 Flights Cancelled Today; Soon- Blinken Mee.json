Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. I'm Christine Romans. We begin with a major winter storm across the southern U.S. Overnight, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders declaring a state of emergency and activating the National Guard as severe weather moves across the state. Sleet, freezing rain, bitter cold temperatures impacting some 38 million people from Texas to West Virginia. A winter storm warning is in effect for a large portion of Texas including Dallas/Ft. Worth. Schools in the area are closed due to the dangerous conditions. According to Flight Aware, nearly 1,000 flights have already been canceled today. Let's get to meteorologist Chad Myers, who is seeing the worst of the winter storm -- Chad.",

Let's show you what's going on right now.This is Dallas, Texas. Those roads are not supposed to be orange nor red nor should they say road closed. This is what is going on in there is at this hour. I'd say population-wise, this is the worst that you will see. But probably travel-wise that would be parts of Arkansas, especially the Ozarks, you get some hills there and you get an half an inch of ice on any of those roadways and you are going nowhere. So, third of an inch of ice in Greenwood, Luckenbach, Texas, a quarter of an inch here in Texas. Here is the rest of the weather for the rest of the day, that will slide to the Northeast, but that is only the first round of three that will be coming for Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas as we move you ahead, this is the forecast radar. Moving you ahead to this morning, rain develops again in Dallas, Rain and 29, that is not a good combination no matter where you are. Same story into parts of Arkansas, all the way down possibly into the northern sections of Louisiana. Again, across parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama. It is ice. This is not 3 inches of snow, which would be easy. This is a quarter of an inch or even an eighth of an inch of ice on the roadways. Some of it will be sleet. That is a little better than freezing rain. The difference is sleet comes down and you hear it. Freezing rain comes down as rain and freezes when you it hits the ground. That is the worst. And wet ice is the worst thing that you could possibly try to dry on that about this is an ice event. And that is why we have 1,000 or so flights canceled. And even though you may be leaving from New York going to L.A., it doesn't mean that your flight came from Dallas and got to you. You may not have a plane. Check ahead today.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Seven Memphis police officers have now been relieved of duty in the Tyre Nichols investigation, including the officer wearing this body camera, identified by Memphis police as Officer Preston Hemphill. Hemphill can be seen firing his Taser at Nichols following the initial traffic stop on January 7th.

Attorneys for Nichols family released a statement today saying in part that the news today from Memphis officials that Officer Preston Hemphill was reportedly relieved of duty weeks ago, but not yet terminated or charged, is extremely disappointing. Why is his identity, and the role he played in Tyre's death, just now coming to light?

Jeanna, this is -- look, when I talk to executives and CEOs, they're like, oh, they'll figure it out. The recent histrionics, they'll figure out. I'm not sure. We've already hit the debt ceiling. You have the Treasury Department with extraordinary measures. What do you think happens here? House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the president, what do they bring to the table of negotiations tomorrow? JEANNA SMIALEK, FEDERAL RESERVE &amp; ECONOMY REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES: Yeah, I think it is an interesting question. We don't seem to have a lot of agreement within the Republicans. We don't seem to have much consensus over what they actually want. It is clear that Speaker McCarthy is planning on coming with some sort of plan, but it is also clear that that group of 20 critical Republicans who really challenged his speakership in the first place when he was being voted in as speaker are on the sidelines and it is not entirely clear what that will look like. Although it could involve pretty intensive budget cuts. And so, you know, I think that there is a good chance to have sort of a period in which we're kind of moving the goalposts around what we actually want here. And given that the White House's position is very much that they would prefer not to negotiate this, that they would prefer to have a clean debt ceiling increase, I think that you have a real opportunity to set up for some strife.",

When you talk to business leaders or Wall Street, one of the reasons that they are so calm about this process is the prioritization plan will mean that, you know, debt in principal and interest on the debt will be paid back first. And so even if we breach those measures, even if we get that whether it is in June or July, it is okay because we won't default on the debt.But if you actually talk to experts who looked at that prioritization plan in the past, they say three things. A, the White House doesn't have much political incentive to go for it, B, we're not sure that it would work and we can do it, and C, we're not sure that it is legal. And obviously that could be a real problem. There are people who are saying that they would sue the government if they don't get paid.
