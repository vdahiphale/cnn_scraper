What you really worry about is when those are severe, and that was seen in just less than 2 percent of patients in this study and two patients died related to that side effect in the trial.",

The second victim was a 20-year-old student, but walking at night on a bike path with his long hair and beard could have been mistaken by the offender as a homeless person. The third victim was a homeless woman in a tent. So, you're seeing a possible pattern of someone stalking homeless people. We saw that in the Stockton serial killer earlier this year.

The United States and Mexico have agreed that the U.S. will continue to provide a pathway for eligible migrants to try to enter the country from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela under its humanitarian parole process and also agreed that Mexico will still continue to take back migrants from those four nations on humanitarian grounds past May 11th, which is the lifting of Title 42.But this comes as the administration says they're also preparing to send 1,500 troops, active-duty troops, to the southern border for 90 days to join the 2,500 National Guard troops already there. That shows you what they're preparing for. Currently, there are about 7,000 encounters between migrants and border patrol agents every day along the southern border. That number is expected to rise dramatically in the weeks ahead. And right now, a bus of migrants from Texas chartered by Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, are about to arrive in New York City.

So, these members of the military will be there in support of the border patrol and customs.The larger solution to this, which the administration announced a few days ago, are regional processing centers, which I think is a very good idea. Create for people who are desperate to leave their circumstances a lawful safe pathway to a place like the United States or Canada, versus the wrong way, entering our country illegally.
