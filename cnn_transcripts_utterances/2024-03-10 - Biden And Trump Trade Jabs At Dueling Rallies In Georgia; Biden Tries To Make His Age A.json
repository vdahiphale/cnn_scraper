The thing I'm most carries about honestly is whether most of the Nikki Haley voters who came out in these Republican primaries against Trump if they were already going to be Biden supporters. Anyway, they might have already been Biden 2020 supporters because the reason Biden won Georgia in 2020 is because not only did it turn out Democrats and independents, he got many disaffected Republicans in a state that as you mentioned as lean GOP for the past couple of decades. So, I think there's going to be a lot of focus on a Nikki Haley support but I would say most of those Nikki Haley voters who came out and cast an anti-Trump protest vote might already be in the bag for Biden.

And that led to the airport being closed. Essentially, you cannot fly in or out of Haiti right now. The security situation continues to deteriorate.

Last week, members of Dartmouth Colleges Men's Team voted 13 to two in favor, clearing the way for them to potentially earn salaries and have access to workers compensation. The current NCAA model bars players from being considered employees, but the National Labor Relations Board disagreed. Dartmouth is appealing and that process could go all the way up to the Supreme Court in a case that could reshape the landscape for college sports.All right, let's discuss this with CNN Sports Analyst Christine Brennan.

Of course, Division One Sports.And that's why someone like Caitlin Clark has had a decision to make because she's making so much at Iowa, the question would be in terms of endorsements and commercials, did she -- did she want to go pro. She turned out that she's made that decision to go to the WNBA. But that's where athletes are now, they are not employees as of now. They are not paid salaries as of now. And this whole conversation has been going on now for quite some time, but its reaching a crescendo in large part because everyone looks at the huge money, the T.V. dollars, millions of dollars coming in to leagues and conferences and teams. Football, men's basketball, and now women's basketball and other sports as well. And also, the fact that the coaches have salaries. The multi-million-dollar coaches salaries, especially in men's basketball and football and the imbalance and the questions have come in there about what our athletes, student athletes are getting. What do they deserve? And these are the questions, more questions than answers right now. But it is a real change in the college sports landscape. over the last several years.",

You know, the old days of not being able to give a kid $50 or $100 to go to his or her mom's or grandmother's funeral.You know, those kinds of stories were out there. That's gone. And I think because of that they're looking at it really through a new set of eyes or glasses, a new prism, and that's where we see it. But you made a great point. There is an appeal here. This is not happening overnight. The Duke -- the Dartmouth Men's Basketball Team is not going to be unionized tomorrow. It is a -- it's a long process. It's grueling. It may well go to the Supreme Court which is also hearing other case -- sort one other case at least and we'll certainly hear more over this on this issue. And the Supreme Court has shown that it really is for giving athletes more leeway to receive money. And so, we'll see how that moves forward. But -- and also of course women's sports. We cannot forget, are we going to unionize men's but not women's? I can't see that, you know, lasting in our country. So, there are lots of issues especially involving Title 9 and what we want for our female athletes, our daughters, and our nieces as well as our sons and nephews. You know, there's a lot yet to be determined if this is just going to be men's sports or women's sports and how our country will react if women are not part of the equation.",

A lot of speculation already building into this year's ceremony around Ozempic use and people who might be attending this ceremony.We talked with Eli Lilly CEO about why they put this ad together. He said there were really three reasons. One is that the steady population that they looked at did not include use for cosmetic weight loss. They only tested this in folks with Type 2 Diabetes or in people with obesity or health rated our weight-related health conditions. Another thing that they're focusing on here is the fact that these drugs have been in shortage. They cannot make enough to satisfy all of the demand that's out there. And that has led to difficulty for patients with Type 2 Diabetes accessing these medications. A third reason is that health insurance coverage is really bad for these drugs. They're very pricey. They cost more than $1,000 per month without insurance coverage. And Lilly's CEO told us that half of Americans who could qualify for them don't have health insurance coverage. So, he told us about how they're trying to sort of capitalize on this moment and this attention around this ceremony coming up to draw attention to these issues. Here's what he said.

And yes, the media attention drawn on that from last year and might be drawn this year, we're taking a point of view on that.
