Not that a deal would be done, period, but that a deal would be done as soon as Monday. Now, we know that the Biden administration was pushing to get a deal done in time for the holy month of Ramadan, which is due to begin around about March the 10th. And we also know that we've moved on from those framework talks in Paris and talks are actually happening in Doha, so-called proximity talks, because Hamas is there as well. The head of the political bureau meeting with the emir of Qatar. You've got the Israelis, Egyptians and Americans there as well. So they're in the same city, even if they're not talking directly with one another. So this is fueling this optimism, fueling this momentum, and there is hopes that a deal is getting closer. But I think the surprise was that President Biden said that it was going to happen as soon as Monday. And actually, in an interview, so we can be sure that it wasn't just the ice cream talking, President Biden addressed the ceasefire issue a little bit more in an interview on American television.

That gives us time to begin to move in directions that a lot of Arab countries are prepared to move in. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOTKINE: And of course, at the same time, we know a lot can go wrong between now and next Monday, so it may not happen on Monday. And what we've seen in the past, albeit less severe conflicts between Israel and Hamas, that when there is a ceasefire on the cards, the fighting actually intensifies before you get there, as people want to make as many gains as possible before the guns fall silent.",

Now, we understand there are 13 women among the 100 or so hostages that are still in captivity, and about five of those are of military age. So there could be about five or so female hostages. At the same time, there'll be a 40-day pause in fighting, and about 10 times that number of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli jails. There would be 500 aid trucks going into Gaza on a daily basis, thousands of tents and caravans to help with shelter, and at the same time, things like bakeries and hospitals being repaired so that they can resume functioning. So those are the broad parameters we're hearing from Reuters, also from Israeli officials, and as we say, Biden certainly is optimistic it can happen by Monday, whether that will be the case. You know, we'll have to see. Let's not forget as well that we have the primary in Michigan going on, where Arab American voters may be less put off by the Biden administration's support for Israel if there is an imminent ceasefire.",

And there were a couple of other pretty significant things that came up out of this meeting, which was pretty hastily arranged. I think you really get a sense that Europe is trying to lead and there's a real collective sense of urgency.

He said that Sweden has been destroyed as a sovereign state. Now, look, while Finland obviously massively increased NATO's border with Russia, Sweden will give it much more control, as you say, over two regions. One, the Baltic, and two, the Arctic. Now we have a situation, once Sweden does join, where the only country bordering the Baltic that isn't in NATO will be the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. And separately within the Arctic, out of eight Arctic countries, only one will not be in NATO and that's Russia.

And since they're willing to exchange Krasikov in principle, then I just need to get rid of the bargaining chip. CHANCE (voice-over): No person, in other words, no problem.

But some Biden supporters like former Congressman Andy Levin say the president's prospects this November are uncertain. ANDY LEVIN, FORMER U.S. HOUSE DEMOCRAT: I mean, I'm going to do everything I can to get him elected in November. All I'm saying is I don't know if we can succeed unless we change course, and by the way, it's the right thing to do. GALLAGHER (voice-over): He says he voted uncommitted in the primary, not because his support for the president is wavering.",

Then-candidate Barack Obama and John Edwards had removed their names from the ballot after the DNC punished Michigan for moving its primary up.Now, look, it's important to note that Michiganders, they vote uncommitted all the time, and not everyone who votes that way on Tuesday is supporting the campaign here. [04:20:00] But the organizers say that Democrats as a whole should pay attention because this is not political for many of the people here. It is personal. They have friends and family members that have been killed in Gaza, and they say that it's not just a risk that they may leave the top of the ticket blank, but that they may not show up to vote at all in November if something doesn't change.

That's protecting U.S. forces and citizens in the region, supporting Israel's inherent right to defend itself from terrorist attacks, working closely with Israel to support and secure the release of hostages from Hamas, and ensuring that the crisis, the conflict between Hamas and Israel, doesn't escalate.

For today, Dallas gets to 90, tomorrow back down into the 50s. Even for Chicago, Wednesday you're going to be 70 and then knock your temperatures down by 37 degrees to 33. That's the cold front. And it's the same cold front that could make severe weather tonight around Chicago, around southern Michigan, also Indiana, Illinois, and then by morning possibly all the way down toward the Ohio River. When you have warm air like this and cold air wants to push it away, there is the potential for those storms to want to rise. When you push those storms into the air, you get severe thunderstorms possible even this time of year. I know we think about March, April, May being severe weather season, but when the warm air is this warm, you can certainly get severe weather. 70 degrees in Chicago on Wednesday, and then here's your knockdown, all the way to 21 for a morning low. Some of the outdoor plants may not like that very much. We'll have to see what happens to all of those things that want to grow. Then all of a sudden Mother Nature says, nope, how about 21? That'll freeze them up a little bit, so we'll have to be very careful and possibly even get them covered up if they start to peak out there.
