We're standing by as Trump appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, is expected to hold two hearings where she will consider motions to dismiss the cases from co-defendant Walt Nauta - including from co- defendant Walt Nauta, a Trump aide.This comes as never before seen photos have been revealed from June 2022 showing Nauta moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors say that Nauta moved the boxes shortly before a Trump attorney was going to look through them after getting a subpoena to turn over classified material. CNN's Evan Perez is in Fort Pierce, Florida, today to watch these hearings as they develop. Evan, what do you expect to see?",

In this case, Judge Aileen Cannon is having hearings on pretty much every single motion, which is why this case is moving so, so slowly.What - today we're going to here motions from Walt Nauta this morning. This is a co-defendant of the former presidents, still works for him. He is arguing vindictive prosecution. Trump, in his case, and the other co-defendants, are going to - his lawyers are going to be in court this afternoon and they're arguing for the suppression of evidence. Trump wants all evidence from the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago to be - to be - to be suppressed. He also wants testimony from his former lawyer, Evan Corcoran, he wants that kept out of this case. Now, here's the deal. What we saw with these new documents, you're seeing some of the evidence that what the prosecution says support their case. First of all, you saw those images of Walt Nauta, according to prosecutors, this is from surveillance video. This is where he is moving boxes before Corcoran and other lawyers were doing a search of Mar-a-Lago to be able to return those documents as ordered under a lawful subpoena. What we're also seeing, John, is one of the reasons - the major reasons why Judge Beryl Howell ordered Corcoran to provide testimony. A very unusual thing. As you know, he was a lawyer for the former president and he was claiming, of course, attorney-client privilege. But here's what she wrote as part of the reasoning for ordering that. She said the government has proffered enough evidence that the former president was using person 18, in this case that's - that's Evan Corcoran, as an instrument or as a front man to obstruct the government investigation or to conceal the documents, again, that he was ordered to produce.

So, a storm this massive just decimates really a huge chunk of this very small town. And it, of course, is not just here, as I said. Southwest Iowa very hard hit. In neighboring Montgomery County, 28 homes were hit. That's according to officials out there. And then I'll take you to Carbon, Iowa, where a storm team was there just moments after a tornado hit.

I think it's really interesting to listen to that exchange for a few reasons. And, Keith, let me just start with you because the way I see it, there are probably three options for what happened there. Number one, Trump heard and understood the question, how do you feel about contraceptives, and then basically made up that his campaign was going to come out with some kind of a statement, a new policy over the next two weeks on it because we don't believe anyone is coming. The second option is that he confused contraceptives with abortion and, again, made up some kind of statement that the campaign was going to come out with in the next two weeks because, no - we have no reporting that's going to happen. Or, c, didn't understand the question at all and just made up that the campaign was going to come out with a statement in the next few weeks because we have no reporting that that's actually going to happen there.

He's got - he's the same guy who's been out there bragging that he's responsible for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe versus Wade.But when Arizona, because of that overturning of the law, when Arizona went back and enacted this 1864 draconian law banning abortion in almost all instances, Trump had to come out and say, oh well, no, I didn't really mean that. You know, this guy who has said - claims he's the best president ever seems to have no knowledge of basic public policy.

We have two years' worth of electoral data that showcases Republicans continue to lose elections, even close elections, even counties that the former president won in 2020. We have seen in some states have voted with Democratic counties to protect reproductive rights. And when you actually speak with many Republican voters, including conservative ones, and even some evangelicals. They will limit that they recognize that this is not electorally beneficial to the Republican Party, and they are willing to give the former president almost unilateral movement on this particular issue. So, I think his campaign needs to figure out, if you're going to say this is a state's issue, than it should be a state's issue that should be on the ballot via ballot initiatives that people should be able to vote on.

The Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. Two of those things have already been overturned by the current Supreme Court in that same generation. The Voting Rights Act, although it hasn't been overturned, is being gutted by the Supreme Court in the Shelby County v. Holder decision in 2013. Roe versus Wade was gutted by - by the Supreme Court and completely overturned just a couple years ago. And so I'm not competent that Griswold will survive either because Clarence - because - not just because of what Clarence Thomas said, but because Donald Trump has followed the federal society policy of employing the nominating these conservative right-wing justices who are determined to overturn all of these precedents that are 50 or 60 years old. So nothing is safe if Donald Trump is allowed to continue to appoint more right-wing justices and federal judges to the bench.",

The same thing they were saying when the - when the - when the Hur report came out, that Biden - Biden doesn't have the ability to be able to form a sentence. So, I think we're judging the two candidates on a different standard. Biden is 80 years old or 81 years old, and Trump is 77 years old. They're both elderly men.

Keith and I have discussed this before. I've seen Keith discuss this issue on other shows. Republicans just aren't winning on this. And most voters, when you look at our survey data, you look at our polling data, even a plethora, a majority of Republicans are saying, we don't really want politicians touching any of these issues. And I think that's why you continue to see Republicans struggle at the ballot box.This is going to be a close election. This is an issue Republicans should completely leave alone.",
