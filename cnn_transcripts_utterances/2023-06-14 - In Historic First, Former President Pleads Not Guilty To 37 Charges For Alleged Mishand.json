But it seems there has been little to celebrate for the former president after he was arrested during his arraignment in a Miami federal court for the alleged mishandling of classified documents. He pleaded not guilty on all counts and while he described those 37 federal criminal charges as fake and fabricated, they are by far the most serious of all the legal charges against him and present the very real possibility of prison time.Amid all the vitriol, the anger, the lashing out, the bluster, Trump was also fundraising. The twice impeached, twice indicted, now twice arrested former president spoke to supporters in Bedminster, New Jersey just a few hours ago insisting he had every right to have those secret and classified documents in his possession. And he accused U.S. President Joe Biden of orchestrating the case against him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, almost all of those reactors have been shut down by one which is in what's called a warm shut down. The plant itself does have enough cooling water to last several months according to the local authorities here, but it sits on the dam or the lake above the dam of Nova Kakhovka which has been blown or burst with a very substantial loss in water levels of that dam. So, in the future, one of the things that head of the IAEA will be looking at is how do they maintain supply of water to those all- important cooling pools. This coming as the Ukrainians continue to increase the level of attacks that they're conducting on that Southern front, making small but significant gains as they take on a very substantial Russian front line, very strong defense in depth that the Russians are known to have there, because it's the route for Ukraine to try to get through to liberate the Crimean Peninsula, which was seized by Russia back in 2014. And at the same time, the Ukrainians also enjoying some tactical success now punching up to about seven or more miles in a salient southeast of the city of Bakhmut. Again, significant advances really have a tactical nature. But ultimately, if they're able to join up with forces breaking through Russian lines elsewhere, they might well be able to turn the momentum of this counter offensive very much to their advantage. But this has been the early stages of the much-wanted campaign to try to rid Ukraine of the Russian invaders and Ukrainians are privately admit, these are Ukrainians inside the military, that they anticipate that the scale of the fighting that is coming in the near future is going to be such that they're expecting to take some really significant casualties.

To put it into context, at 2022 for example, the last year we have figures for, there were nine firing incidents, so it's one of the lowest gun crimes in the world in Japan. This incident though is slightly different. Because the reason gun crimes are so low is because it's so difficult for somebody to be able to own a gun.
