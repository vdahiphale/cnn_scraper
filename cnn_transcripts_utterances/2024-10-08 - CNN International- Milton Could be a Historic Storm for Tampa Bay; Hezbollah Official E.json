Meanwhile, intense fighting in the Middle East, after a day of mourning where Israel marked one year since the deadly October 7th attacks. And U.S. presidential candidates out in force, how Harris and Trump are looking to grab headlines with less than a month left before election day. Historic, unprecedented and potentially catastrophic. Those are the words being used to describe hurricane Milton now bearing down on Florida's West Coast, at least very soon. Milton is forecast to make landfall late Wednesday as a major hurricane. The storm dropped a category 4 intensity overnight. Again, the key word there is dropped because it could build back up to a category 5 later today, after earlier reaching speeds of 180 miles per hour, or 290 kilometers per hour. Now, as residents prepare mandatory evacuation orders are in effect for nine counties, including the Tampa area. And the mayor's message, get out or you're going to die. Michael Brennan is the Director of the National Hurricane Center, and last hour on CNN, he talked about the expanding warning area as the hurricane approaches. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we're going to see a substantial wind event across much of the Florida peninsula, potential for widespread power outages, wind damage. Also, the potential for life threatening flash flooding with up to 18 inches of rain, especially along and just north of the track.

Now, just two years ago, this part of Southwest Florida, Lee County, was devastated. Was a good part of it was destroyed by hurricane Ian. And so, the folks out here have been getting ready. Essentially, what you're looking at is some of the preps underway. But to give you a sense of where the water got, about two years ago, hurricane Ian brought a storm surge about -- probably about to hear. So, the expectation is that the water that will be associated with the storm is probably going to be at this level, if not slightly above. And so, the businesses here in downtown, Fort Myers, are all getting ready for this hurricane now to the north of where we are, the preparations, the evacuation orders there, went into effect and began in earnest yesterday, over in Sarasota County, Manatee County, Hillsborough County and Pinellas County. The folks there began moving inland yesterday, traffic cameras really showed just the number of folks that were taken to the roads trying to get to Northern Florida, Central Florida. Folks are trying to get over across to the east coast in South Florida. In fact, on our drive in from Miami here to Fort Myers, the traffic really did not let up across Alligator Alley, which connects both coasts of the State of Florida. And so, the line of cars really was from Naples, Florida on the West Coast, all the way into Broward County on the east coast of Florida. One of the biggest concerns going into this storm is the debris that was left over by hurricane Helene, which hit about just two weeks ago. We were in the Tampa area just last week doing a story on some of the damage there. And emergency officials really have been concerned about the fact that in Pinellas County and in Hillsborough County, there just has not been enough time to get all of that debris out. And of course, those folks there are expected to get a more direct hit by hurricane Milton, if that forecast track holds. And so, if you've got all of that debris laying out -- laying around in neighborhoods, it becomes a safety concern for the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of folks that have been ordered to leave their homes and for the folks that stayed behind. The last thing they want to deal, of course, is all of that debris, which, again, has yet to be picked up.

But elsewhere in the world, the conflict in the Middle East is growing as this latest iteration enters its second year. The Israeli military says it's expanded its operations against Hezbollah into Southwest Lebanon. The IDF says it killed a Hezbollah commander around Beirut Monday, though that hasn't been confirmed. Hezbollah firing a fresh barrage of rockets toward Northern Israel. Meanwhile, the Israeli military says it's still operating in central Gaza a day after a strike killed 30 people in a refugee camp there. So as the fighting ramps up, a Hezbollah official, for the first time, appears to be endorsing ceasefire talks. We have Jomana Karadsheh in Beirut.

They have been flying over the southern suburbs of Beirut for the past couple of weeks right now. And this loud buzzing noise has really become something that the residents of Beirut hear every single day and every single night, pretty much constantly, and that's usually an indication to many that airstrikes are coming. And we've seen several airstrikes on the southern suburbs now, this is an area where you have a heavy presence of Hezbollah. But also, it is neighborhoods, many, many neighborhoods in this densely populated part of the capital where you have pretty much a different, very diverse group of people living in there, hundreds of thousands of people who live there. And we've seen a mass exodus when the Israeli military operations intensified there, but you still have civilians there. And you know, Omar, what we've been seeing is sometimes the Israeli military does put out warnings, does tell people that airstrikes are coming, but those tend to come in really late at night, when people are not really glued to their phones and social media to know that these warnings are out. Some people return to the southern suburbs during the day to pick up their belongings that they had to leave behind in a rush when they evacuated the area, and you suddenly have these air strikes. So, it is very troubling for so many civilians in this city, but a very dire situation is continuing to unfold in Southern Lebanon. That is, of course, where the Israeli military operations are really focused, whether it is the airstrikes, the shelling, the fighting, what the Israeli military is describing as this limited ground incursion that began last week, where our sources are telling us what has been happening is these sporadic raids across the border. But Omar, I want to share with viewers this drone video that has emerged, and it shows the village of Yaroun. This is a village that is right on the border with Israel. And you can see the scale of the destruction there, and for so many people, this is absolutely terrifying. So many people see this as their worst fear come true when they're seeing this one village, the devastation in one of so many villages that have been caught up in this war. And they look at this and they say that they fear that their country, their villages, their towns, are being turned into another Gaza, Omar.",

She did Alex Cooper's popular podcast \"Call Her Daddy\" live on Sunday with a focus on women's reproductive rights. I should say it came out on Sunday, then her wide ranging 60 minutes interview aired on Monday night. Today, she'll appear on the view \"The Howard Stern Show\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\". Running mate Tim Walz is also making the media rounds, appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Monday night.

Some polls, she has a slight edge when up against for President Donald Trump. Other times, she doesn't. And a lot of what they see in polls as well is that voters are still trying to get to know her more. And so, this is a media blitz timed in part because we're in the final stretch, also because early voting is already underway in some states. So, as you mentioned, she already has had a couple of interviews this week, also targeting different audiences, for example, that \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, millions of listeners, mostly young women. So, the focus there very much on reproductive rights and amplifying her message. There 60 minutes a wide-ranging interview where she talked about multiple issues, including, for example, immigration and foreign policy. And now today, on the view, she's going to use that platform to announce a new proposal to try to assist with the long-term care needs of senior citizens, especially appealing to what we call the sandwich generation, those adults who are caring for both children as well as their aging parents. And so, we expect to hear more about how she intends for this to look and how it's going to be paid for. And perhaps some of her own personal story, because the vice president has also previously talked about how she took care of her aging mother. And then again, as you mentioned, \"The Howard Stern Show\", a mostly male audience, and that is an area where the campaign is trying to make more inroads. And then later \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert, and later in the week, a Univision town hall. So, what you see when you look at it altogether, is a campaign that's trying to reach multiple different audiences to increase the exposure of the vice president and her vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, to try to get their message out and try to reach people, as strategists often say where they are. Now, of course, the vice president has been getting some heat for not doing enough media appearances before, perhaps to some hard-hitting media appearances, but the campaign says that this is ultimately a strategy that they see to drive out turnout when we're at a point where voters are starting to think more seriously about the election and starting to pay attention more now than perhaps, they did a few months ago, Omar.",

      "sentences": "I mean, I think the context is that this is Donald Trump using a very well-worn playbook. Remember, this isn't thefirst time he has used dehumanizing and disparaging language to talk about migrants. You mentioned him you know, his rhetoric regarding the Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, about eating pets. Claims we know just are not true and have been said by Republican officials on the ground that are not true. Last year, he referred to migrants as poisoning the blood of the country. Anti-Semitic rhetoric that we know Nazis used to describe Jewish people around the Holocaust. He said a lot of similar things. I mean, this is taking it to a different level, arguing that perhaps immigrants have bad genes in them. But I think the context of this is that this is rhetoric that Donald Trump has used repeatedly in the past. While this distinct comment may be new. The overall strategy is not Donald Trump really does use fear mongering and tries to stoke fears with voters about immigrants. It's something he did successfully in the lead up to the 2016 election. And he has continued to do repeatedly on the campaign trail this cycle. And I will remind you as well, Omar, that despite a lot of these claims just being untrue, unsubstantiated, receiving a ton of backlash and stirring up a lot of controversy, Donald Trump continues to lead on the issue of immigration, when compared to Kamala Harris. And his campaign views immigration as one of, if not the, top issue for them ahead of the November 5th election. And so that's where a lot of this is coming into now, I think one very clear thing to point out here is that also how Donald Trump generalizes the immigrant community. We know that repeatedly on the trail, he also tries to talk about immigrants creating or conducting violent crimes, and he tries to generalize the entire immigrant population at times by saying that particularly immigrants who are here, who are undocumented in this country. But in many ways, I will argue from the rallies I have been to, a lot of Donald Trump supporters and Republicans on the ground say that immigration is their number one issue. Whether they're in a border state or not. A lot of these people could be in Wisconsin or Michigan. They tell me immigration is a number one issue, and they do believe what Donald Trump is saying. So, I think at the end of the day, we know that a lot of this is just not true. We know that this is dehumanizing language, that he makes a lot of unsubstantiated claims when it comes to immigrants. But there's a lot of voters who do believe him, and they his campaign does believe that this is, in some ways a winning strategy as they look ahead to November.",
