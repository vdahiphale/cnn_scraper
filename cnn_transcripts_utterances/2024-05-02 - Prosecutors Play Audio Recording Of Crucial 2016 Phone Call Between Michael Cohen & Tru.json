Day 10 of the Trump hush money trial, ending with a false claim, from the defendant that he's not being allowed to testify.The day began with prosecutors seeking additional contempt judgments against him. But things really heated up, during the testimony of Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal's former attorney, Keith Davidson. The prosecution played the phone conversation that Michael Cohen secretly recorded, and CNN exclusively obtained, featuring Donald Trump, taking an active role, in the Karen McDougal deal. We're going to be talking about that, and the impression that it may have had on the jury, throughout the program. If you're just joining us, here's that clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, just interesting for the jury to hear this. These are real-time recordings. Of course, Trump's lawyers will push back on what it means, and what he was referring to.

What took place before that? And what took place after that? To put in context, exactly why you were doing that? That'll give some additional food for thought for the jurors to understand. Is he doing it to save his skin? Or is he doing it because he believes that this person is somehow trying to be secretive about even his involvement in it, and he's trying to give some evidence down the road? That's part of the overall picture that is becoming increasingly clear. But Michael Cohen is not going to be the most sympathetic figure for these jurors. Nor does he have to be. Nor does David Pecker have to be. Nor does the idea of the catch-and-kill and salacious details. They have to return the jury to the overarching crime, that they are alleging, the falsified business records. A lot of this is about contextualizing it.

Not, I thought, if I did this, he might do this. He hasn't even repaid me. And you combine the word repaid, with the audio tape that's been recorded, to suggest that there has been some meeting of the minds, between Donald Trump and Michael Cohen, about an event that would take place, and then he did not make good on his promise.

It has to do with the relationship that Stormy Daniels had with Donald Trump, or allegedly, right? And they get this into evidence here, today. Steinglass, the prosecutor asks, so let me direct you to two parts in particular. This is of a statement that Stormy Daniels and Keith Davidson crafted. The first two sentences, when it states that she, Ms. Daniels was contacted by certain news outlets alleging she had a sexual and/or romantic affair with Donald Trump, many, many years ago and then it states that that's absolutely false. How is that technically correct? The prosecutor asks. Davidson responds, well, I think you have to hone in on the definition of romantic, sexual and affair. The prosecutor says, OK. Can you explain that? Davidson says, well, I don't think that anyone had ever alleged that any interaction between she and Mr. Trump was romantic. And then Steinglass says OK. How about sexual? And then Davidson responds, well, that would be a sexual and/or romantic. So yes, this may be a documents case. But there has to be a reason the prosecution is doing everything they can, to show there is some pretty seedy behavior.

And it was on Election Night as the results were coming in, and there was a sort of surprise amongst the broadcaster and others that Donald Trump was leading in the polls and there was a growing sense that folks were about to be ready to call the election. The prosecutor says, and you referred to it as \"Gallows humor.\" Can you explain that a little more? What did you mean? Why did you say, \"What have we done?\" Davidson says, I think there was an understanding that this is a text between Dylan Howard and I, and there was an understanding that our efforts may have in some way -- I should strike that.

He's made clear he would not do what Mike Pence did, and stand in the way of sending the fake slates of electors to Congress. He believes Congress should fight that out, essentially defying the Constitution. And I just think it speaks to the moment of what he's in. And the question was, does it give you any pause how Trump has treated Mike Pence, a lifelong conservative, and didn't even call Mike Pence that day, when he was up there? And Mike Pence has said that Donald Trump put his life in danger, also his family who was with him. So he's made that clear.

So, if you've got emails, if you've got discussions, if you've got communications with Hope Hicks, as the connecting dot, between the campaign and the fallout of Access Hollywood, to where we are now, that's when they're most useful.
