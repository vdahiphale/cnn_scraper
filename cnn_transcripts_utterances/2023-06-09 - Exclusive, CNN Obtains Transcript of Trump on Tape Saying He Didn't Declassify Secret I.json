      "sentences": "Well, we know that there is a scramble right now to make sure that this building, the people within it and the former president himself will all be safe and secure whenever this court appearance happens on Tuesday.There was this meeting in Miami that law enforcement took part in and we understand that there also has been a threat assessment done of this federal courthouse building and that there is no credible threat at this time, but there are additional resources being sent here by the Justice Department and others, the Secret Service also has to make preparations to be protecting the former president, Donald Trump, who they get to protect and will continue to protect because he served as president of the United States. Again, he's obviously running for office But even with his appearance scheduled for Tuesday, that kicks off quite a long process of heading to trial when something has been charged. So, there is the indictment, right? That is what we learned about yesterday. We are waiting to see exactly what that indictment says, see the paperwork, when it will be unsealed. And then there is this arraignment where Donald Trump is expected to come into court and plead not guilty. He also will discuss the terms of his release, very likely will be not to be held in any custody pending his trial. He would very likely be able to move freely because of the type of case this is. And then there is a long time, there is a period of time where everyone prepares for trial, where the Justice Department turns over all of the evidence that they have collected to the defense team that is called discovery. There are also all kinds of legal arguments that happen that set the parameters for the trial, exactly what evidence can come in, what sort of law needs to be applied there, that all takes place, and then the trial itself happens. And when the trial happens, that is going to be a huge question coming up here, because Donald Trump is running for president. A lot of times, it takes a full year or more to go from charging a case to a trial. And so there is always the possibility this trial could come after or in the heat of the election next year. And so that is a really, really significant thing. Timing is everything in a lot of these cases. And then, of course, once there is a trial, he may either be acquitted, there could be a mistrial, and if he were to be convicted, that is when appeals typically would take place. But everything now is that motion and that movement towards this hearing next Tuesday where Donald Trump will appear in person, and then the motion and movement towards the trial itself.",

      "sentences": "It is. It is a remarkable report, Sara. And so far, I haven't heard direct reaction to that. But I do know after CNN has been covering this audio transcript for some time now, it's something that his team is very concerned about. And, really, it's because it undercuts the former president's entire argument that he can just declassify documents when he took them with it. It shows that the intent was there potentially, that he knew that he was taking classified documents and that he still had classified documents in his possession after leaving the White House.Now, I have spoken with many of Trump's aides who are with him, huddling right now very nearby, behind me in Bedminster, at his golf club here in New Jersey. And they really say that they're still formulating what the response will be. What they're trying to portray is that they're feeling emboldened by this, that they think it could give him a short-term political boost. Of course, that's what they're saying, and I think that's the message that they want to put out there. But we also know from other people I've spoken with that they do have serious reservations about this as well and what an indictment could mean, particularly federal charges for his re-election campaign. They did point to the Manhattan district attorney indictment earlier this year, where they did see some sort of political boost from that in the immediate term, and they're hoping that they'll have that now. I do know that in the last 48 hours, Donald Trump and his team have been reaching out to their allies on Capitol Hill and other conservatives who support him, trying to get them to defend him and push back against this indictment. Even before it came, they were circulating talking points that they wanted them to use and span the airwaves defending Donald Trump. And so that's really, I think, the mood right now. I'll also just add that when the first indictment came earlier this year and now this federal indictment, even with all the bravado that Donald Trump is putting out, he does not want to be indicted. He does not want this to be a stain on his record. And there definitely are concerns here. And so I think that they're all building now toward this Tuesday appearance in Miami, and we're going to see how they continue to message on this. And just one other thing quickly, Sara, I'll add, is we have heard that he may make public remarks soon. We saw him make public remarks after that first indictment earlier this year when he was in Mar-a- Lago. We're still waiting to hear more details on if that will happen, but stay tuned for that. We're trying to get more details.",

They've got a tape in the New York District Attorney's Office that corroborates Michael Cohen. They've got a couple tapes in the Georgia case that are going to make him the star witness in that case.

I mean, I think Bill Barr said it succinctly when he said the DOJ has been very careful at the way they've handled this case and that this is a unique case and that, again, quoting Bill Barr, saying they offered to -- they asked for the documents back, they asked for the documents. And according to Bill Barr, what he said, he's like all they did was jerk around the Justice Department. And when that happens, that's when you open the door to all these other problems, which are really just lie at former President Trump's feet.",

I mean, he makes statements that just cannot be explained away. What this also does is -- one key piece of this prosecution is going to be proving Donald Trump's motive as to why he kept the documents, why he stole the documents and why he obstructed the Department of Justice from getting them.Well, here's one motive proven right now that he was using them for political purposes to go after people that were attacking him. Here, he's going after General Milley, who basically said that, towards the end of the term, he was concerned that Donald Trump might be invading Iran, and he was keeping his eyes on him very closely. Now, what does Donald Trump do? He uses a classified document that was basically something that the Defense Department does on probably any country that we have concerns about, particularly Iran, where they have a plan in place in case they have to invade. So, now, Donald Trump is trying to use that to show, well, it wasn't me that wanted to invade Iran, it was General Milley. And so using national security information for that purpose is absolutely forboden. And the real question is, is there more to this motive? Is motive going to be spelled out in the indictment that we see in a couple of days? The information that was subpoenaed from the Trump Organization on seven different countries, including Saudi Arabia, is going to be interesting to see if they can show a financial motive as to why he did this.",
