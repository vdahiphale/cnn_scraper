      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, the latest flash point between Russiaand Ukraine, Patriot missiles. Why this particular piece of U.S. hardware could be a game-changer on the battlefield. Then, new episodes from the Harry and Meghan series drop on Netflix. We'll unpack the accusations with our royal correspondent. Plus strikes are bringing parts of the U.K. to a standstill, the latest workers to walk out, nurses. I've spoken to some of them to try and understand why they're striking for the first time in 100 years of the National Health Service history. But before we get to all of that, let's have a quick check though of the Dow Jones, you can see there, it's off by 2, just more than 2.5 percent, nearly 900 points or so this hour. We've seen weak consumer spending numbers, followed by a gloomy outlook, if you remember this time yesterday from the Federal Reserve chief that obviously cut half a percentage point or so. We are keeping a hike of -- half a percentage point, we are keeping a close eye, of course, on this story. Markets trying to understand what the Fed said and really what we can expect, come 2023. Of course, we're getting an update from CNN business editor-in-chief, Richard Quest in about 30 minutes or so. But of course, we'll keep an eye on the stock markets for you this hour. I want to go to the Ukraine and Russia, because Russia is giving a stark warning to the White House. Its embassy in Washington is saying, if the U.S. provides Patriot missiles to Ukraine, there will be unpredictable consequences. Now, Russia's foreign ministry spokesman says, the systems would become legitimate military targets and would push the U.S. closer to the conflict. The White House has not yet announced that it is delivering the defense systems to Ukraine. Kyiv has been pleading for the systems, if you remember, to help fight off Russian air attacks on energy infrastructure and other civilian targets. Earlier, Ukraine's foreign minister spoke to CNN, a scoffed, really, at the Russian threats. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Large portions of that city have been reduced to rubble, and then Ukrainians have been launching shells and rockets at a pace the Russians claim, it's the worst attack on Donetsk they've seen since 2014. There is video that is emerging on social media, there are reports from Russian- backed officials in Donetsk, claiming that essentially the civilian targets are being hit. They showed an intersection, a main intersection that was on fire. They showed residential and commercial buildings that were -- that were hit. They showed a cathedral that was hit. And so, the Ukrainians are lobbying the kind of attacks that Russians are saying are attacks on civilians, just as the Russians have been relentlessly attacking civilian targets on the frontlines In the east and also to the south, particularly Kherson. As you know, Isa, where just constant Russian bombardment has been taking lives and is essentially disconnected that entire southern city from its electrical grid and its people there are basically, with these plunging temperatures, just in the dark and in the cold as we speak.",

Supporters of former president, Pedro Castillo, are demanding his release and early elections, as well as the resignation of Peru's new president. Castillo, if you remember, was impeached and arrested last week after he tried to dissolve Congress. Today, the supreme court is considering whether to extend his detention, while congress is discussing a possible date for new elections. Rafael Romo is following all the developments for us from CNN Center in Atlanta and joins me now. Rafael, great to see you. Let's talk about the state of emergency first. Is that going to make any difference? Because it's not just about Castillo here, is it? It's much bigger than this now. RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SR. LATIN AFFAIRS EDITOR:  Yes, that's definitely true, Isa. This is the hope of the new president, Dina Boluarte, who is doing everything she can to try to bring the situation under control because it has been chaotic for the last week or so. And, Isa, a hearing to determine whether former president Castillo remains behind bars for 18 months started earlier today but was adjourned and it is now scheduled to resume at 5:00 pm local time. It's been more than one week since he was impeached and arrested. And the country remains in turmoil, even after the government declared Wednesday a state of emergency. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROMO (voice-over):  As it has been the case for more than a week in Peru, police once again clashed with protesters. This violent protest in Cuzco mirrors what has happened across the South American country, including in Lima, the capital. Defense minister Alberto Otarola declared a state of emergency Wednesday that would be in effect for 30 days. He said, the national police and armed forces are responding to acts of vandalism, violence and seizure of roads. Peru's national police has said earlier that highways in at least four regions across the country had been blocked by protesters, demanding the immediate return to power of former president, Pedro Castillo. As you may remember, Castillo was impeached and arrested on December 7th after he announced plans to dissolve congress and install an emergency government. He was apparently trying to get ahead of a congressional vote on his impeachment. Castillo is accused of conspiracy and rebellion. He denies those allegations. Dina Boluarte, who was his vice president and succeeded him after his impeachment, said Wednesday, that it is technically possible to call for new elections by the end of next year, even though Peruvians are not scheduled to go to the polls until 2026. National police were deployed to Lima's international airport, which, according to a spokeswoman, is operating normally. However, some regional airports remain closed. This means that many international tourists are stuck without a connecting flight to the capital and must stay in Peru for now. Train service between Machu Picchu and Cuzco was disrupted due to deadly protests, leaving dozens of tourists stranded at the Inca citadel. A political crisis has gripped Peru for years. Boluarte, who took over after the ousting of Pedro Castillo, is Peru's sixth president in less than five years. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The tensions have been high there since June of 2020, when one of these skirmishes turned deadly, with at least 20 soldiers killed from the Indian side and at least four soldiers killed from the Chinese side. And the relations have deteriorated ever since then between Beijing and Delhi.

Residents in this community are already starting to salvage what they can. You can hear the sound of hammers and drills behind me here, as they start to rebuild. They are expecting the governor to come tour through here, tour the damage and devastation. But part of what really caught residents here off-guard is just how rare this large of an outbreak of tornado is, tornadoes are for this time of year. You know, they certainly feel as though they can't catch a break, Isa. They've gone through hurricane Ida with some telling me they have just finished repairing their shingles and the roofing from that storm, only to have their homes destroyed again by this one. Isa.",

Others say that they've been toldthey are going to wait between two and three weeks before their power is restored. And just really quick, briefly on that note about this happening before Christmas, yesterday I interviewed a 7 year old child. You know, he so believes in Santa Claus and he was worried that Santa wasn't going to be able to find his home to deliver presents. You know, so the fixation here on Christmas being around the corner and this happening is not lost on the residents here, who, as you mentioned, are already starting to rebuild.",
