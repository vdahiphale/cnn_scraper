      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world and to everyone streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church. Just ahead.Vladimir Putin extends his rule over Russia for another six years, claiming a landslide victory in an election where the results were always a foregone conclusion. Ceasefire and hostage negotiations are set to get underway in Qatar in the hours ahead, but Israel's prime minister is already calling Hamas's demands outlandish. And people in Haiti are trying to escape the rampant gang violence. We'll take you to a school transformed into a refugee camp. Good to have you with us. Well, to the surprise of absolutely no one, Russian President Vladimir Putin is poised to cement his grip on power with a fifth term, after the country wrapped up its three-day presidential election. With no genuine opponent running against him, the outcome was never in doubt. So far, preliminary results show him with a commanding lead of almost 90 percent. A win means he will stay in office until at least 2030, continuing as Russia's longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. In a post-election appearance, Putin called for national unity, but some Russians made their opposition of Putin clear during voting, with sporadic acts of defiance, which included setting fires at polling stations and the use of Molotov cocktails. Russia's election came a month after the death of Alexei Navalny, who Putin addressed by name in wide-ranging remarks after the vote ended on Sunday. CNN's Matthew Chance has been following all the developments from Moscow.",

Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translation):  A few days before Mr. Navalny passed away, some colleagues told me that there is an idea to exchange Mr. Navalny for some people who are in prison in Western countries. Maybe you believe me, maybe you don't. The person who spoke to me had not finished his sentence yet, when I said I agree. But unfortunately, what happened, happened. There was only one condition, for him not to come back. Let him sit there. Well, such things happen. There's nothing you can do about it. That's life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And he lashed out at criticism by taking a swing at the U.S. political system, suggesting that court cases involving presumptive Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump were politically motivated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN (through translation):  Can it be considered democratic to use administrative resources to attack one of the candidates for president of the United States, including through the courts? The use of administrative resources, the judicial system, this has become simply ridiculous and a disgrace in front of the whole world for the United States and for your so-called democratic system, in quotes.

It's notable that the numbers that we have so far are obviously not quite complete just yet. But in terms of the Putin landslide, that looks like it's bigger in those occupied regions of Ukraine than in the actually internationally recognized borders of Russia, and so is the turnout.But obviously, reports have been surfacing that these elections are taking place under a climate of coercion, potentially also intimidation, soldiers seen in videos. We can see even in Russia's most recent conquest, military conquest, of the town of Avdiivka in Donetsk, voting there, taking place under a very clear military presence. So serious questions. The U.N. has made it very clear that holding elections in these occupied territories violates international law. Ukraine has made it very clear that it violates their laws as well. And this is what Russia has done in the past. We have the template, of course, with Crimea. They take these military conquests and move very quickly to bring in political processes to make them, in their eyes, sort of permanent and irreversible. So, I think this is something very concerning for Ukraine and a sign of what more Putin means in terms of this war, Rosemary.",

He is, however, sending a delegation here to Doha to continue negotiations for a ceasefire.Now, we know that the Mossad director, David Barnea, will be here, we believe, to have talks on Monday, according to a diplomat familiar with those talks, with Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Now, there were meetings on Sunday in Israel, there was a war cabinet meeting, where they decided the parameters of how far that mediation could go and what could be agreed to. We've heard from a Hamas senior leader saying that they believe that the proposal they have come up with is logical and that the ball is now in Israel's court. Now, we know last Thursday Hamas said that their proposal was they wanted between 700 and 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to be released, in return for all female prisoners, including IDF soldiers, and also potentially the elderly, the weak, or the wounded hostages, assumed to be around 40, although there's no definitive figure on that at this point. The sticking point comes after this phase one when Hamas has proposed that Israel fully pull out of Gaza militarily, and also there is a permanent ceasefire. We have heard consistently from Israel that that is not what they want to do, that even if there is a temporary ceasefire, they are still determined to launch this offensive in Rafah, which we heard once again on Sunday from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that that offensive would take in all a matter of weeks. Back on Friday of last week, he approved the military and the evacuation plan for some 1.5 million Palestinian sheltering in Rafah, in the south of Gaza, although there's no timeframe for when it will happen. There is huge resistance to this plan, including from the main ally, the United States.

Number one, the estrangement of the mainstream Democratic Party, as evidenced by Chuck Schumer, the highest elected Jewish official in the country and the first Jewish majority leader.His estrangement with the policies of the Netanyahu government, particularly the two extremist ministers. And number two, it reflects, given the Republican reaction to the speech, the degree to which the U.S.'s relationship, like so much, so many other issues in America, part of the argue culture in which we now live, has become a partisan and polarizing issue. And for anyone who is interested in a healthy and resilient U.S.- Israeli relationship, both of those indications are not good. I think the president's frustrations are mounting.

I must say, though, that Mr. Netanyahu is not alone here when it comes to wanting to continue Israel's ground campaign against the four remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah. I think the large majority of the Israeli public, including Benny Gantz, perhaps the putative successor to Mr. Netanyahu, is also in favor of that campaign. So, that's a tough issue on which the administration, should it choose, is going to take on more than Mr. Netanyahu. It's going to take on, I think, the vast majority of Israelis.

The growing Russian military presence in Niger is at the heart of this dispute between the U.S. and Niger.U.S. officials are telling CNN that they had a tense military junta leadership in Niamey, the capital of new share. And especially the status of what is called Air Base 101, and if that would be ceded over to the Russians. The U.S. operates two bases in Niger, Air Base 101, and the larger Air Base 201 in Central Niger. It's one of the largest drone bases in the world. It's where the U.S. spent $100 million to build it. That's not part of this contingent, but Air Base 101 is where this major issue appears to be. Back in January, the Russian defense ministry announced that it was expanding its military ties with Niger and the other major issue here is that the us approach to dealing with the military junta leadership has always been that we're open to cooperating with you as long as you commit to return to civilian rule. The Russians don't do that. Secondly, the Russians can sell weapons and other equipment to Niger much faster to tackle the terrorism issue that they're facing. And they don't have the same restrictions about human rights or a returned to civilian rule in the country. That is the backdrop for this ongoing dispute and why suddenly after these tense meetings led by General Michael Langley commands the U.S. Africa Command, as well as Molly Phee, the U.S. assistant secretary for African affairs and other officials, this surprise decision was announced on Saturday. General Michael Langley warned Congress earlier this month that Russia is trying to take over the entire Sahel, this region. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MICHAEL LANGLEY, COMMANDER OF U.S. AFRICA COMMAND:  I would say the Russian federations narrative drowned out the U.S. governments in the past years, they were accelerant. The Russian federation, not just through Wagner, stoked a lot of the instability across the Sahel. They did this through misinformation, disinformation campaigns. So I see or how we work could not doubled down on our efforts is through our own information campaign, but matched with our assurance efforts. So, the U.S. believes that Russia is stalking instability across this wider region in Sahel. And also, taking advantage of that to profit off the natural resources, especially gold mines in Niger. On the other hand, the Niger military junta leader felt that they were getting lectured by the United States even after it's cancelled all military and foreign cooperation after the U.S. designated this as a coup. So why would you lecture us when you're not supporting us in any way? That's why in that announcement of state TV, these spokesperson for the military junta said that the U.S. had been condescending to them and threatening consequences without offering them anything in return. So in the absence of that, they see Russia's a better partner, and that's the background for this current dispute. It's not clear if now the military junta leadership initiative will force U.S. troops to leave immediately because once the deal is off, then that naturally follows. That should the next step, but they haven't said anything beyond that, Rosemary.",
