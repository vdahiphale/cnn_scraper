He's one of 37 grandkids and a large, well known, successful Italian American family from the Baltimore area.They own and run the Turf Valley Resort, which is 1,000 acre resort with two golf courses and a hotel. They also run another facility called the Hayes Field. They own a conservative radio station. And also assisted living facilities. And so that enabled him to attend the Gilman School. It's an all-boys school here in Baltimore that is one of, if not the most prestigious, it's one of the most prestigious private schools in this area. And he wasn't just a student there, he excelled. He was a valedictorian.",

Obviously, he was very popular and successful. So -- but one of the angles that we're trying to track down though, is that there was -- there did seem to be in the past, a few months or so, some sort of a break and people say that he sort of went off the grid. He wasn't communicating. We even found out that his mother contacted police in San Francisco filing a missing persons report, trying to track him down.
