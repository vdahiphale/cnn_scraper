Let's start the show.First of all, okay, first of all, we lost an icon this week, Frankie Beverly died, and his passing has just not yet gotten the coverage it deserves. It just has not been covered the way it should be. That song you hear there before I let go is an anthem for so many people. It recalls good memories and family reunions and happy feelings, if you will, right? So stay with me. Call your people. We're going to do it right for Frankie later this morning. All right. We have to start this morning, though, with this trash about eating cats and dogs. By now you've heard about the racist claim about Haitian migrants eating pets. And now there are the memes, of course, and the TikTok videos of the cats and the dogs looking sad or scared. It's viral. But maybe what you have not seen are the ways that anti-immigrant lives are impacting real people's lives. The Haitian Times spoke to a community activist in Springfield, Ohio. They were told that, \"People are very afraid for their lives.\" \"Many families are starting to think of leaving Springfield, and some kids are not even going to school because of fear of being attacked.\" On Friday, schools in Springfield were evacuated for the second day in a row. There was a bomb threat against schools and City Hall on Thursday. Here's the mayor of Springfield, he says they need help, not hate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And we have to reiterate the point that while the President has as a centerpiece of his campaign, migrants who are undocumented in the country, these people that he is criticizing are very much documented in Springfield, Ohio. I wonder what is the impact on Haitian American communities, because we talked a little bit about Alabama outside of Ohio, outside of Springfield, and your concern for what is we're seeing popping up across the country?CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK: Well, my biggest concern is that when people now see Haitian people, they're assuming that everyone's illegal. They're assuming that, you know, we have people voting illegally and you are illegal just because we are Haitian, not knowing that we actually have papers. And so we're feeling the combativeness, we're feeling the death threats. We're feeling people calling them. I'm hearing that from people all across the country is that now they're under attack. And this is not the first time that the Haitian community was under attack, as I mentioned, but we feel like we've dispelled all of these rumors about, you know, eating animals or even committing crimes. The truth is, Haitian people do not commit crimes or have not been committing crimes when they came to the United States, legally, especially. And so it's extremely detrimental what he's doing. He's actually bringing us back, and he's, you know, bringing those people who already had racist sentiments. He's restoring those stereotypes and it really does hurt everyone involved, because our children now at risk going to school.",

Because it seems this narrative, this fictitious narrative that the former president is putting out and JD Vance is putting out, it doesn't seem to have anyone agreeing with it. We've seen business people who actually employ the Haitian migrants who are happy that they're there helping the economy. We've even heard a father step out to say, please stop using my son's name to perpetuate this lie about Haitian people committing crimes. And so we need to be present, to be there to make sure we're hearing from the right people. It's so unfortunate that a former president will make up these lies and disrupt a community that is trying to get on its feet. This is not the America we know and love. We're all here to pitch in and help every community and sprinkles the community that we do want to help.

You know, we can't forget and we can't take him seriously. We saw what happened on January 6 with him doubling down on it. We see more death threats. Him actually speaking about this more and more, we see that it's actually manifesting into violence. And so as right and now we're looking at the situation, how he keeps doubling down. I do believe this is what he's going to try to do going into the election. This is a scare tactic that he's going to keep on amplifying so he can try to scare people into voting for him. And so as the scaring amplifies, I do believe more people will be violent, and that's why we have to stop this now, and that's why we have to take a stand for our country and say we're not going to tolerate someone to be fearmongering and trying to get people to attack cities that actually need the help.",

Marcellus Williams was convicted in the 1998 murder of Felicia Gail. The office of the prosecutor that handled the case asked the court to throw the conviction out because overwhelming evidence showed Williams's trial was unfair. Well, this week, a judge rejected that. He wrote, \"There is no basisfor a court to find that Williams is innocent, and no court has made such a finding. Williams is guilty of first degree murder and has been sentenced to death.\" Judge Glenda Hatchett is with us. She's the host of The Verdict with Judge Hatchett. Tthank you for being with me. So the issue here, and we've talked about this several times now, is that the prosecutor's office. I want people to remember, this is the prosecutor's office. They say that the weapon here was mishandled. They had DNA tests and found other DNA turned out to be some from the detective, some from the prosecutor. At the time of the case, they submitted that or they were going to submit it. And unfortunately for Mr. Williams, the judge said, that's not enough. We're moving forward. Is he right here? JUDGE GLENDA HATCHETT, HOST, \"THE VERDICT WITH JUDGE HATCHETT: I don't think he's right. I think there's enough here Victor that the judge could have basically said that it was not appropriate to go forward with the execution. We're talking about execution, as you know, in 10 days. I do not think that's going to happen, but let's go back to what the judge said. He said that there was not enough evidence to overturn and that the conviction for murder should stand. When you have a prosecutor, let's stress this. A prosecutor comes in. This motion was filed back in January. They have been trying to get this resolved for all of these months to say this man should not be executed. There was enough evidence from the DNA on the scene to perhaps exclude him. And if that is the case, why would you then go forward with the execution? We also know now that the Alford plea is off the table.
