Just a few days ago, we brought you that just yesterday, and they're taking a series of towns and villages right along the way. And they're advancing in several other areas as well. Meanwhile, Antony Blinken made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital today. And this comes after the U.S., of course, approved a massive military assistance package to Ukraine that had, if you remember, being blocked for months on end by Republican lawmakers. Now, the U.S. Secretary of State met with President Zelenskyy, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and he reaffirmed America's support. Have a little -- have a listen to this little clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We can clearly see that on all frontlines including that new one, that new assault that you were just speaking about in the northeast of the country, the Russians still are advancing, but certainly at a much slower pace. For instance, today, than they did yesterday, at least according to the Ukrainians, and the Russians are sort of acknowledging that as well. Now, listening to Antony Blinken today, he said that some of the aid has already hit the frontlines and a lot more is set to arrive. Essentially, what the U.S. did when it got that aid package through is, it tried to get some of that military aid, especially ammunition to the Ukrainians as fast as possible, because that's been their biggest issue of big lack of an ammunition -- rocket artillery ammunition, but then also regular 155 millimeter artillery ammunition has been a big deal and a big problem for the Ukrainians. In fact, pretty much over the past seven months that I've been going to Ukraine on every frontline, the Ukrainians have been speaking about being starved of artillery shells, so that's certainly something that can make a difference fairly quickly, but at the same time, of course, the Ukrainians are badly outnumbered because the Russians certainly have gotten a lot of people into military service. And a lot of that aid simply hasn't reached the frontline yet, because it is logistically, of course, also a challenge as well.",

Right now,families in central Gaza are searching for loved ones in the rubble. According to local hospital officials, dozens have been killed including nine children. Meanwhile, U.S. officials tell CNN that Israel now has enough troops around Rafah to launch a full-scale incursion. This despite U.S. as well as international pressure, of course, not to go ahead with such an operation. Jeremy Diamond is following the story for us and he joins us now live from Jerusalem. And Jeremy, do we know then at this stage when this full-scale incursion will take place, and critically, what preparations are being made for the million-plus people evacuating? What are you hearing?",

I mean, U.S. officials have said that Israeli forces have nowamassed enough troops, enough material to be able to carry out a full-scale ground invasion of Rafah should they choose to do so. But we don't have a sense of when or if that will actually come. What we have heard, of course, over the course of the last week since President Biden made that threat regarding future U.S. weapons shipments. Should Israel carry out such a full-scale ground invasion has been a lot of bluster, a lot of defiance from Israeli officials, certainly no indication of a course correction, but we also haven't yet seen the plans in motion to be able to carry out that full-scale invasion. What we've also seen is a lack of planning, a lack of information at least, about where the nearly 1.5 million people who were sheltering in Rafah should go in the event of such an invasion. The Israeli military has pointed to the expanded humanitarian zone at Al-Mawasi. But as we've seen over the course of the last week, nearly half-a-million people have already fled Rafah, heading for that area and other parts of north of Rafah in Gaza. And what they have found is a total lack of sufficient and adequate infrastructure, sewage infrastructure, electricity, water, humanitarian aid groups having trouble bringing enough aid in to reach those parts, those areas where people are setting up makeshift shelters and tents. And the United States is also saying that they have yet to see a credible and competent plan by the Israeli government for how exactly they will evacuate that large number of people. So, certainly concerns escalating over exactly how this could happen. And again, so far, we don't have a sense of timing from the Israeli government or when they plan to move forward.",

This new bill is called the Israel Security Assistance Support Act. It prohibits the Biden administration from reversing, cancelling, or indeed pausing military aid to Israel.

Appreciate it.Now, Israel's Rafah operation has set back negotiations for a hostage release and Gaza ceasefire, according to Qatar's Prime Minister. Qatar is, as you know, and has been, of course, a key mediator between Israel as well as Hamas. But the Prime Minister warned, talks are almost at a stalemate over a, \"Fundamental difference on stopping the war in Gaza.\" This would come as a major blow, of course, to the hundreds of Israeli family members still hoping for a breakthrough. Almost 100 hostages are thought to still be alive inside Gaza. One of those people still in captivity is Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin. He was kidnapped on October the 7th and has been in Gaza ever since. Just a few weeks ago, Hamas released a video of Hersh, the first proof that he survived being badly wounded during his capture. I want to bring in his parents now, Jon Polin and Rachel Goldberg-Polin. They're joining me now from Jerusalem. Rachel and Jon, really appreciate you taking the time to speak to us here on the show. As you probably have heard in the last, kind of, 24 hours, we have heard from President Biden, who says he's still hopeful that a deal, of course, can be reached to bring the hostages on your son, Hersh, home, and to -- as well to bring a pause to the fighting. But by all the indications, it does seem that the negotiations have stalled. And I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you. Just your reaction, first of all, to those negotiations being at a pause for now. RACHEL GOLDBERG-POLIN, MOTHER OF AMERICAN-ISRAELI HOSTAGE HERSH GOLDBERG- POLIN: Well, obviously, as parents, we are deeply concerned. And as all the hostage families are, we -- every time there's a stalling in the negotiations, we feel tremendous frustration. We really feel that there should not be a halt to negotiations ever. That those people in that room should actually be locked in that room until they can come up with a solution. And if they feel helpless and frustrated and trapped, I would say, I have a feeling that the 132 hostages who have been held for 221 days feel helpless, frustrated and trapped. And so, I think you have to stay in that room until you have a solution.",

All else is not for us to decide. Just explain a bit more on what you mean by that -- by those comments. Is Prime Minister Netanyahu and others playing politics with the lives of hostages, with the lives of your son? JON POLIN, FATHER OF AMERICAN-ISRAELI HOSTAGE HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN: Look, unfortunately, it has become politicized, not only in Israel but globally. And it -- the proof is, it's 221 days in, and the hostages are still sitting there. So, we could talk a lot about who's blaming whom and who's at fault, both domestically and globally, but there's a fact. It's day 221 and 132 hostages remain in captivity. Something is wrong with that picture. We don't want to be in the middle of the politics. We don't want to be in the middle of the blame. We just want to end the suffering for people on all sides and get these 132 hostages back home to their loved ones. Many are still believed to be alive. Some, unfortunately, are known to be dead. They all need to come home. The living to be rehabilitated. The nonliving to be given proper burial. Now is the time.",

GOLDBERG-POLIN: I mean, it was a huge, emotional, indescribable moment for us after half a year. When so many people did not believe that Hersh had survived, having his arm amputated, which we had, you know, CNN was the one -- was the network that shared that video with us. And so, that was our last image of him on October 7th, you know, getting onto that pickup truck with his arm missing, covered in blood, clearly in distress.

It is day 17 of the trial. The prosecution's star witness, Cohen, facing that cross-examination. it starts off with some blistering fire. Earlier, under direct examination by the prosecution, Cohen described a moment of truth with his family, who asked him point blank in 2018 why he remained loyal to Trump? It was then Cohen testified he decided he would, \"Not lie for President Trump anymore.\" Also, on Tuesday an appeals court did reject Trump's challenge to the gag order issued by Judge Juan Merchan in this case which prevents him from publicly attacking witnesses. For more on where this stand, let's bring in Misty Marris, she's a defense and trial attorney. She joins us now from New York. Misty, let me get -- begin with where we stand because part of the news this morning is that Cohen will be the prosecution's last witness. He's now being cross-examined by the defense, and that the defense will not call any witnesses, which means we could be done perhaps with testimony by the end of this week and then into closing arguments and deliberations next week.

The defense does not have to say anything. So, it's always a strategy call, and oftentimes the defense will wait until the prosecutors are done or close to wrapping up their case to make that determination. But Jim, we are really -- we're at the end of this thing. The Trump team said that they're going to cross-examine Michael Cohen today, cross-examine Michael Cohen Thursday, court is dark on Friday.

You can believe none, some or all. So, jurors have a lot of discretion in assessing that credibility. So, prosecutors needed to get ahead of it. They needed to control the narrative about all of Michael Cohen's very, very obvious credibility issues. There's a -- just a timeline of changes in his story at admission.
