For Iran's part, we've had confirmation from state media that there were attacks against what it describes as military centers in three Iranian provinces. That's Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam provinces. No reports of any casualties yet, neither from the Israeli side nor from the Iranian side. It's around 11:30 in the morning in Tehran right now. We haven't seen any of the imagery that is so prevalent in Gaza and in Lebanon from other Israeli airstrikes in densely populated areas. So we haven't gotten any indication from the Iranian government that civilians were impacted in this. In fact, we've gotten reports from residents on the ground speaking to CNN and from state media that life in Tehran right now feels very much like normal, that traffic is moving around and that stores are open right now. Let's take a listen to what one Tehran resident has to say about what it was like being in the city as anti aircraft fire lit up the skies in the predawn hours.

And we have been -- the reaction seen from the Ukrainian side have been downplaying this attack as well as mocking, get on the social media as well as the state media. But on the other side, the narrative we are hearing from the Israeli side, they want portray it as a success. And this could in some ways indicate that maybe we should be or we can be moving toward a deescalation. And you know, this was expected to be a massive strike against Iran, to be inclusive of, in the first days, of Iranian nuclear facilities or energy infrastructure. But it ended up to be limited to some number of military sites. And the Iranian side is also, is questioning the efficiency of those attacks. And maybe for some short time, we might be able to avoid a full-scale war in the region. However, the trajectory somehow remains escalatory. And yet there is the risk of an exchange of fire in future, specifically that we are approaching the presidential election in the United States and by the time that I think we have an official president in White House, I think there are the chances of a renewed conflict between the two sides.

One argument would say that Iran's response to Israel would be falling into the trap of Benjamin Netanyahu because he wants to drag in the United States in a regional war.And the other argument was that no response would in fact be falling in another trap that would invite present Israeli facts against Iran. In the course of the past few weeks, we have been seeing that a kind of consensus or a unity iman (ph), elites in the country they need to do something against Israel if they want to stop that process. And if they want to end this cycle of actions or reactions of that violence between the two sides, the have to somehow revive that deterrence against Israel. And that's why we saw Iran attacking against Israel in self-defense in October 1st. And but with the attack and operation happening this early morning, which seemed to be weaker than expected or more limited than they expected in Iran, maybe this could be a way out of this escalation, at least for a short time, to see that. How that deterrence line will be moving toward. And I think Iran will react to this. But according to the quality of the Israeli operation and the discussions may being made today in Tehran, maybe that reaction could be direct or indirect in order to avoid that full scale war.
