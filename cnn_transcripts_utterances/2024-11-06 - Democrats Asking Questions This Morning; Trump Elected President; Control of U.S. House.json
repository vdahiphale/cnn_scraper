And that's on the record. And he knows that. And that's very clear. But I think, you know, we live in a democracy. The people have spoken. And not it's - it's - our - we have two obligations. Number one, to think through thoroughly, why did people not hear the Democratic message, and how do we reach out to people who were not with us in this campaign and need it - and we - who we need it. And how do we bring them - work over the next four years to bring them into the fold and to work together and to revision where we're - where we're headed. What's our policies and what are also our messaging. That's part of it. And the other part is to protect our democracy in the meantime. You know, we have a - now a president-elect who's said that on day one he's going to use the government to go after his enemies. That he's already amassing a list of both individuals and non-governmental organizations that he's going to hand to the IRS on day one and have investigations opened up, not because they've done anything wrong, but because he - they disagreed with him. That he's going to use the military to go after the American people, and he's going to target Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. And this is very, very dangerous for all of us, as Americans.",

I was very good at opening mail and answering phones. But what I can tell you is that they are a very, very close family and it has got to be eating them up inside right now to see Bobby Kennedy Jr. out there now going to take over the health care or was led to believe, you know, control of the health care industry, when his family has spent so much time trying to put together what they thought was the right approach to health care.

And I think that's a reflection of the nature of people in families and people in close- knit families, but also people in families that have political disagreements.But I also think it's true, and I think she brought up a really important part about, what does this look like in the actual administration? And I think that's something that we actually have to talk about. Certainly, it's a question not just that Democrats are asking this morning, but that most of America is asking this morning. What does a Trump administration look like? What does, you know, Robert F, Kennedy Jr. as health czar, what does that actually mean for the government? And the first thing that I would point out is that Trump, unlike 2016, actually has a transition team this time around. This transition team is more - far more organized, they're far more disciplined, and they're far more loyal, and they're far more partisan. So, I would be concerned about that. The second thing that I would be really concerned about is not all of the other promises that Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, but the one specifically about getting rid of non- political civil servants within the government. And that is the one that we should really be paying attention to, because it is those civil servants and those non-political appointees who actually make the government run and function and prevent against corruption, greed, and scandal. So, we should be really asking these questions, but we should also be laying out what that actually looks like. [08:3501]",

I'm proud of the way that she served admirably as vice president. They ran a race with no gaffes, no embarrassments, in a short period of time, and she's an amazing woman. And if my daughter could grow up and be half the woman Kamala Harris is, my daughter's life will be a success. So, let me throw that out there, first. She meant so much to so many people.The second thing is, this is a concession speech, which is probably one of her last, if not her last hurrah on this major stage and platform. This is about a vision that you wanted for the future, but you didn't win. And that happens in politics. In politics you have winners and losers in democracy, all right. That's the way this thing works. And the American public, 81 million people came out and said that Donald Trump is who they want for the next four years and only 66 million said they wanted you. That's all - is that surprising? No. Is that disappointing? Yes.

You know, does he deport millions of citizen U.S. children? Does he fire U.S. attorneys if they won't - does he send investigators? Does he send the National Guard into blue cities, as he said he would, to just patrol for crime?So, you know, a lot of what he wants to do does not require Congress. His two biggest promises, tariffs and immigration are areas where the president has enormous unilateral authority. So, what does he do?

Chalk it up to heated campaign rhetoric. But it is very important that people understand what she said and the way she ran her campaign is not the way this is going to be. This is America. We had an election. I totally agree with you. But if you - if she needs to do that today. And I really hope she does.",

You'll remember, this is an open seat that the Democrats are hoping to hang on to. Elissa Slotkin, former CIA analyst, has been in the House of Representatives, running against Mike Rogers, who formerly had been in the House of Representatives, and had also worked in law enforcement. Again, 96 percent of the vote in. We know that the Republicans have taken control of the Senate currently with 52 seat, including three pickups. Now, this would not be a pickup for Democrats. This would be them holding on to a seat. But, at this point, Democrats, of course, hoping for any good news that they could get in the Senate. The Michigan race still outstanding, but the alert here is that Elissa Slotkin is leading ever so slightly, again, with just 96 percent of the vote in. John, we'll continue to watch this race and other blue wall states still outstanding, as well.",
