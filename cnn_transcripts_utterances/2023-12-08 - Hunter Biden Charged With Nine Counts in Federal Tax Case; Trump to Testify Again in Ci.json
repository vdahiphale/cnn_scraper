All right, there's a live pictures of the White House were, shortly, it could be the first chance to hear from President Biden since his son was charged with new counts of federal tax evasion, charges that come with a litany of new salacious details. The president is leaving a campaign in Nevada. We are watching to see if he stops to comment on the way to the helicopter. Now, according to federal prosecutors, Hunter Biden, quote, engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in taxes that he owed from 2016 through 2019. Prosecutors alleged that instead he spent hundreds of thousand dollars on drugs, escorts, exotic cars. CNN's Jessica Schneider following this for us this morning. Jessica, what's the latest here?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. This is the second indictment against the president's son just this year. And it's actually these charges now out of California that really do bring much greater peril for Hunter Biden. He could face up to 17 years in prison if convicted on these nine counts. So, this latest indictment, what does it include? It includes failure to file and pay taxes, evasion of a tax assessment, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return. And prosecutors are describing it as Hunter Biden engaging in a four-year scheme to avoid paying at least $1.4 million in federal taxes that they say he owed for a span of several years.Now, this is from the indictment. I'll read it for you. It says, between 2016 and October 15th, 2020, the defendant spent his money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing, and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes. And more specifically, prosecutors are saying that Hunter Biden subverted the payroll and tax withholding process of his company when he withdrew millions of dollars. They say it was all to subsidize his extravagant lifestyle. It included nearly $700,000 in payments to various women, nearly $200,000 in adult entertainment, and about $70,000 in rehab, among other things. So, Hunter Biden's attorney immediately responded, Abbe Lowell, and he said this. He said, based on the facts and the law, if Hunter's last name was anything other than Biden, the charges in Delaware and now in California would not have been brought. Now, President Biden was asked about this indictment, John, and here's what he's saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He was named special counsel in August. Of course, that gives him wide latitude to investigate and prosecute. And, of course, there is that other indictment against Hunter Biden out of Delaware. That stems from his illegal purchase of a handgun back in 2018. So, John, now the president's son will be fighting criminal charges in California, also Delaware, all while his father mounts that re- election campaign and while Republicans continue to call into question Hunter Biden's international business dealings and, of course, their claims so far unsubstantiated that President Biden benefited from his son's business dealings in Ukraine and China. We know that Republicans are moving toward an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, so there is a lot going on with the president and his son just as we're moving into this election year. John?",

That indictment really spared no expense when it comes to really calling out Hunter Biden for the embarrassing things that he spent this money on as opposed to paying his taxes.You'll recall, and as Jessica laid out there, he could have avoided these charges had that a plea deal not fallen through many months ago in Delaware. David Weiss alluded to the fact that these new tax charges were imminent. They are much more serious than the gun charges that he's facing in Delaware. And now he's facing multiple charges, multiple coasts. Abbe Lowell, his defense attorney, you'll note that that statement that he made immediately following this indictment coming down, didn't really defend the conduct, didn't say that he was innocent of the conduct. He just noted that this essentially was a political prosecution, and that were his name, anything other than Biden, they never would have been brought.",

He could have pleaded guilty to simply misdemeanors instead. They bump them up to felonies.But these tax charges are more serious. I don't agree with Abbe Lowell. I think they would have been they would have been prosecuted by any prosecutor for anybody not with the last name Biden given just how egregious the conduct was because it's fraudulent conduct, right? There's difference between misdemeanor tax charges and the charges of this nature that there was really a campaign to hide money so that he didn't have to pay these taxes.",

So, again, that's not fighting the facts of the indictment.Also, Abbe Lowell has a reputation for being a real bulldog. He has represented Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. So, he doesn't discriminate in terms of his clientele. He also sent a letter noting that he had asked prosecutors who brought these charges most recently to sit down with them. They denied that meeting. So, I think he's going to go the route of selective prosecution, vindictive prosecution, things, arguments that we've really seen Trump make in his prosecutions.",

This time, he will be questioned by his own lawyer.So, they will be setting the table of what he wants to talk about in this case, and we will have a lot of latitude in the ground that he'll cover. Now, as you mentioned, his attorney, Alina Habba, saying that she advised him against speaking because of the gag order. She also said he's not afraid and that he will clarify some matters. Now, this gag order is pretty narrow. It just says that Trump can't make any comments about the judge's staff. So, that leads you to think that it's a possibility we might see a bit of a repeat of the last time Trump was on the stand when he turned that witness stand into a campaign event and was criticizing the judge who was sitting just a few feet from him, the New York attorney general, Letitia James, who was in the room, and the case writ large. And at some point, the judge even said to Trump's lawyer, you need to rein your client in or else I will. So, we'll look to see if we learn anything new or see what kind of explanation Trump may give on what the allegations are in this case. This case is about him inflating the value of his properties on financial statements to obtain better rates on loans and insurance. And when Trump testified the last time, he acknowledged that he was familiar with these financial statements, that the banks did rely on them, but he said he relied on the accountants. John?",

And so this is a choice, to try to intimidate and silence through verbal violence, and now, you know, there's always the concern of the threat becoming real, because this is the single worst environment for Jews in terms of our threat level here in the United States since prior to the Tree of Life massacre, and that is frightening.
