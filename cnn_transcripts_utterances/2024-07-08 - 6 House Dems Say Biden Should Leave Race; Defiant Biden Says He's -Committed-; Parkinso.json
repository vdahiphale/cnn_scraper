But once - one starts to develop symptoms, then I think it's reasonable to evaluate whether that really is the beginning of an organic process that would result in significant cognitive decline. And again, there aren't a lot of medical issues that I think would absolutely disqualify somebody from running for president of the United States. But cognitive decline or Alzheimer's disease I think would. I was in Japan a couple of weeks ago and visited Hiroshima. And if you ever want to get a sense for how important the power of the President of the United States is, visit Hiroshima and understand really the magnitude of the power that that office holds.

If the President has a comprehensive mental status exam now, let's put that away. And then there's nothing else to talk about.

It was predictable that people would have curiosity about why this doctor was there, given the issues that were raised by the President's debate performance.

She's not exactly a Biden hater. She spent more time with President Biden than most people have.My own advice to these folks, and they're my friends and I love them. I love this president. He's really a wonderful man. He's done great things for the country. But they've got to be more transparent. They need to listen to Dr. Reiner, you know. Nobody wants their medical records released in public, but you know what? He's got his finger on the button. He's got 5,000 nuclear weapons. He's got a million troops under arms under his command. And Mr. Jefferson said, this is our third president, when a person assumes a public office, they become public property. So I think both candidates, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, should waive doctor-patient confidentiality and send their personal physicians out to, say, Sanjay Gupta, right?

The conversation you just had was so telling. You know, President Biden is playing trying to keep the support of his friends in the Black Caucus. He's trying to keep that support because it's such a foundational element of the Democratic Party and it causes strife for other lawmakers. If the Black Caucus stays with the president, it's hard for many other Democrats to stand up and say, get out. But you have Democrats who are looking at all the data and now a member of the Senate leadership who does not want Republicans to take charge of the Senate, saying, Mr. President, you need to lead the charge. What does she mean by that? You need to change the numbers. That's what she's saying. They want to see the numbers in the polling changed, and they want to see it fast, Anderson, and that's hard to do. The president this morning said it's just the elites in the Democratic Party trying to push him out. But I'm just back from another trip on the road, Anderson. I want to take you to Wisconsin, right? And I want to show you, here's Milwaukee down here. This is blue, the president has to win here. Then you go just north of Milwaukee, you get to Ozaukee County.

That is just not what we saw today. This is a much shorter document. It is much more vague and it really ignores some of the hardline Republican stances that have been in place for decades. For example, abortion. The part of -- on abortion in this platform is just severely watered down. There's no mention of any kind of national abortion ban. Remember, this is something Donald Trump doesn't think is a political winner and has said that he would not sign if it came across his desk. The other interesting part of this platform is no reference to traditional marriage, particularly as between a man and woman. This is not something that Donald Trump believes should be part of the Republican platform. And the last one is something that is a stark difference from what we have seen in decades of the Republican Party, which there is no emphasis on reducing the national debt. Instead, the emphasis is on curbing inflation. Now, the rest of it really sounds exactly like what you would hear at a Trump rally.

This was completely covered in several feet of water, not three hours ago.This storm has had a dubious track record, rewriting history books, and now it made its third landfall the first of the Atlantic 2024 hurricane season here in the United States and slamming into the Texas coastline. Where does it go from here? Well, that's the big question. We know it's impacted Houston in a major way. There was at one point this morning over 400 calls to 911 per hour asking for assistance. There is of course power outages significant here within Harris County where Houston Metropolitan is located. Even the mayor of Houston is saying that he does not have power at his very house as well. So where's the storm going? Well, it's exiting quickly out of Texas and it's got its eyes set on the Arkansas and mid-Mississippi Valley, and it's bringing a tornado threat along with it. There's already been multiple tornado warnings this time across Louisiana, Arkansas and into Missouri. But, you know, when we compare that to the winds that we experienced here in Houston, we had wind gusts in excess of 85 miles per hour. That is a Category 1 hurricane. The last time that happened here in Houston was 2008 from Hurricane Ike. So that's really saying something. And, you know, with the storm creating so much wind damage, it also increased the power outages. So now currently sitting at 2.5 million plus customers without power. And the problem with that is here in Houston, we have a heat advisory going forward over the next couple of days. So without that ability to cool your home down with air conditioning, no electricity, it is going to be a very difficult next couple of days. The good news out of all of this, this is not a Hurricane Harvey. This system is moving quickly and it's got its eyes set on the Canada-U.S. border, and are set to clear by Wednesday.",
