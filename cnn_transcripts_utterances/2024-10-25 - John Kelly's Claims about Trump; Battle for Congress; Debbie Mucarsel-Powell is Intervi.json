There are plenty of other people who worked in the White House at that time who have come out on the record and said John Kelly's not telling the truth about this. You know, and there's something about having a falling out with Donald Trump that tends to make a person literally lose it I think sometimes. And it's not the - it's not the only indication. And I wasn't there. I don't know what happened in that White House. But I can tell you, people I do know have been willing to say that John Kelly's not - not got his facts straight on this. And I - and John Kelly does have an axe to grind with President Trump. We should be clear on that. And President Trump has an axe to grind now with John Kelly. I think the American public knows enough about Donald Trump that this is not going to decide their vote on him. You know, I think one thing about the way people think about Trump as a good metaphor is to say, you can't make the ocean more salty and you can't make the ocean less salty. It's so vast. And the American public's opinion of Donald Trump is based on so many things that they've known for so long. None of these individual spats he has with people changes how they think of him.",

And it's - this is also not the first instance we've heard this - the things that Kelly has said in this most recent interview. That's not the first time that we've heard that he's, you know, that he's been critical of veterans, people who've served this country.And so I think you've got to look at the fact that you've got Donald Trump, who is probably one of the most sort of bald-faced liars in modern American public life, just absolutely has no compunction about lying, and then you have people who have served for him in serious and important roles that are responsible for our national security who say, I saw him up close, I saw the awful things he said. He's somebody who should not be within 100 yards of the Oval Office ever. You know, you've got to weigh those two things. And I think for people who are trying to decide, make a decision in this election, I do think it carries weight to say, you know, nobody who served with Donald Trump in these important roles thinks that he should go back to the White House. And that, I think, gives voters some pause. I - I agree be that one given story in this media environment is probably not enough to puncture, but I do think that the full tapestry of these stories and the people who are saying, I can't support him because I saw him up close in this role, I do think that that has an impact with voters.",

Vance and Trump are taking the time out of, you know, the very - out of the campaign to deny these reports, I mean, it's very rare as a journalist, quite frankly, that somebody goes on the record with their name and lies. I mean, I - you know, that - that hasn't been an experience that I've had in my career. So, I think, you know, given John Kelly's - I think his credibility is - is fairly clear. But they're denying it. And I think the reason for this denial is that they are seeing something that - it is impactful. That this does get voters' attention. It does surprise me - I mean I would think, at the end of the campaign, the decision really is about economics. And when we look back at, you know, why this campaign goes the way it does, it very well may be because of economics and inflation. And those have been like the larger issues that have voters that I talked to talk about. But the - you know, the end here has been about character. And Harris is seeing something in her data that shows that it's a useful closing argument. And Trump is - is making a show out of denying it. So, he clearly has some concerns about it as well.",

Democrats, of course, currently the majority in the Senate. They're trying to flip the House. Republicans hoping to take control of the Senate.A new CNBC poll shows this, 48 percent of registered voters would prefer Republicans control Congress, while 44 percent said Democrats.

And so, if the Republicans - you know, the Republican vote is less concentrated than the Democratic vote. The Democratic vote is very clustered in urban areas and on the coast. And so therefore Democrats could win the national popular vote for House, right? If you add up all the congressional House member's votes, Democrats could win that by a couple of points and Republicans still control Congress. And so, if Republicans end up with a plus four advantage in the vote for Congress, and I'm not saying that's where this goes, you've got some undecided people that have to vote there. And of course, it's - a generic vote doesn't always translate into a district. But a 48-44 Republican advantage would give Mike Johnson a lot of comfort going into election night to hold the House.",

I mean, I think there was, you know, when Biden was at the top of the ticket and there were really concerns about where his numbers were going. There were a lot of congressional Democrats who were talking about running explicitly as a check on Trump. Obviously, as Harris has made this race much more competitive, I think that has fallen by the wayside in a lot of districts, although not - not entirely. Some in - in some more Republican districts, moderate Republican districts, you're still hearing that messaging.So, you know, I think the other thing to think about is, you know, split ticket voting is largely a thing of the past, not entirely, but largely a thing of the past. And so I think, particularly for the House, you know, where the presidential race goes will probably determine where control of the House goes. It's just there aren't all that many people in this country who are going to go, especially in such a nationalized election like this where people are going to go pull the lever for, you know, Donald Trump and then the Democrat for Congress. So, it will be - it will be interesting to see. I think the House is probably going to be tied - the fate of the House is going to be tied very closely to the presidential. The Senate, obviously, slightly different. Obviously, this is a tough map for Democrats in the Senate, but, you know, we're seeing encouraging signs in places like Texas, where Kamala Harris is going to be tonight. So, we'll see.",

And I will say this, regardless of who wins and who controls the House and who controls the Senate, I would say that the Democratic Party, shockingly for me to even say this, are even - are - will be more operationally ready after the election because they will not have the infighting that we have seen over the past couple years in the House Republican conference. And we're going to see continue, Democrats more united in the U.S. Senate. The same thing, we're going to see Mitch McConnell step down at the end of this year. He's been there a long time. You're going to see this fight over control within the United States and it - within the Republican conference. So, again, let's go six months down the road and have this discussion.

And he's got a chunk of senators in the Republican conference in the Senate who - who not like the way he's led the Senate lately.And so I think the next Republican leader in the Senate actually will have a lot more support. And I think you'll see a Senate conference that's united on the Republican side. The House is a different story. You know, we don't herd very well as Republicans.

And everywhere I've been, everywhere I've traveled to, I have Republicans, independents, Democrats. They're coming to our events. They're voting for me in this election. Rick Scott is one of the most vulnerable Republicans running for re- election. He has not been able to cross a 46, 47 percent mark in any of the polls. He's below 50 percent. We still have a group of undecideds. And we know that in the past year independents have been voting for us in all the special elections. In the primary elections, we were able to defeat the Moms for Liberty candidates here for schoolboard. And they were outspending us two to three against them on the - our candidates for schoolboard. So, I'm telling you, Kasie, I think there's a lot that a lot of people are missing about Florida. This is not the same election that it was in 2020 or 2016.

She's calling Donald Trump a fascist. Is that the kind of messaging that you feel like is helping you when in the final days, or is your message a little bit different than that? MUCARSEL-POWELL: Well, our message here in Florida is about Florida, and about lifting up every single family that has been struggling under extreme policies that started under Rick Scott. We have a property insurance crisis. We know that we're paying four times the national average. We just were devastated by two different hurricanes, Hurricane Milton, Hurricane Helene. People are left with absolutely nothing. Rick Scott voted against funding FEMA. And a lot of families here have been struggling for too long. Our teachers are the lowest paid teachers when you look at the national average for the rest of the country. We have students that have been attacked because of who they love and who they are. And now, of course, we are living under one of the most extreme bans on abortion. A six week ban that Rick Scott supports. And let me just say this, Kasie, he wants to go back to the Senate, become Senate majority leader. And I want everyone to just think of a world where you miss Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader. He would be catastrophic, not only for Florida, but for America.

They've said that they want to protect abortion rights. I'm curious where you think people are in Florida. And if you think people who are going to vote for that are also going to vote for Democratic candidates because that may not always be the case. MUCARSEL-POWELL: So, yes, that's a very emotional ad. And, Kasie, I just heard a similar story yesterday. A woman who was carrying her pregnancy, she already had a six-year-old daughter. She was seven months pregnant, and the doctors told her the - the baby wasn't living anymore inside her - her - her body. And they wouldn't terminate her pregnancy. And so she was forced to travel, leave her six-year-old daughter here in Florida and had to go to New York to get that critical health care. It's really devastating. I'm a mom. I have two daughters. I'm the youngest of four sisters. This is such a central issue for us for health care, for safety, for our livelihood. And most of the people that I talked to, whether Republicans, Democrats, or independents, really regardless of political affiliation, they are supporting Amendment Four. They are protecting a woman's right to choose. It will pass. It will cross the 60 percent threshold. And just last week, I was at an event where three different women came on up to me. They were Republicans. One of them said, I'm very conservative. I've never voted for a Democrat. I'm voting for you. And I asked her, you know, what was her reason to do that. And she said it was abortion. They've crossed the line. Florida, we're not extreme like that. We've just been hijacked by the former president coming here in 2018 and then this governor, who has just crossed the line in every single policy. We are not extremists. Floridians understand that we - we don't like government telling us what to do. This is government interference. And we will pass Amendment Four. And I can tell you, they need 60 percent. I need 50 plus one. I need people with me. We can win this race. You want the Senate majority. I will deliver that Senate majority. And that's exactly what we're going to do in about 11 days.",
