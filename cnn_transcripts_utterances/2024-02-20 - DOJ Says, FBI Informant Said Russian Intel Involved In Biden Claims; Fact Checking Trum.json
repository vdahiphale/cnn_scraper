And tonight, a 28-page filing that lays bare an active ongoing scheme to interfere in the 2024 election. The Justice Department spelled out all the ways that a former FBI informant lied over and over again to federal investigators. Alexander Smirnov allegedly planted stories that he said were told to him by foreign agents, Russian agents. According to that document, Smirnov, quote, promoted a new false narrative after he said he met with Russian officials. He's allegedly associated with Russian intelligence. He met often with someone inside Russian intelligence, a person who runs hit men, quote, individuals tasked with carrying out assassination efforts. The Justice Department makes clear that this is no accident. The contacts, quote, are not benign. The informant claimed that Russians have comprised -- that's compromising material on Americans who have close ties to 2024 candidates. Now, some of the false stories that were provided allegedly by these Russian agents were about Hunter Biden, who the document refers to as businessperson one. On that informant, the DOJ says plainly, Smirnov's efforts to spread misinformation about a candidate of one of the two major political parties in the United States continues, it's happening right now. So, will Republicans retrench and walk away from an impeachment investigation that is built on these alleged lies? It certainly doesn't sound like it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's number one.Number two, I do think they need to haul in people from the FBI and try to find out how it is that this person who the FBI thought was a credible person is all of a sudden not credible. And how long he's been feeding the U.S. government misinformation, apparently at the behest of and at the payment of the FBI, I think that's important to know. I don't know whether they're going to impeach Joe Biden or not. I've always been skeptical of it. I've never been quite certain they were going to be able to get the votes for it. And I'm not sure it's that big of a deal anyway because the Senate is never going to deal with it in the way that Republicans want in the House anyhow.

Kevin McCarthy, you'll remember, made that trek too, right after the insurrection. He eventually found himself a victim of Trump's grudge and a House rebellion. And, of course, out of a job. Ronna McDaniel also went to Mar-a-Lago just this month. Trump called her a friend on Truth Social, before unceremoniously pushing her out of the RNC's back door.

And it's pretty clear that Nikki Haley isn't going to do the same thing. Now, I look at this in two ways. Number one, it's her right to do so. It's her right to challenge him. And there are about 20 or 25 percent of the Republican Party that still does not want and is never Trump. But on the other hand, in every single poll, bar none, Donald Trump is winning not just a majority, but a super majority of Republicans.
