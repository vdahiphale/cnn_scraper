Over the past several days his shifting positions on an abortion referendum in Florida have angered his conservative base. In a span of 24 hours he seemed to backtrack though on how he would vote in Florida. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, I think the six week is too short.

Great to have you on this morning.Let's talk a little bit more about where Trump is and where he's been kind of all over the place on this, staking out different positions around these reproductive rights issues. How will voters take all of this in -- him swinging kind of from one direction to another? CHEYANNE DANIELS, RACE AND POLITICS REPORTER, THE HILL, CREATOR AND HOST, \"THE SWITCH UP\" PODCAST:  You know, I think this is the former president really trying to figure out what he has to do to win over those voters who are extremely concerned about abortion and reproductive rights this year, right? He's spent so much time talking about how he -- it was because of him that the Supreme Court was over -- able to overturn Roe v. Wade. And then the response to that, as we now see, is 10 states, at least, have abortion literally on the ballot in November. And so he's trying to find this middle ground to speak to his base while at the same time grabbing the attention of those who are maybe saying you know what, I don't agree with that. So it's going to be really interesting I think to see where voters sort of align with his, especially when looking on the other side to where Democrats are and Democrats wanting to restore Roe v. Wade. It's going to be a very interesting play, I think.",

AVIVA SIEGEL, FORMER HAMAS HOSTAGE, HUSBAND STILL HELD BY HAMAS (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes. So, six hostages were murdered in such a brutal way, and they were alive three days ago. And they should have been back in Israel months ago when it was possible. Their families are in so much pain. Rachel and Jon are like my family. I love them. And I so much wanted to meet Hersch, their son that they've been talking about for nearly a year. It's just beyond what happened to them and things like that should not happen.
