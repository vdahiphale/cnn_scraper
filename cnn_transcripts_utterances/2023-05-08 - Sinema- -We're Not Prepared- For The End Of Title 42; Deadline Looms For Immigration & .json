It used to be you could come into the United States until you had your court hearing, then you can turn them away. There is expected about 7,500 people now in a day encountered at the border. They expect that could go to 10,000. It could go to 12,000. It could go higher. Kyrsten Sinema, now the independent Senator from Arizona, says the administration is doing some things but not enough.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-AZ): Well, it's wonderful that the administration is announcing things like a 1,500-troop deployment, and these new processing centers which will not be operational by next Friday. Those are good things. Those are aspirational. That's not the same as operational. Tent the buses. Hire the drivers. Build the soft sided facilities so that we can process individuals. We need more holding capacity. I mean, let's be realistic here. And that's what's not -- we're not prepared for that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We'll have to wait and see on that one. But, they are very conscious, and they want to prepare the public too for the fact that we are going to see a surge in migration once Title 42 expires, even beyond the surge that we are already witnessing right now with those numbers, as you said, creeping up to 7,500 people crossing per day.They will argue, however, that they are as prepared as they can be, that they have been working to expand legal pathways on one end of the situation for populations coming from some of these countries where we have seen the surge, particularly Central and South American countries, and at the same time tightening some of the enforcement measures. We're expecting, before Title 42 lapses, this new asylum rule that's going to bar certain migrants who crossed into other countries before coming to the United States from applying for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. So, look, it's going to be a significant challenge. But, that is the irony of this. They have been preparing for this.

And I'm just really struck by polling among Democrats even where they largely have a positive view of President Biden, certainly has performance in the White House, what he has gotten done, but still, not less than half of them want them to run -- want him to run again. And a lot of that comes from that age issue. And the President can joke it off. It's the very Ronald Reagan-esque method of -- don't -- you don't buy youth's -- my opponents are youth and experienced.

And one of the things that the White House constantly comes back to is, well, once the American public sees how much he has accomplished, once they start to see the results of these bills, like infrastructure, like the CHIPS Act, like the Inflation Reduction Act, then they'll finally understand that he is competent, and he is up to the task.

And there are ways to demonstrate that without showing the images of these dead bodies. But, as I was watching over the weekend, this mass of people being evacuated from this mall, you think about the number of people who are affected every single time we have one of these mass shootings, and whether or not that starts to change minds, because it certainly creates activists.We have seen this after significant mass shootings in this country, the way that this movement around gun violence has developed.

Leader McConnell telling CNN's Manu Raju in an exclusive candidate phone interview, you'll love this. \"We do have the possibility of screwing this up and that gets back to candidate recruitment. I think that we lost Georgia, Arizona and New Hampshire because we didn't have competitive candidates.\" That would be last year, he means. This despite an obvious advantage in the upcoming election. Democrats are defending a whopping 23 seats compared to only 11 Republican-held seats.Right here in studio with me as our Chief Congressional Correspondent, Manu Raju. His candor is born of experience. He thought in the last couple of cycles he would get and then pad a Republican majority, and yet he is in the minority. Let's just put the map up on the screen here. If you look at this, number one, the advantage for the Republicans is, all 11 of those red states with Republican incumbents are Republican states in presidential elections. Is Florida potentially a swing state? Maybe. But, you go through all of those states and you have Republican incumbents in what should be safe or safe-ish seats. You look at the map here. McConnell, in the interview with you, focuses on Montana, West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where you have Democratic incumbents right now in, what, in a presidential year, should be tough states, right?",

And it's interesting to see him talk about that, because he is seeing this -- despite all those states that we just saw, he is really looking at a very small map to take back the majority. In West Virginia, of course, Joe Manchin, we don't know if he is going to run again. He is very happy about getting Jim Justice, the governor there, to run. Also in Ohio, he -- Sherrod Brown is the incumbent Democratic Senator.They have several candidates they are happy about. In Montana, there is hope that they could get this businessman named Tim Sheehy to run there. Jon Tester is the incumbent member. And they are really, really pining to get Dave McCormick, who ran and fell short in the Pennsylvania Senate race in the last primary. Now, they want him to run here. But, John, in each of those states, there are very complicated primaries that could emerge and could complicate their efforts to get back the majority. So, McConnell made very clear that unlike the last cycle where the Republican leaders, for the most part, stepped away from those primaries, they plan to engage, spend money and resources in those races to ensure that they believe they can get the most electable candidate root out the weaker ones. But, of course, that's easier said than done. KING: And so, let's continue there. So, another reason McConnell thinks Montana, Western Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, good for Republicans, even if Trump is the nominee, because those are strong states for Trump. He lost Pennsylvania last time, but he has -- he got a ton of votes. It was a very close state there. Then you look at these other ones. You look at Wisconsin. You look at Nevada. You look at Arizona, where you have Democratic incumbents in what should be battleground states. Why not more confident there?",

He didn't say that explicitly that the down ticket impact could definitely hurt Wisconsin. It could have hurt them in Arizona. Michigan, he barely even mentioned in the interview. And Arizona is such a complicated state for them because of the potential of Kyrsten Sinema running as a third-party candidate, also the Democratic candidate, and some very far right candidates, including Kari Lake, Blake Masters considering a run in Arizona.McConnell made clear to me, John, that they plan to wait almost certainly until after the primary to decide whether to spend any money there at all, which explains the underlying problem here for them. Now, the primaries could produce candidates who could be unelectable in a general election, which is why he is hedging his bets at this point.",
