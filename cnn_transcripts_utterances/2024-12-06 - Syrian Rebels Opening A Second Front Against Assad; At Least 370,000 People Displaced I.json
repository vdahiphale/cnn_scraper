Syrian rebels open a second front against the Assad government, and they say they aim to take Damascus. The manhunt widens as police believe the suspect in the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO has now left New York City. And trouble for TikTok. An Appeals Court upholding a law that could ban the social media app in the U.S. And Spotify success. BTS and Blackpink dominate the K-pop streaming chart. That conversation and plenty more, coming up. But first, the Syrian government now facing a new front. Rebels in the Southern Daraa Province say they have captured a military base there, as well as a major border crossing into Jordan. A coalition of rebel groups, meanwhile, continues to make gains in the north as it approaches the central City of Homs. The foreign ministers of Iraq, Iran, and Syria held a meeting, saying the rebel advance poses, quote, a \"serious danger to their nations.\" And Russia is urging its citizens to leave the country. Turkey has been supporting rebel groups in Syria, even deploying forces. Here's what President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said about the advance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RECEP TAYYIP EDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): Idlib, Hama, and Homs. The target is, of course, Damascus. This march of the opponents continues as of now. We follow this from both intelligence and all media. Of course, I will say that our wish is that this march in Syria continues without any accidents or hardship. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Its parent company, ByteDance, is Chinese, but its investors are largely big foreign private equity firms and groups. Its algorithm is, you know, very hard to distinguish from the Chinese app called Douyin from the U.S. app. And in fact, that's one of the big challenges that we face in trying to figure out how you would even divest TikTok's U.S. arm, because separating the algorithm, ByteDance says, is impossible to do. And so, I'm very curious to see that if they bring this all the way up to the Supreme Court, will the Supreme Court agree with the judges today that said that they did not provide enough national security evidence to warrant a ban, we will just have to take a look.

He's gotten up to $20 billion in interested buyers. Now, is that enough money for an asset like this? It could be worth up to $100 billion. I'm not sure.
