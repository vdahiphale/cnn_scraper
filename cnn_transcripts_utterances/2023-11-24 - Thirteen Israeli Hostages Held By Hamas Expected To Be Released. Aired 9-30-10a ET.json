      "sentences": "All right, guys, if you can put that map back up on the screen of southern Gaza where we can see Khan Younis where Barak was just talking about right now. And Barak's reporting -- there you can see it right there, Khan Younis highlighted in southern Gaza.Remember, southern Gaza is where Israel has told people inside Gaza to move, from the north there in red, down over wadi Gaza, the marshlands there into southern Gaza. So Khan Younis is the biggest city in southern Gaza where the most people live, that is where perhaps these hostages are being handed over at this moment to Red Cross officials and they'll be moved south. The entire length of Gaza is 25 miles. So you get a sense it's just a few miles away from the southern border there, so this could all be taking place at this very moment. Chris, I do want to talk about this. And this is an aspect of this, if this is happening in Khan Younis as Barak says, and everyone knows it's happening in Khan Younis, how badly do the Israelis want to be getting information about where these hostages are coming from, and how limited are they since they're no longer -- they're not able to fly drones over Gaza at this moment? CHRISTOPHER O'LEARY, SENIOR VP FOR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, SOUFAN GROUP: So it's a challenge, and that's a real deficit for them. The collection from the drones, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance is critical in finding the other hostages. You track the guards, the members of Hamas. You track their movements of where they're going and where they're coming from. You like illuminate the network, try to piece them together. So, all those little pieces of intelligence are important. But what you are going to get instead now, we're going to get tactical debriefs of the hostages as they come out by trained professionals with counselors who will do this once they're ready, and you'll start piecing together information that will also help, you know, build the picture, and then when the drones get to start flying, that stuff will be laid on into the collection effort. So, you're losing something near term, but you may actually be getting greater details and new lines of effort and intelligence collection in for it.",

What are the risk/rewards of that if it can happen?O'LEARY:  So, it's unusual. Red Cross doesn't usually get to visit hostages held by terrorist organizations. What they do traditionally is they visit prisoners of war and they have access. The concern is letting them go in to give some legitimacy to Hamas as a uniformed combatant force under armed conflict. They're not terrorist organization. So we have to remember that. But on the positive side, they're going to be able to provide medical care, possibly identify the hostages that are being held, that are alive, and there's some information that's missing for some of these families. They don't know if their -- you know, their family members are alive. So we're going to get that. That's going to be positive, and it's all going to be reported back. So it is a positive turn in some ways.",

And so that is something that officials were watching closely, because they were saying, you know, we're going to ask questions of the adults. They're not going to ask questions of the children in the same way. That has been the guidance that has been going out to the Israeli soldiers who have an enormous responsibility on their hands as they are receiving these hostages who have been through a traumatic several weeks.We don't know what conditions they've been in. We know -- you know, there's this extensive tunnel system underneath Gaza that two of the hostages who were previously released said daylight shocked them when they saw it, John, because they had not seen the sun in so many weeks. And so, of course, that is going to be a question for these 13 hostages who have just been released to the International Red Cross Committee.",

Not all of the hostages I've just heard, not all of the hostages are as of yet with the ICRC. Some of them are. I have been told, but not all of them.There has been a slight delay. And I haven't been told what that delay is, but not all of those hostages are currently with the ICRC. But there are some who are. So obviously, we said from the beginning of this, this is going to be fragile. There are going to be delays. This is an extremely difficult operation. The process is set up. There are obligations on both sides. The first obligation today that Hamas hand over those 13 women and children to the ICRC. We are not sure, we cannot yet know exactly where those hostages are or whether they are all together in one group. But certainly, I've literally just been told in the last couple of seconds, that not everybody as of yet is with the Red Cross. The hope here is, that will happen soon is what I'm being told. But it hasn't happened as of yet. So obviously, there is a little bit of conflicting reporting going on --",

We do have one source in the Israeli Prime Minister's office tellingus that all 13 hostages are with the Red Cross in Egypt. Becky's sources in Doha saying not all of them just yet. Let's go back to Barak Ravid from \"Axios\" right now. And Barak, again, you had heard that they've been turned over to Red Cross officials in Khan Younis, which is still inside Gaza. Where are things now, just over the last few minutes? We're 40 minutes into this window where the hostages were to be turned over.",

And according to those officials, the -- we are still in the process of Hamas handing over the hostages to the Red Cross in Khan Younis. They are not in Egypt. According to Israeli officials, the hostages are still not in Egypt. So I think we should be very careful with everything we say right now.There is a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of fog. There's a lot of conflicting, contradictory reports. But at least, according to two Israeli officials I spoke to, and who are right now in the situation room following this operation, the hostages are still not in Egypt, we're still in the phase of Hamas handing them over to the Red Cross in Khan Younis in southern Gaza Strip.",

      "sentences": "Understood. So again, we can put that up on the map so people can see exactly what we're talking about here. Khan Younis, the biggest city in southern Egypt -- sorry, in southern Gaza. Barak Ravid sources say that they are the 13 hostages in the process of being handed over to Red Cross officials there -- that's still in Gaza. They would then be moved to Egypt to cross back in to Israel.This is an important part of the process, but the process is not done yet. I want to bring back Chris O'Leary who is here with me to talk about this. You have dealt with hostage releases and negotiations before. What's this like for the 13 hostages going through this right now, remembering some of them are children? O'LEARY:  Yes, so they're confused right now. They don't know what's going on, they don't know that they're being turned over. They don't trust their captors obviously, because you know, they've been held in tunnels likely for the last six weeks. So it's going to be very traumatizing, very confusing, they will be dealt with very carefully. This is all coordinated, pre-rehearsed. There will be professionals that take them through the continuum to reintegrate them. And as we talked about when they're ready, they will start to get questioned. But they have to be medically sound and psychologically sound. It doesn't do you any good to rescue them or recover them and they're medically OK, but then they're mentally incapable of re- entering society. So that's one. The other thing is, from the -- you know, I can speak to the -- you know, U.S. military and intelligence side, we go through specialized training to prepare us for being detained. These victims do not. This is extremely arduous for them. It's going to be a shock to their system coming out, and they will not trust anybody for quite some time.",

This is not like the Berlin wall and the cold war where there's one place where you know something is going to take place. There are so many different moving parts here, which explains some of the confusion here in this process. So let's get back to Kaitlan in Tel Aviv to figure out where we are at this moment. Kaitlan?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, Kaitlan, I think the news that these Israeli hostages have -- are in the custody of the Red Cross in Egypt tells us, one -- two things, effectively. One, they could come through this Kerem Shalom Crossing, and the only other crossing really that would make sense from this point would be the Nitzana Crossing, which is another crossing between Egypt and Israel.  That is where a lot of those aid trucks have been going to get checkedby Israeli officials before -- to get those security checks before they make their way into Gaza. But what we have seen in the past, for example, in the case of Gilad Shalit in 2011, is that he was transferred into Egypt first via that Rafah Crossing, and then he came into Israel via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. Kerem Shalom has two access points, one of them, Gaza to Israel, and the other, Egypt to Israel. And so that gives us a strong indication that this may very well be the location where those 13 women and children could make their first entry back into Israel. That is certainly a very strong possibility. From here, my understanding is that they would be boarded onto buses and taken to an Air Force base where they would finally be able to make their first phone calls or have their first meetings with some of their family members, depending on the circumstances. And then from there, of course, they would be taken in helicopters to one of several hospitals in Israel that have been preparing for this very day. As you know, Kaitlan, there has been an enormous process to build up and to prepare for these hostages to arrive for the various medical, psychological, financial needs that they may have. But certainly, for the families of those 13 hostages who have been told that they -- their family members were going to be released today, knowing that they are now in the custody of the Red Cross must give them a huge sigh of relief, even if they won't be able to breathe entirely easy until they know that they're firmly on Israeli soil.",

And so, this is also a testament to what we know so far, this agreement between Israel and Hamas actually working and in process as we've seen the fighting stop, the aid go in.And now hearing that these hostages are being handed over, that, that is underway right now. CNN's Matthew Chance is also tracking all of this as we are watching it very closely, things are changing by the moment as this is developing. And Matthew, obviously, a big part of this is not even what this group looks like that we've also learned, it's actually bigger than this, that there are also 12 Thai nationals that are being released according to Egyptian officials. That's what they've been saying. As a part of that in addition to the 13 hostages that we believe are being handed over right now. What are you learning?",

And just to remind people the very latest information we're getting which has been conflicting over the last 20 minutes. The 13 hostages appear to be in the process of being handed over to Red Cross officials still inside Gaza, whether they have transferred fully into Egypt yet or not, that is what we are trying to determine at this now.But the process, it is under way. Chris O'Leary is still with me, hostage negotiator, hostage coordinator and expert. We've got about a minute left before we're going to take a quick break and reset here, Chris. This is the first stage, this is the first day of this. This could be extended past four days, Israel says, if Hamas continues to turn over a minimum of ten hostages a day. How long do you see Hamas doing this for? O'LEARY:  I think Hamas is going to try to drag it out for a little bit longer, it makes sense, it recalibrates the strategic narrative in the international community, that's part of the propaganda of releasing the Thai victims today. But I think both sides are going to get to a decision-point where it starts going against their interest. Hamas wants a long-term, you know, protracted situation here with the hostages. They'll hold most of the IDF soldiers as long as they can. Israel has to defeat Hamas, and extending this truce, the ceasefire goes against those interests. So they're going to have pressure from the international community to extend it. They're also going to have pressure within the community of Israel from the hostage families. So it's in friction with each other.",
