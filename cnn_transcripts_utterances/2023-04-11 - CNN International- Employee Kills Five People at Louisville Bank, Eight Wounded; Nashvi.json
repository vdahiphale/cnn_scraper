Well since Roe v. Wade was overturned in the middle of last year, we had half a dozen abortion ballot measures, right, and the pro-abortion right side and every single one of them came out with the majority with a win. And we're not just talking about blue states like Vermont and California. We're talking about red states right, like Kentucky and Kansas and Montana. So, the fact is, Americans are on the side of pro-abortion rights. And it's going to be very interesting to see going forward whether or not they like this decision.

This would be his former Vice President, Mike Pence. Pence has been subpoenaed to that grand jury and Donald Trump has been trying to claim executive privilege or presidential privilege protections around the communications that he and Pence would have had after the 2020 election leading up to January 6th whenever Pence was being pressured to try and stop the outcome of the presidential election and overturned Donald Trump's loss. Now three times, Donald Trump has already gone to the appeals court and lost related to other witnesses. A lot of other people, including people from Pence's office, his own White House counsel, some of his top aides, even cabinet members. But this fourth time he's filing again to try and block part of Pence's testimony by claiming executive privilege. We do believe, though, according to many of the legal experts I speak with, that he is likely to lose again here. We know that a trial level judge already denied Trump's request to stop Pence from answering these questions at the grand jury, and there's 50 years of case law up against him here. Obviously, the appeals court has not sided with him any time he's tried to make executive privilege claims over January 6th material before and that is a likelihood again.
