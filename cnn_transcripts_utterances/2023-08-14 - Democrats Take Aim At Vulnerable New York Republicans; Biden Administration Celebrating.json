But I've often said, and we talked about this in the green room, that if you're looking at what we're going to be dealing with moving forward, you're going to have gas prices for heat and energy. Come this winter, they're going to be astronomical without that safety valve to be able to be pulled again. You're going to be dealing with the fact that we are now seeing again people defaulting on their car payments. The fact that the credit card debt now topping a trillion dollars. The fact that the median amount of savings has gone down precipitously and continues to come down, all while baby boomers are retiring to the tune of about 10,000 per day. So those are the type of perfect storm conditions that end up with you staring down the barrel of a 2024 election with the average people saying yes, the macro economy might be doing well, but the micro issues -- the issues that everyday Americans decide their lives on -- those are the ones that are really going to be putting down with pressure on that middle class.",

The restaurant owner accuses the paper of illegally obtaining and sharing documentation on a DUI citation she received about 15 years ago. The newspaper reports it was a source that shared the information with a reporter and they confirmed it through publicly available records. They also decided not to publish the information until after the restaurant owner started publicly accusing them of wrongdoing.Our senior media reporter and analyst Sara Fischer joins us now. This is really much bigger than this paper, right? It matters what's happening here because it matters. It's a First Amendment question. You rarely see a raid like this happen. How did this happen and was it legal? SARA FISCHER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA ANALYST, SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  It's a great question, Poppy. And just to hit at your first point there, this is part of a broader trend within the United States of law enforcement and journalism companies going head- to-head. We've seen the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has tracked that this has been increasing since the George Floyd protests in 2020. We saw hundreds of journalists get arrested. There were warrants issued for them to give over their footage. And so, when we hear about something happening like this at a local paper it's a reminder that this is part of the bigger problem in the U.S. I cover a lot of press freedom rights around the globe in autocratic countries. You rarely see things like this -- a raid like this at a local paper here in the U.S. Right now, it seems that there is a discrepancy between whether or not the paper was supposed to be raided -- whether there was legal grounds to do it. You mentioned at the top there's 34 news organizations joining the press freedom groups, arguing that this is against federal privacy law. That this is against federal law to do it. Of course, the local law enforcement is pointing at different situations, saying that they had grounds to invade the home of this newspaper executive. Time will tell once we get a better sense of what's going on with the story. But for now, you have a lot of journalists very worked up over this situation.",
