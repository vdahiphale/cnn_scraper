Plus, Russia is claiming to have halted a Ukrainian incursion in the Kursk region. Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now, the futures are looking mixed frankly, as anxious investors mull another U.S. Jobs Report looking for further clues about the state of the world's biggest economy and what the U.S. Fed will do next on interest rates and when we'll get you back to New York for the opening of Thursday's session, say, a little bit less than 30 minutes from now. We start this hour with the details of the thwarting of an alleged terror plot that forced the cancelation of Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna. Austria's Interior Minister says international intelligence agencies helped foil the plot. A source telling CNN that the warning came from U.S. intelligence. Police detained three teenagers for questioning, at least two of them, they say, were radicalized online, with the main suspect pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS. Police also found chemicals and suspected explosives at his house. Now the cancelation of these concerts say heartbreak for the tens of thousands of Swifties already in Vienna or set to travel there to see the super star perform what were three sold out shows, starting tonight. They are safe, at least in principle. Salma Abdelaziz, connecting us from Vienna. Salma, what more are we learning about the suspects and their alleged plot?",

In fact, that 17-year-old was arrested just outside yesterday. Take a listen to what the head of the security services told me.

Thousands of fans were expected outside this stadium, and then, after using a vehicle that they would potentially detonate an explosive device. You can imagine that this is still very much an ongoing investigation. They say they do not believe that there are any suspects still out there at this time, but they continue to look into that.

So, it is very telling that they're saying nothing about this. It is also very telling that the U.S. clearly was not given any prior warning, which they often are for big operations. So that is, you know, on the one hand, I think we still have this very open question as to what Ukraine is trying to achieve here. Is it to distract Russian forces away from the Eastern Front, where they have been inching forward? Is this some way of preventing a similar scenario to what we saw in Kharkiv in the spring, where Russia opened a new front? Are they actually playing for territory here? Are they trying to gain Russian territory to give them leverage in future negotiations? And on the flip side, Russia's approach here is also very telling, in the sense that they're not trying to hide it.

And I think she both is open to talking about the issue and expressing sympathy about what is happening, but she also wants to kind of keep control over the campaign and move this forward. So, this is her initial effort to deal with this kind of heckling, which is as inevitable as the kinds of attacks that will be coming in the next few months from the Republican Party. And so yeah, she's quickly navigating and figuring out what will her strategy be.",

We've seen it a couple of times.So much of the focus on the big favorites heading into these races, but couple of Team USA athletes, Cole Hocker, we had in the 1500 meters. And last night, Quincy Hall, you could see every ounce of that effort. He was not giving up, he said. Afterwards, he said, no distance is too great, really upsetting the odds to take that victory in the men's 400 meters. There is perhaps more of a heavy favorite back on track tonight, Noah Lyles, in the 200 looking to do the double. We've got plenty more looking ahead. Still that's coming up in just a couple of minutes in \"World Sport\".",
