So I'm not going to ask for another because I'm not the loser of this debate. That's very much the marker he's put down for himself right now. So, he doesn't want to do Fox. He doesn't want to ask for another debate. Will it happen? Should it happen? I don't know if it will happen. Should it happen at this point for Donald Trump? I don't think it should. Now, he's dealing with another new cycle instead of talking about the failures of the Biden-Harris administration, and how groceries or more expensive. It's harder to buy a home, it's harder to get ahead in this country than it was four years ago. Instead of talking about that, he's getting distracted by Kamala being able to pull him off his mark in that debate.

PERRINE: Right. I think the ability for this to be a monumental, not only endorsement, but opportunity for celebrities to step in and try to move the needle. I think it exists here. It kind of brings me back to the 1990s when Rock the Votes started, it changed the way that younger people believed that they could be involved in the American voting system. Because back in the 90s, most young people thought, hey, that's what older people do. They vote, that's not my thing. Rock the Vote and celebrities really changed to that approach. Now, is this only this endorsement right here where she puts out the image, puts out her statement and encourages people to get more information. That likely won't make a huge difference. But because of her platform and the opportunity that exists this here with her, if she is willing to do more whatever that may be, if that is a concert where your entry fee is a voter registration ticket that you've done that, that could help move the needle, if they're doing it. And to be clear though, the margins are kind of small, even with Taylor Swift being a monumental star, because Kamala is already doing he really well with a lot of the demographics that are Taylor fans, women, younger voters, things like that.

Also that she was in charge security that day. Not for the first time, none of that is true. The January 6th Committee found no evidence of any order for 10,000 troops that day. The former president's own acting secretary of defense confirmed that in testimony. There is also no evidence he even offered the then-speaker thousands of troops. It's also not in her power to turn down such an offer. The president is in charge of the D.C. Guard, not the house speaker.Joining me now is Democratic House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi. She's also the author of the recently released book, \" The Art of Power:  My Story as America's First Woman Speaker of the House.\" First of all, I'm just wondering overall, what you thought of the debate last night because it does seem from, maybe like ten minutes into it, Vice President Harris certainly found a way to get underneath or under the skin of the former president in a way that very few people have in a public debate. REP. EMERITA NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA):  Well, let's just talk about her rather than him right now. We can come back to his skin later. But right now, I want to talk about her leadership. I was so proud of her. She was presidential. She showed her new way forward -- new and forward, her plan to take us forward, command of the issues, eloquence in talking about them, again, strategic in her thinking. I thought she was just spectacular, but her excellence did get under his skin. And it was so strange because one of the -- one of the things I was so proud about that Kamala, the vice president last night, was that she prioritized in her answers, any one of them could be a program discussion, but she prioritized the importance, whether it was the women's right to choose, whether it's our national security, whether it's issues that relate to our economy and the rest, she prioritized, and that means there's so much more to come as we go from here. So, I think she did great. As to baiting him and him taking the bait, you know, I don't even like to use his name, much less talk about him. But the fact is, I thought he looked foolish last night. I thought she looked presidential. I thought he looked silly.",

So for all of those millions of people who saw her and were excited by it, the rest, we don't -- that's OK.But we have to -- we have to put it into action. So that means we must -- I have three Ms. Mobilize -- we must own the ground to get out the vote, every single vote that is for Kamala Harris to come to the polls. We have to Message in a way that is inspiring. You don't run on empty. As you mobilize, you need inspiration. We want a Message that is bold and progressive, but not menacing, but is unifying for our country. As she said, turn the page where we want to unify America. Mobilization, Message, and of course, the Money to get the job done. And small donors have been just so enthusiastic about her campaign. But this must continue.
