He held a call, called the former president yesterday to apologize, according to new reporting from our colleagues Melanie Zanona and Kristen Holmes, where he both apologized. He told the former president that he misspoke and, of course, he blamed the reporters for taking the comments out of context, according to McCarthy. But that wasn't where it ended, Sara. He also had an exclusive interview with \"Breitbart News\", a right winging -- right leaning news agency to try to talk more about why he believed Donald Trump was the strongest candidate to beat Joe Biden.Later, his campaign sent out a fundraising e-mail, saying that Donald Trump was stronger than ever. This just goes to show you that Kevin McCarthy knows that his right flank is so important for him to hold on to his speakership. He cannot anger people in his conference who are getting behind the former president, who are fervently behind him at all times no matter what that means in term of defending Donald Trump. And that is why Kevin McCarthy went out of his way yesterday to go ahead and apologize to the former president. And then in subsequent interviews, make it clear that he does believe Donald Trump could be a strong contender to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election. Sara?",

Now, if you're like me, you're probably thinking, OK, wait a minute. ERCOT is saying everything is going to be fine in the grid in Texas, but why are prices soaring so much? Well, here is what Ed Hirs, that expert explained to me, and bear with me for just a second when explaining this.So, he explained that when demand for power increases in the State of Texas, of course, because the temperatures spike, he says that the supply that is counted is only the supply from the generators that are generating power at that point in time. Now, here's the kicker, there is a sideline of power that is not included in supply. Let me say that one more time, there is power on the sidelines that is not counted as supply. And, Kate, here's the kick, once the price spikes, then they bring in that supply into the total supply for power in the State of Texas, but of course, at a much higher price. So, you put that sideline power and the rolling blackouts and that's how Texas manages its power and they'll tell you everything is going to be fine. Yes, but it's going to cost you a little more.

A temporary ceasefire between two warring military groups in Sudan appears to have ended with reports of renewed violence near Khartoum and the western part of the country yesterday. That was the latest ceasefire agreement in this ongoing violent conflict between two Sudanese paramilitary groups that forced U.S. diplomatic staff to evacuate Sudan back in April. The latest numbers coming in show that nearly 2.8 million people have now fled the violence, which is in its 11th week. John.",

They are pretty ideologically appealing group for someone who is critical of affirmative action. Even though there has been a wave of anti-Asian hate in the last three or four years, Asian Americans are often thought of as a model minority.
