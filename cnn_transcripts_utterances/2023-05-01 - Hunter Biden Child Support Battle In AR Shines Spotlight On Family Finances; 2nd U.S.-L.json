Hunter Biden's Finance is taking center stage in a small Arkansas courtroom today. The President's son appearing before a judge is part of a child custody support battle -- the support battle, excuse me. The years old paternity dispute began back in 2019, but escalated last week after the mother of one of Hunter Biden's children ask the Arkansas judge to hold Hunter Biden in contempt for failing, she says, to turn over finance documents. Today, the judge ordering Hunter Biden to answer more questions about his investments and his art sales under oath in a June deposition, a trial right now on the books for July. And now, to the race to escape war torn Sudan. Another 100 Americans are safe in Saudi Arabia after evacuating over the weekend. The United States government launching two convoys to evacuate private citizens and escorting them to U.S. Navy ship in Port Sudan. The New York Times reporting that armed American drones flew overhead and guarded those buses as they made the 525-mile journey to the Red Sea. Many evacuee say they are relieved to be safe, but are heartbroken to leave loved ones behind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "That's a really good question, John, and it's one that we really just don't have a definitive answer to at this point. As you said, there were two U.S. organized convoys that headed from Khartoum to Port Sudan over the weekend. And on those convoys were American citizens, also locally employed staff. Those are Sudanese folks who have worked at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum and then, citizens from allied countries.And the U.S. government, this is the first time that they had actually organized convoys for U.S. citizens actually, after quite a bit of pressure from those Americans saying that the U.S. government wasn't doing enough, because previously they had been referencing them to convoys that were led by allied nations or flights out of the countries by U.S. allies and their partners. Also, over the weekend, we saw that there was a U.S. Navy vessel that was at Port Sudan. And this morning, we're hearing from our colleagues at CNN International who spoke with the U.S. official on the ground in Jeddah, that there were about a hundred Americans that were on that Navy vessel that went from Port Sudan over to Jeddah, bringing those Americans obviously to safety. As you said, the remaining question is how many Americans still want to leave Sudan. And according to the State Department, they have facilitated about a thousand Americans to get out of the country that's working, you know, with their allies and partners. And they say there are less than 5,000 who have reached out for some kind of support from the U.S. government. Not all of those Americans want to leave. So we'll be watching to see how that demand continues to mount or continues to lessen over the course of the next few days and weeks. But, of course, we know there was that 72-hour ceasefire that was agreed to on Sunday that could make conditions a little better. But still fighting continues. John?",

They want to go after Republican plan because they believe that going after what the Republicans proposed, it's politically advantageous, even though the Republican plan has no chance of becoming law.Really, there are a few different options here. One is actually have a negotiation here, one that is something that the White House says they're not going to do because they believe that debt ceiling should be increased without any condition. Today in Israel, Speaker McCarthy made clear, there'll be no debt ceiling increase with -- that would be simply a clean increase. There must be some condition. So one side has to cave. The question will be, whether Democrats will break ranks from the White House pressure Biden to come to the negotiating table. Perhaps, we need to get a little bit closer to that deadline, which could be in June, July before things get really, really serious because right now it's still theatrics and posturing.",

You know, what are they going to do?So Bernie Sanders trying over the weekend to offer the solution. The Republicans say we want to negotiate all at once. The President says, debt ceiling clean, but if you want to talk about budget cuts after, first, raise the debt limit, then we can talk about the budget. Bernie Sanders says, why don't we give it a try? Combine the two. Everybody say they're doing it the way they want. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Well, I think we can start negotiating tomorrow, but you cannot be holding the American people or the world's economy hostage.

I, --I didn't even take an economics class in college but I'm not the expert on that. But the other thing about it is these cuts that are being talked about are like, if you're going in to buy a car and negotiating over like the floor mats, it's not what would really change the fiscal health.
