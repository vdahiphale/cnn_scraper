Stewart, a free agent and a former MVP, hoping to get rid of WNBA rules forcing teams to travel on commercial flights under most circumstances. Now, she tweeted earlier this week, \"I would love to be part of a deal that helps subsidize charter travel for the entire WNBA. I would contribute my NIL\" -- name, image, and likeness -- \"posts and production hours to ensure we all travel in a way that prioritizes player health and safety, which ultimately results in a better product.\" Let's discuss now. Bomani Jones, the host of \"GAME THEORY WITH BOMANI JONES\" joins me now, which is, by the way, now streaming season two on HBO Max. Bomani, good morning to you. So let's talk about this. There are several WNBA and NBA stars who have signaled their support by responding to Stewart's tweet with the hands-up emojis. I mean, this issue has come up several times over recent years. Should WNBA players still be publicly campaigning for this right now? BOMANI JONES, HOST, HBO-HBO MAX \"GAME THEORY WITH BOMANI JONES\", HOST, \"THE RIGHT TIME WITH BOMANI JONES\" PODCAST:  Oh, they absolutely should be. I do think that there's a bit of a dilemma at play with this. Like, this is an issue that Major League soccer also had a few years ago, which is that it has become standard, at least in the minds of professional athletes, that you fly private, right, and that flying commercial is not good. It's also worth noting that as we know more about the effect that flying has on the body and how it affects athletes, it's probably a cost to doing business that you should be flying private. The problem, of course, is the same reasons those teams don't fly private is the same reason that I don't fly private. It costs a lot of money to do that. However, if this is what the cost of doing business is -- if a team cannot afford to fly its players private, then the person who owns the team probably cannot afford to own it. I think the league needs to find a way to make this possible or, if nothing else, putting in a prohibition against flying private, which is what the issue is right now. The leagues have it set in order to protect the owners that ain't got that much money that they're not allowed to fly private. And if an owner can do it, they should allow them to do it. And if that's a problem for those who can't afford it, they should probably sell to somebody richer.",

And then they come drop off the plane and then somebody does it. This is much more of a profit-maximizing enterprise. They look at it differently. But they don't have to have those rules in place. Those rules are there to protect the owners at the expense of the players. And I've been on a flight before with the WNBA team and you sit there and you think about it. They played a game the night before. They're getting on the plane the next day. They're playing a game the same night and they're all walking on the plane getting behind me, right? So you think about people -- their height, sitting there cramped into a middle seat, and then they're supposed to play a basketball game that night. I mean, that just sounds ridiculous on its face. So one way or another, they need to figure out how to come up with the money. And if it's a loss, I think this is just a cost that's necessary for them to do business in an optimal way.",
