It's Thursday, February 22nd, 05President Biden might be taking a page from Donald Trumps playbook to deal with the crisis at the border. The president's considering executive action to restrict the ability of migrants to seek asylum if they cross the border illegally. It's a move that's not dissimilar to the controversial actions taken by Donald Trump during his presidency. And you could consider it an extension of some of the toughest border measures in that border compromise bill that was recently blown up by the Republicans who had demanded it in the first place. Let's bring in Michelle Price. She has national political reporter for \"The Associated Press\", and she is joining us from South Carolina, where she is ahead of this weekend's Republican primary there. Michelle, good morning. It's always wonderful to have you. Let's talk about these asylum policies that the administration is considering changing via this executive order. What would they do? And why are people describing them as a return potentially to Trump era policies?",

But one of the proposals that is under consideration it seems to be potentially capping the number of people that could come in so save 5,000 people, 5,000 asylum seekers tried to cross the border that they could try to cap the number coming in.And this is one of the proposals that was in that bipartisan border security bill that was to negotiated in Congress that House Republicans wouldn't take up. And just kind of speaks to the politics of this that Joe Biden and his campaign see this is enough of a political liability for him that they are considering doing this alone under executive authority, rather than trying to work through Congress where nothing is moving through. But the authority that they would be using to do this is the same authority that Donald Trump used in the early days of his, his tenure to ban and travelers coming in from Muslim majority countries. And the American Civil Liberties Union was one who challenged that. They've already signaled that if Biden does this under this same section of law, that they would challenge this in court as well.",

Here was a tweet from Congressman Troy Garcia who said yesterday and again, this is the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.Quote: This is a Trump policy. People seek asylum because they fear for their lives. President Biden would be making a grave mistake if he moves forward with this policy. This, of course, is -- there's a couple of dynamics at play here, right? I mean, were seeing a change in the makeup of the people who are coming across the southern border. There's now more reports of people coming from across the world, not just from the triangle countries that were so much a focus for so long. There are additional concerns about national security related to that. And then there's also been the southern state governors taking a lot of migrants from the border and flying are busing them to blue states and cities and causing additional problems and putting more pressure on the administration. I mean, is this an acknowledgment from the Biden administration that Donald Trump was right about some of this. How should we be looking at it?",

But there are definitely questions about whether paying for lawyers for the former president is the best use of donors' money. Reporters pressed Lara Trump on this.

They tend to be skeptical if things like party machines. So, when she says putting in somebody very trusted by Donald Trump who's got the last name Trump at the RNC, that actually might go along way for rank and file Republican voters, the ones who turn out in primaries.Now when it comes to donors, especially if big donors, that's an entirely different question. You know, the RNC, as you mentioned, they are having fundraising and troubles. This is an organization that is supposed to help elect Republicans up and down the ballot. Their main mission is not just the presidential race, and it's certainly not just paying Donald Trump's legal fees. There are ways for people who want to donate to help him with those legal fees right now. And he is still struggling to pay those and that does not even take into account the half a billion dollars in legal judgments against and that's just the lawyers fees. So, you know, we've seen. Some mixed messaging from Donald Trump's team about whether if there's leadership change goes forward, which we expect it will, whether they will start paying his legal fees. RNC has done that in the past, but the RNC does not have a lot of money right now to be spreading around on all these different causes.",

I want to read you a portion of what he said. He said clearly, Mr. Biden, is demonstrating behavior in the style of a Hollywood cowboy to cater to domestic political interests. And he then holds President Putin up as someone who never makes offensive remarks.So, look, it's relatively common in Russia for officials below Putin to sort of hurl insults at the U.S. It plays very well and the Russian propaganda where the sort of confrontational foreign policy with the U.S. is a way of deflecting the blame of Putin or any of the ills inside the country. So that I think is what we're seeing here. President Putin, though, himself, usually tens as Mr. Peskov was alluding to, to stay aloft of these kinds of public spat -- Kasie.",

So, you know, if you look at the theme of these events, people getting charged for things that we in the West thing is they're being overcharged, if I can call it that and then the being used in a diplomatic game. So, has she been called up with that? You're right to point out that there are travel warning. So she would have been aware of the risk and she knows, you know, Russia well, of course as well.

So, just a little ways to go. Look at the West Coast, so the extended range outlook? Yes. There is the potential we could break that record. That's significant. Remember, these are the months where we fill up the reservoirs, buildup the snowpack, and we start to ensure our water availability as we head into the spring and summer months. Now, elsewhere across it the country, these are generally quiet aside from a few scattered showers, there is the potential for some heavier rainfall across the Ohio River Valley today. Weak disturbance moving through not a significant concern, but definitely it will impact your travel conditions as you move along the east coast through the next couple of days, 48 hours. A cold front behind it will temporarily cool things down, not a significant cooldown, but enough, you'll feel it. But the big extended outlook shows a warming trend over the East Coast.
