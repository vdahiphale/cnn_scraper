I am live at Chez Vachon Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, with Kasie Hunt, Phil Mattingly, with us in New York. And another big round of polling locations just opened across the state. Take a look. It is now or never, basically, for Nikki Haley. This could very well be her last best shot at beating Donald Trump. Last night at his final rally before today's primary, Trump predicted the GOP race will end today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Now we're down to two people. And I think one person will be gone probably tomorrow. And the other one will be gone in November. But now is the time for the Republican Party to come together. We have to unify. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so there's been a bit of an incoherence, frankly, in the Republican Party on this. The Democrats have had a more coherent position.

On the Republican side, I think that's why you saw Nikki Haley really try in the Republican primary to say, hey, guys, you can't talk about this issue the way I can talk about this issue.I have experienced things like going through a pregnancy, knowing what it's like to struggle with these issues. And it does give you the ability to talk about it in a more personal way. This is an emotional issue. It is not just an issue of the head. It is one of the heart. And so having those messengers who can connect is really important.",

      "sentences": "It is the biggest motivator for Republican voters. And you look inside these numbers, they still trust Donald Trump to be -- to take the hardest line on immigration. I mean, Ron DeSantis, of course, argued that he made a bunch of promises on immigration and didn't keep them. But the Republican voters don't believe that. They think Trump is the only person who can get control of what most Americans legitimately believe is a crisis at the border. So, yes, I would anticipate this topic being a pretty top shelf issue for the Republicans, and not just in the presidential race. I mean, you're going to see this in the big Senate races all the way down.",

Because of the kind of tactic or stunt of sending a bunch of immigrants into blue states, it's destabilizing some of the politics in our own party. You have the New York mayor saying, look, I can't handle all this stuff, which is kind of the point the red state governors have been making for a while. I think we live in -- everybody is now living in their own private QAnon in terms of the information environment people have. If you're a Republican, all you're seeing is immigration crisis. If you're a Democrat, you're not seeing it at all. And that's how people wind up, I think, being surprised by some of these issues.",
