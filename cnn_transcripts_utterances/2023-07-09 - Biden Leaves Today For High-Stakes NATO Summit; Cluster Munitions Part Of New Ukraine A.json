He will start at the United Kingdom, where he will meet with King Charles, the first face-to-face meeting since his coronation, as well as the British prime minister. He will then move on to Lithuania, where he will attend that critical NATO summit, and conclude his trip in Finland. Now, looming over all of these meetings is going to be the war in Ukraine, especially now after the U.S. announcement that they will be providing cluster munitions to Ukraine, as it tries to make gains in its counteroffensive against Russia. Now, this was a controversial announcement, and one that was considered for sometime within the administration, and now is moving forward after unanimous decision among President Biden's national security team. The reason there is concern is because this is a weapon that over 100 nations agree should not be used in modern warfare. And number two, this is a munition that includes scattering bomblets in large areas, and that is something that could pose a long-term risk to civilians. For those reasons, some members of President Biden's own party have pushed back against this decision. President Biden was the one that ultimately gave it the go, and he also conceded that it was a difficult decision for him to make. So, that will be a topic of discussion this upcoming week. But then also is the question of whether there is a path to NATO membership for Ukraine. That is something that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has been asking for, for sometime. Now, what President Biden has said, it's premature for Ukraine to be a member now, to be part of this alliance at this moment. But there could be a path forward. And that's going to be one of the issues that will be discussed during the summit. So, again, a lot of pressing questions for President Biden as he heads out on a weeklong trip which is going to be critical -- Bianna, Victor.",

I would like to see a group, a commission, a council put together that lays out what's required and a date certain for that report. There are some who'd go further. They would simply say, look, this war could continue for sometime. We can't let Russia have a veto on the membership. So, the membership could entail all of Ukraine. It's not in a conflict zone so that NATO could go in and secure -- help secure the bulk of Ukraine, including Kyiv, and other major cities against Russian air attacks. And this will be Mr. Putin's problem. So, there's really three major polls of opinions on this. I think we'll come out somewhere in the middle.

They are being outgunned by the Russians on a consistent basis.And in order to put this counteroffensive together, they have to win the so-called counterfire battle against Russian artillery in at least a limited portion of the front to make that penetration, to be able to clear the minefields, deal with reserves up close, and get their forces into maneuver warfare in Russia rear. So, this DPICMs are going to be useful in that respect but it was essential to provide because we could not keep up with the demand for the conventional 155. That having been said, we would not do an offensive like this without air power. We wanted to sweep the battlefield well in-depth, be on the front line. We would not do it without long-range artillery fires including ATACMS, and we wouldn't do it without electronic warfare superiority which we've also withheld from Ukraine. So, we are asking them to do some things against a very sophisticated Russian defense. We've all put the Russian forces out. Yeah, they fumbled in Kyiv. They're not very good on the attack. But putting people behind a couple of minefields and give them anti-tank weapons, and it's a much tougher problem for Ukraine going forward than it was defending. I think we have to recognize this.",

So, you know, I think the Ukrainians have every right to ask for the use of these weapons and I think we have every right to provide them. And I hear the humanitarian concerns.

It remains to be seen what's going to happen in the end, but in their opinion, the three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati acknowledged that their views were, quote, initial. They also said they may be wrong. But there is a reason why they expedited the appeal of the preliminaryinjunction. The judges say they are the goal of resolving the matter no later than September 30th this year, in an effort to mitigate any potential harm, from that possibility, to reach their conclusion, they were granted a stay of a lower court injunction which had been blocking enforcement of the state's ban on health care providers, performing gender-affirming surgeries and administering hormones or puberty blockers to transgender minors, spanning the duration of the appeal. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti who is a Republican, acknowledged Saturday after the ruling was announced that this case is far from over, but this is a big win, he said, adding that the Court of Appeals lifted the junction, meaning the law can be fully enforced and recognized that Tennessee is likely to win the constitutional argument and the case. On the other side, the American Civil Liberties Union blasted the decision, in a statement, also saying that this case is far from over. This ruling is beyond disappointing, they said, in a heartbreaking development for thousands of transgender youth, their doctors and their families. As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all of the transgender youth in Tennessee to know that this fight is far from over and we will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated, and Tennessee is made a safer place to raise every family. Now, Victor and Bianna, the ruling means that the ban will now take place immediately. This is the first time a U.S. federal court rules in favor of a law banning health care providers from providing transition care to transgender minors.

And so immunity is not meant to sort of give a total blanket or a complete shield to any type of conduct. But it is to allow aggrieved parties to hold those who have violated their civil rights responsible.So in this case, you have specifically the officers involved, and the case I think will rightfully proceed clearly against them. The issue will be whether or not the plaintiffs in the case have alleged that there has been a policy. Was there a Memphis Police Department policy that the Supreme Court would require that would have essentially led to this action. And that is going to be what the plaintiffs may have to very well amend their complaint and move around a little bit to make sure that they could make those allegations fit. But the judge has to accept what is in the complaint is true at this point -- at this stage. So you can't just make a blanket allegation that somebody did wrong. You have to say, somebody did wrong and tie it to some policy on their part especially when you're talking about a sovereign municipality or state that this is what they did.",

Because she's setting the stage for the story line of this World Cup which is that one of the greatest soccer players in U.S. history and frankly one of the greatest soccer players in the history of soccer worldwide, male or female, Megan Rapinoe. This is her last dance. This is her swan song. This is her goodbye, hopefully for them, victory tour. And so I think it is in many ways absolutely perfect. She introduced herself to so many of us at the 2011 World Cup with what I believe it the greatest pass in history from her foot all the way across the field, yards and yards. I mean literally one of the longest passes ever to the forehead of Abby Wambach who scored a goal that tied a game Brazil against Brazil and moved into and allowed the U.S. to win.

Extraordinary use of her time both off the field and on field. And then as you mentioned, LGBTQ issues, continues to fight for those. And in 2019 when she was leading the U.S. to victory in the World Cup, U.S. athlete wearing the red, white and blue on foreign soil. The President of the United States, Donald Trump was attacking her, and she was fending him off while also becoming not only the leading goal scorer of that World Cup but also the most valuable player at that World Cup.
