It's 8Israel says it's been hitting Hamas targets including tunnels and underground combat spaces. The IDF is again urging people to head south as it expands ground operations inside Gaza. Now all of this as hundreds of thousands of Israeli forces prepare for unexpected incursion into the enclave in response to the Hamas massacres of October 7. Israel now believes the group is holding 230 hostages. In Gaza, there is fear and uncertainty over what happens next reports indicate cellular and internet communications have been partially restored. But hospitals are at capacity if they're functioning at all. There wasn't enough food, water medicine or fuel to go around and very little aid coming in from Egypt. CNN's Scott McLean joins us from London with the latest. So Scott, what are you seeing from Gaza and hearing from Israel?",

But we have heard from one journalist in central Gaza who said that yesterday the Israeli artillery in his words did not stop. He also said that gunfire could be heard from the eastern part of the strip near the perimeter fence. And he said that patient showing up at the hospital and Darrell Bala (ph), this is in central Gaza. We're showing up not with wounds from airstrikes, but wounds from artillery. And none of this obviously, it's helping the humanitarian situation right now, in Gaza, where you have had only a trickle of aid getting in no fuel getting in as well a new video from the AFP shows just how desperate people actually have been with people ransacking a U.N. warehouse. They're taking out carrying out bags of food to try to feed their families.None of this, though, seems to be seems to be facing the Israeli leadership. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, gave a speech yesterday where he said that Israeli troops enter Gaza on Friday, calling Gaza in his words the fortress of evil. He also seemed to address criticism of Israel's tactics and the growing civilian death toll in Gaza, saying that those who accused the IDF of war crimes are, quote, \"hypocritical liars, who lacked so much as one drop of morality\". He also made clear that Israel is just getting started. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Scott McLean in London.They are concerns a ground offensive in Gaza would complicate efforts to negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas. A short time ago, I spoke to Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Here it is. MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: We're talking here about the American model. Interestingly enough, the American model of having forces take over a neighborhood or a village and then using that neighborhood and village as a springboard for the next village and the next neighborhood. This is as the advantage of reducing the casualties on our side. Keep in mind, this is a citizens army. We're sending our children out there, our fathers are, it's okay, there's our mothers to -- to fight and we understand there's going to be a price to be paid. We want to keep that price as low as humanly possible. It also has the advantage of ramping up pressure on Hamas. And though, you know, there's a sense that I've heard in recent days that that by in launching the ground initiative, Israel would be forfeiting some of its leverage on Hamas to release the hostages. The sense tears, it's just the opposite, that if Hamas is surrounded and in desperate straits desperate straits, it will keep the hostages in good shape and will not harm them and use them as a last bargaining chip to get out of Gaza.

I think it's just logical as the incursion increases, and Hamas finds itself increasingly isolated and surrounded, then its terms for releasing the hostages will become, I think, more lenient, and the initial terms than what they initially said was they wanted an open ended ceasefire, as well as the release of all Hamas prisoners from Israeli jails. And we're talking about terrorists who have the blood of many, many hundreds of Israelis on their hands. And that would be unacceptable to Israeli society. And a ceasefire basically being that Hamas wins. We'd get away withmass murder, and Israel would lose its deterrence power.

He started with smaller roles and eventually landed higher profile roles but it was being cast as the very funny and sarcastic Chandler on Friends that made him so famous. Off screen the actors became as close as their characters on the show and they famously negotiated together to become some of the highest paid actors on television at the time. Now despite the joy he did bring to audiences on camera, he said he struggled with addiction and eventually was able to share those struggles with his fans in his book.

And just to global stability, and Ukraine is really the linchpin in the fight for democracy and -- and for staving off Russian aggression. So thus far, the U.S. has already allotted some 75 billion in aid to Ukraine, which is a significant amount. But when you think of the big picture, U.S. military spending is somewhere around 801 billion.And as a percentage of U.S. GDP, U.S. aid to Ukraine is 0.33% of its GDP. And this is actually less than some of its allies. The U.S. has allies, like Norway, and it's actually coming at a time when U.S. economy is doing pretty well. It's been growing at a very fast rate in the last several years, and is somewhere around just under 5%. And there's also just more international support for the war in Ukraine with 45 other countries helping out as well. Now, the support for the war in Israel's war in Gaza, is more complicated.

You don't have as much international support. The international community is calling for a ceasefire into attend to the growing humanitarian crisis.And then domestically speaking, I think Biden is probably striking the right chord for moderates, maybe even across the aisle as well, but not doing enough from the Republican standpoint, and definitely alienating progressives.
