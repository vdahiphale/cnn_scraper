And \"The New York Times\" sues OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. Live from CNN Center, it's Wednesday, December 27th. I'm Paula Newton, and this is CNN NEWSROOM. Good evening, and we do begin with fears of a widening conflict in the Middle East. The US says it is downing a growing number of missiles and drones in the Red Sea launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels who claim to be acting in solidarity with Palestinians. Now, Iran denies any involvement. This is just days after another group backed by Iran attacked US forces in the region. Washington is on edge this holiday season with the worsening situation -- security situation, not just in the Red Sea, of course, but also in the Indian Ocean, Iraq, and Syria. The Danish shipping company, meantime, that giant Maersk, has said it will resume operations in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aiden. That's after the establishment of the US-led naval mission to protect commercial shipping in the area. But other big names, like Hapag-Lloyd and Evergreen are steering clear for now, telling CNN they will continue rerouting vessels via the Cape of Good Hope, which, of course, adds thousands of nautical miles to that journey. It's leading to new concerns about global supply chains and the prospect of rising costs. For more on all this and those fears that the Israel-Hamas war could become a wider regional crisis, Oren Liebermann joins us now from the Pentagon. Oren, I know how close you've been watching this for weeks. Now, if we deal with those attacks, given the seriousness of these attacks, especially at times when it has struck US personnel, was this kind of a response inevitable? And do you think any kind of more robust response does deter from more attacks?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think very much, given the latest attack in Syria against US forces, one in which Kata'ib Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy in the Middle East, launched an attack drone on US forces in Erbil, in Iraq, and wounded three US servicemembers, one of them critically, a US response was very much inevitable.Largely, the US has tried to calibrate its responses, not retaliating against each individual strike, but waiting and seeing if there was a large enough batch and a large enough group of attacks on US forces that it felt it needed to respond. But given this latest attack, which injured specifically US forces in Iraq, the US responded quickly, carrying out three different strikes against positions in Iraq where Kata'ib Hezbollah -- again, an Iranian proxy -- worked its drone program. US Central Command says a number of militants were likely killed and no civilians were affected. However, this does cause some tension with the Iraqi government, which called them hostile acts and an infringement of Iraqi sovereignty. So there is this tension that the US is always watching, given the fact that the US operates in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government. This is just another one of the layers of complexity here when the US tries to figure out if, how, and when to respond. The US warning, as it has in the past, Paula, that if these attacks continue, the US will respond again. And from what we're seeing, these attacks are very much continuing. It's about 100 at this point against US forces in Iraq and Syria since the beginning of the Gaza war.",

And given, you know, how bold those Houthi rebels in Yemen seem to be at this point in their posture, it will be an interesting region to watch in the days and weeks to come.Oren Liebermann for us at the Pentagon, really appreciate it. Meantime, Israel's military leaders say the war with Hamas won't end anytime soon. The chief of staff for the IDF said Tuesday the fight will continue for, quote, \"many more months.\" He says Israel is close to its goal of dismantling Hamas in northern Gaza and is now concentrating more on the southern part of the territory. And I want to warn you now, we have some alarming new video that's just come in to CNN. We are going to show you a still image, as the video is just too disturbing here. The footage, which has been circulating on social media, you see it there -- that's the still -- appears to show Palestinian men and at least two children stripped down, as you can see there, to their underwear while in IDF detention. CNN is unable to confirm where the video was shot. There was CNN geolocation shows it was filmed in Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza City. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment, but has not yet heard back. In the past, though, the IDF has said it has stripped detainees to ensure they were not carrying explosives. Elliott Gotkine is with us now from Tel Aviv. And, Elliott, obviously, as you said, disturbing images just given the vulnerable position that those men, but crucially, children are in, we did not receive any kind of comment from the IDF. But we do note there are comments in the past. And yet, this is obviously going to raise questions about their tactics in Gaza right now and, you know, the accusations that it's heavy-handed on all fronts.",

And presumably, this is not, as I say, the first time that we've seen these kinds of images and won't be the last because in this war zone -- that is the Gaza Strip right now -- Israel and the IDF feels that it's up against an enemy that is completely embedded within the civilian population, that it's impossible to tell who is a militant and poses a potential threat and who is not. And that is why it is taking those precautions. That is the IDF's perspective. But as we say, we've heard from the chief of the general staff about this war potentially lasting for several months, obviously, there's pressure to kind of reduce the intensity of this phase of war from these, you know, strikes from the air, land, and sea to make it much more focused on a higher value Hamas targets. And that was one of the main topics of conversation that Ron Dermer, who's a member of the war cabinet, one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest allies, that was one of the topics of conversation that he had on Tuesday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. So that is very much something that is being discussed. Israel has made some moves to factor in what it's being asked to do by the US, such as opening the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to go directly from Israel to the Gaza Strip, something it said initially that it wouldn't do. And we heard from just Mark Regev, one of the government spokespeople earlier on CNN, saying that civilian casualties are going down. But at least according to the Hamas-run health ministry, death toll now in Gaza since the start of this war nearing 21,000 and says most of those are women and children, although it doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians -- Paula.",

Now, Trump's critics have been trying to disqualify him over his role in the January 6th attack on the US capitol. About a week ago, Colorado Supreme Court did the opposite, ruling Trump is ineligible there. The Colorado court cited the Constitution's insurrection clause, but that decision has since been paused pending appeal.CNN's Marshall Cohen joins us now from Washington DC with more on the case and what it might mean for the presidential race. Marshall, I'm glad that you're on this because it's been hard for legal analysts -- never mind voters -- to try and understand where any of this is leading. Does the Michigan case offer any more clarity?",

      "sentences": "Well, not really, Paula, unfortunately, because now we've got a decision in Michigan, the opposite decision in Colorado. Everyone pretty much agrees that the final decision is going to be up to the United States Supreme Court. But notably, Trump has not yet filed his appeal of the Colorado decision, but it's expected. So clarity is needed.But the news today, as you mentioned at the top, is that the Michigan Supreme Court went and affirmed the decision from lower courts in Michigan to reject this 14th Amendment challenge. Remember, after the civil war here in the US, the members of Congress passed the 14th Amendment. And one of the provisions of that amendment says that anybody who's sworn oath to uphold the constitution and then engage in insurrection is banned from office. But enforcing that ban in a 21st century context has proved very challenging. Of course, it is a novel legal effort. So the Michigan justices said that this was not the right venue, that the courts are not the right place for this. They upheld the decision from a trial judge there that said Congress needs to weigh in. Let me read for you something that one of the justices said this morning in her ruling. It's very notable that she went out of her way to make this point. She said, \"I would affirm the Court of Appeals' ruling on this issue, which still allows the appellants to renew their legal effort as to the Michigan general election later in 2024 should Trump become the Republican nominee.\" What that means is that, okay, these challenges have been rejected for now in a bunch of states, including Michigan, but in those same states, Michigan -- Minnesota, too -- Trump can be challenged again for the general if he's lucky enough to win the Republican nomination. And it sounds like that might be exactly what the challengers in Michigan want to do. One of their lead attorneys, Mark Brewer, said in the statement that \"the decision is disappointing, but we will continue, at a later stage, to seek to uphold this critical constitutional provision designed to protect our republic.\" So a huge win for Donald Trump today in the critical battleground state of Michigan, but he suffered a huge loss last week in Colorado. And everyone, as I said, is waiting for the Supreme Court to possibly get involved and provide some guidance for the entire nation on this critical question of who is and isn't eligible to be president of the United States.",

Antony Blinken has been holding talks with the Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The pair are set to discuss the near record number of migrants trying to enter the US from Mexico. US Homeland Security Secretary, meantime, Alejandro Mayorkas, is also part of the US delegation. The US is asking Mexico to help drive down that number. Meantime, there was a slight drop -- we say slight drop -- in the number of migrant encounters reported Tuesday, but officials say the surge is still stretching resources. And we get all of that information from our Rosa Flores, who is at her post at Eagle Pass Texas, on the border. Rosa, I know how carefully and closely you've been watching all of this. You have told us before, right, Mexico is key in controlling who arrives at the US southern border.

Just to give you a sense of what's happening, if you look over my shoulder, you see a bridge.If you're an American, if you live in this border town, and normally, you cross back and forth to see family or you go to a restaurant in Mexico and then come back, right now, the wait time, it's 15 hours. On a bad day, people here in Eagle Pass tell me that it'll be two or three hours if there's a lot of activity, but 15 hours. And so, regular Americans really don't have access to their international bridge right now because to deal with the migrant crisis, one of the things that the Biden administration has done is that they closed several ports of entry, and that includes one of two bridges here in Eagle Pass, Texas. Now, here's the other part of the story. You look behind me over my right shoulder, you see this empty field. Just last week, there were thousands of migrants that were -- they're waiting to be transported to processing facilities. Now, the US government, the federal government, has gotten really good at something called \"decompression.\" What that means is that when there's a migrant surge, they move migrants from an area that is overcapacity to an area that has space. And they've gotten a lot of practice because there's been a lot of migrant surges. And so, if you see behind me, if you're a migrant who has crossed illegally into the United States here through Eagle Pass Texas, you're being moved very quickly. You don't see anybody behind me. And that's for a reason. The United States is trying to surge resources, not just personnel, but also transportation resources, vans, buses, that sort of thing, so that they can move these migrants to an area where they can be processed very quickly. But, Paula, even though the scene looks better, it's improved from last week, the US Customs and Border Protection says that they're not out of the woods yet. It's back to what you were saying at the beginning. If your house is flooded and you've been flooded for -- you've been flooded about five feet, if the water level drops two, three inches, your house is still flooded.",

We'll head to Iceland, where they're celebrating the annual book flood. But before that, these are the headlines for this hour. The office of special counsel Jack Smith is asking a U.S. federal court to prevent Donald Trump from politicizing his upcoming trial on charges he tried to overturn the 2020 election. The counsel says the former president should not be allowed to air, quote, \"irrelevant disinformation and partisan attacks in an attempt to distract the jury.\" The man called a founding father of the euro has died. Jacques Delors, was president of the European Commission from 1985-1994. He was a major proponent of the E.U.'s single currency project. French president Emmanuel Macron says Delors served as an inexhaustible architect of our Europe. He was 98 years old. A U.S. federal court has temporarily blocked a sweeping import ban on Apple's latest smart watches. Apple had filed an emergency request to halt the ban as it appeals the U.S. agency's decision that its top-of- the-line watches violate the patents of a medical technology company. The White House declined to get involved in the dispute, instead allowing the ban to take effect. Cheaper models of the Apple watch are unaffected. So it's a sophisticated online scam that's luring thousands of Americans and stealing millions from them. The targets don't find out, unfortunately, until it's far too late. As CNN's Ivan Watson explains, many of the suspects are being forced to take part under slavelike conditions. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We also know that police have been investigating Lee since October for illegal drug use, allegations the actor repeatedly denied. Lee instead claimed he was tricked into taking drugs and then blackmailed. He brought a lawsuit against the alleged blackmailer, according to South Korean police. Authorities questioned Lee three times over his alleged drug use, most recently, on December 23rd, when he was questioned for 19 hours and released on Christmas Eve. Throughout the investigation, Lee's drug tests repeatedly came back negative. On social media, fans have been paying tribute to the star, whose career spanned two decades. In the United States, news of his death was a top trending topic on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Lee first shot to international fame in 2019, starring as Park Dong- ik, the father of the wealthy Park family in \"Parasite.\" The film went down in Hollywood history, becoming the first non-English language film to take home an Oscar for Best Picture. It also won in three other categories. A funeral for Lee will be held quietly, according to local media, with (INAUDIBLE) family members and colleagues in attendance -- Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
