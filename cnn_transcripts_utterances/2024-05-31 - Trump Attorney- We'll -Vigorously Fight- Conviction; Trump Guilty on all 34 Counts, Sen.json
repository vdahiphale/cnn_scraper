      "sentences": "Welcome to CNN's \"Connect the World\". I'm Omar Jimenez. It is 9 am here in New York where Former President DonaldTrump was found guilty of 34 charges of falsifying business records. This hour, we're going to bring you a comprehensive coverage of the unprecedented and historic verdict. Starting with the sentencing, what are the judge's options here and what is likely to happen? This also doesn't mean the case is over yet. There is still an appeals process that we expect based on what we have heard to come. So what comes next and what grounds could there be for an appeal. We're also bracing for more responses to that damning verdict that came out Thursday and a couple hours from now. The first Former U.S. President ever to be convicted of a crime Donald Trump is expected to use his public platform to restate his case. We could also hear from President Joe Biden as he heads back to the White House today. Now Trump's sentence on those 34 counts will be delivered on July 11, as it's scheduled now, but just a week before the Republicans officially choose their nominee for the November election. He could get probation, though the judge also has the power to impose a prison sentence of up to 4 years for each offense with a maximum of 20 years. For now, though, Trump remains out of prison and of course, he plans to appeal the verdict saying he will fight to the end. Now this was the first of four criminal cases expected to go to trial for Trump and you look at the timeline here. Let's take a look back at some of the key events that brought us here on October 2016. Michael Cohen paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. This is separate from the 150,000 paid to Former Playboy Model Karen McDougal, which was discussed a month earlier. Now Trump has publicly denied those affairs. But in 2018, Michael Cohen pleads guilty to two counts of making unlawful campaign contributions and implicates Trump directly in the scheme. March of 2023, Trump is indicted by a grand jury and April 15 of this year the trial begins. CNN's Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz have the latest from Washington. All right, so just get us up to speed on how this verdict went down and what we can expect to see in the coming months ahead?",

      "sentences": "Omar, it took seven weeks for this trial to play out, 20 witnesses from the prosecution andthen two witnesses that the defense presented. And then when the jury went to deliberate it took them a little bit over a day to come to a unanimous verdict. They deliberated for just under 12 hours. And over the course of that, 12 hours, there weren't that many indications about what the jury was thinking. One thing that we know that they zeroed in on was the questions of the testimony about campaign finance. One of the underpinnings that the prosecutors argued to the jury was something that Donald Trump intended to break the law. Related to they asked about the testimony of an early and crucial witness. David Pecker, who was a top the National Enquirer as the -- big boss over the publishing company there, and David Pecker had spoken about not just talking to Michael Cohen about burning stories for Trump to help his campaign when there were negative things, women wanted to put out there in the press. But he spoke about how he talked to Trump directly. We don't know what the jury ultimately was saying behind those closed doors in their deliberations, we will have to wait and see if anyone from the jury comes out to devolve. But we do know they did not get to the point where they told the court they were having trouble coming to -- an agreement. And when they delivered that verdict right at the end of the court day, yesterday, it was unanimous. And it was unanimously guilty on all 34 counts of business falsification of records that Donald Trump faced. His attorney, Todd Blanche, after the verdict, came on television, did multiple interviews and said they're going to be fighting this they're going to be appealing. We also know that they are very likely not to ask the judge on -- at his July 11 sentencing to put him in jail. It is a possibility with these felony convictions. But we know Trump's team is going to strongly make the arguments that this should not be something that would ever result in some sort of incarceration for the former president. And here's a little bit more about what Blanche had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TODD BLANCHE, DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY: We have motions due in a couple of weeks in front of Judge Merchan, which we're going to vigorously fight and restate a lot of what I'm saying to you tonight and other things that happened or the trial that we think just made the trial unfair, including the testimony of Ms. Daniels. If that is not successful, then as soon as we can appeal, we will. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Katelyn Polantz, really appreciate it. Thank you. Now the Biden campaign wasted no time slamming Donald Trump saying the verdict shows quote, no one is above the law. The campaign also warning supporters, that Trump is likely to set fundraising records after the verdict. And Biden also repeating that the only way to beat Trump is at the ballot box in November.

And really, they're taking a bit of a subdued approach,because at this point, they don't see this conviction really changing the election calculus entirely. They really do want to keep a focus on issues and frame this as yet another example, that in their central theme that Donald Trump poses a threat to democracy. But all of this was reflected in their sharply worded statement that came out shortly after the verdict where they said, quote, convicted felon or not Trump will be the Republican nominee for president. The White House also released a statement that you see they're keeping it very brief saying that they respect the rule of law and have no additional comment. But again, it is the Biden campaign that is leading the charge here. And we also saw a fundraising email that went out yesterday after the verdict was reached. And the president -- told supporters of the Trump conviction could fire up his supporters and lead to those fundraising records. And so he was also asking for those grassroots donations to keep the focused on the president and him getting voted in November. Now, the president remained largely out of public view. Yesterday, he was commemorating the ninth anniversary of the death of his son Beau. He is returning to the White House this morning where he will have a celebration with the Kansas City Chiefs. That is usually a lighthearted event, but it is also an opportunity for reporters to ask him questions. So we'll see whether or not he takes any questions about this verdict. But again, the campaign is still taking a bit of a subdued approach here. They're trying to signal the Democrats to not get carried away whether that remains their strategy moving forward, still unclear. We have seen how their strategies have evolved as it pertains to this trial over the course of the last few weeks. But the White House at the very least is staying quite quiet on the subject, Omar.",

It was a famous case of Dr. Shepherd that was the basis for a movie, that's one appeal. Second appeal would be the judge's ruling to allow cross examination if Mr. Trump took the stand, a various uncharged conduct relating to E. Jean Carroll and other things involving his alleged criminal past alleged. And the third appeal would be they wanted to call an expert from the Federal Election Commission. And the judge said they couldn't call that person that may be another avenue that was an abuse of discretion. So those are at least three, I'm sure the brainy appellate lawyers, and I'm not one.

And that conspiracy appears to be successful. That is extremely serious. His view is that based on the cases he reviewed, and the charges and the facts of this case, he should get jail time, my prediction, and I always use the word Tasseography, reading the tea leaves. My prediction is the judge either will give a de minimis amount of incarceration, or it's possible for Donald Trump to get probation with home confinement, here's why. He's got to be almost 80 years old. He's been humiliated with the 34 out of 34 counts, which is shocking. And age is of a huge factor in sentencing. The second thing is I am very worried that when Donald Trump goes to prison, if he does, he will be hurt. He will be hurt, he could be attacked. And I'm worried about that. Because I don't think the people in many of the prisons love him as much as his MAGA supporters. Maybe they do. But I'm worried about that. So because he's unique, he's -- generous, he's the Former President of United States. It's hard to put him in a prison, you'd have to have secret service, there's so many things that will be involved, he may be imposed, the judge may impose home detention or the State Department of Correction folks may find a facility that they can call a correction facility.

And even though he can still run for president, the case could have a profound impact on voters and a new analysis piece. CNN Stephen Collinson writes, quote, Americans have never seen an ex-President convicted of a crime and a country already torn apart by bitter political and cultural polarization is likely in for a rocky time.

And if that's the case, it could be a big problem for President Joe Biden in the polls right now. So pretty much this election is neck and neck, nationally, and in those swing states, although there have been some that show Trump had a little bit in the key swing states, but this is going to come down to a few states. The president will try to use this verdict, to say that Donald Trump has extreme, he's a threat to the legal system. With his attempts to burn down the legal system after this verdict, he's a threat to democracy. And that should be the overwhelming argument. If he can't make that the overwhelming argument of this election, if economic factors are more important, then I think the verdict probably isn't going to play that much of an impact. By the time we get to November, it's already it's the end of May. This was a kind of an October surprise at the end of May. And it wasn't really that much of a surprise to many voters.

So you're seeing people that in the past might be more minded to criticize the former president, like, for example, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against him in 2016, the Republican primary. All of these people are getting on board. Rubio even compared what happened yesterday in New York to Fidel Castro's Cuba, which clearly is a bit of a -- comparison. But it shows you where the Republicans, who want to play a part in the party after Donald Trump has finally left the scene, feel that they need to be to avoid alienating Republican voters with a view to a future primary race. So it is not a very brave position for many of these Republicans to take. But it's a sound one politically, the impact of that, of course, is that they're all jumping on this bandwagon and saying the legal system is discredited and corrupt.

When they do they often lose support from the Republican base. And even people who are running in difficult districts -- you know people like Don Bacon or others they still have to get their base to turn out. Yes, they also have to depend on independent and some Democratic voters in those districts, but they have to get their base to turn out and the fastest way to turn the base against you to find yourself in a situation where you have a primary challenger is to go up against Donald Trump. So politically, it's a very difficult and precarious position for Republicans who choose to try to distance themselves from Trump.",

I want to go now to our National Security Correspondent, Natasha Bertrand who is traveling with the defense secretary. Great to see you Natasha look, the message to China was clear and candid.

It will not stop with Ukraine and other would be aggressors and other parts of the world will take note and consider pursuing their own aggressions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, this is been playing out over the course of the past couple of months or so. The discussions andwhat the U.S. saw that led to this point. And that's because the U.S. saw Russian forces building up within Russian territory for a new offensive in Kharkiv. And that's where these discussions began realizing the need for this, especially as Ukraine's leaders asked for the ability to use U.S. weapons to strike right across the border into Russian territory and effectively hit those Russian forces before they attacked. Those discussions took a much more serious tone in May 10th, when Russia launched its new offensive. And then over the course of the next several days, the top U.S. leadership and that includes Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General CQ Brown came to the conclusion and made the recommendation to the President to Joe Biden, that Ukraine should be allowed to use U.S. weapons in Russia in a limited way. They can't use deep strike missiles like attack items that the U.S. has provided. They can use effectively to attack the forces that are masked right along the border there. And it took a while once the decision was made from Biden to essentially hammer out all the details, but according to U.S. officials, it has now as of yesterday, I believe gone into effect. And Ukraine can now for the first time use U.S. weaponry to hit those Russian forces just across the border. And it's significant even if Russia's offensive has stalled. It was able to keep its forces in its supply lines just a couple of miles away there in Russian territory, believing they'd be immune from U.S. weapons now, of course, that is no longer the case. Russia not exactly reacting positively to this news warning of a potential escalation and I believe also warning that it won't change the situation here. So Russia, defiant in the face of what frankly we saw coming because Eleni this has played out, like so many others -- other instances where the U.S. has said no, no, no, no, no and then under domestic and international pressure said yes. It happened with Abrams tanks with attack comes with F6 teens and we're seeing it happen again with his change in U.S. policy.",

But that needs to be more than just words and more than just a security package here and there. What could that involve? Some sort of defense pact, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also pushed to effectively make progress on the conversations about the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO. So there are different ways this could proceed and of course, each of these different agreements could have its own -- its own details, its own limitations, its own abilities to help Ukraine in the long term. But that's the goal here to get to something that is not just in the moment, and not just announcing an aid package every few weeks from the U.S. or from NATO. It is something more robust than that, and something that simply can't be cancelled. And that it seems to be is the goal here with that NATO Summit in Washington coming up in July?",
