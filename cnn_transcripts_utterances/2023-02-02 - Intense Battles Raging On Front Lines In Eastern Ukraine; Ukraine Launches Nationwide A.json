A grueling back and forth reminiscent of World War II made all the worse by a brutal cold of winter.CNN's Fred Pleitgen is there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): All-out winter warfare on the eastern front. We're in a trench with Ukrainian paratroopers. They fire on Russian positions using AKs and a U.S.-supplied Browning heavy machine gun. They're searching for weak spots in our position, says the commander, call sign Ghost. They want to see if we fight back. If we show strong resistance, though, they don't advance. And this is what strong resistance looks like. The Russians are only about 400 yards away, hidden in the snow and fog but constantly firing at the entrenched Ukrainians. The enemy uses all kinds of weapons, Bogdan says, small arms, heavy machine guns, artillery, mortars, rocket launchers and aviation as well. But so far, the Ukrainians say they haven't lost an inch of territory here. The Ukrainians say the situation here is reminiscent of some of the worst times in World War II, where they're not only fighting a strong adversary but the elements as well. The snow, the mud, and the cold make fighting here even tougher. And Ukraine's leadership believes the Russians will soon escalate even more after mobilizing hundreds of thousands of men for a likely spring offensive. But this gunner who goes by the name \"deputy\" says the paratroopers are ready. It will be hard, he says, it will be tough, but we will hold because we stand here for our land. If we don't do it, nobody will. There's a visceral hatred towards Moscow's leaders among these men. In Russia, they have a terrorist dictatorial regime, Bogdan says. So now the civilized world is fighting against this wild medieval dictatorship. As we prepare to leave, incoming grenades explode above. This, the men say, is a relatively quiet day. They expect much worse in the months to come. But their motto is, if not us, who else? Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Krasnohorivka, Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Ukraine has long held the reputation as one of the most corrupt countries in Europe. President Zelenskyy was elected in part on a promise to do something about it. Last month, a number of high level officials either resigned or were fired over corruption allegations. And last night, Zelenskyy promised new reforms were coming to make his country more effective and transparent. Just hours later, the majority leader in Parliament announced a brand new crackdown which included searches of the state tax service dismissal of the entire management team of the customs agency, and notices of suspicion being served to defense ministry officials. One of the raids was on the head of the key tax authority accused of a scheme to effectively look the other way on about $1.2 billion in unpaid taxes. Officials say that searches of his property and office turned up cash totaling about $175,000, plus luxury cars and watches. CNN has reached out for comment. Scott McLean, CNN, London.

An estimated half a million public sector workers striking across the country, including teachers, transport workers, and civil servants. With thousands of schools forced to close, most train lines at a standstill, and government services severely disrupted. Well, here in central London, thousands of public sector workers have marched on Whitehall, the center of government to demand better pay and better working conditions. Trade Unions say the public sector is in a crisis. And this has only been exacerbated by record high inflation and a deepening cost of living crisis. The strikes come amid an ongoing standoff between the government and trade unions.

So, what will break the deadlock here?DOMINIC THOMAS, CNN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR (on camera): That's a great question, John. I mean, in some ways, I wish I knew the answer. I think what could break the deadlock here is that the government's position is a weaker one. We know that they're on their fifth Prime Minister since 2010. And with a general election looming, and unless they can address these issues and the underlying issues that have to do with the cost of living crisis and rising inflation, ultimately, their position is weakened. What we are seeing is that these strikes and that the empathy and sympathy for them is escalating. In some ways, the government has gone down a rather unquestionable path, which is to try and stigmatize and strikers who are already struggling, or shame them in the -- in the public eye. And I don't think they're winning that particular debate. And we see throughout the month of February, a more labor action is planned, and some of it are getting to a kind of historically, an unprecedented level. And so, the standoff will go on until the government breaks and addresses these issues. And if they don't, we're going to go down another road of historical precedent, which was all the way back to say 1979 when the Labour government was brought down under these kinds of circumstances, and paved the way for Margaret Thatcher.

In other words, what would it look like to make and provide tax cuts to the wealthier sectors of society, while at the same time arguing that the inflationary aspect has to be tackled first and foremost, and instead of talking and tackling those kinds of issues, they're going down the road of first of all, not wanting to circular provide further support for public spending. They know that that's not popular with any of their members, and as I said, to go about stigmatizing the strikers and trying to turn public opinion against them.

They got three board seats to care -- and to focus Exxon, to force them to commit to carbon neutrality and to force the renewable resources. I know you -- I can't see you, but I know you're probably rolling your eyes, John. To adopt less fueling (ph) strategy going forward. And that hasn't occurred completely yet. So this is not something that cannot be ignored. This is a very bad look for Exxon, because it's something that they've got to put a mandate going forward. So it is very complicated because there is all these aspects and investments -- where are they going, how are they giving back. And even Chevron in this industry had -- was it $27 billion, as well? So this can't continue to go on, John, is my point. My point is these money investments have to be and solve questions. Just placing a tax and saying, \"Hey, you're bad; we are good.\" It just needs to come together to be able to solve something.",

They're about -- I mean, according to data released by the country's state bank last week, there's just about $3.7 billion left in Pakistan's foreign exchanges there. And that's, according to experts, just enough for about three weeks of imports. It's quite a dire situation here.We're being told that Pakistan isn't going to default, but there are lots of records being broken here at the moment. Pakistan's currency, the rupee, fell dramatically against the USD just earlier last week. You know, it's the worst that it's fallen in about 20 years. There is a huge cost-of-living crisis. I mean, I'm in Islamabad, which is one of the wealthiest cities of this country, but I went out and spoke to a few people on the streets -- bakers, people, you know, who are trying to make a living here, you know, just normal jobs, and this is what they had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IMRAN ULLAH YOUSAFZAI, BAKER (through translator): You look at everything -- flour, gas cylinders, electricity. The rates of everything have shot up. Because of that, our earnings have come down. It's become very difficult to keep surviving like this. SYED JAMSHED BUKHARI, DRIVER (through translator): Since onions became expensive, I've stopped buying them. I've left them. But this is not just stopping at onions. Anything we buy to eat, if we bought one kilo, we buy a quarter of that now. This is the story of every home, not just mine. It's so hard to survive right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The IMF was actually supposed to complete its review of the current program with Pakistan back in November. That's been delayed by two months. Ever since the current government came in, we've had two different finance ministers. At the start of last year, there was a separate finance minister with the previous government. And each minister has had a different economic policy. And with that, I mean, we have a situation, along with the fact that there were -- there were catastrophic floods, historic floods, which have decimated huge parts of the agricultural sector. So the World Bank is saying we've got about $15 billion that Pakistan has lost because of these floods that happened in the summer last year.

Kusama is considered to be one of the world's most famous contemporary artists, sometimes called the Princess of Polka Dots.

This is her second collaboration with Louis Vuitton, the first, more than a decade ago, when she explained a constant theme in her work: eternity.
