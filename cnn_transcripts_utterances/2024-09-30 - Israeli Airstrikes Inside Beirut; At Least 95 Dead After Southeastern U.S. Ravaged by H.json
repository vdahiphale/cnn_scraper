And we begin in the Middle East, where Israel says it has launched new airstrikes in eastern and southern Lebanon today.The Israeli military says it targeted Hezbollah strongholds. Meanwhile, in Beirut, people are on edge after the first Israeli airstrikes overnight within the city limits. You can see the damage in this video from an attack near the city's Cola Bridge, which is a major intersection. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. And this follows an intense barrage of strikes in Lebanon that began about a week ago. Lebanon's health ministry says the attacks on Sunday alone killed more than 100 people and wounded more than 350 others. Israel confirms that it also carried out airstrikes more than 2,000 kilometers away in Yemen on Sunday. Video shot after a strike on a power station shows an inferno with emergency crews on the scene. Houthi-run television says at least four were killed there and 45 others wounded. Israel's defense minister says the strikes in Yemen show that for Israel, quote, no place is too far. Well, senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman joining me now from Beirut. He is live at the scene of the airstrikes in the Lebanese capital -- Ben.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky, those airstrikes took place at about 1 a.m. local time. The target was that flat in that building. And we understand that killed in that strike were three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is a Palestinian group that, frankly, hasn't been particularly active, certainly here in Lebanon in recent years. But they were three members of the group related to security and politics as well.And we spoke to one of the people who lives in an adjacent building, who said he heard the missile come in and then heard the explosion. But he said he had no idea who was living in that particular flat and stressed that it's important at this point to know who's living in your building. But, as you can see, there's still sort of the rubble spread all over the place. They have been trying to clean up the neighboring buildings. Now, yes, as we have pointed out, it is important to keep in mind that this is the first Israeli strike outside what is commonly known as a Dahiya. That's Arabic simply for suburb, but the southern suburbs in particular, where Hezbollah has a very strong presence. This area, the Cola Bridge, is well known. It's a mixed area of various religious sects and others. So it does represent a broadening, or the first step, perhaps, in a broadening of Israel's campaign in Lebanon to not only include those who have been involved in hostilities in the border, but other groups, militant groups, Palestinian groups, who don't have a particularly active presence at this point in Lebanon -- Becky.",

In fact, almost all the inhabitants have left the southern suburbs of Beirut because the Israelis have put out specific warnings for certain buildings. And many people left those areas thinking that Dahiya, the southern suburbs, would be the target of Israel's airstrikes. Clearly, this is a message that they're going to spread those airstrikes beyond that area. And just to give you an idea where we are, this is right here, it's known as the Cola Bridge. Under it is a Lebanese army position.This bridge takes you to the heart of Beirut, straight ahead. It's an overpass, normally very busy. And it's an area, as I said before, it is not, I think it has a Sunni Muslim majority, but there are Christians, there are others who actually live here. So it's not an area affiliated or associated with any political group or activity. It's just sort of a normal area of a city that's very busy and has lots of traffic and shops and whatnot. But it is not of any sort of strategic, political or military significance, just significant, obviously, to the residents of Beirut, who fear that targets will be spreading to areas that, until now, they thought might be relatively safe -- Becky.",

This, you know, ceasefire process that critics say is essentially a fig leaf for an ongoing operation. Meanwhile, the emphasis sort of turns to dealing with the humanitarian situation in Lebanon. We have a million people displaced. It's about a quarter of the population. Just by my house here, there are people sleeping in a park. They have been for days. The needs are incredible. The Lebanese state was already failing before any of this happened. And so, yes, I mean, I think that the Israeli operation continues.
