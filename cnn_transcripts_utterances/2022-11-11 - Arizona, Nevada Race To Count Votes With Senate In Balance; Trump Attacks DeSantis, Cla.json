Let's go into Nevada, which could be the second one. What do we got here? We got Adam Laxalt up by a point.But as you were hinting at in your read, this margin has been closing, closing, closing, closing, closing. Catherine Cortez Masto was once down about three points. She's now down just about one. Let's go down south, southern part of the state Clark County. This margin now six points. The presidential race back two years ago, it was nine, but it was five points when we spoke yesterday as more male votes have come in from Clark County which is the home to Las Vegas. Catherine Cortez Masto's vote toll has gone up. She has closed the gap with Adam Laxalt. Will also go up here to Reno, to Washoe County. Few days ago, Adam Laxalt was ahead here. Now Catherine Cortez Masto, as more mail votes have got counted, she's up by three. There are tens of thousands of male votes still out. I would not be surprised if she continues to close, close, close and eventually jumps out ahead. Now, also a gubernatorial race in the state of Nevada. Right here, Joe Lombardo, the Republican has a somewhat larger lead than Adam Laxalt. It's a three-point advantage. This margin may hold even if the Senate margin flips. This could be another state where we sort of have this split ticket voting, right, where there's just enough people out there and just enough independents in the electorate who say, you know what, I'm going to choose the Republican gubernatorial candidate, and maybe I'm going to go democratic for Senate.",

I think there's a question as to whether or not the Democrats could actually take the lead in some of those uncalled races where they currently are.I just want to go into California for a quick second, and give you an idea of how many votes there still are to be counted. So David Valadao in this district, California 22nd, is up by about 9 percentage points, or -- between a 9 percentage points. But look how much of the estimated vote is reporting. It's just 32 percent. It's just 32 percent. There's two-thirds of the votes still to be counted there. Who knows that race might flip? Or how about here where John Duarte is up by a little -- well, less than a point. Look at that, just 44 percent of the vote is reported. So don't be surprised if some of these California races flip. I'm not saying that they will. But I'm just saying that there's plenty of room (INAUDIBLE) in those races. Finally, you know, we'll just go on to Colorado here. We'll go on to Lauren Boebert district. Yesterday she was trailing, but look now, she has a slight advantage 99 percent of the vote. And I'm not sure there's enough out there for Boebert to lose her lead. But still, one incredibly close race, a close race that nobody thought would be close.",

There's clearly infinite money for Ron DeSantis a run. But there are two big problems for anyone to be Trump. One is that the rules in the Republican primary -- you know, the Republican primaries are fought under different rules in the Democrats. And the Republicans really advantage whoever has the biggest block, even if it's not a majority, and Trump has a very loyal base. In 2016, Poppy, he was the presumptive Republican nominee. He had pulled away from the field before he won 50 percent in any state. He only won about 40 percent vote. And the other problem is that the base in the party that is resistant to Trump are college educated Republicans. They were resistant in 2016.
