The power of one person's vote, a singular vote is on full display right now in Nevada. Take a look at this, these are live images of the vote counting process unfolding right now in Washoe County. And in any minute now, we are expecting new results from Clark County that's home to Las Vegas and the bulk of Nevada's population. That potentially could push us closer and closer to knowing the winner of Nevada's totally pivotal Senate seat. Republican challenger Adam Laxalt holds a razor thin lead over the Democratic incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto. His lead has shriveled to only a mere 862 votes. That's 862 votes out of nearly a million votes counted so far. If Cortez Masto does win, Democrats will achieve what seemed almost inconceivable just a few days ago. They could keep control of the U.S. Senate with at least 50 seats. It's now deadlocked with Republicans and Democrats having 49 each as of right now. Let's begin our coverage right now with CNN's Rosa Flores. She's on the scene for us in Nevada. She's right outside the Clark County Election Center in North Las Vegas. Rosa, four days after the elections, we may now be approaching the totally crucial moments. Update our viewers on the very latest.",

That's where hundreds of people are working to count these votes. Let me give you a state of play when it comes to the entire state of Nevada and where the remaining ballots are located.We know that about 1,000 ballots are in Douglas County. We are not expecting for those results to be posted today. There's another 12,000 ballots in Washoe County, that's a swing county home to Reno. We're expecting for those results to post at about 7:30 Pacific Time, 10:30 Eastern time. And there are 34,000 votes here in Clark County where I am home to Vegas. Here's the breakdown of those votes. About 22,000 votes are expected to be processed today. And those are the tallies that we're waiting for. Those are the votes that could be updated at any point in time. Those include Election Day drop box ballots and also mail-in ballots. Then there are also more than 7,000 ballots that still need to be cured. The deadline for that is Monday. There's another more than 5,000 provisional ballots. The deadline for that is Wednesday. Now, Clark County officials say that they plan to continue working today through the afternoon, through the evening until they finish processing those 22,000 ballots to make sure that those posts today. That's the nail-biting situation that we are in right now because of the balance of power of the U.S. Senate coming down - could be coming down to Nevada. Here is the latest when it comes to where that race stands. We have watched as the margin as the advantage that Adam Laxalt had from the morning after the election dwindle, it has shrunk. We've seen it go from 22,000 to 15,000 to less than 10,000, right now is that 862, Wolf. That is a 0.1 percent margin. It doesn't get any more razor thin and that. We will be here. We will be watching. We are looking at our computers constantly to see when those numbers are updated and you will see them here at CNN first. Back to you.",

Republicans need two, Nevada's outstanding and Georgia is going into a runoff, so this is why Nevada is so critical. If indeed, Catherine Cortez Masto can close that 862-vote gap, overtake Laxalt and win this race, Democrats would secure the majority. You were just talking to Rosa down here in Las Vegas in Clark County. This is the population center. Nearly three quarters of the population of the entire state is in Clark County. And Joe Biden won this county by nine percentage points. Catherine Cortez Masto was winning Clark County, but not by as big of a spread, right? She's winning it by seven percentage points. She's at 52 percent overall for the county. Adam Laxalt is 45.1 percent. Remember, Catherine Cortez Masto is running a bit behind. She may - she needs to over perform in what we see come from Clark County tonight than she is right now. She's got to do better than this to overtake Adam Laxalt. So that's why we are looking, again, 95 percent of the voters out. I will tell you statewide, Wolf, because I want to show you another key county that we think there are about 50,000 to 55,000 votes overall in the state of Nevada.",

We're estimating about 94 percent in. This is a tight swing county. We watched this throughout the course of this week go from a Laxalt lead in this county to now a Cortez Masto lead. So Washoe is expected to also deliver some votes that could help Catherine Cortez Masto potentially overtake Adam Laxalt there. Those may come later in the evening. But it's these two blue counties that have the most votes left to deliver, Wolf, which is what's giving hope to the Cortez Masto campaign that they can overtake Laxalt and actually win this race.",

When we learn, do the 22,000 votes we get tonight, Wolf, look similar to the votes that we saw last night, meaning, overwhelmingly in the favor of Catherine Cortez Masto, that's going to be a game changer here, or, or does this batch of votes that we receive from Clark County tonight not look like that. Does it look like it's friendlier turf for Adam Laxalt? Perhaps these election day votes, these mail drop-off votes, perhaps Adam Laxalt does better in them.Then that's going to be able to prevent Catherine Cortez Masto from doing what she needs to do here to win. Remember, overall in the state, Wolf, you're looking at some, you know, nearly a million votes, 900,000 and change votes total cast statewide in this race. We only believe there are 50,000 to 55,000 outstanding votes and we know we're going to get a big chunk of that outstanding vote soon, very soon from Clark County. And when that comes in, what is remaining, it just becomes a much smaller universe. So this batch of votes from Clark County is going to give us a ton of information about whether or not we will be able to project a winner in this race -- Wolf. BLITZER: And they presumably will be getting the results of those 22,000 uncounted votes in Clark County, the largest county in Nevada, fairly soon. And that will give us a much better sense of where this contest stands. I also want to go to Arizona for a moment while I have you, David.

Joining us now Elizabeth Thompson, the editor of the \"Nevada Independent.\" Elizabeth, thanks so much for joining us once again. You and I have been speaking over the past few days. What are you hearing from each side right now on the ground as we await the votes that are about to come in? ELIZABETH THOMPSON, EDITOR, \"THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT\": Well, the tone has changed a little bit from the two campaigns since yesterday, which has been interesting to me and my team here on the ground, which is to say that Catherine Cortez Masto, while being reserved, her campaign is sounding, I think, a little more positive, maybe a little more hopeful than they might have been before. And Adam Laxalt's campaign, interestingly, seemed this morning in a tweet to be indicating that, although they had not given up, they were prepared as the votes dropped today for a possible loss. They didn't say that outright, but if you read between the lines, that was the word there. So the Laxalt campaign, I think, a little less confident today than they were yesterday, but still not giving up hope. Because as your viewers just heard, Wolf, this is still a very tight race. We are not comfortable calling this at this point.",

It'll be around 7:30 here in Nevada for us. We're hoping based on percentages out of Clark and Washoe that we'll be able to safely determine who wins. But again those provisional ballots, those signature check ballots, and there's still a little bit of a question mark with the rurals.

Just to give you that statewide total again, Katie Hobbs has a 37,743 vote lead over Kari Lake. And this total, this Pima County vote report basically netted Katie Hobbs an additional 5,000 votes added to her lead there.So let's go in here to Pima County. That's the Tucson area. I'm now going to bring down, Wolf, the chalk board here that I wrote out these latest totals on. So we got this report. 12,579 votes went to Katie Hobbs in this update from Pima County tonight. Kari Lake got 7,110 votes. So when you look at the percentages, Katie Hobbs got 64 percent of this Pima vote batch compared to Kari Lake's 36 percent. By the way, you see here Katie Hobbs is winning the county 60-40. This latest vote batch she's doing better than that. She did 64-36. And what our decision desk did, Wolf, after these votes came in, they recalculated the sort of outstanding vote in Arizona now. So how many votes in Arizona are currently outstanding statewide after this vote came in? We think about 375,000 votes remain outstanding in Arizona. And here's what's key to watch, these percentages. OK. Kari Lake now needs between a range of 54 percent to 56 percent of the outstanding vote statewide in order to win this race. Katie Hobbs who is in the lead obviously needs a smaller percentage of the outstanding vote. She needs in the range of 44 percent to 46 percent. Well, as you could see here in this last vote batch, I mean, Kari Lake is nowhere near in Pima County at least getting that kind of level that she needs to win this race. And again, just a reminder as I pull out statewide in Arizona, right now Kari Lake has 49 percent of the vote. She needs to significantly increase her performance with the rest of the votes that we see coming in from Arizona tonight to hit that range I just showed you in order to overtake Katie Hobbs and win this race.

So break down the latest numbers we're getting in Nevada, John, because the stakes right now are enormous, whether the Democrats retake, still have the majority in the US Senate, that's at play.",

      "sentences": "The stakes could not be higher. There are only two states left on this map that haven't been decided yet. Nevada, which I'll show you in a minute; and of course, Georgia, which we know is going to runoff on December 6. If Democrats win either one of these races, either one of these races would get them to that number of 50.You can see right now it's tied 49/49 in the chamber. If they win Nevada, that puts them at 50, and because Vice President Kamala Harris is a Democrat, she would break a tie and that will get Democrats control before even the runoff in Georgia. When you dig in to Nevada, this is what we are waiting for next. We are waiting for Clark County, the largest county population-wise in Nevada, by far. It is about seventy-three, seventy-four percent of the entire population. We are expecting them to release the count from 22,000 votes -- 22,000 votes. Now, I'm going to do some math for you because in Clark County, in general, it is split about 52 percent to 45 percent. Fifty-two percent For the Democrat, Catherine Cortez Masto, the incumbent; 45 percent for the Republican, Adam Laxalt. She has been winning, you can see by about seven points, but in the vote that's been counted after Tuesday in the mail-in vote, it's actually skewed more blue, more in favor of Catherine Cortez Masto. She has been getting 60 percent or higher of the vote that's been counted the last couple days in Clark County. What does that mean? I'm going to do some advanced math for you, which isn't easy for me, but I think it actually illustrates why everyone is so keen to figure out what's going to happen maybe in the next few minutes. Twenty-two thousand votes coming in sometime minutes or hours from now. If she wins 60 percent, which is what she has been doing there, that will give her 13,200 votes in this batch from Clark County, it would give Adam Laxalt 8,800 votes. The difference there -- the difference is 4,400. She would net 4,400 votes, and in truth, you would probably net more than 4,400 votes because if she gets over 60, he doesn't typically get 40. He gets around 35. But 4,400 votes, and you will notice and I'm going to pull out an entire State, you will notice Adam Laxalt's lead is 862 votes. So if Catherine Cortez Masto nets 4,400 votes from just Clark County, that would put her in the lead by several thousand votes, Wolf, and that would be before even we see other votes. We are expecting 12,000 votes to be counted from Washoe County, again, which has been skewing slightly Democratic, and then there is the matter of provisional votes. But 4,400 votes, if that's what she gets tonight, I'm not saying she will, but that's an interesting target, that would give her a lead for the first time in many, many days. Adam Laxalt has been leading since Tuesday, sometimes by as much as 22,000 votes -- Wolf.",

It does take longer to count there, so that is what we're waiting to see.You know, Wolf, I do have one point of historical reference here that you will appreciate having covered the Senate for so long. You know, you look at how close this race is, right now, well, Nevada has had some close races before. This was the 1998 Senate race, Harry Reid was the incumbent against John Ensign who was a Congressman at the time. Harry Reid won by 401 votes. Four hundred and one votes in the 1998 election.

They could come at any moment and potentially could determine, which party controls the US Senate. Right now, fewer than 900 votes separate the incumbent Senator Catherine Cortez Masto and her Trump-backed Republican challenger, Adam Laxalt. The race is still too close to call. Our political panel is here to discuss what's going on. Big picture, Nia-Malika Henderson, where are we right now? Because by all accounts, this is a decisive, potentially decisive moment for the future of the US Senate? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's right. I mean, we're in some ways where Democrats never thought they would be, right, potentially on the cusp of keeping the Senate, potentially in the cost of actually growing their Senate margins, depending on what happens in Georgia. This race, particularly in Nevada, no one really thought that Catherine Cortez Masto, who was a first term Senator, could pull this out. And if you've seen over the last couple of days, she has steadily cut into Adam Laxalt's lead. You hear Adam Laxalt on Twitter, essentially saying, you know, if the trend continues, it would be difficult for him to climb back in this, but we'll see what happens. This, you know, if the Democrats are able to keep the Senate, this means a huge amount for Biden's presidency, right? It means that he can get Judges through, it means that if he has to get administration officials, Cabinet official through, that it will be that much easier and it will be a massive, massive defeat for Mitch McConnell and for Republicans in general, who all along over the last many months thought that this was the best political environment in a generation, and they thought they were going to be able to capitalize on it.

Inflation is an issue according to exit polls that, you know, two-thirds of the American public are worried about, they think we're in a recession. And Republicans were sort of measuring the drapes everywhere, and that didn't occur because of other issues, like abortion, and because -- and I'm going to echo Mitch McConnell here, candidate quality mattered.That's past tense now. It did matter. So you look at all of these races and you say, well, why did -- you know, why didn't it work out the way that Republicans thought they were going to work out? Candidate quality, Donald Trump inserting himself into this, and I also believe one other thing, which was very interesting to me, which was that experience seemed to matter with these candidates.

The same with Fetterman in Pennsylvania. These candidates were able to carve out an identity in many places, apart from the President. Now, Nevada actually was one place where these candidates were sort of tracking a bit more with the national trend and everything that Nia and Gloria were saying is true. I think it's even more true when you look at the House. I think the Senate for a long time has been a 50/50 proposition, not just the current makeup of the Senate, but who would control the Senate after this election was a bit of a coin flip. I mean, these races were close all along. This Nevada race was a margin of error race, but Nia is totally right. I don't think there's a Republican or a Democrat who did not think that Catherine Cortez Masto was potentially the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent on the map, and the fact that she is in the hunt here and possibly on the cusp of overtaking Laxalt, when you are the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent on the map means you're doing something to overperform the expectations.",

Republicans only have 10.And if you look at those seats right there, it is going to give Joe Biden a really big headache, because many of them tend to be a little bit more conservative. The Joe Manchin's of the world. You might even see Jon Tester, who is considered very liberal, distance himself as well from Joe Biden.

They've seen 2016, 2018, 2020, so they are just educated in a way that I think we might not have seen years ago. And I think for Democrats as well, this isn't their first rodeo. In Georgia, they have a really great ground game. Obviously in Nevada, the Harry Reid machine still lives even though he has passed away.

Two years ago, Donald Trump would have actually won it by four points. So now, you're actually seeing Democrats not just surviving and winning in Democratic districts, but they're now beginning to win in the West Coast in districts that are Republican here.The big picture here is where it gets very interesting, okay, there are -- these are the races that CNN has now projected winners. You can see Republicans are leading, and 211, Democrats are leading in 204. There are 20 districts that have not been projected yet that CNN has not called winners yet. You can see that the Republicans, of those need to win seven, the Democrats would need to win 14. Democrats would need 14 districts to control the majority, the Republicans would need seven to take over the majority. Now, who is leading in these remaining 20 districts? You can see Republicans lead in 10, they only need seven; Democrats are leading in 10, they would need 14. They're close. I mean, Democrats may very well have a path here. So, let me just quickly show you some of the districts they're looking at. They're mostly in California at this point. Some of these districts are pretty tight. You can see California's Third Congressional District, Kevin Kiley, over Kermit Jones leads by six points, but it's only 10,000 votes with 51 percent remaining. You go down here there's only an 84-vote margin in California's 13th, John Duarte and Adam Gray, only 46 percent reporting. You go further south, you can sort of see similar pictures in some of these districts. You can see Ken Calvert, the incumbent in California's 41st, only leading by 1,500 votes 47 percent reporting. So that was three -- three. If somehow Democrats were to hold every blue district that is still yet to be called and pick up those three and one more, they have a path at this point -- Wolf.",
