These are a number of hospitals that have been affected. And as I understand it, and some have been evacuated due to the damage caused by the earthquake. You're talking to people on the ground. What are they telling you about the sort of pressure that these facilities are under right now? It looks as if they're functioning, how are they functioning? DR. KEWARA: All ERs are overwhelmed. All ORs also overwhelmed because of that huge number of injuries. So doctors working around the hour. All hallways are full and we can - one of our referral hospitals main hospitals stopped receiving any casualties because of no capacity. We stopped to add evacuated to maternity hospitals, frankly, and evacuated the newborns from the incubators because of those facilities and those hospitals got damaged because of the earthquake. So we are using the maternity hospitals to serve the trauma cases coming from this earthquake and collapsed building huge number of collapsed buildings in different villages and cities in Northwest Syria because of this earthquake. So this is the situation. We received mother, date mother, pregnant mother in our Shifa Hospital in Afreen. We unfortunately, she died, but we could get her newborn alive out of his body.

When we treat any casualty we couldn't send it to any safety space, or any safe area because of there is no shelter for them. We need also support in medical supplies and the international community, the humanitarian community knows exactly in the trauma cases, we keep lack the IV fluids, medicines, antibiotics, painkillers, medical consumables using in the operation rooms and in the emergency rooms. Those are all we are consuming from what we have and everything we have could be consumed within hours or days. So this is what we need right now. Unfortunately, I'm very - let me say and be frank. I'm very concerned for Northwest Syria, maybe the earthquake and that it started here in Turkey in this state which usually Turkey is supporting Northwest Syria.

I mean, aid agencies have been appealing to the international community long before this earthquake to help the displaced people in Northwestern Syria. The vulnerable population there, as it was facing this harsh, harsh winter and now you have this on top of that. And then if we look at the situation in Turkey, Becky, this is a country as you mentioned, no stranger to earthquakes. It is a very well equipped country. It has known how? It has the manpower to deal with natural disasters, as we have seen over the years. But from the early hours after that 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck we heard Turkish officials declare that this is a level four emergency meaning that they needed the support from the international community. And they triggered these requests to NATO to EU and countries, of course rushing to provide support. The Turkish authorities search and rescue teams deployed from across the country, the Turkish military on the ground. But one of the biggest challenges they're facing Becky is the fact that this is such a massive earthquake zone. 10 provinces, millions of people living in this earthquake hit areas across Southern Turkey making it very, very challenging operation for them. And then you've got the weather conditions right now, the snow, freezing temperatures tonight, making it very difficult for them to reach a lot of these areas with reports of roads being blocked, as well. And so right now, Turkish authorities are scrambling to set up shelter, it is nighttime now of course this is going to impact the ongoing search and rescue operation. We know that thousands of buildings have been damaged, destroyed many buildings just flattened by this powerful earthquake that hit while people were sleeping. They were indoors in their homes sleeping so you can expect that there's going to be a large number of people potentially trapped under the rubble. President Erdogan saying they don't really know how many so of course, very, very challenging situation on so many levels. And of course, this the weather conditions just making this absolutely horrific and miserable for the millions across that devastated region this evening, as they are left outdoors. No shelters as they're trying to set up all these shelters. I mean, as you heard from your guest there, and I've heard from colleagues also, in Gaziantep, people really don't know where to go right now. If they don't have a car, there's really no safe place because of course, the concern of these major aftershocks more than hundred aftershocks reported by Turkish authorities you know, the concern is of course, that you will see more and more buildings collapse as a result. So they're asking people to stay outdoors stay away from structures as they set up more and more shelters for the hundreds of thousands if not millions who will need those shelters.",

Before I let you go these disasters, of course and we get too many of them. But what they do often is transcend politics Jomana earthquake diplomacy, one might call it and I'm coming from Israel, for example, aid to Turkey. We haven't heard whether there's any aid for sure from the Israelis to the Syrians? But we wait to see it. And I have a formal relationship of course with Syria, Qatar, Jordan, the UAE and we've spoken with them they are sending aid into and supporting to both countries.

And so you are seeing Turkey requesting that support and you are seeing countries already responding. You've got countries in the Gulf Qatar and Kuwait, announcing that they are establishing an air bridge for humanitarian aid for medical supplies for personnel to try and help setting up field hospitals sending in search, search equipment that will be needed. And then, of course, we've heard from NATO as well, saying that it has received the request from Turkey, a key NATO member also requesting, you know, a long list of assistance that it is going to need in dealing with this situation. I mean, Becky, this is a country that has the capabilities; it can deal with natural disasters.

It certainly seems absolutelyunclear what the future for Oleksii Reznikov holds in that administration, whether he's going to get moved somewhere else, whether he'll stay in the Defense Ministry, whether he might get replaced altogether. It really is unclear. But we've been sort of following the story over the past couple of days and some of the talks that have been going on. And some of the people within Volodymyr Zelenskyy's own party, the servant of the People's Party have said that yes, he is going to be replaced. Then said he might be moved to somewhere else to the Ministry of strategic industries also said that he might be replaced with the current Head of Military Intelligence Kyrylo Budanov, that that could be the next defense minister. Certainly, those are discussions that apparently have been going on and a lot of talk that's been, you know, fairly public going on here in Kyiv, among people who are close to the Zelenskyy administration. So, it is absolutely unclear. But of course, it also comes at a very important time for Ukraine, where especially the defense ministry is one that obviously needs to be functioning at an extremely high level. They're integrating a lot of new weapons systems right now into their ministry into their military, new weapon systems from the west others as well. So certainly, an important time and you know, Oleksii Reznikov, we just saw that sound bite from him where he said that he believes he's a winner. He thinks that there's no wrongdoing on his part. But he did also say that, of course, there were inefficiencies in the ministry, there were issues there was an internal audit. Of course, we also have to keep in mind, Becky, that the Deputy Defense Minister, that he did step down because of alleged corruption because there were problems, especially with the procurement of food for the troops that apparently wait too high prices were paid for that bulletproof vests as well. So certainly, there isn't acknowledgement on the part of Reznikov, that there had been issues within the Ukrainian military that of course, right now that Ukrainian military needs to be functioning in a very efficient way in a very transparent way. But he also says that he believes that he's someone who can solve those problems. But again, we heard at the end there that he said that, in the end, it's up to the Ukrainian president to decide. So, I think in all of this, you can really see that Reznikov himself is sort of taking things as they come. He believes that he's fit for the job. But he also says that if the president doesn't want him there any longer of Volodymyr Zelenskyy that then he of course will go and go to another role go somewhere else or completely leave the administration, Becky.",

Rescue crews working tirelessly to find more people alive in the rubble of buildings like this one for example in Turkey, and it is similar if not worse story in Syria emergency workers. They're sifting through rubble hoping to find anyone still alive. Well, a rare Israeli military raid into the West Bank city of Jericho has left at least five Palestinians dead.

It's better known as the oldest, longest inhabited city. It's a tourist destination. Tourists go there all the time. And it's also better known as a place where wealthy Palestinians have vacation home. So, it's really not known, I mean, I can't even recall in the last two decades of a similar situation happening in Jericho. The Israeli military said that they went in overnight to try to apprehend two members of what they said were a part of a Hamas terror cell that they said carried out this attempted attack on a restaurant that attempted attack took place about a week ago. But what happened according to the Israeli military, and according to surveillance video, is these two guys tried to go up to the restaurants tried to start shooting, but their gun jammed and then they got in and fled. He's really military saying some 30 people were in the restaurant at the time. And since that day, the Israeli military has been setting up checkpoints and has been really at Jericho for the past week trying to go after these guys. And they say that last night they undertook this raid. And as you noted, the Palestinians are saying that five Palestinians were killed in this raid. Several of them are actually related. At least two of them are brothers and Hamas did put out a statement saying that all of them were their resistance fighters. We just go see it that map how far towards Jordan Jericho is it's really far from what we've been normally talking about these hotspots of Jenin, of Nablus of where these sorts of raids usually take place. And I think that goes to show you and it really helps illustrate the situation that this region is in right now. We've been talking about the really rising levels of violence and tension. We've seen attacks we've seen these regular Israeli military rates and to see Hamas claiming fighters in Jericho to see the sort of Israeli military rate in Jericho. I mean, like I said, I can't remember the last time Jericho had anything close to this. And I think that really shows illustrates this very dangerous situation this region is in right now. Becky.",

But China's sticking to the explanation we've now heard for the balloon that was shot down by the U.S. just a couple of days ago at this point saying this was a weather balloon, a civilian balloon that had drifted off. Of course, they only, they say they only had limited controllability over it. And that's one of the reasons why it ended up over Central America. We've heard from two countries there or rather Latin America. We've heard from the Colombian Air Force as well as the Costa Rican Civil Aviation Authority, saying yes, they spotted the balloon. However, they didn't specifically blame China for that balloon, saying only generically that they had witnessed or notified the balloon. We don't have a specific location on it right now, whether it's still overland or whether it's drifted over the Gulf of Mexico or drifted to over another country. And we don't have frankly, the same number of people looking for this balloon in the sky there. So, we don't have as accurate a depiction of where the balloon currently is. But we know China acknowledging the balloon at least is theirs even if they're sticking to the explanation, an explanation the Pentagon and the U.S. government outright rejected that this was a civilian balloon that had simply drifted off course, Becky.",

A CNN producer on the ground in Gaza and in Turkey says the aftershocks felt like Armageddon his words. Well, the death toll is now rising tragic proportions soaring past 2300 this all happened only hours ago in a region already scarred by war and a refugee crisis. Well, to make matters even worse, rescue efforts are likely going to be slowed by what is harsh weather in the region. Meteorologist Chad Meyer standing by for us at CNN Center in Atlanta two things going on here that I want us to address. One is the forecast. But before we do that, let's just have a look at the map of these aftershocks because we are having them described as big as the initial earthquake. Just explain what's going on in.",

There will even be some snow in the upper elevations that 7.5, their aftershock actually happened in the mountains, almost 600 meters higher in elevation than the original quake. And it didn't do quite as much length damage; it did damage all around one epicenter. And that's you know that that earthquake actually went up somewhere the earthquake the original just went across, just went side to side. So that's the reason why the damage is here from the 7.8, the way it formed, the way it stretched and the way it fractured the land all the way from here. You will be able to look at the surface and see that fault at to see the break in the dirt. And I've even seen some breaks in asphalt, breaks in airfields where the fault itself is all the way to the surface, Becky.",
