We need more than thoughts and prayers. But today, we want to focus on making sure that shooter is caught, that people stay safe in their homes, that businesses that need to be closed stay closed.But this isn't how we normally have to interact in Maine. We're a state where people have, you know, gotten to know each other well over the years. Where people are usually very comfortable with gun ownership. We're not used to having this kind of assault-style weapon and this kind of shooting.",

You know, he has some history in Maine as a reservist in the national guard. He was a -- actually, ironically, you know, he was training others on the use of guns.So, you know, I know there will be a lot of people who knew him, who worked with him. You know, we're turning up about more about his background and I don't really want to say anything more but I think you'll hear more about it from the public safety commissioner and others. A lot of this is being used to track him down, and it's sort of vital information right now.",

They wander in the woods. They go hunting in the woods. But the fact is, we have a lot of territory to cover. And as you've heard this individual has training in the military. He knows how to evade other people. You know, he's got weapons and ammunition. So, it is a very dangerous situation, but it is also hard to find someone in the woods, and this is someone who probably knew their way around.",

An important update about to begin there.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, that news conference, as you mentioned, we're going to hear from a number of people. We're going to hear from the governor, Janet Mills, here in Maine. And we're also going to hear from the Maine director of public safety, along with the Lewiston police chief. Sort of highlighting the multipronged approach they've taken to try and track down the person of interest we have seen up to this point.Robert Card is the person of interest they have identified. 40 years old. They've put out pictures. They have considered him armed and dangerous, and that's the warning they've put out to residents. And that's part of what's kept many people on edge over the course of not just last night, but into this morning as well when they realized that, oh, this person still has not been caught. Just in the town over from me in Lisbon, Maine, the police chief there spoken to one of my CNN colleagues, and he was telling him that they were getting tips. They were getting tips from residents who felt like they were seeing things and hearing things. On social media, people also talking about how difficult it was to sleep through the night knowing someone like this is out there. Now, what the person of interest is for, the case that he is tied to are the two sets is of mass shootings -- the two mass shootings we saw here in the area that happened within rapid succession of each other. One at the bowling alley, not too far from where I am now in Lewiston, just a few miles down the road. And the other here at this bar and grill restaurant. Both of those scenes, times and places, where people were out and having a good time. And all of a sudden that changed in just a matter of moments. And we know in, at least, the bowling alley, there were people of all ages that were witnesses, not just by seeing but hearing the gunshots as well. So, this was something that ripped through the community in such a short amount of time. And when you talk about this community, it is not a big one. And so, people know each other. It's not -- you can't go far enough -- I think the police chief in Lisbon said that with this area combined with Lewiston and all the surrounding areas, you can't go far without knowing someone or at least knowing someone who knows someone. And so, with the many that are in the hospitals right now, trying to recover, there are so many hoping that good news comes from those recovering because we know this has been a mass casualty event. Many have died, many more injured, and there are hopes that some of those injured can survive. And so, right now we are at the beginning of this process because we are waiting to hear on the conditions of some of these patients that are recovering. The investigators are working through scenes, not just like the one behind me, but also at the bowling alley as well to figure out what happened when the shooting started. And then at the top of the priority list, at least, for investigators is trying to figure out where this person of interest is. If this person is still in the area? If they believe they are zeroing in on someone? Those are the types of the questions that residents here are hoping to get answers to and potentially we'll see some of those questions get answered in this press conference that's set to start at any minute now that, again, we're going to hear from the Governor Janet Mills, the Maine director of public safety, and of course, the Lewiston police chief as well.",
