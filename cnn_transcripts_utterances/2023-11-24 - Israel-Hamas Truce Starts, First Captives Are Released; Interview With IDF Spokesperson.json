To see these beautiful children come home that we've been waiting for, return to their families. These sweet little faces smiling into the camera. This boy, Ohad, who's nine years old, who was trapped in Gaza in a tunnel with his mother to be welcomed by their family.The people of Israel are full of mixed emotions right now. We're melting with, really, love on one hand for people, and at the same time, we know that there's still over 200 hostages, including many women and children and men and grandfathers and grandmothers still in Gaza. What we saw was we saw them brought over the border. Right now, they're in medical care. As far as we know, the ones that we've met and that we've seen are in good health. They're probably enormously traumatized. And we have to understand, Wolf, that some of them, some of these little children, there's a two-year-old and a four-year-old, there are multiple children, do not know yet that members of their family have been killed. And therefore, there's a process of psychologists, of support networks that are there to reveal to them, yes, you're home. But how do we convey to these sweet children that Hams killed their families? That is, right now, what the State of Israel and the people of Israel are facing.",

Let's not also forget the mental trauma. And mental trauma is not something that can be assessed right away. The medical staff in the State of Israel want to make sure that we're helping these people as much as possible, and therefore in as short a period of time as possible we're trying to assess this. So, when they reunite with their families, they're able to move forward in life after this horrific ordeal that Hamas put them through and put all of us through and not go reversed.And so, this is an incredibly difficult process on a scale that is simply massive. We're dealing with these 13 precious people. And in the coming days, God willing, we'll be able to deal with more and more as part of this framework. And so, it's a process. Hopefully, as soon as possible, everybody --",

They will all be debriefed thoroughly. And I'm sure many of those pictures will come clear, obviously, to be held deep underground, inside the Earth for 50 days. The thought that Hamas had their hands on these two-year-old, four-year-old, five-year- old, nine-year-old children is kind of beyond all of us.We know that Hamas killed a number of our hostages. We uncovered their bodies. And that will be forthcoming in the in the coming days. But what we have to remember from our perspective is that this is a pause, Wolf. This is a pause that because of our military campaign, it led -- pushed Hamas's back to the wall. It led to this release. We are not done with this military operation. We are just beginning until every single one of those sweet children, mothers and fathers in Gaza are going to be returned home.",

We did see Israeli forces firing tear gas at the crowds that had gathered to watch that crossing unfold. Now, of course, we are seeing huge crowds gathering here outside the Beitunia municipality center. Many of them have been waiting for hours for the release of those 39, or at least some of those 39 prisoners to arrive here at the municipality building where many of the family members have been waiting to meet with their loved ones who have been in prison, many of them for years now at this point.And we have already seen some of those now released prisoners arriving here outside the municipality building, surrounded by crowds of friends, family and other locals who have come to show their support for those now released Palestinian prisoners. We've seen fireworks being set on. We've seen people chanting and cheering and celebrating here. And I think that is interesting to see, this celebration unfolding, because earlier in the day, and in fact earlier in the week, we've been speaking to family members of some of those on the list of 150 Palestinian prisoners who could potentially be released over the course of this four-day truce. And many of those family members told us that while they welcomed this decision and while they would be happy to see their loved ones released, this wouldn't be a moment of total happiness because of course of the ongoing war or rather the war in Gaza that this release of prisoners has come at a heavy price. And you can just see behind me these crowds are pretty huge. And we are seeing Palestinian flags being waved, but we are also seeing Hamas flags being waved here at the Beitunia municipality center. Now, of course, those 39 prisoners, as I mentioned, are the first amongst what is said to be 150 Palestinian prisoners who are expected to be released if the terms of that truce agreement is upheld over the next four days. And, of course, this is an exchange for those 50 in total hostages that are held by Hamas inside the Gaza Strip.",

Biden, Bill Burns, the CIA director, traveled out to the region.Arlette Saenz is traveling with the president in Nantucket. And, Arlette, I know we're going to hear from the president shortly. But I wonder, was the administration surprised there were no Americans in this initial group? I mean, there's a lot of discussion, for instance, of one of the hostages who happens to be turning four years old today, not involved in this initial group. Was there any upset with that? Any surprised that they weren't included at this point?",

But the White House still remains hopeful that that will be the case, that these two women and that young girl, four-year-old Abigail Edan, will be part of this group of 50 and women and children who are being released in the coming days.Now, we just learned President Biden just left the home where he is staying here in Nantucket, Massachusetts. And we expect to be hearing from him shortly about this latest hostage release that played out this morning. The White House officials were monitoring the release in real time, and I'm told President Biden was briefed throughout the morning, including by his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. The president, yesterday, had told reporters he was hoping to be able to provide an update today once that release had gone forward. But all eyes have been, not just on this release at large of the 50 women and children, but also whether these Americans will be able to get out. Officials have really been viewing this first day and tomorrow as a real testing period to ensure that all of the plans and mechanisms that they had agreed to are actually carried out. So, we expect to hear from President Biden in a short while. An update. He himself had said he was keeping his fingers crossed that that four-year-old Abigail Edan would be part of this hostage relief -- release. And the White House is hoping that soon they will be able to reunite these Americans with their families.",
