We also see that there's another tweet coming out from UNLV, the university police. The tweets saying that they're responding to additional reports of shots fired in the student union, evacuate the area and then in capital letters it says run, hide, fight.Now from looking at the map, it looks like this is right next to Beam Hall. The other building that I was telling you about. So not clear right now -- as you were just hearing -- It's not clear right now if this is some -- a different incident that's happening in two different buildings or it's the same incident right now. We're still trying to work through that. And looking through how they're expanding this perimeter and how that may be affecting the entire city of Las Vegas. If you keep in mind it's pretty contained. The part where like tourists would normally be, but still all of this can have an impact around the area here. So still watching this. Still seeing that all of this started with, we see the first tweet coming from UNLV about -- just over 30 minutes ago. So this is still a very new situation that we're learning about and learning whether or not they have actually found somebody. If they are encountering people. But their origin tweet did say that they looks -- does appear like there are multiple victims here. They are still working through this, but for a law enforcement tweet to say that that's pretty indicative right now. But it's still unclear how large it can be, but it does seem to be a very large response here as they're looking to contain this and also to secure these areas, these buildings and to find any perpetrator or perpetrators that still may be out there -- Boris.",

And of course, sadly, if any people have lost their lives. That's what we're still unsure about. And there still may be very many people who are still sheltering in place who are looking at the tweets and maybe looking at the news on their phones, on their computers, to figure out what to do.Nerves are going to be rattled, and they're trying to make sure that they contain the area, get the medical response that they need to get In there.
