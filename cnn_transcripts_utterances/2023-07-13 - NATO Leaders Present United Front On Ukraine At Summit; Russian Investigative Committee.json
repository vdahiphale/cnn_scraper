But, you know, I think he does have a genuine concern that he wanted this timeline to joining NATO, because he's concerned, let's say, the timeline, and the, you know, a path, a concrete path to join in NATO spins out beyond, let's say, the next U.S. election, President Biden has been hugely instrumental in bringing NATO together and keeping support going for Zelenskyy and he will have genuine worries that if Biden doesn't win, and another -- you know, there's a different U.S. president, then maybe the path to NATO becomes so much harder, maybe even that U.S. president has less interest in keeping NATO united. So, there will be genuine concerns because Russia is not going away. Presidents and leaders of NATO countries may and therefore the political will inside NATO may shift over time.

Zelenskyy says it, but every commander you speak to on the ground, says it. I was in a command bunker just a few miles behind the front lines. There they had the most amazing technology to watch all the Russian frontlines, and they could see the Russian soldiers pop up from their trenches, if they had the ammunition and the guns, they will be able to take out their enemy and move them back out of their country. So, you know, Zelenskyy's frustrations on lack of ammo and everything else is a real analysis of what's actually happening at the front line. So, sure, it looks like a bottomless pit, because you need to -- you need to put in a lot to get the result. It's a war and that's how wars are.

Ukraine's defense ministry also reports rebuffing Russian assaults all along the eastern front lines in Donetsk region. In the south, Ukrainian forces have stepped up missile and long range artillery attacks on Russian command hubs and ammunition depots, pressing their offensive to reclaim Mariupol and Berdyansk (PH). Russia's Investigative Committee has released a video purporting to show the moments just before a former submarine commander was shot and killed earlier this week in southern Russia. CNN cannot independently verify the video but has geo located the footage to a park where Ukraine says the shooting took place. His death is one of several mysteries surrounding senior figures linked to Russian forces. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For Russian generals, a home once so distant from the front is no longer safe. Here, former Russian submarine commander Stanislav Rzhitsky runs his usual route at the usual time, but with a new unnoticed companion on a bicycle. Moments later, he was gunned down. Ukrainian defense intelligence said they had nothing to do with it, but they knew a lot about it, saying he had been shot seven times with a Makarov pistol and heavy rain meant no witnesses. Rzhitsky commanded a Russian submarine accused of many attacks on civilians, Ukraine also said, although his family reportedly denied that. Ukraine added later, perhaps sarcastically that he had been killed by his own men who refused to kill Ukrainian civilians. Russia was quick to respond with their own propaganda, claiming to have captured the gunman within hours. Video we can't verify. But it was a crude bit to show they are in control of the fate of their top brass after now weeks of chaos. Russian media said the killing hinged on a clumsy detail that Rzhitsky had made his daily run public on the running app Strava which has a long history of accidentally exposing the location of people who don't want to be found, revealing U.S. military bases in Syria and Yemen five years ago. There are the dead and also the missing. News Wednesday, too, about this key Putin lieutenant Sergey Surovikin who vanished since he appeared early in the armed Wagner rebellion to plead for it to stop.

Shortly after, the wife of Huw Edwards, one of Britain's most famous and one of the BBC's highest paid journalists made a statement on his behalf, confirming the accusations were made about him and asking for privacy. Writing, I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental wellbeing and to protect our children. Huw was suffering from serious mental health issues. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters. He has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving inpatient hospital care where he'll stay for the foreseeable future. Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published. Edwards has been open about mental health struggles in the past saying at one point things got so bad he couldn't get out of bed. In the meantime, the BBC now says it will continue its internal investigation. Other less serious allegations have been made against Edwards. Police say they are aware but haven't received specific information and that there was no police action on them at this time. Questions about the BBC's handling of the complaints will surely not fade from the front pages anytime soon.

State media reports leader Kim Jong-un personally guided the launch of the Hwasong-18 intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday, which flew for 74 minutes before crashing down in the waters near Japan.The longest flight ever carried out by this ICBM. It was a solid fuel missile. It's been called the North's most powerful nuclear weapon, but it's unclear if it could actually deliver a nuclear payload. The launch also follows threats from Kim Jong-un's powerful sister, as CNN's Will Ripley reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A menacing milestone for North Korea's missile program. Pyongyang's latest ICBM launch breaking its own record for the longest-ever missile flight, a staggering 74 minutes, hurdling high above the earth at supersonic speed, hitting 6,000 kilometers before splashing down in the sea. The massive missile's potential striking range, the entire U.S. mainland, and most of the world. Pyongyang's most provocative launch in months, coinciding with this NATO summit in Lithuania, quickly condemned by Japan as an unacceptable threat to regional stability. South Korea's military ready to overwhelmingly respond. The ICBM, a crown jewel in leader Kim Jong-un's nuclear arsenal, protecting the power, fortune, and future of the ruling Kim family. His young daughter Kim Ju Ae often appearing alongside her dad, barely ten years old, the rising star of a state propaganda campaign, carefully crafted by Kim's younger sister, the mastermind of the Kim family brand, the leader's loyal confidant, trusted adviser, and perhaps the most powerful woman in North Korea. CHUN SU-JIN, AUTHOR, \"NORTH KOREAN WOMEN IN POWER\": She is the number two, that is for sure. But actually she is very smart lady, and she actually knows that her position is secure only when her brother is secure. RIPLEY (voice over): Just five years ago, very few people knew of Kim Yo-jong. She stepped onto South Korean soil, the first member of North Korea's ruling family to cross the DMZ. She carried a message of peace. North Korean athletes and cheer squads got a warm welcome to the 2018 Winter Olympics. She rose to fame as a fixture to her brother's side, standing silently behind Kim as he met with former President Trump, that brief period of diplomacy feels like a distant memory. The silent sister now a loud voice of defiance, issuing fiery statements on state media, often laced with crude language. This week, she threatened to shoot down U.S. spy planes, accusing them without evidence of entering North Korean territory. Warning, in case of repeated illegal intrusions, the U.S. forces will experience a very critical flight. Past actions prove she's not all talk. In 2020, a dispute with South Korea ended with a bang. Kim ordered the demolition of a joint liaison office at the border, turning diplomatic dreams into a pile of rubble. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera): She ordered the demolition of a building partially because she was angry that South Korea wasn't doing enough to stop activists from sending propaganda leaflets in balloons to the north. And she's accusing the U.S. and South Korea of having the most hostile and aggressive behavior, calling the South Korean president a fool. And those two countries now strengthening their military alliances, which means there could be even stronger responses from North Korea and the second most powerful person in North Korea Kim Yo-jong.

As you can see here, it's being broadcast live via Parliament T.V. And the Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha who took power nine years ago in a coup is not seeking reelection. He will retire from politics that was announced earlier this week. It was in May when his party, the military back party was defeated by the opposition in general elections.

He is a former executive of the Southeast Asian Grab but to become Premier, he needs the votes, he needs to scramble around 60 more votes from rival parties from conservatives and that is a tall order given his party's progressive policies on monarchy on military reform. Now, the party tells CNN that they're confident that they can get enough votes. But Pita faces a big setback, he could be disqualified as a lawmaker over a shareholding issue. In fact, a Thai Constitutional Court will be reviewing the case next week. If Pita fails, then another party When the coalition will step forward, Thai will nominate its own candidate. It could be a 60-year- old property tycoon. It could be the daughter of the self-exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself was ousted in a coup back in 2006. But look, the debate is underway. We're waiting for the election to take place. After Prime Ministers is elected, a government can be formed likely by early August.

There's been some pent-up hostility that I think you're seeing come out in these guild negotiations, where people really feel that the studios are not sharing information with them, are not being open with them about what they're making or not making on their streaming services. And they want to make sure that they're not cut out of that -- that supply chain.",

You know, so you're seeing what technology has done to the business.And technology has remade it in a number of different ways. One of the things actors are concerned about is A.I. and other forms of digitization, you know, replacing them. But I think the real problem is the lack of transparency from studios about what their streaming numbers are, how the model works, what the revenues are from that. And it's basically reshaped the business in ways that are leaving the other participants in the business largely in the dark about how much the shows they're working on are worth and, therefore, whether they're getting a fair share of that.",

But, yes, I mean, this business is driven by new, hot shows. And you need actors out there as the face of those shows promoting them. So the writers create one problem, and as you mentioned, the actors create an entirely different problem, because they not only bring production to a screeching halt, and things are produced far ahead, so you won't see the effects of that right away. But what you would see right away is they won't be out there promoting their productions. And that's a real problem. That brings the whole ecosystem of marketing this industry to a halt.",
