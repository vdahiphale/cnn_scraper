Desperate for help, western officials say that if the U.S. doesn'tprovide more aid to Ukraine, the consequences will likely be devastating. Also ahead, if Ukraine falls, its smaller neighboring country of Moldova could be next. I'll ask the Democratic nation's President about what they're doing to prepare. And later, a binder containing some of the most guarded secrets in America went missing just days before Trump left the White House. We'll bring you the details shared exclusively with CNN. Hello everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching \"One World\". We start with two very different conflicts, which are both top of mind for President Joe Biden today -- Ukraine and Gaza. Western officials telling CNN that Ukraine's defenses are, quote, \"certain to fail without more aid from the U.S.\". But another aid package remains stalled amid wrangling in Congress. And then there is Gaza, where U.S. concerns are mounting over civilian deaths. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan travelled to the West Bank today, meeting with top Palestinian officials one day after he voiced U.S. concerns directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Israel selects targets and tries to distinguish between targets that hit Hamas and those that might take the lives of innocent civilians. At the end of the day, what we have consistently said is that Israel has the intent to make sure that it is drawing those distinctions clearly and in a sustainable way, and we want to see the results match up to that. (END VIDEO CLIP) Sullivan says he believes the intense bombing that is currently happening in Gaza will ease up, though he didn't give a precise timeline. And both Israel and Washington insist that they remain in complete agreement that Hamas must be eliminated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Our chief U.S. security analyst, Jim Sciutto, is in Washington while CNN's JeremyDiamond is along the Israel-Gaza border in Sderot. Let's start with you, Jim Sciutto, in Washington. And Jim, as it relates to Ukraine, a stark warning from U.S. military officials about that blocked funding for the country. Tell us more about the concern within the Pentagon. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: No question. A shared concern, frankly, on both sides of the Atlantic, U.S. and European officials with a similar assessment that without U.S. aid, this is not just a negative impact on, for instance, the on-going counteroffensive, although it certainly would factor into that, but a broader concern that this could lead to Ukraine's defeat. And on a timeline, it's quite tight. One senior U.S. military official put it at months out the out sight, perhaps as soon as next summer, that without continued U.S. military support, that would be the outcome for Ukrainian forces there, that in effect they could not keep up their defense. And the trouble, of course, is this is happening at the same time that Europe is reconsidering its own military support for Ukraine. Again, a large majority of countries want to continue it, but, for instance, in the vote in the last 24 hours, you have Hungary standing in the way. And when I was speaking to U.S. and European officials, their concern was that if the U.S. stops leading on this, then Europe might very well follow. I spoke to U.S. Congressman Mike Quigley. He's the co-chair of the Ukrainian caucus in Congress. And in his words he said, that \"If we, the U.S., go south, our allies will, too.\" And I should say once as well, Bianna, that they're already seeing the effects from this. Ukrainian forces already rationing ammunition. They were outgunned prior to that. Now, they're more outgunned. And a senior Ukrainian military official told me that rationing has already led to additional casualties on the battlefield. So we're seeing it playing out in real time.",

We saw a lot of that public -- a lot of that rift between Biden and Netanyahu spill into public view earlier this week. And then today, as you mentioned, Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, really trying to paper over those differences, suggesting that, for example, when the defense minister Yoav Gallant said yesterday that this war effort is going to take months, whereas the U.S. is focusing on trying to transition this war to a less intense phase of fighting over a matter of weeks, suggesting that those two things are not necessarily in contradiction. But what's clear, what we heard from Jake Sullivan, is that there were very intense discussions, very intense debate between him and Israeli officials over the timetable for transitioning to that next phase of the fighting, and also as it relates to civilian casualties. We heard Jake Sullivan say that he believes that Israel does have the intent to minimize civilian casualties, to distinguish between Hamas targets and civilians in Gaza, but that he said effectively that it's not the reality that we're seeing on the ground. And so, there appear to be kind of two main avenues of focus here. First, for Israel to begin matching up that intent that the U.S. believes Israel has regarding civilian casualties with the reality on the ground. And then also to begin focusing on shifting operations to not this all-out war effort that we're seeing in Gaza, but rather more targeted special operations, intelligence-driven operations to target Hamas' senior leadership. And even Jake Sullivan today acknowledged that that will take months, even if we transition to a less intense phase of fighting much sooner.",

But reading the body language there between Jake Sullivan and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant yesterday when they were shaking hands, and Yoav Gallant said that this fight against Hamas could go on for months, coupled with the fact that you have been reporting along with other reports saying that behind closed doors, Israel is saying this can only last at least at this scale for another three to four weeks' tops. So, Jake Sullivan is saying publicly there's no contradiction, that there's different phases of the war. Is that how Israel and its government, its warring government there is viewing this?",

And, you know, Jake Sullivan's trying to, I think, you know, try and project business as usual. But when it comes to the issue of how long the high intensity phase of the war is going to continue, I think the argument is quite tactical. We're looking here at you know, the U.S. would want this to be over by the first week of January. The Israelis want this to be over by the last week of January. It's not a strategic disagreement. The strategic disagreement is over what happens next, meaning, how much Israel will be willing to start discussing seriously the issue of the plans for the day after the war and how this thing will go forward. What's going to be the context? Is this going to be part of a political diplomatic initiative for Gaza and for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a whole? Or we're just looking here at finding somebody to take care of taking up the trash and opening the schools in Gaza? And here, this is the main strategic argument.",

Eighty percent of the Israelis who support the war the same number says that Netanyahu needs to go once the war ends. And when the war ends, it's not the low intensity phase. They're talking about the high intensity phase that might be over within a few weeks. So, this is going to start moving a political snowball internally within Israel. So, when I speak to U.S. officials, some of them are asking me this question. Do you think that Netanyahu will even be there to call the shots on what will happen the day after? But let's say he is there to call those shots. As you said, right now, the Israeli government doesn't have any real alternative or proposal for how the day after will look like, other than all sorts of slogans about, oh, the Saudis will take care of it. The Europeans will take care of it. There'll be some sort of a -- international body that will take care of it. As of now, nobody is standing in line volunteering to take care of Gaza.",

If he sees that this is -- things going for political campaign and not for, you know, maintaining security visceral, he can just leave the government. So, I think that's what he was trying to signal to Netanyahu and to many, many others. And Netanyahu, when he looks at the polls, he knows he is in a very big problem. Netanyahu's coalition right now in the polls is at 41-42 seats in comparison to 64 that they got in the elections. Benny Gantz gets more than 40 seats if elections were held today.

So, as we noted, the President -- the Prime Minister of Israel met with the president of the ICRC yesterday. And the president of the ICRC also tweeted this yesterday. She said, \"I'm meeting families of hostages. The ICRC must be granted permission with practical details agreed between the parties for visits to take place. I reiterate, hostages must be released immediately.\" Why do you think messages like this weren't made and sent sooner? And Moshe, do you think that if they had been, they would have made a difference? MOSHE LAVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW HELD BY HAMAS: Thank you for having me today. I think I will start by saying that I truly believe that ICRC is a neutral party, is doing what they can behind closed doors, as the spokesperson said, to achieve access to the hostages as soon as they can. However, I do think that their public messaging was lacking from the onset of the crisis. And while there was some improvement, the words yesterday or two days ago of the spokesperson were -- I wasn't very satisfied, at least personally, I know other members of families of hostages were not satisfied with them. Because we do believe that putting pressure through public announcement is a vital and crucial way to make sure that the issue remains on the top of the table, remains on the top of the public mind, and reminds the public that Hamas is preventing access from the ICC to visit the hostages, to give the medical assistance.

We keep emphasizing that this needs to be at the forefront of any policy decision, that this needs to be addressed as soon as possible, and that we will promise that this is the primary objective of the Israeli government and the primary objective of the International Community, and we still expect them to fulfill that primary objective. Every day, we receive reports of another body of hostage who has been discovered murdered in the Gaza Strip during their captivity. It's shocking to us that it's happening and Hamas must be held accountable for that, but it also emphasizes how important it is to expedite the path to release the hostages, whether it is additional military pressure or much more efforts in the diplomatic front. Because at least from the reports we receive, there is no direct communication right now to renew the negotiations for the release of the hostages. And we expect that those negotiations to happen.

Now, she's the former aide who worked with former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. She told the January 6th Committee that she was, quote, \"almost positive it went home with Mr. Meadows\". She said it had been kept in a safe in Meadows' office when it was not being worked on. And Hutchinson also wrote about this classified intelligence in her book. She claimed that on January 19th, the final night of the Trump presidency, that she saw Mark Meadows leave the White House with an unredacted binder, quote, tucked under his arms. Now, we have talked to Mark Meadows' attorney, and he strongly denies this. He said in a statement that Mr. Meadows was keenly aware of and adhered to requirements for the proper handling of classified material. Any such material that he handled or was in his possession has been treated accordingly, at any suggestion that he is responsible for any missing binder or classified information that is flat wrong. Now, CNN reached out to the CIA, the Director of National Intelligence, the Justice Department, the FBI, all have declined to comment. The Trump campaign also did not respond to our request for comment on this binder, which is all to say, Bianna, that the mystery of the binder, the missing binder, remains just that it's a mystery.",
