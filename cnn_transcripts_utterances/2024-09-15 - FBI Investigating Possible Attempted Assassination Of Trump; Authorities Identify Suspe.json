We want to welcome our viewers in the U.S. and around the world as we are covering our breaking news today in this hour, as the FBI now says it is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination attempt of former president Donald Trump.Yes, just two months after the last attempted assassination of the former president. We are told he is now safe. He is back at his Mar-a- Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. This comes out after about 1:30 this afternoon. Police were notified that shots had been fired in his vicinity while he was golfing at his club in West Palm Beach, Florida. That is just across the bridge from where Mar-a-Lago is. As of right now, a suspect is in custody and just a short time ago, we heard from authorities with an update on how all of this situation played out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Our real-time crime center put it out to the license plate readers, and we were able to get a hit on that vehicle on I-95 as it was headed into Martin County. We got a hold of Martin County Sheriff's Office, alerted them, and they spotted the vehicle and pulled it over, and detained the guy. After that, we took the victim, I'm sorry, the witness that witnessed the incident flew them up there and he identified as the person that he saw running out of the bushes that jumped into the car. Now, in the bushes where this guy was is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope, two backpacks, which were hung on the fence that had ceramic tile in them, and a GoPro, which he was going to take pictures of. So those are being processed right now. The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a fantastic job. What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the president was at and he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediate engaged that individual at which time the individual took off.

And when you look at the Secret Service that's around Trump, it's obviously been ramped up since Butler, but is it at the level that a current president has? How can you tell us what that looks like?",

Because here's the question I think a lot of people watching are going to have, which is, two months ago, what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, happened. It's not just obviously the fact that we saw Trump came within an inch of his life that day, but also what we do know about the increased threat from Iran that has been directed at Donald Trump, at his campaign, at his family that we know of.I think a lot of people will look at this and say, why are they still letting Donald Trump go out on a golf course that has a perimeter that as officials said there once someone is in those -- in the shrubbery surrounding this golf course, it's incredibly difficult to be able to spot them. There's three roads that surround this golf course there. And I think some people may look at that and say, this is someone who golfs regularly. It's very clear when he has left Mar-a-Lago and gone to the international -- to the Trump International, the golf course, about 15 minutes away. So it's not like someone wouldn't be able well to know that he's there. And so how does Secret Service approach something like that?",

Again, today, the model worked where those agents that were flanking in advance of the president, their role specifically is to identify this type of specific long-range threat.Now the question --the follow-up question is going to be and the Secret Service will need to address this is how was the outer perimeter, how is this shooter able to get to that outer perimeter, an area that, you know, should have been identified as a vulnerability previously. Again, if you are able to get line of sight from the fence line into the golf course where the former president is in this threat environment, that needs to be addressed fully. And Kaitlan, as you may remember back in 2017, there was a CNN crew that was actually filming the then president of the United States, you know, golfing with a clear line of sight that then was blocked or mitigated by a box truck, but -- so the thought that you're seeing inside the golf course from the exterior, this isn't the first time this has happened. So there are some questions that the Secret Service will have to answer for that but at the end of the day, the protective model that surrounds the president worked. You know, we saw that happen and more the point, that communication, the immediate notification by the agent that, you know, shots were fired, that there was a suspect, that communication was immediately picked up by local law enforcement who were able to carry forward the immediate action of, you know, setting up a perimeter around the golf course and then getting the witness to identify exactly the vehicle, the tag number, and bringing a successful resolution to, you know, the immediate threat.",

Another level of security for a former president of the United States, like Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or Donald Trump for that matter right now.But there's another level of security for someone who maybe a former president, who's also the presidential nominee of a major party, a Republican presidential nominee right now.

We are seeing -- you know, no one could predict that we'd have two assassination attempts domestically against the former president. The Secret Service, you know, was, you know, for a long time, they were a little bit on their heels, you know, trying to address this new and dynamic threat environment around the president.Now they're leaning into it with more assets, more agents. They were applying as much as they can to ensure that the former president is safe. We're seeing -- you know, physically, we're seeing the control measures that are around the former president significantly enhanced as I said. It's coming closer to vice presidential, like sitting vice presidential level protection. But there still is more that needs to be done. Again, you know, we came very close to a disaster today, and that is way too close. Again, the model has to be changing to the threats that they're facing day in and day out now, both from domestic actors and potentially hostile foreign actors.",

And that descends as you go down to lower officials including candidates.The difference with Donald Trump at this point is the security he is receiving is about as close as you would get to the presidential package for somebody who's not the sitting president because of the intelligence on the Iranian assassination plot, because of the assassination plot that happened in Pennsylvania, and I think this will bring it up yet another level. What you're seeing, though, is basic assassination tactics. We haven't seen a successful sniper killing of a president of the United States since Lee Harvey Oswald in Texas, and President John Kennedy. But what we do know about these assassins are, you know, I think technology has changed this a lot and it comes to bear here. But we've also seen the personality profiles done by the threat assessment people at the Secret Service. That behavioral analysis unit at the FBI tells us that about 70 percent of these people, you know, their main goal is to hurt the person that they're attacking. About 38 percent is their main goal is notoriety, and 12 percent are anticipating they're going to get killed in the process. So when you look at that GoPro camera, that could tell us a lot, especially if it was rolling and streaming during this incident.",

We heard from the White House that the president and Vice President Harris has been briefed. We are also hearing from Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer. He was briefed by the acting Secret Service director today and he noted the quick response and applauded the quick response of the Secret Service, and also said that the perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Florida Republican congressman, meantime, a member of the Trump Assassination Task Force that notably was formed after the previous assassination attempt back in July in Butler, Pennsylvania, he says that he will recall on U.S. Secret Service to brief them on Capitol Hill this week, and Kaitlan, probably the first of many members of Congress who will ask for the same -- Kaitlan.",

So that's the FBI has primacy, as they say, for investigations of incidents, of terrorist incidents here in the United States and also assassinations so this is all very clearly spelled out in presidential directives that date back into the 1980s.What they're doing right now, Wolf, is trying to consume as much information as they can possibly find about this individual. So they are likely preparing search warrants for any location they can tie to him his residence. Maybe he has a work location that they know about, if he has any storage facilities or things like that, they're going to want to look in those as well. They are likely interviewing people who know him, parents, spouses, family members, work associates, and friends, things like that. When they execute those search warrants, they're going to be looking for devices that might contain electronic evidence. So devices that he used to search the internet, devices that he used to access social media, to send text messages or phone calls or e-mails to friends and associates, all of those things will be seized and then search warrants will be served on the companies that provide the services to those devices. So they want to know everything he's written. Everyone he's talking to. And they want to take that information and build a timeline as to what exactly he was doing in the hours and days and weeks leading up to this event. And everything they collect that falls into that timeline all that stuff could likely be used as evidence at trial if this person decides to fight the charges against him. We know that he'll be facing state charges. We heard from David Aronberg, the local prosecutor. And then I think it's likely that he'll face federal charges as well. We haven't heard from the U.S. attorney's office in Miami just yet, but I expect that within the next 24 hours, we certainly will. And I would expect to see this person charged. One thing, Wolf, that I think is really important to remember. And we've had some comments about it so far. It's going to be really interesting to see exactly what this person knew when he went to the fence line with a gun and his GoPro and all that other stuff. If he knew that Trump was golfing and there -- would be coming around that kind of northeastern corner of the golf course at that time and so therefore, he was waiting essentially at the end of the next hole, next hall. That's a very troubling thing because it raises all kinds of questions as to how did he gain access to that information? It's also possible that he didn't know any of that that he may have just taken his chances and thought, you know, Trump talks about golf on the weekends all the time. Maybe I'll just go out there and see if he shows up. So these are two, you know, kind of opposite ends of the spectrum on that fact. And where he ends up falling on that spectrum is going to be very important to assess the nature of the threat that he posed and that may be others involved with him who might still pose.",

You know where Donald Trump is and when he's going, if you're in that area and if you know this.And I think that's the question, Chief Ramsey, is that if you take a step back and as this investigation is playing out and we're waiting to learn more about this suspect, the idea that two months after an attempted assassination of Donald Trump, that someone with an AK-47 was able to get within 400 to 500 yards of the former president of the United States is just mind-blowing.

I mean, how did he know he was going to be, you know, on the golf course today and be lying in wait. I mean, it could be just random luck, but I'm not a big believer of luck. So, you know, that's going to be one question that's going to be very important to have answered. And right now, we don't know if he's cooperating with investigators or not. Hopefully he is. If he is then we'll get answers to a lot of questions. If he's not, then they're going to have to do a lot of digging in order to come up with some answers to those questions.",

But there has been steady stream of crime scene vans coming in and out of here from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Department. So they are still actively investigating what happened hours ago inside that golf club. Also, this is Summit Boulevard here behind me, one of three very heavily trafficked areas that surround Trump International Golf Club.And as you can see, there is no traffic here behind me at all. This boulevard is completely closed off. The area really still is, Wolf, essentially under a lockdown. There are police flashing lights and barricades as far as the eye can see. No cars except for the media and other law enforcement are getting in and out of this area. But this all went down, as you know, hours ago, there's 27 holes here at this golf club. And between -- somewhere between the fifth and sixth hole, apparently, those Secret Service members, as you said, did spot the barrel of a rifle poking through the fence, and they were able to engage that apparent gunman and alleged gunman, and then were able to chase him down up Interstate 95, and apprehend him. So still so many questions, Wolf, at this hour. But one thing we do know is that there doesn't seem to be any threat to the community even though it is still under lockdown. Officials are saying that even though there's -- they know that the parents were concerned, there's an elementary school in the area, there's a public library in the area, they said you'll be able to get your children to school and there isn't any immediate threat right now. But as I mentioned, certainly a lot of questions. Who is this gunman? What was he doing here? How did he get to the fifth, somewhere between the fifth and sixth hole apparently? We know he didn't go through the front gate here at Trump International. There's heavy security and law enforcement there at that front gate. So that was not going to happen for him. So it's unclear how he got settled in that area, what he was planning to do. We know he had those two backpacks, the AK-47 style rifle, according to law enforcement, as well as a GoPro.

So it's important to note that a lot of the security measures that we're seeing outside of Mar-a-Lago they were put in place after the first attempted assassination that took place in Pennsylvania. Southern Boulevard, which connects the mainland and Palm Beach is open at this hour, though there are two command posts that have been set up by the sheriff's office.They are right now not stopping any cars that are trying to get out on to Palm Beach. There is a small island that sits between the mainland and Palm Beach, that is normally open to the public. And so folks are able to park their cars there and get a look at the property. However, that has been closed by law enforcement. And so folks are not able to stop there. And then once you get on to Palm Beach, there is a road, South Ocean Boulevard, that runs along the perimeter of the Mar-a-Lago resort. That again has been closed since the first attempted assassination took place. It is closed every single time that the former president is at his property. And so only folks that live in the neighborhood or that are visiting someone who lives in this neighborhood are able to get out onto Palm Beach. We're about 10 to 15 minutes from where Randi Kaye is, where this incident took place at the golf course. And it took us a little bit more time to get to this location from there because, as Randi mentioned, there are several streets that have been closed as this investigation unfolds. And so for us to get from that location here, we kind of had to go through some different side streets just to get out east from where this took place. The last time that we were at this location was in late July, that was when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid a visit to the former president. And we saw these type of similar security measures that were in place at the time then. They have carried over into today. And in fact at, Kaitlan and Wolf, we're being told that before the former president made his way back to Mar-a-Lago after this incident at the golf course, it appears that he may have been held up a bit because authorities were still trying to make sure that the perimeter of that golf course was safe.

First off, it might explain his favoring the AK-47, the rifle that is most popular in Eastern Europe and, you know, Russia and those conflicts. But it also might explain the equipment. His setup the ceramic plates were body armor and so on.But again, as you know, we're the early stages of this and peeling back the layers of his life, as Andy McCabe said, is going to mean going through all of his electronics not just what we can see front- facing on social media, but all of those things hidden behind it. Coming from Hawaii, living in North Carolina, the vehicle he is driving apparently is registered to his daughter. She may live in the area but we don't have a handle on how long he has been in the South Florida area or whether he just traveled there to carry out this mission allegedly.",

But facts like you just finished talking to Andy about, you know, his attitude toward the war in Ukraine, the fact that he claims he fought there and was recruiting people to go fight. Does that make it a motive? Not necessarily, but it's certainly something that's going to cause them to want to take a deeper look at that.And again, the social media aspect of this, I mean he's 58 years old and does have social media footprint, not that older people don't, but, you know, it shows that he's very active on social media. He did have a GoPro, so he was planning on filming himself and he wanted to leave that behind in my opinion, if he had been successful. And so all these things are I think important clues. But the most important clues are going to come from execution of those search warrants. Any evidence they're able to gather from his home, a business, interviewing friends, family, smartphones, all those kinds of things, that's where the evidence is going to really come from. And that's what they're actively working right now. And now that his name is out there obviously there's going to be a lot of interest in tracking down friends and relatives of this individual.",

This is something that was briefed to the Trump campaign. I should note, and I want to be very clear here, we don't know that this new intelligence in this new briefing that the Trump campaign got about this attempt by Iran to escalate its attack on Donald Trump is at all related to this second attempted assassination that happened today on his golf course. But it does speak to the threat environment that is facing him and has been facing him for several months now. As we learned earlier this summer about these attempts, I'm told that this was related to both the physical and also a potential cyberattack, Wolf. And I just want to get back to you, Andrew McCabe, on this reporting and while we don't know that has anything to do with what happened today, what it says about overall what the Secret Service and Homeland Security and officials are taking into account.",
