So let's begin with President Biden meeting with members of what's known as the Bucharest 9. CNN's chief White House correspondent, Phil Mattingly, live in Warsaw.

      "sentences": "You know, I think what's most interesting about what the president's doing today, its final event before he heads back to the United States is what's going to be happening behind closed doors? This is expected to be a lengthy meeting between the President and the nine members of the Bucharest 9, as well as the NATO Secretary General.And for context here, I think everybody obviously paid attention to kind of this stunning secretive surprise visit to Kyiv. Everybody was watching the speech yesterday in Warsaw, and these are all connected, but this meeting is critical. As the president laid out, this is the front line of NATO. This is the kind of tip of the spear, if you will, of the defensive alliance. And these are the countries that I think when you talk to U.S. officials, they acknowledge have the most to lose, and certainly are the most uneasy about what they've watched over the course of the last year. It was an alliance essentially that was put together in the wake of Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea. And while they are not monolithic, and what they request, what they asked for, what their positions are, even as it pertains to Russia, they have made clear that they want more assistance, they want more action from the United States. And most importantly, I think this is why the president's meeting today is so critical. They want to very clear commitment. The president has made that commitment over and over again, verbally. We heard it yesterday in Warsaw, talking about Article Five and the sacred oath that represents when it comes to NATO and NATO members, but reiterating that in person, underscoring the commitment of the United States, and also listening to what these individual leaders and what their countries need, want, and would like to see in the months ahead is critical. And it also gets to something that we've seen throughout the better part of the last 11 or 12 months, which you heard the president talking about, and that is the idea of keeping a western coalition together. There's a lot of trepidation about the ability to keep very divergent interests, certainly they may have a broad ideological similarity, but not necessarily the same domestic equities, political equities, regional equities, keeping that all together. And this group of leaders, this Bucharest 9 Eastern Flank of NATO leaders is certainly a critical component of that -- perhaps the most critical when it comes to the risks that they face on a day-to-day basis.",

We are beginning to see, however, that China is beginning to engage with the number of ICBMs that they are building, the build out of a submarine ballistic missile launch capability. They're going to continue to build, and at some point, we're going to have to re-enter into those negotiations. I think people realize when it comes to nuclear weapons, it is a weapon that you do not use to bluff. It is a weapon of last resort.

Moreover, we're approaching the so-called anniversary of the full- scale invasion of the aggression of Russia against the world as [technical difficulty] the fact that 1.7 billion people in 94 countries.

And there are many there are moments of levity. And so perhaps it's humorous and those moments of levity really creep in. On the other end of it, certainly you never want to point a gun at anyone. And certainly during a trial in which tensions flare in which people are in opposition, there certainly are moments where you may not like the other side. However, I will not prescribe to that view.Final thing, Kristin, and that's this, the -- not to -- you know, it's important to make note of what that witness was speaking to. And that witness was the expert for the -- for the defense, and they were asserting that the trajectory of the weapon would be suggestive of Alex Murdaugh having not shot that that gun. Why? Because the trajectory would suggest that he would have had to have it down by his kneecaps. And since he's six-four, it would not have been him, says that the defense who fired that weapon. So not to get lost in the mix of all that have occurred in terms of, you know, whether you want to call it bad humor, whether you want to call it levity. That was the essence of that expert witness's testimony, which the defense believes is very helpful to the notion of reasonable doubt.",

The first thing is, is that whenever your client testifies, it doesn't become about what you did as a defense attorney, in terms of establishing reasonable doubt in the prosecution's case, it becomes about whether your client is lying or not. It becomes the believability and credibility game.And, boy, would he have a lot to answer to, that is Mr. Murdaugh, in the event that he took the stand, with respect to his inconsistencies in talking to the police about where he was, with respect to the cell phone data that contradicts where he was, with regard to the car data. So he would have a lot to say. Second point, Kristin, and that's this. I'd argue that he did testify. There have been a lot of tapes played with respect to interviews done of him. So in that regard, he has gotten before that jury, but it's always a risky proposition. It's not to suggest the defense won't take that step. But, boy, I would think two, three, four, and five times before I left it in Alex Murdaugh's hands, if he's cross examined and crumbles, there goes your case, there goes the verdict, and that would be guilty. So I think they will think twice and pause before they take such a step.",
