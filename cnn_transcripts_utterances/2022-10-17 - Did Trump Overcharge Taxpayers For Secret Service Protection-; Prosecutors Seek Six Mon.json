At least four people were killed in Kyiv, including a pregnant woman. A Ukrainian official says they were able to shoot down most of the drones, like this one caught on dramatic police bodycam video. The words \"For Belgorod\" were written on one of the drones, an apparent reference to recent explosions in that region in Russia. CNN's Clarissa Ward was at the scene of one of these drone strikes in Kyiv shortly after it happened. Here's what she saw. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Ana, it certainly seems to indicate that the Russians are striking Ukraine across the entire territory of this country. And they're really trying to hit the energy installations. It's something the Russians have said they're doing anyway, but the Ukrainians also confirmed as well.And if you look at the power plant here in the Dnipro region, it was a power plant that was right in the middle of a big steel-producing area. There's a lot of other factories there, so an area that needs a lot of energy, and that now has to conserve energy. In fact, the authorities here in the town of Dnipro have now urged citizens to conserve as much energy as possible as they try to repair the damage. And they did say that there was widespread damage at that power plant. But, of course, the main targets today, even though wide parts of the country were hit, was really the capital of Kyiv, where we saw those massive drone strikes by those kamikaze drones. Of course, the Ukrainians saying that those are Iranian drones that were supplied to the Russians. And, again, also in Kyiv, exactly the same picture, where you had a power plant targeted there as well. It was the same one, it seems, that was targeted last Monday. So it seems like the Russians trying to hit that area again. And then, of course, as you mentioned, that residential building also targeted, with those four people who were killed just there and many people who for a very long time were trapped under the rubble. The authorities there very quick on the scene. The mayor of Kyiv denouncing that attack and ripping into the Russians. I think one thing is really telling in all this. The Ukrainians are saying that, in total, three cruise missiles were launched in their territory today, and 42 kamikaze drones. And they said, of those 42 kamikaze drones, they were able to shoot down 36 of those, so a very large number of those drones, but some did make it through. And then they caused that massive damage that we can see on our screen right now, and that really absolutely terrorized the citizens there of Kyiv, many people hiding in the metro stations for a very long time. And, of course, the Ukrainians are saying, this is something that right now is still continuing. And they're calling on their backers, the international community, the U.S. and its allies, to give them a more capable Western air defenses as fast as possible to try and stop this and make sure that the citizens there can be a little bit safer -- Ana.",

That's a larger advantage for Republicans than they had the last time \"The Times\" polled. In fact, it's a flip. But here's what I think is so important. Look at what voters are saying is the most important problem facing the country; 44 percent say it's either the economy or inflation. There's nothing anywhere close. I mean, it's 44 percent, then 5 percent, then 5 percent, then 5 percent. So the reason why Republicans have been able to turn in an advantage, at least in \"The New York Times\" poll, is because the economy is front and center, and voters overwhelmingly trust the Republicans more than the Democrats on the number one issue by far.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Ana.Wall Street has been all over the place, ups and downs like a roller coaster, because there's just so much uncertainty in the economy, but another recession warning today out from economists surveyed by \"The Wall Street Journal.\" They see a 63 percent chance of a recession in the United States in the next 12 months. That is up significantly from just a few months ago. And it's the first time that the probability of a recession is above 50 percent in more than two years. Now, the biggest problem remains high inflation, high inflation that is forcing the Federal Reserve to slam the brakes on the economy. Now, as you can see on that chart, inflation was really, really low for many years, and then, boom, spring of 2020, COVID hit and inflation skyrocketed, and it has remained very high. For families, that means that their paychecks are not going as far, especially at the gas station and the grocery store. And that is really painful. But there are bright spots in this economy, especially the jobs market, which is historically strong, and the unemployment rate is just 3.5 percent. That is tied for the lowest level since 1969. I think the question is, how long can it stay low, especially when the Fed is trying to cool off the jobs market by raising interest rates? I think that it's safe to say the unemployment rate goes up from here. But, Ana, the question is, how much higher?",

I guess we have been seeing a lot of polls, Harry, showing Republicans at this stage are doing better with voters on the economy.And yet when you ask voters who they want to control Congress, Democrats or Republicans, it's about even on that generic ballot question. So how do you explain this? ENTEN:  Look, there are a lot of things that go into a vote, right? But I think what's important to look at here is the trend line. The trend line is so important, because, remember, Roe v. Wade was overturned earlier this summer. And that, I think, really shifted things. So if you look at the generic ballot, what you essentially see was, at the beginning of the summer, Republicans had an advantage of about two points. Then, all of a sudden you go in August, it was tied. Even a month ago, the Democrats had a one-point advantage. But as the overturning of Roe v. Wade kind of goes on in the rearview mirror and economic concerns become front and center, you see the Republicans gaining back momentum. So, yes, it's true. Republicans do not have a large lead. I wouldn't be surprised if Democrats won the overall House vote if the election were held today. But the momentum is clearly moving towards Republicans, in my mind. And the reason that's happening is because the economy is front and center, and voters overwhelmingly trust the Republicans on that issue.",

No one really knows exactly what's going to happen here. I mean, there's no playbook for what happens to a $23 trillion economy two years after a once-in-a-century pandemic and in the middle of a war in Europe.

Prosecutors also want Bannon to pay a $200,000 fine. Let's bring in our senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig. Elie, Bannon faces sentencing on Friday.

Now, under the law, that carries a maximum sentence of 12 months behind bars. Now it carries a minimum, a mandatory minimum sentence of one month behind bars, which makes it curious that Bannon's lawyers just asked for probation. He cannot get probation, he has to get at least one month behind bars. But in the federal system, you have to look at the sentencing guidelines. And what those are, are advisory ranges that the judge has to consult. And the range here is between one and six months. And prosecutors sometimes do and, in this case, they're asking for the top of that range, six months. Prosecutors are making the point to the judge, this is not just any contempt case. Here's something that prosecutors wrote in the memo that they just submitted earlier today -- quote -- \"The rioters who overran the Capitol on January 6 did not just attack a building. They assaulted the rule of law. By flouting the Select Committee's subpoena and its authority, the defendant exacerbated that assault.\" So we have now heard both sides weigh in, Ana.

It certainly seems like he won't, given that wild-14 page statement that he issued last week. If he does not comply, then the committee will have two options. First, they can pursue civil litigation. They can go to a federal judge, ask for an order requiring Donald Trump to testify. As Adam Kinzinger just said, though, they likely do not have enough time to do that. Or the committee can refer the case over to the Justice Department for potential criminal contempt of Congress charges. And then the decision will be up to the Justice Department. Now, this has happened four times already in this case. Two of those -- one was Steve Bannon, who we were just talking about. He was charged. He's been convicted, coming up on sentencing. DOJ also chose to charge Peter Navarro. He's coming up on his trial next month. But DOJ decided not to charge the other two, Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino.

And so the emphasis, the focus is now going to shift over from the committee to, of course, the United States Department of Justice under Merrick Garland. And don't forget the Fulton County district attorney down in Georgia, Fani Willis. We know both of them have investigations going. We have seen signs that those investigations are expanding and getting closer to Donald Trump's inner circle. We know that these prosecutors have either subpoenaed or interviewed or negotiated with some key witnesses, Cassidy Hutchinson, Pat Cipollone, Marc Short, Mark Meadows, all of whom had some interaction with the January 6 Committee first. Ana, quick note that's important here about timing. Because midterms are only three weeks away, we're not going to see any major politically charged indictments or charges between now and then.
