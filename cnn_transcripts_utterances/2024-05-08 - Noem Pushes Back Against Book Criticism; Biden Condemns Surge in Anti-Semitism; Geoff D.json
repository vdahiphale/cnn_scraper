And the conversations that I was having with some more moderate Democrats ahead of time, I'm going to get the congressmen to weigh in on this in a second too, was that he needed to not both sides it was how some people argued it in that he needed to take on the left of his own party and the way in which there is anti- Semitism brewing there. What was the thinking behind the scenes in the White House about how to frame this? KANNO-YOUNGS: I think those concerns from some of some of the more moderate Democrats are exactly the concerns that the White House has really been worried about leading up to this, and leading up to the president's comments also last week. You basically - look, I think it's worth reminding folks, this has been an issue that the president - and he talked about it yesterday - sort of has - it kind of traces his career, both through the Senate, but also with his upbring in Delaware. He talked about dinner table conversations with his father, talking about the significance of the Holocaust and the need to not forget it as well. I know that White House officials, after some of the criticism they were getting last week around, where is the president sort of on this issue of the rise of anti-Semitism and protests on college campuses, they were definitely paying attention in terms of the calls to have him speak out. But also the reaction to the speech shows just sort of the tricky political situation here. You know, you had some Republicans saying that it didn't go far enough. Yes. Of course, it was praised by those who have been concerned about the rise of anti- Semitic acts that are happening around the country. But you also had some on the sort of more progressive wing, far left flank, and pro- Palestine protestors saying that, you know, criticism of the Israeli government shouldn't be conflated with anti-Semitism. So, it just shows how difficult this situation is politically. But that speech is, I think, exactly what the White House - what White House officials and many Democrats want to hear yesterday.",

And what they did on October 7th is despicable. Let's start there.Then we can say, in this conflict, at the end of the day, both peoples deserve rights. They both should be free. And, frankly, neither Palestinians or Israelis are going to be safe until both are free and both have independent states. And then the third point that I think we should all agree on is, hate has no place in this discussion. And that's really what the president focused on. If we could start with those shared principles, we can have a real serious debate about what exactly Israel should or should not be doing in Gaza. But instead, so many people just retreat to their corners and have made this such a polarizing issue that they deny basic facts, and we do have this sort of both sides-ism going on, where there's - they 're not - there are no both - there are no two sides to Hamas.",

Kennedy says he's spoken to the event organizers about adding a debate to the schedule. All right, this morning, former President Donald Trump is waking up at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after that dramatic day of testimony at his hush money trial in New York. The adult film actress, Stormy Daniels, is set to return to the stand tomorrow after describing, in lurid detail, her alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Court is not in session on Wednesdays, and this is the first time that Trump has taken the one-off day during the week to return to Florida. While he is back home, President Biden headed to battleground Wisconsin to make his economic pitch. Joining me now is former Republican lieutenant governor of Georgia, and CNN political commentator, Geoff Duncan. Geoff, good morning to you. Thank you so much for being here. I really want to dig into what you had said and written earlier this week, was that you would come out and vote for Joe Biden. Can you - just walk us through your decision and what you're urging others to do. GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, I didn't get here lightly. I've been a lifelong Republican. In fact, when I ran for lieutenant governor in 2018, I was - I was accused of being too conservative to even be the Republican nominee. And - but I think there's a distinct difference. Being conservative or being angry are two separate things, but Donald Trump has conflated that for Republicans. And look, I'm one of those Republicans that want our party back. I want to make a difference. I want to use conservative policies to make a difference all across the country. But Donald Trump's not the right person to do it for us. And the quicker we take our medicine, the better off we're going to be. And to do that, we've got to beat him. And I've tried everything, right? I've tried to support Nikki Haley. I even considered running as a third party No Labels candidate for president. But now we've just got to get Donald Trump out of our system, take our medicine. And if that takes voting for Joe Biden and trying to work with their administration to adjust their policies, to focus on the border, to focus on inflation, then that's what I'm going to do for the next seven months.",

Look, the judge said, we're at - he said at the top, I don't need that many details, right? And then he said, partway through the middle, like, we're getting too many details here. But, I mean, the silk or satin pajamas he was wearing, the way that, you know, he was dressed when Stormy Daniels came out of the bathroom in a t-shirt and boxers, the details I don't really want to repeat myself about what played out in the aftermath of that, I mean, what was going through your mind as you heard that and what was going through your mind? DUNCAN: Well, other than wanting to vomit. Yes, look, you can tell a lot about a person, how they act in private, right? And just watching this unpack for Donald Trump, how he conducted himself behind the scenes in his personal life, whether it be is personal finance, whether it be his personal relationships, whether it be inappropriate relationships, that tells me what somebody's going to do in a real job. And Donald Trump's not prepared to be an authentic leader. I got - I - you know, I got tricked into it. I voted for him in 2016. I voted for him in 2020, begrudgingly. And I made a mistake both times. I should have found somebody other than him to put on the ballot. But we did, and we learn from our mistakes. But, look, this does not play out well for Donald Trump. He is not prepared to lead. And think about this, if you're a serious-minded person that genuinely is concerned about the border, genuinely concerned about inflation, Donald Trump's not your guy. He's a fake Republican. We spent years listening to this talk about building the wall. What he built was a 20-mile-wide selfie station for Republican governors to show up at, take pictures at. But he didn't actually build a wall. We talked about inflation. He spent $8 trillion of additional debt just to do what? Just to get us in debt. Just to - just to pay off, you know, the American public to try to get votes. It's a dangerous proposition to think Donald Trump is a real Republican for us.",

Somebody should never do that as a Democrat. But that's the spot we're in. Donald Trump has confused and hijacked this Republican Party, or at least an element of it, to just create so - you know, chaos and hatred and visceral. It's not - it's not fair, but it is what it is, and I'm willing to stand up and do what I need to do to get this party back in - back in place where it needs to be. And I think it's going to take a number of bold, you know, courageous leaders to step up and do it. I call on other folks of influence. I call on Republican governors to stop trying to tow the party line and just say what needs to be said to save your personal politics. Stand up and do what needs to be done. Defeat Donald Trump.

But some of these, I mean, additional details, while obviously we're going to talk about them, they captured the attention of those in the courtroom and the public, the trial is about sort of the money, right? It's about whether he falsified these records. It's about the payment. And, you know, you saw the judge, usually a stoic judge in this courtroom, really start to get frustrated around what he seemed to describe as additional detail outside of the scope here.
