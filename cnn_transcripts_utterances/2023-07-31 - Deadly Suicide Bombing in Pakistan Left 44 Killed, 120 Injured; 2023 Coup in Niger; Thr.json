Members of an Islamist party had gathered in a town near the border with Afghanistan. Police say, the attacker detonated explosives near the convention stage, but no one has claimed responsibility for the attack so far.For more, let's go to CNN Producer Sophia Saifi who is live for you in Islamabad, Pakistan.

But the death toll that we've seen, over 40 dead, over 100 injured, close to 20 people still in critical condition. We're just waiting to see whether that death toll is going to increase or not.The blast took place at a convention of the Jamiat-e-Islami F Party, which is quite a prominent and popular party here in Pakistan. There were about 500 people gathered in Bajaur Agency which borders Afghanistan in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There has been a spike in militancy in Pakistan, especially in those regions of the country. We saw deadly attack back in January in the north the Pakistan in the City of Peshawar. There have been attacks in the past couple of months in Bajaur Agency, where this current attack took place, and previously the Islamic state has taken responsibility for this attack. At the moment, we do not have a clear responsibility, but there is a heightened sense of secure -- insecurity across the country. We have an important visit happening in the capital, for example, at the moment. The Chinese vice premier is here to commemorate the decade of the One Belt One Road Project. So, there already was a heightened state of security. There's a public holiday in Islamabad for that specific reason to ensure that there is high for security in the country. So, there is no claim of responsibility. There's been a universal condemnation against the attack. But this, again, is a general election year. Towards the end of October, November this year, we're expecting elections. And what we have seen in the past, even five years ago in the previous elections that took place and in previous elections before that, there have always been an increase in militancy, an increase in attacks on Democratic parties, on the Democratic system by militants. So, again no claim of responsibility but we're going to have to wait to see how the day unfolds today. Laila?",

All of the people who were there were in the lead up to the election campaigning that is about -- that is starting to take place by various prominent parties in the country. So, there is, again, you know, the fair that there's going to be an increase in militant attacks on political party workers, not just the JUYF but other parties as well. So, again we're going into the election season with an increased signs of militancy in the country. We've seen it from the start of the year.

Russia says it intercepted three unmanned aerial vehicles, but a business center was damaged in the process. It happened on the same day that another drone reportedly crashed in Russia's Rostov region near the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, Moscow said it has launched attacks of its own on Sunday.

More opaque statements of how Russia's tranquil backwaters were no longer so calm. Ukraine trying to impact Russian psychology by hitting areas like this, even the Kremlin, too, is subject of a drone strike. Russia's saying, nobody injured in this. But again, it is simply a taste of what Ukrainians have been experiencing over the past nearly 18 months now. Nightly strikes of -- and on parts of civilian Ukraine and Sumy in northern Ukraine, 20 injured, two killed from Russian barrage is at the same time as Moscow is being hit and even here in Zaporizhzhia City, two dead in the last 24 hours, and two injured from yet more attacks by Russia. Russia targeting civilian areas, it seems, repeatedly day after day. Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying how these strikes on Moscow were a sign that the war is returning for Russian territory. But also, too, taunting gains by Ukraine in the east, near Bakhmut, and also, a slower, steadier, less publicly touted progress in the south near where I am here. This counteroffensive by Ukraine moving forward, it seems, slowly. They targeted part of Russia's railway supply line, up from Crimea into Zaporizhzhia in the last 24 hours as well. That's potentially key for Russia's ability to defend the frontlines. It's urgently holding on to at the moment despite these Ukrainian advances. But still, Moscow, being hit in such a way, repeatedly now it seems will have an impact on those in Russia. We're told by the Kremlin that this could be a matter of days, this war.

Now, Afghan Taliban have been saying that they are not letting the one side to be used against any other country. But there's a very strong connection between the TTP and the Afghan Taliban.
