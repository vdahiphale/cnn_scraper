Governor Walz and his wife will be on the tour, Senator Amy Klobuchar, as well as a whole host of celebrities, basically making the case and trying to draw this contrast between them and the former President, who, no matter what he says now and how he tries to moderate on this issue, it is because of him that ultimately three conservative Supreme Court justices ascended to the High Court and overturned Roe v.

That's quite a contrast in folks that are trying to take those rights away from us. I think most Americans get it, if you've been through that. I don't think they're cutting hairs on IVF or IUI.

And why have they done that, John? Because our party is the party of common sense. We don't agree on everything. We may disagree about tax policy or environmental policy, but we think we should have a closed border. We think American families should be able to afford housing and food, and we want calm and peace all over the world, not the world in constant conflict that Kamala Harris has delivered.

Obviously, Donald Trump's really sort of intense focus, Jason, is capturing back the states that he lost in 2020, and part of that is, of course, to win back a lot of white working class voters. Just explain to us the strategy to do that.JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, first and foremost, what the former President is going to do is tell these Pennsylvanians, when he takes the stage at this rally, why he says he is the best candidate on the economy, why he is the one who can preserve jobs. Some of those jobs that he is talking about preserving have to do with fracking here in the state of Pennsylvania. And just to give you some perspective, Zain, in terms of ranking, Pennsylvania is second only to the state of Texas when it comes to natural gas development. So, you can understand why so many jobs here in the state rely on that particular industry. And this is something that Vice President Kamala Harris has waffled on. In the past, you remember back in 2019, she said that she supported a ban on fracking. Now she has since explained why she has evolved on that position and no longer supports a ban on that. But, expect President Trump to, when he addresses folks here in Pennsylvania, to say, look, this is a candidate that simply cannot be trusted on this issue, cannot be trusted when it comes to preserving jobs here in the state. In fact, yesterday, he posted on Truth Social, when Harris was asked about her change in position on fracking, the former President said her answer rambled incoherently. He then went on to say that she is someone who would keep borders open here in the United States, and there will be no fracking under a Harris administration. So, these are some of the key points we expect the President to outline when he takes the stage at 04:30.",

I mean, there are clearly some of those who are in the Christian community and the evangelical community who have very strong opinions when it comes to reproductive rights.Having said that, this is a group that has traditionally supported former President Trump. But, when it comes to the general election, and you're trying to carve out just about every single vote that you can, and when you're looking at swing states like the state of Pennsylvania, where there is no clear leader within the margin of error, you've got to try to appeal to as many votes as you can. Many of those votes are in the center, and that is why I think you've got some folks who are looking at this proposal by Trump, this IVF proposal, to appeal to those particular voters who have somehow turned away from the GOP because they feel as though the GOP and perhaps even Trump himself are not sympathetic to those who support reproductive rights, right? And so, it's going to be a question that's still outstanding, how evangelicals feel about this latest development. But, one point is clear, both of these candidates have to appeal to as many as they can. The races are just too close in too many swing states. Zain.",

She took it and asked what it could mean for people watching and that it meant a lot to people. And she really took a step back and kind of assessed it clinically, rather than emotionally. And she has done this throughout the campaign, has chosen not to go into the fact she is a woman, not to really go into her race, other than describing her background, which, of course, she has made a critical part of the campaign.And it really stands in contrast to someone like -- someone who, Amie has written quite a bit about,     , who really leaned into the whole I'm with her glass ceiling breaking way of her campaign. So, there really is a contrast here as to those two candidates who both were trailblazing in their own right. ASHER: And not only Hillary Clinton, Amie, let me bring you into the conversation, because I remember back in 2007 listening to Obama talk about the fact that he is equal slave and equal slave master. And these words were so moving, not just to black Americans, but also white Americans as well, this idea that as the first black President, he would represent all people, and he really lead into his race. And a lot of people, regardless of their race background and religion, found that extremely inspiring.

She saw what worked and what didn't. I think it might have worked for Obama. I think it didn't work for Clinton, obviously, to talk about the history-making piece of her campaign. But, I think she is smart in that. She knows that she needs to reach out to people who might still have questions about her, who don't really know about her, these people and these few voters in these key swing states that we talk about, and they might not have concerns about that. They want to know about their bread and butter issues, about the economy, about the issues that are facing their family.And so, she is taking kind of the very middle of the road approach here. We might still hear her talk more about that later, certainly if she is President, but I think she is smartly learning.

What they got instead were these three phases that you described, and each phase will be three days. They'll start in the center and then move to the south and then move to the north. And on each of those days, there will be seven hours pause in the fighting allowed. So, if you multiply that out, you get to 63 hours to vaccinate across all those days, to vaccinate 640,000 children, all those under the age of 10. And the UN says it really has to hit a target of 90 percent to be effective.So, that is a big lift. I mean, that's -- if you just do the raw numbers, that's about 10,000 children an hour. There are about 2,000 people who have been trained now to hand out or provide -- give these vaccines to the children. But, it's a very, very big lift at a technical level, because you have to record who has got it. You have to organize people who are coming in there. They don't all have transport. It's a finite amount of time. People don't feel safe. And then you have, as you say, these unexpected components, well, the WHO vehicle that was hit just -- World Food Programme vehicle that was hit mistakenly a couple of days ago, a convoy -- aid convoy hit within the past 36 hours. If you get incidents like those, all of that is going to eat time out of the available vaccination window. So, it's a huge challenge, and then you have to do it a second time in four weeks.

Ukraine is trying to get the U.S. to lift restrictions on using American weapons for long-range military targets inside Russia. An F-16 fighter jet was lost on Monday in a mission to destroy Russian missiles and drones. The crash also killed one of Ukraine's top pilots. An investigation is now underway into what caused the crash. And today's meeting comes after overnight attacks across Ukraine. The attacks resulted in three fatalities and dozens injured. One person was killed in the Donetsk region and two others in attacks in northeastern Ukraine. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more on that high-level security meeting and what it could mean for Ukraine.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures index, or PCE for short, held steady at 2.5 percent last month, unchanged from June. Some economists were expecting it to move higher. Here is how Wall Street is reacting. This inflation report is also closely watched by investors, along with the U.S. central bank, which recently signaled a likely September interest rate cut.I want to bring CNN's Matt Egan now. So, Matt, obviously, just in terms of what everyone is expecting, we know that a rate cut is imminent. Based on these numbers, though, from this inflation report, what are we expecting in terms of how far and how fast the Fed may cut?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Zain. An interest rate cut at the next meeting in September looked like a slam dunk before this report came out and it still looks that way right now. Investors are pricing in about 100 percent chance of an interest rate cut, but the big debate remains, how big of a rate cut will the Fed opt for? And right now, there is about a 70 percent chance that the Fed does a smaller cut of 25 basis points. This would still be the first time the Fed has cut interest rates since COVID. But, there is also a chance that the Fed does a bigger rate cut of 50 basis points.Now, what the Fed ends up deciding here is going to be based on how the economy looks when they meet in just under three weeks and that's going to be decided on not just one more month of inflation numbers, but really how the jobs market looks, because in exactly a week, we're going to get the latest reading on jobs. And right now, that is where the Fed is more concerned. They are more focused on the weakness, some of the cracks in the jobs market, than they are on the inflation front. And so, if there is a weak jobs report for August that we learn about a week from today, you know what, Zain, maybe that ends up forcing Jerome Powell and his colleagues to go with a bigger rate cut.",

And that was slightly better than expected, depending upon which estimates you're looking at. Some real context, though. This is the lowest, tied for the lowest reading since February of 2021, which, by the way, was the first full month of the Biden administration. That chart shows you how this metric has really improved.I mean, two years ago, this PCE index was above seven percent. That was alarming. That is why the Fed had to step in and act like the firefighters by significantly raising interest rates, right, moves that we are still feeling the effects of today. The fact that inflation has come down so much shows that a lot of that tough medicine from the Fed, it has worked. One thing I want to stress, though, is the fact that the inflation rate has come down, it doesn't mean that prices across the economy are falling, right? They're not. It doesn't mean that life here in America or most countries around the world is suddenly cheap again. It's not. The cost of daycare and groceries and rent, all of that, of course, is so much higher than a few years ago. But, Zain, this is encouraging because it shows that prices, they're no longer skyrocketing. They're going up at a more gradual pace, and that is good news.",

The helium leaks that Starliner is experiencing is really small. NASA said at the time they could tolerate leaks that were 100 times larger. The bigger issue were the thrusters. The -- basically, they were getting hotter than NASA or Boeing had predicted, and that was causing some problems with the seals.In the case of the SpaceX, the rocket, the helium leaks are not on the rocket's side. They're on the ground side. So, it's a support side that's having the issue. They got all that figured out. They were ready to launch again. Then the weather, recovery weather was going to delay them. And now -- then they had a mishap landing, the first stage booster of a separate launch back on the drone ship. They had one of the legs collapsed and the booster tipped over. So, the FAA has to investigate. They consider this a mishap for the whole vehicle.
