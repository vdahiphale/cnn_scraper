This, as Trump sees another indictment, in the other investigation, is all but a done deal. What the former President is saying about today's closed-door meeting, with prosecutors, investigating January 6th, and what the Special Counsel's Office is and isn't telling his attorneys. Plus, he briefed Trump on classified intelligence, on a near-daily basis, for two years. Dan Coats will join me, for an exclusive interview. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump is facing new federal charges, and he has a new co-defendant, as prosecutors are now accusing the former President, of asking Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, to delete security camera footage, from his Florida Resort. These are new court documents, and they lay out, in detail, intricate detail, I should note, that the steps that were taken, to make sure that footage would be destroyed, after it had been subpoenaed, by the Justice Department. De Oliveira, who was the head of maintenance, at Mar-a-Lago, is quoted, as saying that \"The boss\" wanted that server deleted. Trump has also now been charged, specifically, for withholding top secret plans, for a possible attack, on Iran. It's the very document Trump is heard, here, discussing, on the audio that CNN brought you first. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: This was the Defense Department and him.",

When you destroy evidence, a tape, it no longer exists, if it's destroyed. So, I think the seriousness of the obstruction, I think, is escalated, based on the conduct here. And what you have is that destruction is directly connected to the former President. The second piece is one of the documents that you talked about, on there, connecting to the briefing that occurred, at Bedminster. That's now are charged.

And now, we see he's indicted.We know that he was one of the people that was working with Walt Nauta. They were seen, on video, moving boxes. Apparently, Carlos De Oliveira is the one, who was assigned to put on the lock, on the storage room, which is what the Trump team had told prosecutors, and told the Justice Department, that they were going to secure all of those boxes, all of those documents, to make sure that they were in a safe place. And then, obviously, after that, prosecutors knew that the box is removed. One of the things that to me really stands out is, this indictment, this new indictment, really brings forward the timeline, right? Because, the previous one really stops, back in June of 2022, when they come, and they retrieve the boxes. And of course, we know the FBI went and did a subsequent search. This fills in so many of the blanks that we knew that there was something -- there was something amiss, and that there were witnesses, who had come forward, to the Justice Department, and told them, that box is removed, and that there was an effort of obstruction. This really fills in the blanks on that obstruction picture. And it's a lot worse, once they get the subpoena for their surveillance.",

That's the quote. \"I'm just an open book.\" Earlier that day, he had documents, flown to Bedminster. Then, wait a minute, all of a sudden the FBI discovers that there is a surveillance system there.

You have to have intentionality, sort of knowledge and awareness. And the evidence with respect to the destruction, that's the purpose of it. You don't destroy a video, unless you don't want that video to be shown. You want to hide it. That's awareness that there's something on there.

So, destroying the evidence that to try and keep him out of court. This system is not being bullied against Donald Trump. Donald Trump needs to get out of the race. Republicans need to have a backbone, and say, \"This is not good for our party. This is not good for our country. And enough is enough.\" They won't do that, because, for whatever reason, they think it's a good brand. But it's not a good brand, in the general election. Republican candidates, you would hope that when something like this comes out, they might say something. Republicans that support Trump, you would hope they would turn their backs. But they're not going to say something.

They feel stuck.But the reality is in any other race, against any other person, when your opponent is indicted, multiple times, you don't wait and see, you don't look at the larger picture. You use that. And I've told Republican campaigns who say, \"Look, we're going to wait to draw our contrast,\" which is the campaign term that we sometimes use, \"and we have a debate coming up in about a month.
