      "sentences": "It continues to intensify. It is sitting in such warm ocean temperatures. Every update from the hurricane center says it is still rapidly intensifying. A category one hurricane right now. With 85-mile-per-hour winds, sitting 800 miles west and southwest of Tampa, Florida.Now as it continues its trek, it's going to cut across the Gulf of Mexico here, which will allow it to rapidly intensify again to possibly category four hurricane with 145 mile per hour wind. As it gets closer to Florida, some of that intensity could wane a little bit, gets shaved off and take it down to a category three as it hits landfall. But at that point still, we're still looking at massive impacts when it comes to storm surge, the damaging winds and the rain, and not just for one portion of Florida but for the entire peninsula. Where exactly that eye goes will determine who gets the worst of the storm surge. Now it could weaken some a little bit as it gets towards Florida because there's this front nearby, that same front that's steering Milton into Florida. Could also shave down its intensity a little bit as it makes landfall. Again, like I said, the ocean temperatures incredibly warm, middle and upper 80s, and that's what's fueling this intensification over and over again. But also something that we're watching, too, is the spread here in where exactly that eye could take direct aim. Right now, look at the spread of possibilities from Cedar Key down to Fort Myers. So something that we're watching very closely, especially when it comes to the Tampa Bay area. They don't really have a history with major hurricanes coming near the Tampa Bay area. If it goes a little bit to the north of Tampa Bay, that will push the worst of the storm surge into Tampa Bay. Obviously a huge city with a lot of population so something to keep a close eye on. So again continues the next two days to rapidly intensify in the open ocean. Outer bands start to come in by Tuesday night, and then by Wednesday is when we'll start to feel those most devastating impacts of that eye coming on land. Landfall should be some time, maybe Wednesday afternoon. No matter what the storm does as far as intensity category, any of that, it will squeeze out so much rain. Five to eight inches up to 10 to 12 inches possible in some areas. And of course, this area is still dealing with the impacts of Helene -- Jessica.",

I think the biggest point here is that this is one of the largest gender gaps in history when it comes to any election, and so for her anytime she has a platform where she can talk about gender issues and that includes being part of a family, being a mother figure, this is a really positive platform for her.And she's also lucky, by the way, that \"Call Her Daddy\" agreed to do this because she said, Alexandra Cooper, at the start of this interview, that she's not really political, that she doesn't want to encourage, you know, political discourse necessarily amongst her audience. But she's here because she herself cares about bringing a platform to women. And so I think for Kamala Harris, this is about driving forth a winning narrative in the final weeks leading up to the election. And she doesn't care which platform she needs to do it. This is obviously great for young woman, but I'm very curious to see what her reaction is going to be from voters when she joins very different audiences. Think about Univision is coming up later this week. You mentioned some late-night comedy shows, \"Colbert.\" She joined Howard Stern.

That's not what it's going to be like with \"60 Minutes.\"She has to be able to answer tough questions on things like immigration policy, on hurricane relief, on the border. And so for her team that's prepping her, it's this duality of be prepared, tough policy questions -- on tough policy questions, but also be yourself. I think actually Kamala Harris has really struggled on the part about being herself, and so the \"Call Her Daddy,\" I hope she goes into this week sort of, you know, reflecting on that moment and thinking about how she's going to bring a little bit more of herself to some of these tough news interviews, because I think that could be a strength for her.

I spoke to an official in Rutherford County, North Carolina, who said this has hampered our response to the recovery because we've been dealing with all this misinformation, trying to debunk these rumors.Here's what I think it's all about, Jessica. It's all about trust. If people don't have any trust in anyone or anything anymore, if they've lost all faith in government and politicians entirely, then they're not able to engage rationally with the environment around them. Look, I'm skeptical. I'm critical. We're all critical and skeptical of our government. But when you start from a place of assuming everything is false and everything is a lie, and assuming the government is always incompetent, then you end up in a very dark place. And that's where we are especially with some Trump supporters. In this case, the government response has not been perfect, but FEMA is on the ground. You can log in and watch videos for yourself seen the government response to Helene. And yet there is this assumption mostly from the right, mostly from the far-right, that the government has failed and they're going to fail again later this week in Florida. I think it all comes down to trust. So you ask, what do we do about this? But what can the country do? What can we all do? Bit by bit. It's about rebuilding and regaining trust, showing that some people and some things are actually trustworthy. I think that's the only way through this because I think all the lies this week about Helene they're an ominous sign for the lies we're going to hear about the election next month.",

I don't know that they have the equation perfectly right but they want to impose some costs on the Iranian people to make them understand how expensive it is to have such a regime that is in charge of them. I do think they're seriously considering and that there is political pressure for Netanyahu from at least two of his opponents to do something about the nuclear sites, even if they're spread everywhere and some are embedded in mountains. And then finally, Netanyahu may also go after leadership targets inside of Iran. Think the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps, the group within the government that manages Iran's terrorist proxies.

So, I can talk about it with you and it's a very concerning breach for US National Security officials because you're talking about sort of the backbone or the internet and phone companies, call records and that kind of thing, who's talking to who.So, when the US government, law enforcement, like the FBI, wants to access -- if they're issuing a warrant, search warrant for call records, they go to one of these big companies and ask for it using a warrant. And so, if the Chinese government has access to some of that information that the US government is looking for, that is a huge concern. The Justice Department has prosecuted Chinese government-linked hackers before, and also Chinese government agents for allegedly harassing Chinese citizens on US soil. So, there's a keen interest from Beijing and finding out what those federal prosecutors are interested in, Jessica. And this breach was recently discovered, but we believe based on reporting that the hackers have -- may have had access to the telecom firms for many months and were quietly sitting there and looking for potentially sensitive information that there could be collected for, for intelligence gathering. So, this is one of those five-alarm fires that breaks out every few months it seems like in the US government where they're hurrying to try to figure out how bad this is and how to put out the fire. In this case, these are three big telecom companies and they've been cooperating with the US government, but it is really just the latest example of how alleged Chinese hackers are burrowing into US critical infrastructure -- Jessica.",

Sean Lyngaas, thank you very much for that reporting, we appreciate it.And we are just 30 days away from the presidential election and the Trump and Harris campaigns are honing in on the key battleground state of Pennsylvania. We saw Donald Trump and his running mate hitting the trail there at last night. Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, also making a stop there trying to garner the support from a growing demographic that could make a difference in November, that's Latino voters.   CNN's Danny Freeman reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Fresh off his vice presidential debate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was in Redding, Pennsylvania, stopping at a Puerto Rican-owned restaurant to boost support among the city's majority Latino population. GOV. TIM WALZ (D) VICE PRESIDENT NOMINEE: This is thing is going to come down to our blue wall states, come down to Pennsylvania and I come right through this restaurant. FREEMAN (voice over): At the same time, just four blocks away, the Trump the campaign was holding its own phone bank, specifically targeting Latinos in the Lehigh Valley.

We've seen aunts and sisters and nieces take it before with past presidents in US history.But regardless of which woman is filling that position, we've seen how it's changed so much over the years, but also how it hasn't. It's a position where its ill-defined. It's not paid. The person is not elected to that position, but often they find themselves facing a great amount of scrutiny and that doesn't have anything to do with necessarily how they do the job. First Ladies who have done a lot like Hillary Clinton when it came to health care and how she sought to use her platform for that role was criticized Melania Trump and how she did not fulfill the conventional stereotype of what we have come to know as a country, a First Lady to do, what that looks like. She was also criticized. It's one of those 'damned if you do, damned if you don't', kind of positions. But one part of it that is been pretty antiquated that stood out to me is, we've always been obsessed with what First Lady is wearing, how she dresses. There's even an entire exhibit in the Smithsonian dedicated to the inaugural gowns that these former First Ladies have worn. It's a fascinating look through history to see them. You can see how much the country has changed, but Melania Trump was someone who, while she may not have been as visible of a presence, she certainly used her outfits to speak for her and send a message.
