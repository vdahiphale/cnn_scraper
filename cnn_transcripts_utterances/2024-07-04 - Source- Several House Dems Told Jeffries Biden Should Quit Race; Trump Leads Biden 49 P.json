Joe Biden is pushing back against calls to drop out of the race as Democratic governors insists at least publicly that the president is, quote, in it to win it. And they're still behind him. But behind the scenes, that's not what my colleagues and I are hearing from concerned Democrats.Plus, chaos is our friend. That's the message from the Trump campaign as the former president makes the rare move to see the spotlight to the current president as his uncertain political future. And Happy Birthday America. On this Independence Day, we'll hear from West Point cadets about their choice to serve the nation and what they believe makes the United States of America so special. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start on this Independence Day with a whole lot at stake for our nation, as members of the president's own party question whether he's up for four more years as commander in chief. But Joe Biden is digging in. A fundraising email last night had the subject line quote, I'm running. The president is also trying to ease concerns about the debate in a new radio interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voiceover): Is there any reason for the American people to be concerned? JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (voiceover): No, I had a bad debate. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voiceover): Yeah. BIDEN (voiceover): I had a bad debate. But 90 minutes on stages does not erase what I've done for three and a half years. I'm proud of the record and we just got to keep moving. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Although, Jeffries himself we are told is still in listening mode. But to be clear, not everyone we talked to feels that way.

CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, CNN's Kristen Holmes, Catherine Lucey of The Wall Street Journal, and Molly Ball also the Wall Street Journal. Hi, everybody. Happy fourth? Can you tell it's a fourth of July? I like to lean into these moments.OK. So, let's start with where we are on this July 4, which is, as I said at the beginning, this is definitely a campaign and a president at a crossroads. And I want to set the table with the CNN Poll of Polls. But there have been some polls that have come out since the debate and what CNN does is put them all together. And here's what it shows. Pre debate, trump 49, Biden 47. Post debate, you can see that Biden has gone down a few points. It is so close, but not as close as it was. Priscilla, you cover the White House for us. Obviously, these are the public polls. I am very confident that the Biden campaign and the White House are looking at internal data as well.",

They took that extraordinary step shortly after the debate to show what other Democratic candidates would look like against foreign President Donald Trump. So, this is top of mind. Oftentimes, when these polls have come out, the campaign will quickly dismiss them, and say, look, we know it's going to be a tight race. And that's what these polls show.But what you also showed there is that after the debate, the president lost some support. And even if this is going to be a tight race, that is not promising polling for them in this very moment. When they are trying to convince their donors and they're trying to convince the Democratic Party, that the president is the one that is still best suited to go up against former President Donald Trump. Now, another takeaway from those polls was how Vice President Kamala Harris was slightly outpacing President Biden in a hypothetical matchup with Donald Trump, that perhaps in some ways, especially for her allies is comforting. But that doesn't mean that she's suddenly going to try to undercut him and try to take the lead here. What it does say is that at least some part of the ticket is showing promise. But in this very moment, President Biden is not delivering in these polls the way that they wanted to, and they are still looking. And they are aware that it's very critical.

In fact, they don't really like or interested in either of these candidates.And so, the one moment that Donald Trump and Joe Biden had to really showcase themselves was this debate that we know millions of people watch. Now, Joe Biden has to basically piece together various events to try and get the traction back that was lost during that debate. I mean, as somebody who has covered Donald Trump for two years, I can tell you that most of America are not watching his rallies. They're not listening. They're seeing a few clips online, but they don't pay attention. Because a lot of America doesn't actually like Donald Trump. It's the same thing with both candidates. They're not watching these candidates. So now he has a harder road to go down to try to fix this.",

And that's when it really appeared to them that this could mean something, something could happen next. Now, I will note, they have spent millions of dollars on data modelling, trying to figure out the best pathway to beat President Joe Biden. So, whether or not Joe Biden is on the ticket actually does really matter to them. But what's interesting to me is that they've really spent the last year kind of floating this conspiracy theory that Joe Biden wasn't going to be the nominee, that at some last moment he was going to step down was going to be someone else.
