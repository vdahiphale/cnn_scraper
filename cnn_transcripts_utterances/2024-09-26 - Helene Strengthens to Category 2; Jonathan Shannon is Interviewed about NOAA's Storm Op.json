We take that whole kit out to where the storm is so that we can give people the most amount of time to prepare, get that data to the National Hurricane Center so they have the - the - the best picture. And then we also work with our Caribbean countries, our Caribbean partners. We can forward stage so that they are also aware and we can track it all the way in to, unfortunately, where you are. Tallahassee is where forecast landfall is. So, be safe to you as well. BERMAN: Yes, I appreciate that. Yes, 20 miles south of here is the actual coast. The coast itself, not heavily populated, but Tallahassee certainly is, 200,000 people. So, a lot of people watching the storm very closely.

Kamala Harris actually has a three-point lead in the average poll among voters 65 or older. And let me point out, no Democrat has carried this group since Al Gore in 2000.

I'm going to vote for the person making that argument.But there's some interesting things that I saw in the poll that I think may benefit the former president. We've talked a lot about women. With white women in particular, 50 percent for Trump, 47 percent for Vice President Harris. Can the former president increase those margins by 2 percent or 3 percent? That could certainly benefit him in a place like Pennsylvania. Another thing that I thought was very fascinating. We asked in that same poll, which candidate has policy positions on major issues that align with you. Donald Trump, 29 percent, to Kamala Harris, 18 percent.

And also, they pay a lot of attention to things like Project 2025, which really threatens the things that they care about most. Things like Social Security and Medicare. They pay attention to - when Trump talks about tariffs, across the board tariffs. Twenty percent across-the-board tariffs, which they understand is just a tax increase on them.We did a study recently that shows that groceries alone would go up by $185 a year with those 20 percent tariffs. And all in, it's about $4,000 a year for an average family or senior. So, they get that what Trump is proposing is very bad.

He wants to deport 9 million people from an economy where we have basically full employment, which would drive up prices.So, I don't think it's - they're - they 're reacting to the things that he's proposing. I think that they're looking back at pre-pandemic prices and thinking those were good and - and why can't we go back to that? That didn't have anything to do with Trump. That's just the world that we lived in, not just the United States, but the entire world. And we live in a new world now. So, I think its understand.

That's if Russia is hit with conventional missiles. That threat comes as Zelenskyy addressed the United Nations General Assembly this week, and as the U.S. and the U.K. considers Zelenskyy's plead for the lifting of missile restrictions to allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia.

Putin decreeing on Wednesday that he wants to update Russia's nuclear doctrine. That has not been done since 2020. Now, as for what is in there. Well, on the one hand, they're saying, you know, they're going to include Belarus now under Russia's nuclear umbrella. Not remotely surprising given that they've already positioned nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus and carried out joint nuclear drills. On the second point, there's now this idea that if a non-nuclear country launches an attack on Russia in - with the support, in Putin's words, of a nuclear-armed country, it will be considered a joint attack. That is clearly a direct nod to this issue around western provided long range missiles and whether the west will give permission to use them on Russian soil. And then he seemed to be broadening the definition, broadening the scope of when a first strike would be allowable under this doctrine. Take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The conditions for Russia's position for the use of nuclear weapons are clearly established. We will consider this possibility upon receipt of reliable information about the massive launch of air and space attack weapons and their crossing of our state border and the strategic or tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, drones, hypersonic, and other aircraft.
