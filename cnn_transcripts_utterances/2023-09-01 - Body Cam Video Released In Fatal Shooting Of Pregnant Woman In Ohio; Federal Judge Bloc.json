Sadly, neither the mother nor that unborn child survived this incident. This happened on August 24th in Blendon Township in Ohio, just northeast of Columbus in Ohio. Police were already on the scene there to help out a shopper whose keys had gotten stuck in the car when a supermarket employee came out and told the police that Miss Young had shoplifted something. One of the officers goes to her car, to the driver's side, tells her about 10 times that I counted, \"Get out of the car, get out of the car. You've been -- somebody said you shoplifted. Get out of the car.\" And she refuses. The other officers goes out in front of the car. He bangs on the car and says, \"Get the 'F' out of the car.\" And seconds later, a single shot is fired. Here's how it played out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's provocative information on the Internet. And the fact that kids are spending the majority of their time on social media, they may not understand the nature of what it is that they are engaged in, number one. Number two, it takes time away from face-to-face interactions, exercise and so on. And then you are looking at developing brains and dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that fires every time there's something pleasurable going on. Perhaps having some issues with kids being stuck on the Internet, being somewhat addicted to the things they are seeing on social media. So there are some real dangers out there.

And researchers need to prioritize what the harm of social media can be as well as some of the benefits, because there are some benefits, especially for children who need support around their sexuality, identity, or perhaps emotional issues that they are having. But, also, he states that the digital industries, these social media companies themselves need to be working hand in hand with parents to make it safer.

Retirement isn't easy for any professional athlete, and he just did not want this to be over. The 38-year-old played Michael Mmoh in the second round on Thursday. They battled through five sets and almost four hours. In the end, it came down to a tiebreak. Isner lost it. And afterwards, with the media, he could barely find the words to describe the moment.
