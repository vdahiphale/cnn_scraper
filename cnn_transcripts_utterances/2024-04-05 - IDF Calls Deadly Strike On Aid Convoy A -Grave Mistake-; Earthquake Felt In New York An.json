In fact, the last holdout was Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. That is now transitioned to a ground delay, meaning that flights are delayed at their departure airport bound for Newark, 77 minutes, so an hour and 17 minutes.Seems like that'll be in place according to the FAA until 9:59 p.m. tonight. So the air travel impact is not over just yet. The ground stops were canceled at LaGuardia at JFK, at BWI, and at Philadelphia. The cancellations and delays remain relatively low. But remember, New York, the city that never sleeps, always on the move a million to a million and a half people commute in a lot of them by rail. And they're still delays right now on the New Jersey transit system. Also on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and Amtrak says that tracks must be inspected and that trains are being speed restricted up and down the Northeast Corridor, and that will be in place until those inspections can be complete. So we're just at the genesis of that story. A lot of people could be impacted by that. The good news here is that MTA, which operates the subway system and some of the commuter rail systems in the New York area, they say that there are no impacts to MTA services and that services are operating normally. Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel, both been inspected by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. All the delays are clear there as well. Although remember here, Dana, the thing is that a lot of these pieces of infrastructure need to be looked at visually.",

The IDF says it thought it was a bag, but it turns out -- excuse me, thought a bag was a weapon, that is according to an Israeli released after action report about how a tragic IDF screw up killed seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen by mistake. The detailed account of what went wrong follows a Biden ultimatum. The President of the United States says aid to Israel will no longer be a sure thing if Israel doesn't protect civilians and do it now.I want to get straight to CNN's Nic Robertson.

This is hugely significant, something Secretary Blinken was asking for back in February when he was here. The Erez Crossing is in the north of Gaza and is close to the port of Ashdod that the -- the -- the cabinet, the war cabinet here says that they've agreed to open to import humanitarian aid. And what's important here is that Ashdod, the port is very, very close to the Erez Crossing. So the potential here to really open up a quick and efficient humanitarian aid corridor into northern Gaza. But this has stumbled despite promises made like this in the past before.",

You are in New York. I understand that you felt the earthquake this morning. Describe that and what you're seeing and hearing from your constituents now. REP. RITCHIE TORRES, (D) NEW YORK: Well, I'm here in the Bronx and I was fielding phone calls when all of a sudden my home was shaking substantially. It was a momentarily terrifying experience. But like every congressional office, we're in close contact with FEMA, the governor's office, the mayor's office on we -- you know, so far there's no reason to be alarmed. There have been no reports of damage to infrastructure. There have been ground delays at airports out of an abundance of caution. But there's no interruption to the MTA to New York City Public Transit Service.

The Republicans have been in charge of the House since October 7th and have fundamentally failed to pass a bipartisan bill that provides aid to Israel. The Republicans refused to bring to the floor a national security supplemental that would provide aid to all of our allies, Taiwan, Israel and Ukraine.And so if you're allowing aid to Israel to languish indefinitely, then you're in no position to lecture anyone, including President Biden on his support for Israel. You know, I share the view that every conceivable effort must be made to minimize Palestinian casualties, to maximize humanitarian aid, to Palestinians in distress. But at the same time, any attempt to fundamentally undermine the U.S. Israel relationship will ultimately benefit Hamas, which had perpetrated the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, a fact that the world seems to have forgotten.",

The war was imposed upon Israel by the barbarism and terrorism of Hamas, which must be removed from power.If Hamas remains in power, it will regroup, rearm and launch even deadlier terror attacks than the atrocities of October 7th. Hamas has publicly said that it's intent on repeating October 7th, and we ignore that threat at our own peril. So I disagree. I'm in favor of preserving the U.S.-Israel relationship on removing Hamas from power, but doing so in a manner that minimizes Palestinian casualties and delivers aid to those in need.",

So the idea is what causes the strong shaking is when the earthquake happens, we have a fault, the two sides slip past each other really quickly, generating seismic waves. So if that fault's really close to you, you feel the shaking more severely than if you're farther away, where the seismic waves have some time to get smaller.So shallow earthquakes produce really severe shaking right above them. If the earthquake's deeper, then you're naturally farther away from the earthquake, where the seismic waves won't be as big.",
