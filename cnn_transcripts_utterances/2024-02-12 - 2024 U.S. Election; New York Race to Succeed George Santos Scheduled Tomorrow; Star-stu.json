George Santos, of course, won by eight points. And even Joe Pinion, who lost by double digits statewide won this district by four percentage points. And I'll also note that in the off-year elections in 2023, the local elections, the Republicans did very well here. So, this is an ultimate sort of swing district, John. You know, you were mentioning, why is this district important? It's because it's one that swung back between Democrats in 2020, then Republicans in 2022. So, this is a district, this is probably the last best sort of idea of where the electorate is in this point.

There's currently a winter storm watch out for Long Island, for New York's 3rd District for five to eight inches of snow. And I will note that Democrats do seem to have turned out early. They've made up a fairly large percentage of the early vote out there. So, Republicans are going to probably have to make that up on election day.

They looked at about 1,200 species around the world, 44 percent of them in decline.And the threats are as a result of over exploitation, there is illegal hunting and fishing, poaching that happens on land and in the sea. Loss of habitat, human activity, of course, cutting down forests to make way for developments or roads, pollution in the air and in the sea. And then of course, climate change is the one that hangs over everything, just making some places unlivable for some species now. And if you look at the numbers, 44 percent of these 1,200 in decline and 22 percent on the brink of extinction. It really is sobering. I talked to biologists and colleges all the time, worried about their areas of study. But when you see it written whole like this, it is really sobering.",

I mean, we just looked at the humpback whale comeback, one of the great success stories because humanity focused on that species, brought it back from the brink there. And there is, right now, agreements from all governments to set aside 30 percent of the wilderness by the year 2030.And if that can be implemented, the authors of this report says, that will do so much of the work for us. Just protecting the high seas where nobody owns it so nobody takes care of it. There's a high oceans treaty that needs to be ratified ASAP. It really is in the hands of humans to determine the fate, not just of ourselves, but life as we know it. And by saving bats, which you may not be fond of, or whales that you never see, we're ultimately saving ourselves.",
