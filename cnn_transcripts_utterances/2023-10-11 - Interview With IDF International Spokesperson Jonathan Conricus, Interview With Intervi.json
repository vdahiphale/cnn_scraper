Then, as the horrors of the Hamas attack come into stark clarity, I speak to a wounded survivor of the festival massacre who says his friends were shot in front of him. Plus, I'm joined by Middle East expert and bestselling author Kim Ghattas looking ahead to this war in light of painful Middle East history. Also, ahead, lights out in Gaza as Israel's retaliation reduces parts of that city to rubble. We have a special report. And I speak to a Palestinian writer in Gaza City who says his pregnant cousin died in the recent strikes. Later in the program, my conversation with Guatemala's president-elect on the dim hope for peace in the Middle East and the crisis with his own people surging to the U.S. border. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Israel has announced an emergency wartime government. President Biden had another phone conversation with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as the nation builds up its military forces on the Gaza border. Here's what Biden said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: This attack has brought to the surface the painful memories and scars left by a millennium of anti-Semitism and genocide against the Jewish people. And this moment, we have to be crystal clear, there is no justification for terrorism. No excuse. And the type of terrorism that is exhibited here is just beyond the pale. Beyond the pale. As I said yesterday, my commitment to Israel's security and the safety of the Jewish people is unshakable. The United States has Israel's back and we're going to be working on this all through today and beyond. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Andthe atrocities committed by Hamas on Israeli border communities is coming into ever more grisly focus. A government spokesman now confirms reports that babies and toddlers were found with \"heads decapitated\" in the Kfar Aza kibbutz in Southern Israel. At least 1,200 people have been killed in the assault, according to the Israeli military. In Gaza, lights have all but gone out as the main power plant has shut down for lack of fuel, and Israel continues to avenge its dead with waves of massive airstrikes. More than a thousand people have been killed so far in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials there. The Israeli defense minister says he has \"released all restraints on the IDF.\" Meantime, people in Northern Israel near the Lebanon border are being ordered by the IDF to go to bomb shelters. And joining me now is the IDF spokesperson, Jonathan Conricus. Welcome back to our program. Jonathan Conricus, can you confirm to us first the fears that everybody had about an expansion of this attack against Israel? Is there -- how can you describe what's happening to the north and the fact that Israelis have been told to go to shelters there?",

The difference between Saturday and today is that now Southern Israel is saturated with lots of Israeli troops, and that's why the terrorists are not being able to kill civilians. On the north, on the Lebanese border, the situation is very tense. Alarms just sounded all over Northern Israel and the all clear has been sounded, yet the situation remains volatile. Yesterday night, rockets were fired, most likely by a Palestinian militia from Syrian soil onto Israel. They did not cause any damage and we responded, retaliated with fire against the source of fire. So, there are three open fronts which are active, dangerous. We are deployed along them, monitoring the events and ready to respond to any assault against Israeli sovereignty and civilians.",

However, it must be said, and I know that you've heard this before and the viewers have heard it, but I would like to repeat it, Hamas hides all of its infrastructure behind civilians. They use their civilians as human shields, and they have designed their entire operational concept on having civilians between them and us. And unfortunately, what happens when we are targeting military targets, targets that are qualified as proper legitimate military targets underneath civilian infrastructure, we try our best not to strike civilians, but in some cases, there are unfortunate consequences. I can assure you that we remain committed to the law of armed conflict. We will continue to conduct ourselves as such. But I think we have to be very clear about what it is we're facing. There's an underground city underneath the Gaza Strip, dug by Hamas of an elaborate tunnel system, which allows Hamas to continue to fight as they're firing rockets and sending terrorists into Israel. They're hiding behind their civilians.",

Kim, clearly this is, you know, very, very emotional stuff and we put warnings on because it is really, really hard to listen to and I just wonder, you know, your reaction to all of this since it's been unfolding. You're a journalist as well, and, you know, since Saturday.",

The relationship has been uneasy over the past years because of Iran's involvement on the side of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Hamas took a step back from that but is getting closer again. And over the last year or so we've heard a lot about the unification of France, that is encircling -- that means encircling Israel with fire from Southern Lebanon, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Gaza, and of course, the presence of Iranian assets and Hezbollah and Iran and militants as well in Syria. That's what we've been hearing from Hamas and Hezbollah. Now, it's been very interesting to hear the different statements coming out over the last few days from the different groups and from Iran. There was a very clear effort by Hezbollah to say that they support their brothers in - - from Hamas, that they -- this is also a message to any country that is efforting to normalize relations with Israel. They're thinking about Saudi Arabia, of course. But what struck me most was one of the statements from Ismail Haniyeh, the chief of Hamas, saying that this shows that Israel cannot protect you, you Arab countries who are seeking to normalize. And that, to me, sounds very much like a veiled threat. But what struck me even more is the denial from Iran itself, from the ayatollah, Ali -- the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, saying that Iran was not involved in this. And it sounds to me when you put that together with statements from the United States, from Washington, D.C., including from the secretary of state, saying there's no evidence of Iran involvement, but they must be complicit, it sounds to me like everybody is worried that this could reach a regional conflagration, including the Iranians, and they want to take this step by step. But as I said, Christiane, the risk of miscalculation is absolutely there. And Hamas' game plan is frankly unclear. I mean, this sounds like a kamikaze operation, like a last stand, because they know they're going to get hit hard. And unfortunately, Palestinian civilians are going to suffer.",

Andto that extent, that was successful because the PLO did leave. Of course, it led to devastation in Beirut, a siege. No food, no water, no fuel for two months. You know, we're hearing that again about Gaza. It led, of course, to the absolutely horrific massacre in the Palestinian camp of Sabra and Shatila carried out by Israel's Christian allies. But in the bigger picture, it caused the complete opposite of what Israel was hoping to achieve. It wanted to -- Sharon, Ariel Sharon, the defense minister at the time, wanted to change the Middle East. He thought he could defeat the PLO, make peace with Lebanon, bring Syria to its knees, because Syria took a real beating as well during that invasion with its forces in Lebanon bombarded by the Israelis. And what did you get instead? You get the crystallization of the Axis of Resistance, as it's known today. It was the birth of Hezbollah. It was the arrival of Iran in the Levant. Two days after the Israelis invaded, a plane load of Revolutionary Guards from Iran arrived in Syria and then traveled onwards to Lebanon. And of course, Syria found a role as the spoiler of America's agenda in the region in alliance with Iran. The idea that you can decapitate a militant group hasn't worked for Israel. That's what they keep trying to do. They've done this in Lebanon, not just in '82, but also in 2006 with Hezbollah and it doesn't work. It doesn't work. There has to be some restraint, and that is also the responsibility of the International Community because we must remember the civilians who will pay the price in Gaza, who really have not many places to go to. And we must think about the bigger picture, without any concessions at some point to the Palestinians to address the core of the issue, which is the occupation, we will keep seeing these cycles of violence with extreme ideas on both sides. Very violent militancy by Palestinian groups like Hamas, but also the rise of, you know, extreme right-wing governments like Prime Minister Netanyahu's government.",

They changed the landscape by continuing to bomb a place for hours, nonstop. And also, by pulling down houses on tops of the people inside of them. Now, by just a few hours ago, the minister of the interior (INAUDIBLE) published a statement that says that about 23 families, 23 whole families were wiped out from history. And we don't know who's next. Because in my house now, I have about four families.
