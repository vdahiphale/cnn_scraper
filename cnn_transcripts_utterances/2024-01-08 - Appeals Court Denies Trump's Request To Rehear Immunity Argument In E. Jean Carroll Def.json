The -- Trump is arguing that the whole case should be thrown out before it's even tried, which is unusual in a criminal case because under his understanding of presidential immunity, he has the right not even to be tried.In most criminal appeals, you have to wait until you're convicted. But in a very narrow set of circumstances, you can argue that you don't even have to be go to trial. That's what he's arguing. It's a tough case for him, I think. COATES: It's a really uphill battle for a lot of reasons. I mean, I remember the argument about if I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and no one would care. He's essentially saying, because I lived on Pennsylvania Avenue, that's all I have to have in order to have immunity in these cases. And, of course, the court will look at this through the lens of the kind of wild, wild west novel argument. But many people, Jeffrey, as you know, and you've written the book on Supreme Court, they will have this assumption that this will all be decided according to who appointed these judges.

And for those keeping score at home, it is two Democratic appointees and one Republican appointee who are hearing this case, which I think lends some optimism to the Jack Smith's team because of that -- because of that makeup. But it's also true that this argument, even for Donald Trump, is a pretty extraordinary stretch. Remember, when we covered the Mueller investigation and that there was much discussion of the fact that there is a Justice Department policy. It's not a law, but a policy that says a sitting president should not be indicted. But implicit in that policy is that, of course, he could be indicted later for something he did, and that's always been the assumption. I mean, remember, Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974 for his crimes in Watergate. If he -- if he couldn't be prosecuted, there would be no need for a pardon.",

Both approaches suggest that Trump can face trial.Even if Trump loses in the D.C. Circuit, however, there's a way he could win, which is the issue of timing, because this issue -- this case is now stayed. There's a stay in effect where the trial date is set for May. But the case is not yet proceeding to trial because of the pendency of this appeal. What's equally interesting in this case is not just how they rule but whether they continue the stay, whether the D.C. Circuit or ultimately the Supreme Court says, okay, we're going to hear this case, but we're going to let the trial proceed. That issue, in fact, if you are concerned about a trial before the election, the timing issue is almost as important as the merits of the case.

Thank God that nobody was tragically injured or killed on this aircraft.But this could have been extraordinarily bad. I'm wondering, after you have listened to what you just heard, what is your confidence level in terms of what could have caused this to happen and can it be quickly addressed? People are getting ready to fly all over this country every single hour of the day, and they're now worried whether they're on that type of aircraft or otherwise. MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Yeah, it's understandable, the worry. Laura, this one is going to be solved by looking at metal. You know, we can talk about the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder and the lights that illuminate on the pressurized system. But ultimately, they're going to be looking at those bolts and those spring hinges, and they're going to be looking for what they call witness marks, which is to say damage evidence to see if a bolt or a knot sheared off or if there are missing pieces or if there's any evidence that a knot was screwed on and a little wire wasn't put through the bolt itself to ensure it doesn't loosen. Basically, the way this door is rigged up, if those bolts are not in and locked in, it's kind of spring loaded almost like a mousetrap to be expelled from the aircraft if it gets jostled around. And so, I think the pieces are probably there or maybe they aren't there, and that's the key. What might be missing is very important. And as we've heard earlier today from the \"Associated Press,\" United has found some loose bolts in similar aircraft. So, it appears in Renton, Washington, when these fuselages were assembled, some bolts may not have been tightened properly or at least that seems to be where we're headed on this. But it's still a little bit early to draw that conclusion. I do think we'll know, though, and I don't think, at the end of the day, people should feel particularly unsafe about this aircraft. There's no fundamental design flaw here. It appears they might have missed a step in the construction of the aircraft, and that's crucial.",

He acknowledged that we've never fully achieved that value as a nation.But those were strong words. I was gratified that he invoked white supremacy as a threat to democracy, although I wish he had unpacked that a little for people who may be are less familiar with the notion. You know, I think that the kind of laundry list of accomplishments, they're important. You know, I think they have to be said and, you know, polling shows that a lot of voters aren't familiar with what the president has accomplished.

You know, it's important that he has reduced the prices of prescription drugs. But what about making healthcare a human right? I think, you know, voters don't -- voters understand that we're in a difficult political moment. They're not necessarily expecting the president to deliver on every aspect of his values.

However, and I know Draymond very well and I'll say this, a lot of the issues he was dealing with were self-inflicted. So, you can't say it's too much if you're not willing to take the responsibility. Too much is given, much is required. You don't get to make all this money and behave any kind of way and do whatever you want to do without people saying you're no longer allowed to behave that way. You get a reputation.
