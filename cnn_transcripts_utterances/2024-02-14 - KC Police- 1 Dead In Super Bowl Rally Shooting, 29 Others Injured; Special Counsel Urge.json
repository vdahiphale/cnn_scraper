We'll speak with a man who helped police detain someone possibly involved in the shooting.Also tonight, more breaking news, Special Counsel Jack Smith quickly responding to the Supreme Court answering the former president's claim he's immune from prosecution. And new classified intelligence and new concerns about Russia's nuclear capabilities in space.   Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with what is already, in just 45 days, the country's 48th mass shooting of 2024. Multiple gunshots, too fast to count, just as a parade and rally for the Chiefs is wrapping up outside Kansas City's Union Station: 22 people were hit, at least one killed. Kansas City's police chief says three people are detained. Now, one person was apprehended by good Samaritans. I'm going to show you this video. We've circled it. A man in a tan jacket running quickly from right to left across your screen, tackled and held by several others until police arrived a few seconds later. We don't know if this is one of the three people police say they are currently holding. We want to go back a few seconds with this video. As he's running, you see a man in a yellow shirt on the other side of the barrier pointing, identifying the person fleeing, pointing him out to others in the crowd. That person's name is Tony, and you'll hear from him shortly. I just spoke with him. But first, more on what we're learning from CNN Security Correspondent, former FBI Special Agent, Josh Campbell. So what are authorities saying about what happened, because the press conference, which went on for some time in the last hour or two, it didn't have a lot of specifics.",

That's the big question we all have had, and particularly members of the community, Anderson, wondering, is there a continuing threat.In so many of these mass shootings that we've covered, you will often hear police come out and say, we believe we got the person responsible. There is no ongoing threat. We've not heard that yet from authorities. They're only saying that they have three people detained. They're trying to determine what that involvement might be. Finally, it's worth pointing out that at this point, there's no indication that this specific event was targeted. We've also seen in other incidents, including mass shootings, where you have individuals that are settling some type of personal dispute with guns, essentially shooting at each other. Is that what is at play here? We still don't yet know. Authorities say they're trying to piece together who was involved and what, and trying to get to that motive, obviously.",

But interestingly, they're asking members of the public to also send in any type of video, any type of photography that they might have. We've seen that in numerous mass shootings where the police will appeal to the public.One case in particular, the Boston Marathon bombing, where it was tips from the public that helped identify the location, who those suspects were. And so that's what they're asking right now. They're asking the public, don't decide on your own whether the imagery that I might have is important here, send it to us, let us look at it. They're trying to piece together all that information. And then the last point, obviously, this - the fixated CCTV cameras that are in and around that area going through that information, not only to fixate on the actual location of the shooting, but also the movement of the people in and around that area. And then obviously the big question, even if they have three people, was there a fourth? Were there more? They're hoping a lot of these tips will help answer that.",

It's kind of the first glance that we've had into this possibility that there were more people involved than the two people who are initially reported as having been armed and detained. It also raises the interesting prospect that somebody who's being treated as a victim may have actually also been involved in the shooting - so as a suspect in the investigation.So clearly the Kansas City Police Department has got a tangled mess on their hands to try to get to the bottom of. And I would suspect that they're not really going to be able to do that until they get the sort of assistance from the public that they have now requested, which is to provide - to upload copies of videos and photographs that were taken at the scene in that area when this shooting started. So that will help them a lot, I think, not just place the players on the set as it were, but also to try to try track it back to who was actually firing these shots.",

Typically we have lone offenders, almost always male, although we saw a female mass shooter last weekend and those folks are either killed on the scene or taken into custody by themselves.Now, I should say that the idea of multiple shooters involved in an event like this is not unheard of. And in fact, it's more common in terrorist attacks and certainly ones that we see overseas in Europe and the Middle East and other places. Now I'm not suggesting that this was a terrorist attack. We haven't been given any evidence or facts that would support that. But I think the most likely explanation here, Anderson, is that we have some sort of a conflict between two groups of people that erupted into a gun violence. And it's entirely more likely to happen in a place where many people are carrying firearms.

We've got our logistics train already mapped out, to stay here as long as the president needs us stay here(END VIDEO CLIP) BERTRAND Now, Anderson, one of the big questions that we came away from this experience with is, how much of the Houthi's capabilities has the U.S. actually been able to destroy with their repeated strikes inside Yemen? These strikes are a near daily occurrence now and officials on board these ships didn't have a great answer for us. They don't have a good sense of just how much weaponry the Houthis still have stock piled and that is going to be a really key question when it comes to just how much longer the U.S. is going to have to actually sustain this campaign in the Red Sea, keep those sailors and those pilots in the Red Sea, keep them deployed where they've already been deployed with really no break for the last four months there, Anderson.",
