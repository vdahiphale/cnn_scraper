I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, the U.S. Secretary of State wrapping up his trip to the Middle East, as Israel faces a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon, and a damning report from the UN, accusing both Israel and Hamas of war crimes. We are live in Tel Aviv and London with the latest here. Plus, it is a massive day for U.S. economic news with the latest inflation report and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision happening in just hours. We will look at what this all means for consumers. And Russian navy ships in the Havana Harbor, what this show of force has signaled, with live reports from both Cuba and Moscow. Well, it's time for the haggling to stop and a ceasefire to start. Those words from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as he leaves the Middle East with a cautious message of hope. In a news conference with the Prime Minister of Qatar a short time ago, Blinken said that Hamas has proposed a number of changes to a U.S. outlined ceasefire deal, calling some of those changes workable. Blinken insisted that Israel has accepted the plan, although it has not done so in public, and he is now putting pressure squarely on Hamas. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: If one side continues to change its demands, including making demands and insisting on changes for things that it already accepted, you have to question whether they're proceeding in good faith or not. But, based on what we've seen and what I've discussed with the Prime Minister and what we discussed with our Egyptian colleagues, we're determined to try to bridge the gaps, and I believe those gaps are bridgeable. It doesn't mean they will be bridged, because again, it ultimately depends on people saying yes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Israeli military says that around 200 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon today, and no injuries were reported. Hezbollah did claim responsibility, saying that the attacks were retaliation for the Israeli assassination of a key Hezbollah commander in South Lebanon. The IDF confirming that it killed the commander in an airstrike, saying that he was responsible for multiple attacks against Israeli civilians.Let's bring in now Oren Liebermann, who is following all of these developments from Tel Aviv. Oren, Blinken now wrapping up this trip in the Middle East. Did he accomplish what he needed to with the ceasefire negotiations?",

He wasn't looking to accomplish and have a ceasefire in place before this trip is over. But, it's also clear that he is realistic about where this stands right now, calling on Hamas to accept the ceasefire proposal that's on the table. That's not what happened. 12 days after President Joe Biden publicly backed a ceasefire proposal, one that got endorsement from the UN Security Council, Hamas finally responded last night. Qatar saying this is neither an acceptance or a rejection.Instead, Hamas has put forward a number of amendments and changes to the proposal. Blinken said some of them are workable. Crucially, he said, some of them are not. But, it is clear that he sees a window as do the Qataris to try to move forward here, and that's the goal. Now, they didn't expect to lock this up and wrap this up, while Blinken was in the region. But, there is a chance for opportunity here, and that's what they're trying to focus on. Blinken made it clear, Israel is on board for the proposal that's on the table, and now they'll try to bridge the gaps. The problem is, as they've done before, this has sort of run aground and stalled on the details, and that right now is the fear, and that's what Blinken is being very realistic about. It's not just that, though. He also said, look, there needs to be a day-after plan for temporary ceasefire to turn into permanent ceasefire, and that is where they've run into trouble with the Israelis, because even Israel's own war cabinet has called out Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on not engaging on a day-after plan, and that needs to be a part of his. Blinken said the U.S.'s own proposal on a day-after plan will come in the coming weeks.",

Israel carried out a strike that killed a senior Hezbollah commander, Taleb Sami Abdullah, last night, including several other Hezbollah militants, that according to Hezbollah and according to the IDF.[11:05:00] Hezbollah has responded with some 200 rockets fired into northern Israel, sparking a number of fires. There were tens of thousands of citizens evacuated from northern Israel. This led to several more evacuations, according to Israel police. The area has seen an escalation over the past few weeks. In fact, there were fires raging across northern Israel from Hezbollah rockets one week ago, about, and now we're seeing these fires again. So, on one side, the fighting there doesn't interrupt ceasefire negotiations. On the other side, the fear is that it could lead to another front in the war, and that's what everyone is trying to avoid here. And even if ceasefire negotiations aren't disrupted by the fight in northern Israel, it is also the case and Blinken made this clear that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will lead to at least a cessation of hostilities on the northern border, and that's why the ceasefire, Blinken made clear, is so important.",

Oren, thank you.And another big story we were following today, a damning new UN report on the first three months of the Gaza war, and the inquiry finds that both Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes and grave violations of international law. It's the UN's first in-depth investigation of the October 7 attacks and Israel's ensuing war on Hamas. Now, the report accuses Hamas of intentionally directing attacks against civilians as well as murder and torture, while it accuses Israel of quote \"crimes against humanity\", defining that as widespread systemic attacks on the civilian population of Gaza. Israel, for its part, strongly disputing these findings. Let's get more now from Jomana Karadsheh. She is live for us in London.

But, this is likely to add more pressure on Israel that has come under intense criticism on the global stage for the way it has been conducting this war by -- it's come under criticism from UN bodies and from others in the international community about the devastating humanitarian situation inside Gaza, about the casualty toll, when you are talking about thousands of women and children who have been killed over the past eight months of this war, about the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.And so, you look at what the recommendations are coming from the UN Commission of Inquiry in this report, and they call on both sides, they recommend and call on both, Israel and Hamas, to take immediate steps. When it comes to Hamas and the other Palestinian armed groups, they are calling on them to release all hostages now to cease indiscriminate rocket attacks against Israeli cities and towns. And when it comes to Israel, it is a call for an immediate ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza. And importantly, they point out that it must implement the emergency measures that were -- the -- that were announced by the International Court of Justice. That is, of course, looking into the case, trying the case, looking into the case of the -- against Israel, what has been described as the case of plausible genocide that has been brought against Israel by South Africa. So, what we have seen in the past, Rahel, is these sorts of reports, these investigations by Commissions of Inquiry, that sort of evidence is used by international judicial bodies like the ICC, like the ICJ. So, we could likely see that happen in the future with this sort of evidence when you have these cases that are being considered, that are being tried that this sort of evidence would be used.",

Back here in the U.S., it is a double dose of economic news today in the U.S., for us econ nerds. It's a big day. First, we got the release of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI). We got that this morning, which showed that inflation is cooling off in May. Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent on an annual basis from a year earlier. That is softer than many economists had been predicting, also softer than we saw the month before. Monthly figures also show that prices were unexpectedly flat in May. All of this ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision later on interest rates. That is expected in just a few hours. Let's break this down now with CNN's Matt Egan. So, Matt, walk us through the report. What do we learn?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, we learned that there has been some progress, right, much needed progress with arguably the biggest problem with this economy, and that's the cost of living. Now, today's report showed that consumer prices up by 3.3 percent year-over-year, in a vacuum. That's not really a good number, right? Two percent is what the Fed is targeting. And I was just looking back in history, and between the end of the Great Recession and COVID, there was rarely a time where you had three percent plus inflation. But, obviously, this is not in a vacuum. It's taking place after a period of very high inflation. And this does represent more progress.And I think that officials at the Fed, they're going to be happy with that month-over-month figure, the fact that prices did not budge, that inflation was zero, and you can't even see it on that chart because the bar just doesn't exist, because it was zero for May. That is good news and that is progress. That was because gas prices fell. We saw price drops for apparel, for new cars. All of that is helping, of course. And core inflation was also encouraging, right? That excludes food and energy. But, it's something that economists and Fed watchers pay very close attention to. Core inflation is at the lowest rate in three years. So, I think when you put it all together, inflation, of course, is not solved, right? Life is so much more expensive than it was a few years ago. And we're not going to turn back the clock on all those price hikes. But, this is a step in the right direction. And I would argue, Rahel, a significant step.",

Myself and the business producer, Kevin, looked at each other and we thought, is this a good report? Like, is this a positive report? But, Matt, let me ask. So, in a few hours, we're going to hear from the Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell. What does he do with this? What do they do with this news?",

I mean, remember, at the end of last year, this CPI was around, was a little over three percent. And then, we sort of went backwards and then progress stalled. So, one month or even two months, that's not really going to be enough for the Fed to convince them that we're definitely back towards that two percent goal. But, I think he has also got to leave himself some wiggle room, some options, right?And so, when the Fed releases that statement, we're, of course, expecting no change in interest rates. I was just looking, there is less than a one percent chance priced into the market of a cut today. But, the big question is, what is the Fed projecting out into the future? And so, we are getting that dot plot where the officials pencil in where they think rates are going. And previously, as you know, Rahel, the Fed was penciling in three rate cuts this year. Just looking at the calendar, I mean, that looks very unlikely. But, the question is, whether or not they're going to be penciling in two rate cuts, which would leave open the possibility for a pre- election cut in September, or if they take two off the table and they only project one?

They will do a deep dive with regard to who he is, his background, his financial condition, his mental health condition, etcetera, right? They'll do a full workup as it relates to that.And then what they will do, Rahel, they being Department of Probation at the federal level, is they will issue a report recommendation that pretrial report or pre-services report, pre-sentencing report will then be presented to the judge. The judge will evaluate that, which will have literally in front of the judge who is sentencing everything about Hunter Biden. Next what happens is, is that there are dates for the submissions of briefs. What kind of briefs? His lawyers, that is his defense lawyers, will submit a communication to the court, which would be accompanied by a number of letters of reference and recommendations, clergy members, business people, colleagues, people who know him well. And in that particular document, his defense lawyers will state what they believe the appropriate sentence will be. Thereafter, prosecutors will also submit a response to the defense and they will know, prosecutors, what they believe the sentence should be. And then, of course, the judge at the time of sentencing will hear oral argument from both sides. And of course, Mr. Biden, Hunter Biden, well, if he has or wants to, present a statement for himself as to any sentence can then do that. The judge will then pronounce sentence. Last point, Rahel, and that is as it relates a specific sentence, we hear a lot thrown around about the statute, 10 years, 25 years. There are sentencing guidelines at the federal level in the United States and those guidelines are advisory. But, what they include are really two critical things. Number one, the offense for what you committed and what the specific level is, right, from low to high, and that really factors into what the sentence should be. And then, on the other spectrum, it's not the offense level. It's your criminal history. I say that to say that with those advisory guidelines, we have to remember this is a first offense, in addition to a person having no criminal history. It's also a non-violent offense. And so, there is not any what we call statutory minimums. That is a minimum that the judge has to impose. And so, it's widely based upon judicial discretion with regard to what the ultimate sentence will be.",

We'll just have to take their word on that.But, certainly, very symbolic. I was talking to Cubans in the port as the submarine came in, and certainly submarines from Russia and from the Soviet Union were frequent visitors to Cuba over the years during the Cold War. But, the Cubans said they had never seen a submarine come in above water into the port. Very clearly, Vladimir Putin is trying to send a message to the United States. And it's worth pointing out that for years, this port was full of U.S. cruise ships. But then, the Trump administration enacted policies that banned those cruise ships from coming to Cuba. They have not come here in years. And today, we see it full of Russian warships. So, you can't ask for more symbolism than that, to have the port of Havana absolutely full. There is no more space right now of Russian warships. They will actually allow Cubans to tour these ships starting tomorrow. That is something that's very unusual that they allow them to do that.

I mean, it's very unusual for a nuclear submarine to be sent as part of that group of ships. And I think that's what makes this particular deployment so noteworthy and potent.But, yes. I mean, look, every time Russia does this, it is meant as an attempt by Russia to flex its muscles on international stage, for the Kremlin to show that it's able to project power as far as the back door of the United States. I think there is an additional significance on this occasion as well, which is that it comes just days after President Biden gave the green light for Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia. That has angered the Kremlin. And Vladimir Putin has threatened to supply the enemies of the United States with weapons as well. Now, there is no plan to do that with Cuba, of course, at least no plan that we're aware of.

So, computer chips. That sort of thing. And the ability of companies to use U.S. technology to make chips that then Russia can use. So, really tightening down on that. And then, the other area is this use of frozen Russian assets. They total about $300 billion. And what the United States, as part of the G7 along with the European Union, want to do is to take the profits from that $300 billion, approximately $50 billion, and give that to Ukraine for assistance to rebuild. It is money that Ukraine needs now, not when the war is over, because typically, you would do this with the enemy, in this case, Russia's money, after the war. But, it's being done now because they have these assets, their valuable use of money that Ukraine could use at the moment. But, we can expect the Middle East to be on the agenda.

U.S. inflation is cooling off, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report. May CPI rose 3.3 percent from a year earlier. That was better than expectations. It was also better than last month. Meantime, we are waiting for the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. That is coming in just the next few hours.But, in the meantime, let me bring in Chief Economist at KPMG, Diane Swonk. Diane, always good to have you. Your top line reaction to this report.

And it really gets to how hard it is to seasonally adjust data coming out of a pandemic. The cooling we saw on inflation in late 2024 when people were declaring victory was probably overstating the improvement in inflation then. We probably saw it overstating the deterioration.We saw an inflation in the beginning part of this year. But, if you split the difference between the two, inflation is still too hot. The Fed is still on the sidelines. It keeps the Fed between one and two cuts for 2024, rather than slipping in some outliers that were starting to think about whether or not we needed an additional rate hike. That's the good news in this report.",

And I think today's data makes him a little bit -- but a little light in his step and will make him a little bit -- have a little more levity at the press conference and otherwise. But, the bottom line is the Fed is not moving yet on interest rates, and that's the message they have to convey, and that they are what's called data dependent. Being data dependent, the data are lagged. That means that they're reacting to the data after the fact. And one of the concerns the Fed has had in both getting inflation downis not wanting to over tighten, because what they're worried about is that when unemployment tends to rise, it can do so very rapidly. And by the time we see red ink on something like employment, that's too late for the Fed to be cutting. And so, this is still a very hard balancing act for the Federal Reserve.",

It's getting from four percent, to getting to three percent or getting to two percent. Two percent, of course, the Fed's target. We have been at a three handle for CPI for a year, I want to say since July of 2023. What's your best guess or best forecast in terms of when the Fed will finally be able to say they did it?",

They're likely to have wait until December. Now, some are putting in a September rate cut. It is possible with a lot more improvements in the data between now and the September meeting. But, I don't think they'll have enough evidence that inflation is moving towards that target until December. That doesn't mean inflation will be back down to two percent by December, and that inflation will be out of the front of our mind. At least, it will be receding. What we also know is that the half-life on how long the scars of inflation affect our psyche can be quite long, two to three years, and we're over two years into the inflation boat that we've endured at this point in time.",

Fed President Austan Goolsbee has talked about it a lot. If we don't get shelter costs rolling over, like the Fed expects in the second half of this year, it's very, very hard to get to price stability. And I think that's something that Fed takes very seriously.The other issue has been, of course, home insurance and vehicle insurance. Vehicle insurance, we got a bit of a breather this month. That's great news. But, the bottom line is, it's still up over 20 percent from a year ago. So, it peaked out at 23 percent last month, but it still is very, very expensive. And these are things that are starting to give you more structural rather than cyclical in nature. Home insurance being affected by the number of extreme weather events and disasters on properties, and the fact that insurers have to raise rates for everyone when that occurs. Some places can even get access to home insurance now because of the number of disasters or flooding that they've experienced, and the damage to property. All of those things make -- means that the Fed has to really hit other prices much harder, and we need to see a drop in other prices, goods prices, to be able to offset that lingering inflation in the service sector.",

Now, previously, the EU imposed a flat tariff rate of 10 percent to counter what it sees and what it says as artificially low-priced cars. But, the new duties range from 17 percent to as high as 38 percent. China says it is quote, \"strongly dissatisfied with this decision. The EU must decide by November whether to make the higher tariffs permanent.\"Let's get more now from CNN's Anna Stewart, who joins us live in London.

But, it's interesting to note that this, of course, comes a month after President Biden quadrupled import duties on Chinese EV makers as well, bringing it to 100 percent. So, essentially, pricing Chinese EVs out of the U.S. market. And here you have the EU do something very similar, trying to protect its own EV makers in Europe from cheaper imports from China.You ran us through some of this and the main details of the tariffs. They range between 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent. They come on top of an existing 10 percent tariff. And by November, we'll find out whether or not this is temporary or whether they'll make this a permanent situation. There is also actually a range for different carmakers as to whether they have to pay a lower range or a higher range in terms of the tariff. And Tesla's is still, it looks like, being decided by the EU Commission at this stage. But, already, we've had a response from China. The Ministry of Commerce says the bloc is creating and escalating trade tensions, which brings the question, what will this end up doing? Will China retaliate with similar trade tariffs or trade restrictions? Will we have the return of a sort of trade war between the EU and China? And ultimately, will this end up hurting the very EV makers in Europe? The EU is trying here to protect, for instance, Germany, which sells a lot of cars and car supplies into China. It's a massive market for it. On the weekend, German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expecting this announcement to be made. As she said, protectionism and isolation ultimately just makes everything more expensive and everyone poorer. So, you can see what the plan here is from the EU. The question is whether or not it will work.",
