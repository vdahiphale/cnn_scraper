      "sentences": "All right, coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher. You are indeed watching ONE WORLD. I want to begin with adramatic difference of opinion between two staunch allies. I'm talking about Israel and the United States. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he opposes --he opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state once the war in Gaza is over, despite the U.S. calling for a revival of the now dormant two-state solution. This isn't the first time that Mr. Netanyahu has rejected calls for Palestinian statehood. But this does really show the widening gap between both allies. Here's what the Israeli Prime Minister had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  The state of Israel must control the security of all the land which is west of the Jordan River. That is a truth that I am saying to our friends, the Americans, and have also blocked an attempt to force upon us a reality which will hurt the security of Israel. Prime Minister in Israel must be able to say no even to the closest of our friends. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Arlette Saenz is at the White House with more on the U.S. reaction. Jeremy, I want to start with you. The thing is, Jeremy, there is clearly zero trust on both sides. Israel wants to ensure, understandably, that October 7th can never, ever happen again. So, it wants to really establish security control. But the White House is basically saying, look, the cycle of violence here is going to continue unless there is at least eventual, some signs of a possible future Palestinian state here. What gives?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's right. And listen, the reality is that Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the creation ofa Palestinian state throughout his political career. And this is not the first time that he has done so since October 7th. In fact, he has taken credit in the past at some of these wartime news conferences for the fact that a Palestinian state does not exist today and arguing that if one did exist, it would represent an even bigger threat than Hamas represented to Israel on October 7th. What the Israeli Prime Minister is saying is he believes Israel is incompatible with the creation of a Palestinian state, but that is completely at odds, of course, with how U.S. officials see the future of this conflict, see what could potentially be an opportunity that could emerge out of this conflict to establish a Palestinian state, to bring Israel more in line with its Arab neighbors, more integrated into the region, and more broadly be more secure in the longer term. But what's also becoming increasingly clear is that the Israeli Prime Minister is not only at odds on this front with American counterparts, but he is also increasingly at odds with members of his own war cabinet and other Israeli politicians, not necessarily on this issue of the creation of a Palestinian state. But there are other rifts that are beginning to emerge in this war cabinet. Gadi Eisenkot, who is an observing member of this war cabinet, he doesn't have voting rights, but he is a member of the war cabinet, was brought in as part of the opposition with Benny Gantz, who came into this wartime cabinet as a kind of unity effort. And he is saying that he believes there needs to be new elections in Israel, saying that there is a total lack of trust in Israel in Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership effectively. And he is also criticizing the way in which the war is being conducted, saying effectively that the Israeli Prime Minister and other leaders, without naming them directly, are lying when they say that Hamas has been eliminated from the northern part of the Gaza Strip. And he is also calling for prioritizing the release of hostages over the war effort, saying that there should be some kind of a longer-term ceasefire to secure the release of more hostages. And that is perhaps one of the most defining lines that we are starting to see in the Israeli public is the priority and the difference between prioritizing the war effort itself, prioritizing the release of the hostages. And it may be a defining issue should there be elections called at some point in the future.",

Thousands of anti-abortion advocates have gathered on the National Mall for the March for Life, which is an anti-abortion event that takes place every January in the U.S. This will be the second March for Life event since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

There are four days left until the New Hampshire primary -- until New Hampshire chooses their pick for a Republican presidential nominee. Despite a third-place finish in Iowa, Nikki Haley, she is going all in. She's going all in on New Hampshire, hoping to do much, much better against her rivals there. Polls show her within striking distance of the front runner Donald Trump, her popularity, of course, being boosted by the state's more moderate primary voters and independents who are looking for an alternative to Trump. But Haley has certainly had a few gaffes over the course of her campaign, most notably when she failed to mention slavery was a cause of the Civil War. And once again, last night during CNN's Town Hall, when she reaffirmed her view that America has never been a racist country. For more on this, here's our Eva McKend.

And at passport control, the man who was stamping my passport said, what's 67? And I said, oh, it's the days that -- since my son was stolen from me. And he said, what are you talking about? And I told, and you know, there are people behind in line and I talked to him for maybe 30 seconds and he stamped my passport, he gave it back. He said, I'll be praying for him.

And so far, American airstrikes haven't stopped the rebels from harassingcommercial ships in one of the world's busiest waterways. So, what's behind the boldness in terms of the Houthi rebels? The Houthis are backed by one of the region's most powerful countries, Iran. And Tehran hasn't taken a direct role in the Red Sea attacks. But over the past few days, it has gotten involved in separate skirmishes by launching missile strikes on targets in Iraq, Pakistan and in Syria. So much to talk about here. Time now for The Exchange and my conversation with U.S. Senator Chris Coons. He joins us live now from Wilmington, Delaware. Senator, thank you so much for joining us. So good to see you, as always. Lots to talk about here. As I was just saying there, the Houthi rebels have continued their attacks despite five rounds -- five rounds of American airstrikes. I understand that the U.S. believes that their capabilities have been downgraded. But clearly, not downgraded enough. Why haven't these strikes been as effective as some might hope? CHRIS COONS, U.S. SENATE DEMOCRAT:  Well, Zain, I'm glad that in your framing of this piece, you identified correctly Iran as the source of so much of the training and the equipment and the funding for a whole series of regional actors -- Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon, Hamas that carried out horrific attacks against Israeli civilians on October 7th, and the Houthis in Yemen who are now launching drones and missiles against civilian shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis are really quite tough. They endured years of bombardment and attacks by the Saudis. They began the conflict with the Saudis by launching missiles into Saudi Arabia. And so, frankly, it's no surprise that a couple of rounds of U.S. and British attacks on Houthi launchers have not yet deterred them. But frankly, we could not allow them to continue to attack vessels passing by in the Red Sea. This impacts all of global commerce, a huge percentage of shipping from Asia to Europe and Europe to Asia passes through the very narrow point where Yemen is separated from the continent of Africa. And President Biden approached this in a deliberate way. He assembled a coalition of a dozen countries committed to trying to stop the Houthis. He went to the United Nations and got a Security Council resolution authorizing this multinational action against the Houthis. This is distinct from a number of other recent conflicts in that it is something that is in the interests of everyone, including the Chinese and the Indians, the Saudis, even the Russians. It is in no one's interest, except perhaps Iran, for the Houthis to disturb the global commerce and for thousands and thousands of ships to be redirected around the Horn of Africa.",

The President also, through that legislation, provided billions of dollars for community mental health, which is often distinct from gun safety, but in several critical cases, there is some overlap, of course. We are a country that has embedded in our constitution the right to own and to bear arms. And this is a long-standing division within the United States about what are the limits of gun rights and gun ownership and what could we do that would better protect students in schools, worshipers in churches and synagogues and mosques, folks who just go to the mall to shop. And in some states, like my home state of Delaware, legislatively, we have gone farther in terms of background checks and permitting and safety restraints on gun ownership for those who are demonstrably mentally ill or convicted. And in other states, they have a very different solution, one that really privileges gun ownership over public safety. This is a vigorous debate. The United States is the only country where we have the level and frequency and severity of gun violence of any advanced democracy in the world. And it's my hope that in the upcoming election and in the years ahead, we'll find more positive progress that'll put more bipartisan bills to improve public safety on the desks of President Biden and future presidents.",

I do think the general consensus, certainly my view and the view that I think most people have, is that A.I. is going to create more jobs than it destroys. The number of jobs that are created will be more than or lost. However, lots of industries will have lots of turn. So, the real question for society is will we be able to keep up with the transition? Will we be able to stay stable, stay calm as all this happens?",

It is an incredible, incredibly powerful thing. And we will all have access to the same models. We can all go and type in the same queries. It is possible that it really helps people who have been left out of the global economy. Now, the opposite is also possible. It is also possible that only people in wealthy nations will have access to the best A.I. tools and be able to integrate them into their jobs and be able to increase productivity. So, I think the biggest open question is will A.I. be a force for equality? In fact, one of the most interesting quirky conversations I've had here is I have had about five conversations with people who are looking for text data in uncommon languages, like in African languages that aren't spoken everywhere, both to make their models more accessible and also to make it so A.I. can help translate and bring more people into the global economy.",

What we'll be able to do that, or the best hope, would be the tech companies themselves, if they can effectively watermark, if they can figure out ways of assuring the authenticity. If they can make sure the algorithms are tuned optimally to limit the number of disruptive deep fakes that are put out there. And remember, we have two big problems we're going to face. Number one, people are going to put a lot of false stuff on the internet. Number two, there's going to be a lot of true stuff on the internet that somebody says is false. Whenever there's a bad thing that comes out about any one of our presidential candidates, they will say, oh, that's a deep fake. That wasn't me. That's made up. So we're going to have a hard time navigating it. But thanks to you, we'll figure out what's true and what's not.",

The fans want her held liable for false advertising and also negligent misrepresentation. It's unclear how much they're seeking in damages.
