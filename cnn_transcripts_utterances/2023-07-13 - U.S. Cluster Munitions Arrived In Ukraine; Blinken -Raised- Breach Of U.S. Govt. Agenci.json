Now, he does acknowledge how dangerous these cluster munitions are. He says that they will not be used in densely populated areas. That was one stipulation also from the United States alongside the need to keep track of where they're being fired.

In your view, does Putin have the juice? Does he have the power to successfully put this down? MAJOR MIKE LYONS (RET), U.S. ARMY: You know, it's just going to depend. He -- someone like this always has people around him that are willing to do what it takes to stay close to him. The Russian defenses in Ukraine still are what they are, and they're still much in his chain of command that believe in their mission and they're not going to go against him. So, I think it's not a good idea for us to hope that the collapse comes from within right now within Russia in order for Ukraine to have victory on the battlefield. We got a president -- they -- today say that Russia is losing. I'm not sure that was the smartest thing to say. But it just is going to depend on how deep and level of his chain of command is. Look.

One is, is the economy doing well? And on that score, unemployment is at a 50- year low. Inflation has fallen from nine percent just a year ago, down to three percent, a much more normal rate. And he has a whole lot of other things to boast about. The one he's not talking enough about, I think, is that inequality is falling. The much harder question is how much credit does the president deserve for that? And we see this with every administration. The White House says the economy responds to us and only to us.

This all begins back in 2014 when a graduate of the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut comes forward with an allegation of sexual assault that hadn't been investigated. When the Coast Guard begins this investigation which came to be known as Operation Fouled Anchor, they found much more than that, including dozens of substantiated cases of sexual assault, rape, and sexual harassment at the Coast Guard Academy between 1988 and 2006.The report itself took five years to complete. But when it was finished in 2019, it was kept secret. It wasn't disclosed to the public, and it wasn't disclosed to the Congressional Oversight Committee. And that's why you saw so much of this anger. Senator Tammy Baldwin said it was insulting and re-traumatizing that it was kept secret. She also said it was an unconscionable failure of justice as she grilled Admiral Linda Fagan. Fagan, it's worth noting is not only the first woman to lead the Coast Guard, she's the first woman to lead any military service in the U.S. She said the Coast Guard has come a long way with how it handles sexual assault, harassment, and rape. But there is more work to do. Here's some more of what the investigation found. Take a look at this. First, many suspects were never criminally investigated, according to this report. Those that were and that were found to have substantiated allegations against them were given light sentences in many cases, including demerits or extra homework. Finally, according to the report, the victims of those assaults were punished for fraternization or for engaging in lewd acts. Here is Fagan on where the Coast Guard is today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LINDA FAGAN, COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST GUARD: It started as legacy sexual assaults that were mishandled at the Coast Guard Academy.
