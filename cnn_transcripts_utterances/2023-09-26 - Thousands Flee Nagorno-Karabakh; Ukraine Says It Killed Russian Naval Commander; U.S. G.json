New details are emerging about a powerful explosion at a gas station in the Nagorno-Karabakh where ethnic Armenians had been lining up to get fuel as they leave the disputed region. Well, Armenian state media reports, more than 200 casualties. There's no word yet on what caused the blast. But it comes at a very volatile time.More than 100 bodies have been found after Azerbaijan's military offensive according to our medium state media. And since then, thousands of ethnic Armenians have been fleeing the enclave. Many of the refugees or women, children and the elderly. They're arriving in Goris. An Armenian town near the border with Azerbaijan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The gunfighting was everywhere, all the time, not even a five-minute break. It was going on all the time. We could not leave the basement because it was dangerous. We could die at any moment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I'll never ever come back. Never in this life. Azerbaijan wouldn't even let us take the dead ones away and a lot of them are still there. (END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK: Well, the misery on the faces of many evacuees is plain to see. They have been under a food and fuel blockade for months and now are leaving Nagorno-Karabakh out of fear that an ethnic cleansing of their community will come next. CNN's Becky Anderson shows us what they're facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voiceover): A mass exodus raising fears for Armenia of ethnic cleansing by Azerbaijan. A charge (INAUDIBLE) staunchly denies. So far, thousands of ethnic Armenians have fled the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia. A tragic journey they've become all too familiar with.

They're desperate to leave. The hope had been that you would see genuine peace talks between the government of Azerbaijan and these Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. What we've seen instead was a military offensive to reintegrate this landmass by force. And so, people are now fleeing for their lives. In complete desperation, we're hearing about elderly having trouble leaving. Of course, with that many people crossing a border, there's a lot of desperation and a lot of struggle to survive.",

The area of Nagorno-Karabakh has been autonomous and run by Armenians since the 1920s. The very earliest days of the Soviet Union.  It was always a complicated question as to how you would reintegrate Armenians and Azerbaijanis so they could live in peace side by side.A lot of violence, a lot of loss on both sides over many decades. This escalation really killed the hope for a diplomatic track. You will still see leaders meeting in Europe in the coming weeks. That's what we expect. The E.U. is going to try to mediate peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But really, this escalation and all of the pain and suffering that it's caused, has really poisoned the well. The trust building, the peace building that would have been required for this to stabilize seems to be completely shot. And there's a real fear of escalation and expectation. In fact, in some respects, a pledge by Turkey and Azerbaijan, that this will continue, there will be some form of military escalation, possibly before the end of 2023. That involves the Armenia proper, so basically an expanding conflict if their demands are not met. So, what we're seeing in this conflict at this point, is that what Azerbaijan wants it is taking by force, the mediators, the U.S., the E.U. are being caught on the backfoot. Russia does not want to be left out. They still want to be a power broker. But since the invasion of Ukraine, they simply haven't been able to keep the peace in this neighborhood like they used to.",

A new the video purports to show Ukraine shooting down and Russian missile headed for its port city of Odesa. The defense ministry calls it a pathetic attempt to retaliate for Friday strike on Sebastopol. Ukraine says the missile and drone attacks which have now continued into Tuesday badly damaged the port's infrastructure and destroyed and abandoned hotel. More now from CNN's Senior International Correspondent Sam Kiley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Ukraine dismissed this as a pathetic attempt at retaliation. A Russian bombardment of the port city of Odesa with drones and long-range missiles. Two warehouse workers were killed and abandoned hotel smashed in what could have been an almost routine attacked by Russia. But for this. Kyiv have now claimed to have killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Viktor Sokolov. Ukraine says it also killed another 33 Russian officers in the missile strike against the Fleet headquarters in Sebastopol on Friday. The Ukrainians have targeted senior Russian officers throughout this war, often using intelligence from NATO. And specialist units have been tasked by Kyiv with these killings. They're aimed at sapping morale, and undermining command systems. CNN has no independent confirmation of Ukraine's claim to have killed Russia's Admiral. But it would be its biggest success in this campaign. And part of an ongoing effort to break through Russia's defense lines to ultimately strike at Crimea. They've included earlier attacks on Putin's Navy and a bridge to Russia itself. The first batch of U.S.-donated Abrams tanks have now also arrived in Ukraine. But they're not the strategic weapons that Ukrainian say they need. VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Defense packages from the United States including artillery, necessary shells, HIMARS munitions, air defense missiles, additional air defense systems, tactical vehicle. And some other types of weapons that will prove themselves on the battlefield. KILEY (voiceover): Give wants these ATACMS. Long-range missile systems to attack deep behind Russian lines to kill more officers and destroy logistics hubs.
