We are continuing our breaking news coverage this hour as the FBI investigates an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump.The former U.S. president wasn't harmed in Sunday's incident at his golf club in Florida, which comes just two months after an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. A 58-year-old man identified as Ryan Wesley Routh has been detained. A source says the FBI investigation has now gone global as officials look into his background. We've learned that Routh has criticized Trump on social media in the past. Sources say Trump had been playing golf at the time of the incident, moving between holes five and six, and his outing was a last-minute decision. The Palm Beach County Sheriff says the Secret Service fired shots at a man with a rifle in the bushes along the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club. A witness who saw the person flee in a car helped authorities locate him in Martin County. The sheriff described the man's reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF WILLIAM D. SNYDER, MARTIN COUNTY, FLORIDA: The suspect's demeanor, I would describe as having a relatively calm, flat, A- factor, was not displaying a lot of emotion, never asked what is this about. Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on, never questioned it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance, posted this on X. I'm glad President Trump is safe. He was, amazingly, in good spirits. Still, much we don't know.

DIOSDADO CABELLO, VENEZUELAN INTERIOR MINISTER (through translator): The security services of other countries involved in the plot know that we know more than what I am saying now. I'm not going to reveal everything we know as part of our investigation, because there's a reason we were able to stop them.

He was appointed to cabinet in August after a widespread cycle of anti-government protests following the controversial re-election of Nicolas Maduro on July 28. Both the U.S. government and the European Union have already announced that they would not recognize those results after massive allegations of voting fraud.On Saturday, Cabello accused six detainees of introducing some 400 U.S.-manufactured guns to Venezuela, but again failed to reveal any detail leading up to these arrests, which included two Spanish citizens and one Czech citizen, as well as the three Americans. CNN first reported on the detention of a U.S. Navy sailor on September 4. Wilbur Castaneda is now being accused by Cabello of being the ringleader. of the alleged plot, something both the Department of State and the Department of Defense had already denied. They told us back then that Castaneda was traveling to Venezuela on personal matter when he was detained in Caracas at the end of August. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
