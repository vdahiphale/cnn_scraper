We're seeing this really clear clash between the six conservative justices and the three liberal justices.On the liberal side of things, the newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, has really been leading the questioning here, asking why colleges shouldn't be able to continue considering race when it comes to admissions? And also saying that race for many students is core to their own identity. But on the other side, conservatives here, many court watchers believe, are leaning toward potentially banning affirmative action, even though it's been a court precedent since 1978. We've seen in the questioning from these justices they've been asking, why can't other race-neutral factors really be the core of admission decisions at universities around the country? We saw this line of questioning most clearly from the Chief Justice John Roberts. He asked why schools needed this race element in their admissions policies. And then he asked really when is enough enough? When would affirmative action be complete when colleges might achieve their diversity goal. So here was his line of questioning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE, U.S. SUPREME COURT (voice-over): I don't see how you can say that the program will ever end. Your position is that race matters because it's necessary for diversity, which is necessary for the sort of education you want. It's not going to stop mattering at some particular point. You're always going to have to look at race because you say race matters to give us the necessary diversity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So there was this surge in hate speech that occurred over the weekend. A Twitter executive tweeted there were 50,000 tweets coming from 300 accounts using vulgar speech. And he basically said that we are still enforcing the current Twitter rules. Elon Musk came out also and said there haven't been any changes to the Twitter rules yet and that he backed the current rules. So we'll see if they can tamp this down. But obviously, a big problem. And it will be interesting to see, when they do change the rules, because IT seems that's going to happen, how they rein in this kind of hate speech on the platform.",

Law enforcement searched his backpack and they found a roll of tape, white rope, another hammer, one pair of rubber and cloth gloves and a journal. What does that tell new terms of where this investigation leads regarding the issue of premeditation? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: What, sadly, we could have predicted from the other big piece of evidence they've gotten, which is looking on his social media. So it's a standard kind of account of especially, not completely as it turns out, but especially extreme right-wing kind of terrorist, complaints leading with Nancy leading with Nancy Pelosi. You could have known this in advance, as soon as you heard about the attack. What's so difficult is preventing it. I want to say one quick things. It's commonplace for crimes to be both federal and state. This one, I think, will go federal because the more intense interest is the federal government. This is a guy who was acting and this is what they'll be able to prove about the attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband, because of Nancy Pelosi, because of his identity. And the crime that Evan just referred to, 18 USC 1115, goes exactly to that.",

According to the affidavit from the FBI, he describes, he didn't know this person. Again, that's a key detail. And it appears he was able to bring -- talk the assailant down to the first floor, which is where police answered and were able to come to the home within minutes. You're talking about less than 10 minutes that the police are at the front door. They walk in and they see the assailant and Paul Pelosi holding a hammer. It appears that, at that point, that the assailant goes and hits Paul Pelosi in the head with the hammer. That's when the police take action and detain him and begin doing the investigation at the scene. All of this, of course, happening in front of the police officers who responded to that 911 call.",

He expected her to lie.
