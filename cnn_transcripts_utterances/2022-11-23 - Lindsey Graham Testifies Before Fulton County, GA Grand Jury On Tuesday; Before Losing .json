Hey John. You're gonna die John. You're gonna die.\"  That's according to the court documents. And then apparently there was also a comment that was left on the livestream of the Congressional testimony by FBI Director Christopher Wray, and it said something to this effect, according to the documents: \"I will kill you director Wray you will die I will kill you in self-defense.\" Apparently there was also FBI -- excuse me, Facebook posts by this gentlemen basically believing the conspiracy that there is a sex slave ring that's running out of the U.S. Capitol that involves government officials, elected officials, Tom Cruise, Elon Musk, so according to the documents, officials went to this man's home a few days later, made contact with him, he refused to put down a gun, sort of said he was going to continue, you know, fighting this, so this is obviously someone who has some mental issues, his parents apparently say he has been in and out of mental facilities.

If we think back to about two years ago when the first COVID vaccines came out, those had 95 percent effectiveness. This new one, it is not that.Let's look specifically at what this study found. This study found that if you get this booster eight months after your last COVID shot, so eight months have passed, this booster will be about 43 to 56 percent - I'm sorry, 40 -- yes. 43 to 56 percent effective for you, that's -- you know, that's kind of like what a flu shot is, so it's certainly something worth doing. But just to be honest, it is not like the original vaccinations. It is not the same efficacy. Still worth doing, but not the same efficacy.",
