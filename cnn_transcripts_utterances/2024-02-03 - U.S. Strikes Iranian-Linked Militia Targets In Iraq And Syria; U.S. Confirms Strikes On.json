The strikes are in retaliation for the deaths of three American soldiers killed in a drone attack in Jordan almost a week ago. President Biden says, the launch of airstrikes on carried out in Syria and Iraq are only the start of operations.Look at this video. This is from what appears to be one of those strikes in Iraq earlier this morning. The mayor of this town says that strikes hit houses used for weapons storage. Iraqi military officials condemned the strikes as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. Team coverage now, CNN's Ben Wedeman, Nic Robertson, Kevin Liptak are with us. We're starting though with Katie Bo Lillis. The U.S. hit dozens of targets in both Iraq and Syria, and actually, the statement came out at the 4:00 p.m. Eastern hour yesterday after those strikes were carried out.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Victor, the U.S. military is striking a variety of different targets, 85 different targets associated or used by these Iranian-backed militia groups, as well as Iranian personnel themselves in Iraq and Syria, targets that included everything from rockets and missiles and other munitions stores to intelligence centers to command and control hubs, as well as logistic centers as well.Now, the U.S. military, in the coming hours and days, will be doing what's known as a battle damage assessment, trying to use their intelligence capabilities to independently confirm as much as they can the level of damage that they were able to exact on these militia groups, as well as the number of casualties. The Iraqi government saying that 16 people have been killed, including civilians. But again, we will await sort of the U.S.'s own assessment as well about the level of damage that they were able to, that they were able exact here and the number of casualties to include potential civilian casualties. The U.S. military up until now, of course, has said that they hit everything that they intended to hit. What I think is important and what's significant to note here, Victor, is that the United States in these airstrikes targeted not only these Iran-backed militias that have carried out not just the deadly strike that killed three Americans at an outpost in Jordan last week, but more than 160 attacks on U.S. personnel across Iraq and Syria since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October. The U.S. also targeted here Iranian personnel who were operating co-located at times with these Iranian-backed militia groups. This is an escalation from previous retaliatory strikes that the U.S. has done. This is the Biden administration trying to send a very clear signal to Iran about the support it provides these groups that are carrying out these attacks. Essentially, cut it out. We will watch and see whether or not it works. Victor.",

      "sentences": "Yes, American officials from President Biden on down are making clear that this was just the opening salvo. And really, in the days leading up to these strikes, we heard from officials that this would be a multi-phase response. It could last weeks, potentially months. And in this statement last night, President Biden said that this was not the end of the American reprisal.He said, \"Our response began today, it will continue at times and places of our choosing.\" And I think it's notable he said times and places plural. The president goes on to say, \"The United States does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world but let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond.\" Now, what the next phase of this response looks like isn't exactly clear, and American officials are understandably reticent about describing in exact detail what we might see next. Of course, they will want to do that battle assessment on the ground to calibrate their response going forward, and certainly they will look to the response in the region as well as they decide how to proceed. There are a number of other factors as well that could dictate the timing of the next phase, including the weather. And I think it was interesting listening to officials last night describing how much the weather played a role in the timing of this first phase. Officials looking for clear skies to ensure that they saw the targets and didn't have any unintended casualties. It was notable because there was a significant gap between when President Biden approved these strikes and actually told us that he had decided how to respond and when we actually saw the response begin. But at the end of the day, this does move the United States, President Biden and his administration into a new phase of how they were managing this conflict. He is trying to strike a balance here, trying to deter these groups, trying to prevent a wider war in the region, and also trying not to upend these very delicate negotiations to try and secure the release of hostages in Gaza and secure a prolonged pause in the fighting. President Biden certainly very mindful of not taking steps that would upend those very delicate, fragile negotiations. But certainly, this is now moving into a new, very delicate phase and President Biden certainly watching all of this very carefully going forward guys.",

      "sentences": "Yes, the Iranians, no surprise, are saying this is a strategic mistake by the United States and it destabilizes the region. I think the Iranians, like President Biden and the White House and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, will be very aware of the enduring problem here. Since October 7th, it's become very clear how Iran uses its proxies in the region.It was very clear to people in the region prior to that, but it's become strongly evident now, particularly with the Houthis, particularly what we're seeing with these militias in Iraq and Syria. So, the enduring problem is going to be what happens to, what happens to deal with Iran going forward, if we remember back to when that Iran nuclear deal was being constructed. It wasn't just to stop Iran building nuclear weapons, but it was also to constrain what was widely described as its destabilizing influence in the region. And we're witnessing that destabilizing influence. So, Iran over the past 20 years has really built a strong network of proxies, and that will be the enduring issue. And that will be understood in Tehran too. They know that the United States sees this. They know that, they understand that the United States understands that Iran is willing to use these proxies to disrupt shipping in the Red Sea or put pressure on its forces in Iraq and Syria. So, the enduring question becomes what does happen next? How do you deal with that long term? And of course, everyone is walking on eggshells at the moment because of the concern about escalation with the war in Gaza, but this enduring issue isn't going away. Tehran will understand and will find its ways to respond to the United States to continue to try to put its pressure. The leadership in Iran isn't going to change its view, hasn't changed its view, doubles down, doubles down, doubles down. So, we're in that cycle at the moment.",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly, Amara. One of the things that these strikes are doing is not only deterring future attacks but destroying the capability for conducting current attacks. You're not going to get everything. The popular mobilization fronts, as I've said so many times, they are like gangs.We can name a few of them, the larger ones like Kata'ib Hezbollah, but there are literally dozens of these kind of popular mobilization front forces all across Syria, inside of Iraq, and in other locations. So, these strikes will certainly be consequential for many of them, but certainly we're going to see as soon as the strike ends, we're probably going to see another missile strike by one of these groups, another potential drone launch, but it won't be as significant in the future. We used to have an expression where, you know, another car bomb doesn't necessarily mean that the forces have regenerated, but there is that capability. You're going to see a reduction in their capability to strike as these attacks by the United States go on. Again, don't know how long they're going to go on. But certainly, you know, it's taking out, it's destroying some of their key capabilities. And at the same time, telling them, hey, you are within the sights. You're in the target picture. We're coming after you next. [07:15:26] And I think right now many of those groups are thinking, OK, a lot of strikes occurred last night, over a hundred of them. Who's going to be hit next? And if they're trying to move around, like some have said that they're trying to do, that we've given them too much of a warning, there's not a whole lot of places they can move. And we continue to see where they're going. So, we can, the United States can track these forces as they move around the battlefield, but you can't move some of the arms caches and the rocket launch facilities and the drone production facilities. Those can be struck even as the forces move around.",

And now, that's because they're going to do the work necessary to make sure it's the upper 80s and lower 90s.

And yet, because of the electoral college, he actually won by about 42,000 votes. If they had flipped, Donald Trump would have gotten a second four-year term instead of Joe Biden winning that election.So, every vote is important. Those five percent really matter, but there are loads of other issues that are motivating black voters. So, it's always multi-dimensional chess. That's what these great political people are paid for.

Who are they lying to? You know, it's their personal journal. They told their friends. So, I guess the question will become, who do you believe? The mother or the son, in terms of having said, there's a problem. You know, if your child comes to you and says, I think I broke my leg, you know, any -- we would say, any decent parent would take the kid to the doctor. If your kid comes to you and says, I am sad, I am struggling, I am having some very weird and scary thoughts. Today, we would hope a parent would take a kid to a mental health professional. Either of those things could have stopped this from happening. That being said, parents make mistakes. All parents make mistakes.

The official decision will come after depositions wrap up later this month. But one House Republican tells CNN that she is willing to let the voters decide Biden's fate in November.

Also, we have a woman fits a profile, we typically don't hear from rural American black voters. And she brings up an issue that we've not talked at all about thus far in this campaign. So, she'll engage with us about that. And we've got a member of the campaign to follow up to tell us if and how the Biden campaign will deliver for these voters who were really not overwhelmed by the job the president's been doing. Also, head of Iowa, we talked a lot about white evangelical voters. They are a power base in the Republican primaries, a Republican Party.

So, we'll talk about the image of an evangelical in this country and the truth behind the numbers and how they vote. Also, do you recognize this? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
