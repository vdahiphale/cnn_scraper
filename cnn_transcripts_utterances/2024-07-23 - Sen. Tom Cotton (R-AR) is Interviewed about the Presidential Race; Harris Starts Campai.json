TOM COTTON (R-AR): Well, no, but what you get with Kamala Harris is a failed prosecutor who wouldn't seek the death penalty for cop killers, even though her San Francisco - fellow San Francisco Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, wanted to. Kamala Harris also has to answer questions about what's happened over the last three and a half years. She was not just a part of the conspiracy of silence about Joe Biden's decline, she was the leader of it. She has said time and time again that he's fit as a fiddle, that he's sharp as a tack. When Robert Hur, in February, refused to bring criminal charges against Joe Biden, in large part because he said he was a failing, feeble, frail, old man. Kamala Harris came out and savaged him in the most strident terms. So, the American people deserve to know, what did Kamala Harris know and when did she know it.",

We should not be supporting BLM and Antifa rioters who torched downtown Minneapolis. That's what Kamala Harris did in 2020. It's what she's continued to do to this very day.

The best parallel I can think of is Democrats in 2008 when Barack Obama was nominated. But even then, the party was still reeling after the battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. The party now is incredibly united. Black women are coming together.Tens of thousands of black women came together on a conference call just the other day. Black men are coming together. Just last night, tens of thousands of black men came together. The Divine Nine, the black Greek organizations, the HBCUs. Women of all colors are coming together, concerned about reproductive rights and abortion and concerned - and actually happy to have a woman at the top of the ticket. The delegates have come together. She's already, in one day, gotten - gotten all of the - the 1,976 delegates she needs to win the nomination. She's gotten endorsements from two presidents already. Half of the United States Senate. More than 100 members of the United States House of Representatives . The AFL-CIO. All this has happened in just one day. And on top of that, they've raised a record $250 million, a quarter of a billion dollars in one day. I've never seen this before in the Democratic Party. I'm sure that Donald Trump, right now, must be doing something in his pants and - and just having all kinds of buyer's remorse about the idea that Democrats changed the game on him, fundamentally, and now he's stuck with J.D.

And in this next three weeks, between right now and the Democratic National Convention, I think there is an opportunity to define Kamala Harris.
