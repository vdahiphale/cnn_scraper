All right, MJ, the Supreme Court just issued this ruling on emergency abortions in Idaho. We did get a glimpse yesterday. It is now officially out today.

It is in fact one of the top three domestic issues that the campaign has made clear is really a top priority for them where they think there is political saliency, where they think they can really draw a sharp contrast between the president and the former president in addition to issues related to the economy and democracy.And just to give you a sense of how much the Biden team is really leaning into this issue, this new campaign ad that they just released earlier, was actually already prepped, ready to be rolled out whenever the Supreme Court ruling came out. And it features a testimonial from a high-risk OB doctor in Idaho, who said that she physically left the state after treating her patients because she was afraid that she could be criminally charged. And she said that the laws in her state are barbaric, given that in a medical emergency, every second matters, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're looking for a person's character, they're looking for a person's authenticity, they're looking to see how somebody approaches the person standing next to him. How that would be president or president talks to them directly. Does he talk down to them? Does he talk directly at them? Does he appeal to them? I mean, there are all of these kind of character issues, and they're sort of unknown. But people come away with a sense of who won. We talked about who won, who lost, people come away with a sense of, does this person deserve to be in the Oval Office? Can I live with this person for four more years? Do I want to? And I think that's really what people are kind of looking for. Because as we've all pointed out, these are two pretty unpopular guys. So, they have to do something to appeal to the folks who are watching, particularly those in the middle, the independent voters who may be undecided still.",

I know you don't like them but can you just put up with them for four years?I think Gloria is exactly right. I do think that the most successful debaters, the most successful candidates, the most successful campaigns are the ones that are able to tie the character argument to a governing argument. And we've seen the Biden campaign start to try to do this with the ad that they released in the last week or two, right? Saying that the reason you should care that Trump is a convicted felon is because they argue he is focused on his grievances, and not on the people he's supposed to be taking care of. And so, I think on an issue like abortion, you may see them try to do the same thing. Saying, because of what we know about Trump, because of they would argue, you know, he's not compassionate, he doesn't care about people. That is why you cannot trust him with these types of decisions. And so, you know, anything that puts abortion back on the front burner puts it in the news, the Biden campaign feels is helpful to them even if it's a decision like this that preserves abortion access, it's another reminder of what states are doing on abortion now that, you know, in Trump's argument, he's returned to the issue to the States.",

We've seen bipartisan legislation on infrastructure and environment, on dealing with guns and cr -- like, it's all happened. He's tried to have a bill on immigration. Republicans want to attack him on immigration. The president had a bill on immigration that was bipartisan. The reason it didn't pass was because Donald Trump blew it up, not because Joe Biden did.

He's already said we have no federal law under his tenure. But I think his best headed strategy is going to be to try to take that issue, the audience that matters to lower income, non-college women and talk pivoted to inflation and other concerns in their life.

Now, this is something that is just sort of temporary, but it keeps in place this ability to provide this abortion care.

So, you know, in 2016, both Trump and Hillary Clinton could credibly argue that they had the ability to direct the future of the court ideologically in one direction or another. I think the people who are making this decision on the basis of the future of the Supreme Court already know who they are voting for. I really doubt that there's a lot of Supreme Court -- there's a lot of voters out there who wake up and say, oh, I wasn't going to vote, or I didn't know who I was going to vote for. But now that you tell me that the Supreme Court either might get less -- slightly less conservative or state -- or get even more conservative, but it'll still be as conservative court.
