Joining us now Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, and retired U.S. army General Wesley Clark, a CNN military analyst and former NATO supreme allied commander. Ambassador, the U.S. is directly asking Israel for restraint right now and rallying various allies to ask the same of Iran. Are there signs that Israel and Iran are actually listening? You know the region. You know the players.",

      "sentences": "Good to be with you, Wolf. I'm honored to be with General Clark today.Good morning. This entire conversation for the vast majority of Israelis is very strange, Wolf. It's actually jarring, this notion of preventing war between Israel and Iran. Iran has been waging a war against Israel for the last 10 months. I just completed military service up in the north. And we were being hit by Iranian-made missiles every day fired by Hezbollah. A young man named Nir Popko was killed just up the road from where I was serving. Where you're broadcasting from in Tel Aviv was hit by a Houthi drone just several weeks ago. A young man was killed. We're fighting a multi-war front against Iran. And all this talk of holding Israel back, to me, is just -- it doesn't reflect the reality in any way. The message should be to Iran, if you do not stop waging this war, the United States and the West will stand up to you, pressure we put on Iran to agree to a hostage deal. I think all -- at the best, what's going to happen is we're going back to the status quo ante. And once Iran -- once again, Iran gets away with shooting at Israel on multiple fronts and even shooting at American bases through its proxies in Iraq and wounding American servicemen. I don't see where this gets us at all.",

If you do not hold back your proxies in the Middle East from attacking Israel, from attacking American forces, from blocking shipping in the crucial Mandab Straits, you will pay a prohibitive price. The way to de-escalate in the Middle East, Wolf, is to threaten Iran with massive, massive escalation. That's the only thing that's going to work. The message to Iran every single time is, you can get -- you can perpetrate this type of multifaceted, totally unsettling, destabilizing aggression and you can get away with it. You're never going to pay a price. I don't know why anybody thinks that Iranian behavior is going to change by urging restraint and holding Israel back.",

So you have got a better chance of inflicting damage on Israel. If they do that, they're going to -- they use Hezbollah, they're going to lose Hezbollah.

And let's be very frank about this. No one's going back to the status quo ante of October 6. Before -- on October 6, many of these Israelis were living literally on the outside of the fence. Hezbollah was right there within almost arm's length. No one's going to go back to those communities as long as Hezbollah is there. So not only you have to prevent Hezbollah from firing those 100, tens of thousands of rockets, and they may have as many as 150,000 or even 170,000 rockets, but Israel has to push Hezbollah back from the fence. Whether this can be done by diplomatic means -- of course, that would be preferable. But other than that, life in the Northern Israel will become simply uninhabitable. And Israel cannot lose the northern part of its country, its Galilee here, Wolf. And you know it well. Israel will have to take every measure possible to ensure that its territorial integrity and national security is preserved.",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, there's no doubt there's been a substantial incursion inside Russia, possibly three, four miles deep, maybe deeper towards a town called Sudzha, which is extremely important for Russia, partly because it has a key gas terminal there that feeds gas from Russia through Ukraine onto Europe.Unclear if that's affected at all at the moment. No external signs of that. But this may be one of the motivations behind this clear Ukrainian push. Yes, Ukraine said nothing about this, but there's no other real candidate here. We don't know if, as you have seen in multiple occasions in the past, if this is Russian citizens fighting for Ukraine or the Ukrainian military proper. But the damage and the penetration is very clear from multiple videos and from local officials talking about how Ukrainian forces are inside that town of Sudzha talking about a situation that is -- quote -- \"very tense.\" And clearly also too the Kremlin, very aware, very troubled by this, Vladimir Putin calling it a major provocation, claiming that Ukraine is targeting Russian civilians at will, indiscriminately, a bit rich coming from a country that's been doing that inside of Ukraine with its weaponry for the past two years-plus. But now the Russian chief of staff coming forward, Valery Gerasimov, saying, look, we have halted this advance, but there's still plenty of evidence, plenty of fear from Russian military bloggers that there are many Ukrainian forces still pretty deep inside Russia causing continued havoc. Now, Wolf, the context here is important, because this is a rare headline, frankly, of Ukrainian battlefield success on the front foot. In the past weeks, we have been hearing very troubling news about the losses of territory around key towns in the Donetsk region, the focus of so much of the fighting, with Russian forces getting closer day by day, very slowly, very incrementally, but very importantly, towards a Ukrainian military hub. A lot of questions about Ukraine's manpower, its ability to hold that line and new questions from Ukrainian observers even today on the merits of this advance, what resources were used to perform it, how sustainable it is and what its overall goal may end up being, but still, Moscow certainly taken off guard here, a remarkable breach of Russia's border security -- Wolf.",

There have been some videos perhaps suggesting that weaponry that may have emanated from the United States might have been near this area, but nothing confirmed.And, as you say, it's clearly a key part of Ukraine's plan moving forward. The best weapons have come from their NATO allies, but we have no evidence of this stage from the videos we have seen that they have been involved in this particular advance here. Still nothing from Ukraine at all, I should stress, but there's no other real candidate for an incursion like this, Wolf.",
