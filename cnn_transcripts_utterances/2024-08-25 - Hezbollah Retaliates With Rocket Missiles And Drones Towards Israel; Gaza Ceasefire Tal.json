The attack, Hezbollah says, was a response to the killing by Israel of a top Hezbollah leader in Beirut last month. The exchange started with what Israel called preemptive strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon to destroy what it said was an imminent and quite large attack targeting Israel.Tonight we're learning new details about the U.S. helping Israel to track and take down those incoming rockets and other projectiles with the U.S. defense official emphasizing the U.S. was not involved, however, in any of the strikes by Israel on Lebanese territory. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joins us now from Haifa in northern Israel with more details. Jeremy, Hezbollah has said there could be a second phase of attacks, retaliatory attacks against Israel but at least during these hours when it's been quite quiet it appears to be done. What can you tell us?  what's the level of alert up north?",

The Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in a speech tonight saying that whether or not Hezbollah carries out additional attacks will depend on its assessment of whether or not it's a barrage of rockets and drones that it fired at northern Israel earlier on Saturday, whether or not it was successful enough.And from the Israeli military standpoint, Hezbollah's attack was a failure. That's because Israel says that of the hundreds of rockets and drones that Hezbollah fired early Sunday morning, all of the drones, they say, were intercepted and none of the rockets actually hit any military bases in northern or central Israel. Part of that, they say, is because of this preemptive strike that the Israeli military says it carried out early this morning starting around 4:00 a.m., about 100 fighter jets were in the air carrying out strikes on some 270 targets in southern Lebanon. The Israeli officials say that that attack was able to hamper Hezbollah's ability to carry out what Israel says would have been a much more significant strike against Israel had they been able to actually carry it out in full. So for now, the tensions seem to have simmered down, but there is still the possibility of that second phase. And the Israeli prime minister himself, even as he touted the success of the Israeli aerial defense operation, he also made clear that the story here is not over yet, Jim.",

      "sentences": "That's right. From an initial reading of Hamas' response so far as their delegation departs from Cairo, their position has not really moved from what we've been hearing from Hamas officials since President Biden put forward that proposal in late May. They have reiterated that they want to see a ceasefire deal which reflects that initial proposal put forward by Biden without these so-called bridging proposals that have so far been presented in the weeks following.And they have said and reiterated they actually agree to that deal in early July and want the guarantees, the terms put out in that deal to be honored by all sides, agreeing to this proposed ceasefire agreement. Of course, as we know, there have been several significant sticking points. We heard earlier in the week from Egyptian officials still saying that there are wide differences between Israel and Hamas. Those gaps seemingly not narrowed despite the talks that we have seen here in Cairo over the last three days over the course of the weekend. Of course, one of those key sticking points continues to be the presence of Israeli troops within the Gaza Strip. In a statement just a few hours ago from Hamas officials, they have said that they want to see a deal which guarantees a full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Of course, we know that Israeli delegation has put forward a proposal which would allow for a presence or a reduced number of Israeli troops to be present along the Philadelphi corridor, that buffer zone between Egypt and southern Gaza. That's a proposal that Hamas has so far rejected. Egyptian officials earlier in the week have also said that Egyptian officials are not in favor of this proposal. And then, of course, another key area of disagreement remains questions around guarantees for a permanent ceasefire. Hamas has said that they haven't seen these guarantees on the table -- on the deal currently on the table. We have heard from Israeli officials saying that while they may welcome a temporary pause, that six-week pause outlined in the first phase of the deal, they want to see a continuation of the war in order to eradicate Hamas' military capabilities, despite the U.S. assessing that Hamas has been downgraded to a point where they cannot necessarily pose a significant military threat to Israel any longer. But, of course, these are issues which remain. Those gaps seemingly haven't been narrowed. It remains to be seen whether we see any further negotiations or talks taking place in the coming days.",

First of all, clearly the Israelis have good intelligence about a strike coming their way from Hezbollah because they've been waiting for something. And when they took action. It seems to have synced up with the Hezbollah plans.Second, when I was in Israel in June, The former IDF commanders and people who understood what Israel's military capability was and what Hamas had on the other side told us that if Hezbollah struck Israel, that it would be devastating, that there would be missiles that would get through and would cause great destruction and deaths in Israel all the way to Tel Aviv. So yes, this could have been far worse. And I think it shows that both sides are willing to de-escalate. There's still the outside question of Iran, but Iran also has been showing forbearance. It seems that there are a lot of outside parties, of course, aligned to try to create a peace agreement, as you mentioned, but for some reason, it's not going forward.

Now, the U.S. has put forward these two-carrier strikes that have been in the region for weeks, if not months, in a really strong show of force to try to prevent any sort of broader escalation here.

And one note on this, if there's any criticisms to come from the right, is that this is a policy that is enacted at a state level, and almost about 40 states across the country, and Republican states as well. So, when you actually look at the policy, it's not that much different than what's happening on a state level.",

Authorities say that it was that monsoon that then created those flash floods that likely swept her away. They believe it could be in the area of the Colorado River confluence.And what authorities are saying is that she was not the only one. There were many hikers in that area and even tribal members that had to be rescued. Her husband was actually in this area and was rescued safely. Her family though saying that they're still very hopeful that they want to find her alive and they want the focus to be on this rescue mission. So, in total, 104 people were rescued by the National Guard. The governor of Arizona, Katie Hobbs, actually activated the National Guard, and they brought in a Black Hawk helicopter to get these people out of this area. Take a listen to what a member of the National Guard had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
