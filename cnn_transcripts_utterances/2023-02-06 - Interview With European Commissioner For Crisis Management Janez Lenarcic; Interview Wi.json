Where she pulls back the glamour of her careersin acting and sportscasting to reveal the misery she often felt beneath. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. More than 2,500 people have been killed in Turkey and Syria after the region was hit by one of its largest earthquakes in a century. More than 12,000 are injured, and the death toll, the injury toll is still climbing. The initial quake hit a mammoth 7.8 magnitude and powerful aftershocks have been felt across the region since then. You can see on this map, where the earthquake hit in Southeastern Turkey, and just how close it is to the Syrian border. Turkey's disaster agency has been appealing for international assistance as it scrambles to pull survivors from the rubble. Correspondent Jomana Karadsheh has this latest report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  A young man trapped, desperation in his eyes. Then in the predawn darkness, a moment of joy.

And Christiane, thanks for having me on and great to be on with a friend of mine for many years, Evelyn. So, what we are seeing is exactly what you talked about. President Zelenskyy saying. There is intense pressure around Bakhmut. And we know that they're bringing the, sort of, human waves against the Ukrainians positions.

He and I, of course, were in the early phase working together to help Ukraine in 2014, 2015. The reality is that President Putin is definitely not ready to stand down. You know, his belief is that if he keeps trying this on, eventually the west and the Ukrainians will give up. That we will come to the negotiating table. And so, even though he's losing -- you know, you can argue he's losing strategically because even if he wins Ukraine, what does he have? He has a country that's in ruins, that hates him. And the International Community, of course, is ready to prosecute him and all of his colleagues. But he is determined to try to win on the battlefield.

Clearly, there's a salt mine there that someone wants so they can make money off of it. But the fact of the matter is, it's still an issue that needs to be thought. But to your first question, in the recent past, Ukraine has handled this. Russia, they have no maneuver. They can't do combined arms or warfare. So, their attack is artillery, level the city, sort out what's lifting -- living when it's left over. Now, they add to that.

And the polls were ready to provide MiG aircraft and the deal fell apart, again, because we weren't willing to provide fighter aircraft and the polls wanted that political security. So, I think if we go to the blueprint that we seem to be using now which is that the United States provides it, the other allies can also provide it, even if it's not as capable as an F-16. We can get some fighter aircraft pretty quickly to the Ukrainians. And this is fighter aircraft that they already know how to fly in their inventory right now. Whether we get them F-16s, while the war still ongoing, is an open question because of course there's more training involved for the Ukrainians. And I don't know exactly where we're going to get it from our inventory. But it is important that we provide them with more capability because they need to take the offensive. Ultimately, the only way we're going to get out of this quagmire is if one side takes the offensive then pushes the other side away. And what we would like, of course, for the Ukrainians to put -- push the Russians off of their territory and back into Russia. That's the best outcome for the world, frankly.",

Now, one of your, you know, predecessors, James Stavridis has said, while the addition of tanks is crucial, combat air power may ultimately be decisive.

It is, however, hard and without that longer-range artillery that we talked about, or that I mentioned earlier, it's going to be hard for the Russians -- for the Ukrainians, rather, to take the Russians out.

He says the following -- he says, I always tried to be Lisa's biggest advocate, starting for the moment that I hired her. Her memory of that season and mine are quite different. He says, this is the first time I'm learning of her pregnancy, and I'm sorry that she struggled through that difficult time without the full support of the team surrounding her. And he says, I unequivocal disagree with Lisa's account of the nature of my interactions with her. That's not how I recall our time together during her tenure at MNF, \"Monday Night Football\", and it makes me very sad. Do you want to respond to that?",

And that in fact, you know, he never yelled at me. So, we do put that in the book as well because, like you, I wanted to give both sides, you know, I wanted to give him an opportunity to share his perspective of it. I know what I endured and other people saw it and heard it. And the point of the book isn't to, you know, say, this one person did this one thing to me. It was a culture going back to FOX Sports Net that treats women a certain way when they cover sports or on camera at all. And the other thing I wanted to talk about, which I did really, you know, in great detail was the miscarriage. One in every four pregnancies ends in miscarriage. So, millions of women endure this, and many of them endure it at work. So, I wanted to be open about this and I wanted to start a discussion that you don't need to be ashamed of this. This is a very common situation. And let's talk about it openly and honestly. You don't have to be ashamed or embarrassed of something like that. But at the time, I was. Now I'm not.",

To tell these stories, to let people know that youcan come back after these horrible traumatic challenges, and still be successful and still have your voice and find your voice. That you can be brave. You need to practice bravery every day and you can become more courageous. So, it was worth that. It was worth it to tell these stories as painful as they are. And writing it is painful. And now talking about the book, is also brings back this trauma. But at the end of the day, I know my mother who died when I was eight, and she was 29, Lucy Guerrero. I know she sees it. I know she senses it. I know that I'm honoring her and my legacy through telling these stories. And the bottom line is, I feel like I've grown into the warrior that she always wanted me to be.",
