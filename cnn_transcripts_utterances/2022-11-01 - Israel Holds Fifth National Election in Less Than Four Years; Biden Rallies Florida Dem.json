Rick Scott in particular has been the key focal point of the president's attacks as it relates to this issue of Social Security and Medicare. Scott put out a policy proposal that said that all government programs would have to be voted on every five years or they would simply go out of existence.Biden has used that policy proposal as an example of the ways in which Republicans would seek to change Social Security, Medicare and perhaps, you know, put it into jeopardy in some way. Now there's a reason for why the president is making this case in Florida and why we'll hear him make a similar case at a rally this evening. The president's advisers have long seen Florida as the perfect place for him to make this contrast argument. To make this argument that this election is a choice by talking about those MAGA Republicans not only Scott but also, former President Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, all year in the state of Florida. And one senior Biden adviser told me look, you can't shake a stick in Florida without hitting a MAGA extreme Republican. And so, that is the case that you will hear President Biden make this evening and also hoping it will serve as a rallying cry for Democrats not only here in Florida but as he looks to nationalize the stakes of this midterm elections in key races across the country -- Bianna, Victor.",

What they say is that this shipment would include additional attack drones that we have already seen sent from Iran to Russia, and that it would also include these advanced precision guided missiles. And the significance there is that Iran has not yet provided those weapons to Russia. It's something that has been discussed but the expectation according to our reporting is that they are planning to move forward with that. And just to bring folks up to speed here, the fact that these Iraniandrones have already been used by Russia on the battlefield has been effective for Russia. These drones are able to essentially identify a target and key in on it. They also are hard to detect, and those are things that Ukrainian officials have said has been challenging about seeing the drones on the battlefield. But when it comes to these precision guided missiles that are also expected, they can be launched from a very far distance. And Ukraine said just today that they really don't have the capacity to effectively defend against these missiles that Iran is expected to send into Russia and then to be used on the battlefield. Now when it comes to what the United States is saying about this, just now, the State Department briefing, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the United States is concerned about Iran potentially sending these advanced missiles into Russia. And he also spoke about the fact that the Biden administration is trying to do everything they can to expose, confront, and counter these potential shipments from going ahead. But what U.S. officials and Western officials aren't able to definitively say right now is that they will, in fact, be able to prevent these shipments from going ahead. They can potentially make it more challenging. They can roll out sanctions. They can target the companies that are enabling these missile, building them, or helping Iran to ship them. But it will be very challenging to prevent them from going to the battlefield, and Ukrainians are very concerned about the impact that it could have on this ongoing war -- guys.",
