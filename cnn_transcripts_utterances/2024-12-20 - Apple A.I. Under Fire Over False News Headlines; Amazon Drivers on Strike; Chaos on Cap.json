Basically, we're hanging on by a thread, and it feels kind of ridiculous to feel like you're caught up in the crossfire of some kind of political showdown, when what we really need is for our elected officials and our president-elect, using his influence, to come together, put their party designation aside, and get this money passed.",

And we have faced catastrophic economic damage through closures due to the storm and then also just decreased tourism, because people don't want to travel to an area recently hit by a hurricane. So, we are hanging on by a thread. Most people I speak to are having their insurance claims denied. They don't have any funding. And they're depending on this disaster relief bill to provide them some support, so that they don't have to permanently close. And it isn't just -- the impact isn't just on our businesses. If you think about what happens when a restaurant permanently closes, restaurants are economic cornerstones of their community because we employ so many people. So, every dollar that comes through our doors goes right back out to our work force, the people who live in Western North Carolina, but also to our farmers and suppliers. And if we fail, the whole region fails. And we just cannot risk that.",

We're hearing from a source that the impact to Starbucks stores has been minimal.About 10 stores did not open as planned this morning out of about 10,000 stores. But, ultimately, these are legitimate union workers. And Starbucks has been negotiating with them since February. But the union says that they wanted a deal by the end of the year. And here we are, almost at the end of the year with a contract and a deal that the union says is just not good enough. Starbucks says that they're disappointed. They thought that they were making progress and they wanted to get back to the negotiating table, but, ultimately, talks broke off last week. And, of course, Pam this really does come down to the things that all these strikes come down to, wages and benefits, better wages for these workers. I will note, Pam, that these strikes are intentional at this time of year. This is a very profitable time, Pam, for both Amazon and Starbucks. So, even though the company is saying that this is not going to make a huge impact, just the perception that these strikes are happening around the holidays is raising awareness, awareness that these workers want the American public to know about, Pam.",

And now a press freedom group called Reporters Without Borders is urging Apple to remove the A.I. feature. CNN's Hadas Gold joins us now. So, Hadas, A.I. clearly doesn't always get it right, and this is an extreme example of that.",
