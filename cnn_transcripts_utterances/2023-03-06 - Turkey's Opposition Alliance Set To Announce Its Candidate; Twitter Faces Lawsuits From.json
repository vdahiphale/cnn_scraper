Prince Harry and Meghan receiving an invitation to the coronation of King Charles III in May. According to Harry's spokesperson, the couple has yet to confirm whether they will attend. All right, in about an hour, Turkey's President Erdogan could find out who his opponent will be in the upcoming election. The country's opposition alliance is set to announce its candidate as anger boils over over the government's response to the devastating earthquakes. Let's go to CNN's Nada Bashir in Istanbul. And Nada, what are Erdogan's chances of another term in light of what's been happening in Turkey for the past month?",

This could be one of the biggest challenges that President Erdogan has faced for more than two decades now. He's already faced criticism over a deepening and worsening financial crisis here in the country but also, of course, over the government's response to the earthquake and the preparedness of the country for that earthquake.Opposition figures have criticized the government for not acting swiftly enough when it came to sending that response to the southeast of the country and there continues to be criticism and questions over how people are being treated now with hundreds of thousands living in tents across the southeast region. So this is a significant challenge for President Erdogan. He has already pledged to rebuild parts affected by the earthquake within a year, of course, with those elections looming. But even this has drawn criticism. The union of engineers and architects here in Turkey say this is simply too hasty. We're already seeing excavation work underway while there are still aftershocks happening. There still needs to be geological investigations to ensure that these areas are safe. But, of course, as you mentioned there, there is the question of the opposition and whether the opposition is strong enough to take on President Erdogan. We are expecting an announcement later today of an opposition figure to lead that alliance. But, of course, there are questions around the discord we've seen over the weekend, voicing one party leaving the alliance. Questions around whether there is unity. And, of course, in a time where the country is already facing so much crisis the strength of one party -- the unity of one party might be more appealing, Christine.",

The main allegation here is concerns about the severance -- promises that employees say that were made before Musk's takeover.They say the company repeatedly told them that they would get at least two months base pay, accelerated equity vesting, their annual bonuses, and help with health insurance coverage. And some of those things are really major for big tech employees. That could be a big portion of their compensation -- overall compensation package. Instead, they were offered one month's base pay in exchange for signing this pretty significant NDA. And so employees said that they want that severance that they were promised. I think they also want some sort of acknowledgment of the chaos of the last year and what it meant for them to live through that.

The Mavs would have one last chance though and their star Luka Doncic had the ball in his hands but he can't get it to go in. A harmless foul afterwards. Doncic clearly frustrated and Suns star Devin Booker starts chirping and Luka doesn't like something that he said. And Booker said afterwards that he was just talking to the ref, Christine. The Suns win. They're now 3-0 with Durant in the lineup, while Dallas has a losing record since Kyrie came to town. Irving finished last night with 30 points for the Mavs. And finally, let's get happy -- feeling some madness. Ten teams punching their tickets to the NCAA Tournament yesterday. Seven women's squads, three men's. Nobody had a bigger day though than Iowa's Caitlin Clark. The Hawkeye's sharpshooter putting up a 30-point triple-double in a blowout of Ohio State. It was the first triple-double in Big Ten title game history. Clark scored or assisted on 68 of Iowa's points in their 105-72 win. They could be your number one seed on the women's side.
