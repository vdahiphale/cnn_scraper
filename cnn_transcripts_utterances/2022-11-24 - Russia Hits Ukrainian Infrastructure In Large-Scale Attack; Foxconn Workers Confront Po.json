Clashes at the world's largest iPhone factory with workers angry about their pay and safety. And Germany's football team is the latest to take a stand at the World Cup saying their voice has been denied. We begin with Russia's latest barrage of missile strikes across the Ukraine, targeting the country's critical infrastructure and killing at least seven Ukrainians. The large-scale assault on Wednesday knocked out power too much of the country including in the capital Kyiv, but hours later, a number of regions were reporting that repair work had largely restored the power supply. The strikes also causing massive blackout in neighboring Moldova, where the prime minister sent a message of support to Ukraine after Russia's attack. Well, meantime Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to support the Ukrainian peace formula, saying there should be no room for terror in the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Energy terror is comparable to the use of weapons of mass destruction. When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water. This is an obvious crime against humanity. LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.: Colleagues, it seems that Putin is determined to reduce Ukraine's energy facilities to rubble. Putin's motive could not be more clear and more cold blooded. He is clearly clearly weaponizing winter to inflict immense suffering on the Ukrainian people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's highest since the start of the pandemic.The capital city of Beijing alone reported its third consecutive day of more than a thousand local infections. Well, this comes as violent protests erupt at the world's largest iPhone assembly factory in central China with workers there upset about paying insufficient anti-COVID measures. Social media video shows workers at the Foxconn plant confronting police in hazmat suits. The company is offering those who are willing to quit their jobs and leave Zhengzhou compound a $1,400 payout. Well, for more on this, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me here in Hong Kong. Kristie, these are extraordinary scenes. What are you learning? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Anna, we are closely monitoring online video showing these clashes taking place at this massive iPhone factory in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou. The workers there at Foxconn are fed up and furious over pay, over COVID controls and over sanitary conditions inside the factory. Foxconn is now offering $1,400 for new hires willing to leave the Zhengzhou Foxconn facility immediately. That's a lot of money. It's equivalent to about two months salary for these workers. And apparently, this is being done in a bid to get workers to leave the site to restore order and to end these violent clashes that you're looking at your screen right now. We've been watching the scenes play out. Tense standoffs between the workers and the authorities and security forces in hazmat suits while the workers breaking down barriers and all out chaos breaking out in a live stream that has since been taking down. You can hear the workers complain about the conditions inside the factory as well as their pay. And we have a fresh statement just out this morning from Foxconn. Let's bring it up for you. The company says this \"taking care of the health and safety of employees is the primary operating principle that the group has always adhere to and fully understand the concerns of some newly recruited employees in the Zhengzhou Park about possible changes in the subsidy policy. Our team has been looking into the matter.\" Now, CNN has also learned that Apple has staff on site in Zhengzhou at the Foxconn facility and we have this statement from Apple saying this: \"We are reviewing the situation and we're working closely with Foxconn to ensure their employees concerns are addressed.\" Now, Zhengzhou is of course a major manufacturing hub for the iPhone. It was last month when due to rising COVID-19 cases, the city ordered a city wide lockdown which stopped basically all non-essential business and manufacturing activities. A number of Foxconn workers allegedly fled in order to make-up for the shortfall. Foxconn offered big bonuses for workers to come back and to work inside its closed loop (AUDIO GAP) that morning.",

Red flag laws are where law enforcement or family members, if they believe that you are a danger to yourself or others, that firearm can be temporarily taken away from you. That, by the way, would have prevented last week's shooting in Colorado. We need to do that. And then, final piece to look at is I'm a gun owner.

And he slapped Bolsonaro's Liberal Party with a fine of about $4 million for bad-faith litigation. That's after Bolsonaro filed a petition to have the round two ballots annulled. He claims some voting machines malfunctioned. Bolsonaro narrowly lost to former President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva last month. Lula's inauguration is set for January 1. The United Kingdom's top court says Scotland cannot hold a second referendum on independence without the approval of the British Parliament. It's a blow to the Scottish National Party, the dominant force in Scottish politics, who have been campaigning for a split from the U.K. for years. The court argued a referendum could have lasting effects on the democratic legitimacy of the union between Scotland and the U.K. Independence supporters gathered in Edinburgh on Wednesday, and listened to party leader and Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. While she accepts the court's ruling, she also accused the British government of, quote, \"outright democracy denial.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
