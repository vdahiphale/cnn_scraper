      "sentences": "So, Kyiv very much celebrating -- praising what they see as a major political victory as well as a victory for their battlefield receiving these tanks. They have main British battle tanks that are coming, so you have Challengers from the U.K., Strikers and Cougars from the U.S., Marders from Germany. Now, this is just a fraction of what Ukraine is expecting to receive and just a fraction of what President Zelenskyy has asked for but it does come at a very critical juncture in the conflict.You'll remember the city of Bakhmut, of course, where Ukrainian forces have been on the backfoot struggling to fight back against a fierce assault by Wagner mercenaries. So that will be very welcomed news for those soldiers -- those fighters on the front lines there for Ukraine and really, all along that eastern front. Ukrainian officials are expecting the tempo of war to pick up as the weather warms and as we head into the spring, and expect this offensive from Moscow. So again, very welcomed are these tanks on the battlefield. Now you might ask what impact does it have? Again, we're talking about a small handful of tanks so don't expect it to suddenly change everything on the ground. But what it really provides here is a precedent -- is a new door if you will that has opened up for Kyiv. You'll remember that tanks were absolutely off the table a year ago when this conflict started when the United States and its allies saw weapons that they perceived as offensive, such as tanks, to be something that would aggravate Moscow further -- that could escalate the conflict. Clearly, that calculation has changed now and that's what Kyiv is capitalizing on here. They see that tanks are coming today but tomorrow they could get bigger and better weapons. And this is all about quality over quantity, too. Remember, before the conflict Ukraine's forces were mostly Soviet-era -- using mostly a Soviet-era weapons arsenal. Now they're receiving these Western-made NATO weapons that really ramps up their ability to fight with less on the ground. And they're facing off with Russian troops that are, of course, struggling to maintain ammunition, struggling to maintain manpower, and, of course, don't have that type of modern weaponry. But again, it's about the precedent this sets that the West is willing and able to do anything it can to support that fight in Ukraine.",

Finally, check out this bizarre ejection yesterday in spring training. The Phillies' Craig Kimbrel had just gotten a pitch clock violation and wanted a new ball. The ump threw him one but he didn't like that ball and wanted another one. So catcher J.T. Realmuto reached his glove back to get that ball and watch what happens. He didn't know it was coming. He took his glove away and the umpire then ejected him because he thought he was trying to trick him. Realmuto was so confused, as you can see. He told the Philadelphia Enquirer after the game he said to umpire Randy Rosenberg, \"Dude, I thought you were throwing the ball.\" He said, \"I'm not going to buy that.\" You can see immediately, Christine, that Realmuto was like, wait, what?
