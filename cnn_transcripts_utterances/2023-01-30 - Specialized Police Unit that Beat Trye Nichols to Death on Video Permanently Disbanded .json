All five of the former officers were members of the recently created SCORPION unit which was tasked with tackling rising crime in the city. The Memphis Police Department announcing that they will permanently deactivate the unit. The police chief says it was created due to an outcry because of three years of violence in the city.

And when you look at the Memphis crime picture, and the chief framed it a little bit, but this is a city that's poured millions into downtown, convention centers, restaurants, venues. They lost a Hyatt Hotel construction deal because crime was just going up. Downtown, they had 4,000 crimes in 2022, 1,000 more than they had the year before, 30 cars broken into on one block.So, sending these anti-crime teams that are your experienced officers, highly trained to go after predator criminals, makes sense in a place where you're having record murders, shootings, carjackings. The problem is, how long are they on the job? What was their level of experience? What was their level of supervision? Is there a sergeant with every team? The answer was, not long enough, not enough training, not enough supervision. They got three or four days. Needed more than that. The basics were there. They had de-escalation training. They had some tactical training. But at the end of the day, they had to disband that unit, because the name is poison now. No pun intended about the SCORPION unit, but you couldn't send teams out and have them show up in a community where they would say, who are you guys? And they would say, we're SCORPION, and get anything but a really negative reaction.",

This woman was found last Tuesday, as you point out, beaten into unconsciousness. The district attorney said that he tried to kill her while intentionally torturing her and secretly confining her in a place where she was not likely to be found. She is now hospitalized in critical condition. Now, he fled that scene before officers arrived. This was last Tuesday. They then searched another area about 20 miles north with a SWAT team. They found several pieces of evidence, including his car, and a woman who they believe was hiding him out. They arrested her, but he escaped again. Again, Kaitlan, he is on the run.

This is nearly a month after a six-year-old student in that school, brought a gun in, and shot his teacher in class. Richneck Elementary has installed metal detectors. Students will be given clear bookbags and the principal has been reassigned. Our Brian Todd is live for us this morning in Newport News, Virginia. You can imagine being one of those parents thinking about, you know having that talk sending your kids back to school. What are you hearing?",

We've been talking to a couple of teachers off camera as they made their way in this morning.One of them just told me, she is excited to be back here. A very significantly enhanced security footprint in place here at Richneck Elementary for this first day back as you mentioned. They're making the students carry around clear transparent backpacks, not allowing them to bring their regular backpacks to school. Two state-of-the art metal detectors are now in place. We've seen several Newport News Police officers including the Police Chief, Steve Drew here at the entrance greeting people as they've come in. Now, police officers, school resource officers will not be deployed here, but they will have security officers -- other security officers here from now on as well. They did have that imprint there even before the shooting, but it was one security officer splitting duties between elementary schools, that will now be enhanced. Still parents are very anxious. We talked to one parent of a child whose son is in the same class as the shooter, Thomas Britton, about whether he has confidence in sending his child back to the school. Here's what he had to say.

Treat threats as credible until they're not, not the other way of, you have to do it before the threat is credible.This is probably going to be the safest school in the area for a good long while, kind of an ironic twist. So, I have no misgivings about sending them back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
