The shocking video and the new charges the suspect is facing this morning. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:45:06] BERMAN: All right, today Reverend Al Sharpton is set to lead protests outside Harvard donor Bill Ackman's office in New York. Ackman was a vocal critic of ousted Harvard President Claudine Gay and her handling of anti-Semitism on the Harvard campus and her initial response to the Hamas terror attack in Israel. Gay spoke out for the first time since her resignation this week in a \"New York Times\" op-ed acknowledging that she made mistakes during her congressional testimony last month and making clear that she believes the campaign against her was driven, at least in part, by her skin color. This is what she wrote, \"my inbox has been flooded with invective, including death threats. I've been called the n-word more than I care to count.\" She also defended, for the first time, her academic writings against plagiarism allegations. CNN's Matt Egan following all of this for us now.

And clearly she believes that race played a role in also making this the shortest presidency in Harvard's history. Of her critics she wrote, and I quote, \"they recycled tired racial stereotypes about black talent and temperament. They pushed a false narrative of indifference and incompetence.\" Now, meanwhile, there are new question being raised about the Harvard Corporation. Now that is the powerful but secretive board that really calls the shots at the university because clearly the past few months have been a nightmare for Harvard and there's a lot of people wondering about how the Harvard Corporation allowed it to go this badly. I spoke to Yale Professor Jeff Sonnenfeld. He told me that the Harvard Corporation deserved a failing grade and he called for a membership shakeup there. Listen to what Jeff said.
