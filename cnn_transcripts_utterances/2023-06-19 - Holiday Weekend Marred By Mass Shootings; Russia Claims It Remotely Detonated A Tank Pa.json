New video released by Russia, showing what it claims is a tank, packed with tons of explosives, remotely detonated in a Ukrainian stronghold.Now this video does seem to show a tank hitting a mine shortly before exploding, which complicates part of Russia's claim here. In the meantime, a senior Ukrainian official says Kyiv's forces have recaptured eight southern settlements over the last two weeks. Russia's Defense Minister denies that, though, saying it successfully repelled Ukrainian advances. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Zaporizhzhia. So, a lot of conflicting information here about what's been going on between the two sides, Ben. What is the latest from the front lines?",

The latest we are hearing is that it's taking heavy shelling and air strikes from the Russians. And that even though the Ukrainians appear to be nominally in control, that the situation is really so ambiguous, that even if there are Ukrainian troops in the town, they don't seem to be secure at all. Therefore, what we're seeing is the Russians do seem to be relatively prepared for this Ukrainian counteroffensive. And as a rule, it's much easier to defend than retake a territory. As you mentioned, the Russians seem to be using a new tactic where they are stuff -- this is a T-54 tank, dating back to the Soviet era, just after the end of the Second World War. According to the Telegram channel of the Russian defense minister, they put as many as five or six tons of explosive in that tank, and basically somebody put a brick, perhaps, on the accelerator, aimed it at the Ukrainian lines. But it appears to have hit a mine about 300 yards from that line -- those Ukrainian positions but creating a huge explosion. We don't know at this point where there were any Ukrainian casualties, whether the Russians were able to take advantage of that explosion to advance into the Ukrainian lines. But it certainly is a new tactic that we are seeing here -- Brianna?",

A fishing crew out a $3.5 million prize after its more than 600-poundblue marlin -- you see it there -- was disqualified from a fishing competition. The Big Rock Marlin Tournament said the disqualification was due to a, quote, \"mutilation of the fish by a shark or other sea creature.\" The idea being it was easier to reel it in. The runner-up, team Sushi, went on to win first place with a blue marlin weighing more than 484 pounds. That's not so bad, either. Also, an investigation is underway in Arizona after a man died falling over the edge of a popular tourist attraction over the Grand Canyon. You see it there. Officials say the 33-year-old man was on the Skywalk, a glass bridge that spans about 70 feet out over the canyon's rim, when he went over the edge, plunging 4,000 feet into the canyon. Severe weather in Jasper County, Mississippi, has left at least one person dead, and nearly two dozen others injured.

He didn't think twice when he opened that envelope, but then, of course, that's when he saw the powder inside. He says, so far, all the recipients that he knows about are fellow Republicans. And he shared a photo of that letter with us. Take a look. He points specifically to two sentences in that letter that say, quote, \"to honor your recent accomplishments, it's important not to choke on your ambition.\" Now he points out, of course, this is a very cryptic message, but he thinks this could be a reference to the super majority that the Republicans have in the Kansas House and the Senate and that that majority was used to override nine vetoes by the Democratic governor. Now all of this is very controversial in the state of Kansas. One of those involved the definition of a man and woman, and the other involved transgender sports. Now, he also states that it was calculated because he -- because of the return address, he and others simply just opened these letters. Now, authorities are not specifically talking about motive at this point. There is no one who has been arrested. But he's not the only one of the representatives who feel targeted. Take a listen.
