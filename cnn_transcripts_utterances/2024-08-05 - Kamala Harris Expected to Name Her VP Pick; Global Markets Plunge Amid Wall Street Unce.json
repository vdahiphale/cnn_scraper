Catastrophic rain on a slow motion march up the entire east coast.And we are standing by not just for an announcement but the announcement by Vice President Harris on her running mate. The new clues emerging this morning. And then record-breaking stock plunges around the world. Major new concerns with U.S. market set to open in 90 minutes. Kate is out. I'm John Berman with Sara Didner and this is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. And the breaking news this morning, hurricane Debby made landfall moments ago, and this is just the beginning. Even as the Florida coast gets battered with winds and surge, the real story is what will happen the next few days as the storm crawls up the coast, bringing catastrophic levels of rain, feet of rain. More than 1 million people across three states are under the highest flooding alert possible already. But Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said this just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R-FL):  Now that hurricane Debby is making landfall, the most important thing to do is to just protect yourself and protect your family. Don't go out into this storm.

      "sentences": "Winds are really picking up here. We are starting to get them back end of that eye wall. We are in Steinhatchee, Florida, where Debby made landfall just about an hour ago with 80 mile-per-hour winds as a category one hurricane.What's remarkable is 24 hours before that, it was a tropical storm. It rapidly intensified because the ocean temperatures out here are in your record warm levels. We're talking upper 80s and low 90s. And that is a sign and symptom of climate change. And we continue to see this rapid intensification which is happening more because these ocean temperatures are just so warm. Where we are here actually is only about nine miles from where Idalia made landfall last year. Now that was a stronger category three hurricane, but a lot of this area here took on a lot of flooding when Idalia happened last year. A lot of these docks that you see around me, are brand-new. They just replaced them. There will also showing us some condos and things here that needed to be completely gutted because of the way they flooded with Idalia last year. So locals here were incredibly worried about what the storm surge could do in this area. Storm surge has already topped six feet in nearby places like Cedar Key. Rainfall totals around here have been around eight inches. So again, already seeing the impacts of water here in Florida. The problem as we go through the rest of the week is Debby works inland and then just sits and spins and stalls. We're talking about a forward beat of about a walking pace. You could walk faster than this hurricane as it continues to move inland. The problem with that is it's going to dump prolific amounts of rain. We're talking 20 to 30 inches of rain.",

So when they start using this high risk, a level four of four, that means you really need to pay attention because they will only reserve this for the most rare events. And so they're seeing, just like the meteorologists here at CNN center are seen, is that this area in particular where we've highlighted that shading of pink, that is an area where we anticipate flash flooding, rapid rises in rivers, and the potential for catastrophic flooding. Remember, Sara, it's not only the surge component working inland, but it's also the inland and flooding working against it. So that water has nowhere to go but up.",

Those are the people that we believe that she is deciding between. Shapiro, affectionately known as Baruch Obama, a nod to his Jewish style -- excuse me, his Jewish faith. But also like his style and cadence that many people say mirrors the former president Barack Obama.He could help Harris with moderate voters as could Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut who runs to the right of the administration on issues like immigration. We have seen Shapiro get some pushback from progressives, but you have centrists in the party saying this is a really good strategic choice, or it would be. And then you have Walz. His supporters saying he's the Midwestern dad that America needs. He's good at making progressive policies like universal free meals in schools popular. Now, the former president, Donald Trump, as well as his running mate, they are dismissing all of this excitement around the veepstakes for Harris, saying it doesn't really matter who she chooses. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't care. Let them do whatever. They still want to have open borders. If she picks Shapiro, she's going to lose the Palestinian vote and that's fine. Everybody has their liabilities. SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH) VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I don't really care who she chooses as a running mate. It's not going to be good for the country and we're ready.

      "sentences": "Well, let me start by saying this, Sara. I think this is one of those moments where a lot of people are taking deep breaths as we watch the open on Wall Street.That includes traders, but also those of us who own homes or have a 401(k). That means Main Street because what we saw happen over the day here in Asia is quite extraordinary. Big losses in many of the stock markets, including South Korea and Japan, which saw its biggest daily point loss ever. This is something that just doesn't happen that often, but it is part of a fear that is travelling around the world right now about the economic roadmap for the future. Look back to last Friday, the Jobs Report, the United States came out. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great. But traders, they didn't like it and we saw a big selloff. Now, it was Monday morning here in Asia, almost what, eight or ten hours ago, when markets opened up in Japan, there was talk of higher interest rates by the Bank of Japan. That's not something traders like. So we saw a big selloff here and what's so often happens is when one continent starts to have a big selloff, well, people around the world start to notice and then other markets selloff. So that's what's been happening. So, as we look to Wall Street as to the open, the reason why there is so much concern is that there is potential for more bad news. There is concern of a recession in the works, so to speak. That is because we saw announcements of job layoffs last week from Intel; it's a big tech company. Tech companies should be thriving. We heard from executives that Amazon talk about how their view of the future isn't as optimistic as it was in the past. So, these are all reasons to give traders pause, to give them concern, and to start selling off. And we saw declines already in Europe. So now, America is next. Sara, something really interesting at CNN and if you go to our business section, we have what's called the fear and greed index. What's motivating traders right now? We look at all these different factors. Fear is the dominant feeling among traders that we survey as part of this explainer as to where the economy stands.",
