I'm Christiane Amanpour live in Warsaw, Poland where today pomp and circumstance came to the castle to welcome the arrival of the American President Joe Biden. Marking one year since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. leader pitted the war in Ukraine as the defense of democracy against dictatorship. Take a listen to his speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  President Putin is confronted with something today that he didn't think was possible a year ago, the democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker. But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Tomorrow, President Biden meets with the so-called Bucharest Nine. It's a group made up of the former Soviet Republics for whom this war triggers painful memories. Among them is the Czech Republic and my next guest is the country's president-elect, Petr Pavel, who joins me now for an exclusive interview. President-Elect Pavel, welcome to the program. Of course, we are talking about the former Warsaw pact nations. And so, I wonder what you made today of President Biden's robust speech right here in defense of democracy. Did he say what you are expecting? PETR PAVEL, CZECH PRESIDENT-ELECT:  Well, Christiane, I believe that President Biden's visit first to Kyiv and now to Warsaw is an extremely strong signal not only to Russia, but also to all European countries that the United States will support Ukraine, will support our common principles, and will stand by European allies.",

We tried everything that we could to make a diplomatic solution, and that of course was the right effort to do, to -- trying to make a diplomatic solution. But looking back, it was obvious that Russia will attack Ukraine. They already used the energy leverage during that summer, during that autumn, they already used the energy leverage. There was different kind of disruptions with the energy flows during that year of 2021. They had put their troops in different places saying that they are only training. Looking back now, it was obvious that they were planning this big attack against Ukraine. And then looking way back to 2014, when the Crimea was invaded, we made a big mistake then. We made a big mistake then together not to react more strongly. If we had acted and reacted more strongly towards the Crimea, then the war wouldn't happen. I think Russia thought that it would be just like Crimea, just entering Ukraine. Ukraine would give them -- open welcome. It would last only for a few weeks and Putin would win very quickly and easily the war because we did not react in 2014. And now, we have to learn some lessons on the current situation. And I think the main lesson is not to be naive. We cannot be naive. I listened to the previous panel and I agree. I also want the world, which is beautiful and good and secure and we don't have to put money to our military forces, to our defense forces. I also want that world, but that world isn't a reality.

I first found the story, actually, serendipitously while doing research with my team on the last from I directed, that's a film called \"The Seer and the Unseen\". And it tells the story of an Icelandic woman who is in communication with spirits of nature. And we wanted to open that film actually with archival imagery of erupting volcanoes in Iceland. And once we went about the research, we learned about Katia and Maurice Krafft because not that many people had films of erupting volcanoes in Iceland before but they had. Once we learned about their love for each other and the planet, we were absolutely hooked. They -- seems like they had this kind of a mythical love story. The fact they were in love with each other and the earth. So, that got the ball rolling on making \"Fire of Love.\"",

Both of them grew up in postwar France right along the German border and they both possessed a, kind of, sense of disillusionment with humanity. They kind of felt that humans destroyed more than they had created. Whereas they had this idealistic vision of volcanoes as this creative force that, you know, that created land that brought life to the world. And having that unique perspective at such a young age caused them to bond. Once they began traveling the world together, exploring erupting volcanoes, they experienced a kind of transcendence, perhaps, you can call it, by witnessing something that powerful, that beguiling as a volcanic eruption. There's kind of no turning back. They wanted to dedicate their lives towards exploring that mystery and the fact they had each other along the way, it made it all the more important and meaningful for them.",

So, their work was extremely important. And it also enabled their adventures to move forward because they were supported for this kind of documentation work as well. But that caused them to shoot just hundreds of hours of footage. It wasn't just data. It was also a conduit for them to connect with, kind of, the beauty and the magic and the mystery of the planet that they were absolutely in love with capturing that imagery as well. Catching responses with celebrities in France -- they became celebrities over time in France because people were so intrigued by this unique life -- life's pursuit and this love story. And so, they appeared on television shows, on the news, they even had their own educational program for kids. So, I'll just say, along with all of the footage that they themselves shot, there is a visual and audio record of them that was available to us to get to use it as well.",

There's such a palpable love that radiates behind their frames. You can really feel that kind of connectedness. That desire to be as close as possible. And they did in fact go as close as possible to get these kinds of shots. I'm still in awe of the kinds of compositions that they captured, especially considering the, you know, the heat. One of my favorite shots of Katia in Iceland in the mid-'80s, when she gets up so close to the edge of the Krafla Volcano, and she has a thermometer in her hands, and apparently that reading was 1,200-degree Celsius. And there's moments where you can kind of detect a smile on her face as she is coming back. And she's just in awe. She's just absolutely in love.

But also, what it means to kind of live in relationship to death the way the two of them did. You know, they knew that they could die at any moment pursuing such dangerous work, and that almost seemed to free them up to understand the kind of absurdity to life, so to speak. There's a levity to things. They were kind of freed from lesser concerns, perhaps. They would always comment on what they viewed as, kind of, petty and vain human preoccupations. But to be close to a volcano, it was kind of akin to being with a divine in a way.

And so, of course, we're very aware and intrigued bygray volcanoes, otherwise known as explosive volcanoes. But they were particularly animated by the pursuit of the unknown. They had an opportunity in 1980, when Mount Saint Helens erupted, to delve deeply into researching a gray volcano like Mount Saint Helens. Of course, there's a tragedy, nearly 60 people were killed. The entire area was destroyed. Yet it was a watershed moment in the field of volcanology to study this kind of once in human lifetime type of eruption. It absolutely ignited Katia and Maurice's curiosity. And they felt like there was an opportunity to, you know, this type of volcano that wasn't as well understood because they're so rare, because they're so powerful, and because they're so dangerous. And for Katia, who was particularly driven by, kind of, this pursuit of scientific understanding. For her, she wanted to have this opportunity to really learn. And Maurice too, he, of course, is so in love with that idea as well, but the danger got him all the more excited. And so, for them, they decided to kind of compromise and dedicated their lives towards studying gray volcanoes. And I say compromise because at that moment in their relationship and in their lives, Maurice is very much wanting to develop a kind of vessel that would allow him to ride down a lave flow -- a red lava flow. He was so excited about this and would often tease Katia with this. It's kind of like, they wanted to -- or he wanted to get so close that he literally wanted to be in the lava flow. But through their conversations, based on our research, they kind of compromised and the said -- instead said, OK. Studying explosive volcanoes, that kind of will get them as close to the danger as Maurice wants and provides this opportunity for understanding like Katia wants. And so, they really shifted their focus towards that kind of study and that carried them through the rest of their lives.",

They wanted to do so, so that they could illustrate how pyroclastic flows moved so they could put it in a video about understanding volcanic hazards that they were using to teach governments and decision-makers how to comprehend this very mysterious and very dangerous force. It was really their goal that in Maurice's quixotic terms that volcanoes no longer kill, which of course, is not actually possible. But they witnessed such devastation, namely at the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, 1985, where over 22,000 people died because they were not evacuated in time. There weren't proper warning systems put in place. That they really wanted to use their imagery to, instead, teach people on how these dangerous forces worked to save lives. So, that's really what they were doing that day in June in 1991 at the base Mount Unzen, they were trying to capture a particular shot. And it's tragic yet there's something deeply poignant and poetic about the fact that they were trying to save lives when they themselves lost their own life -- lives. They did so along with 41 other people, including their friend and fellow volcanologist Harry Glicken. So, it's quite tragic. And there's people that are mourning them today.
