      "sentences": "One of the most exclusive clubs in the country has a brand-new member tonight, but it's not a club you'd actually want to belong to. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"With apologies to \"The Sound of Music,\" how do you solve a problem like George Santos? Well, no surprise, I think they may have cracked a nut. The House voted today to kick him out of Congress. What's his response? \"Why would I want to stay here? To hell with this place.\" I'm quoting him. And that is the epitome of \"you can't fire me, I quit\" from the now ex-congressman who just yesterday refused to resign while wearing Ferragamo shoes and driving and arriving in a Jaguar. I point that out because of some of the receipts that came in the ethics report Now, he's joining a pretty exclusive club. No, not the college volleyball team. This is a really exclusive club with only five members. Well, now they have a sixth. The only six members who've ever been thrown out of Congress in the 234-year history. And let me tell you, they are a regular -- well, maybe a rogue's gallery might be the appropriate phrase to use. You got John B. Clark, John W. Reid, and Henry C. Burnett, who were expelled back in 1861 for fighting for the confederacy. Also, Michael \"Ozzie\" Myers. No, not the one from \"Halloween.\" I know I began with the movie reference. I'm talking about a real person here, the one who was expelled in 1980 after he was convicted as part of the infamous FBI Abscam investigation. He and other lawmakers were caught up in a sting operation, taken bribes to help make believe -- to help a make- believe Arab sheik. Now, fun fact, it was the inspiration. Yes, you got it, for the Oscar winning movie, \"American Hustle.\" It's Friday night, I admit the movie references are getting a little extreme, but then there is this one, James Traficant Jr., who got kicked out after being convicted of several crimes, including bribery back in 2002. And that's it, six in 234 years. Now, you got to add George Santos. I want to bring in Congressman Glenn Ivey. He was one of the 311 members who voted to expel George Santos today, and he also sits on the Ethics Committee that recommended his expulsion. Congressman Ivey, I'm so glad you're here. Thank you for joining me today. I'm going to tell you, people were wondering if this day would come, the second they started to hear about how he got elected in the first place. Is it long overdue or the right time given the ethics report release? REP. GLENN IVEY (D-MD): Well, I mean, I thought it was important to get the report out. You know, the Ethics Committee staff did a fantastic job in doing the investigation. We did. And it took time. They went through 170,000 pages of documents and, you know, 40 subpoenas, did over 40 interviews and depositions. So, you know, we did it the right way. I think that's an important fact because, you know, you have people who are concerned about expelling someone from the Congress. I think it was important that we'd done a thorough investigation that supported that position.",

And so, they're going to take their shot. We can anticipate that Judge McAfee is going to be consistent. I don't see any reason for him to rule any differently on the issue this time around.
