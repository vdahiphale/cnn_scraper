And Stormy Daniels' former manager and longtime friend on how the woman at the center of Trump's criminal trial is now preparing to testify. He'll be OUTFRONT. And tonight, warnings of a, quote, bloodbath, as Israel could be just days away from a military operation on Rafah. Fareed Zakaria joins us. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a dramatic moment in court as Trump's former gatekeeper and confidant, Hope Hicks, broke down on the stand. Hicks was sitting just feet away from her former boss. This is the moment caught by the sketch artist, immediately got emotional when Trump's team began the cross-examination and asked her about her time at Trump Organization. Now, that was that particular moment. The reality is from the moment Hope Hicks walked into that courtroom, the atmospheric change. This is an important witness. Our reporters who were there say it was almost electric in terms of the change in the room, Hicks is as inner circle for Trump as it gets and she did prove to be a key witness of the witnesses so far, revealing never before known details that frankly were crucial to both sides for the prosecution. When asked if Michael Cohen would have paid Stormy Daniels without Trump's approval, she said, quote, I didn't know Michael to be in especially charitable person or selfless person. He's a kind of person who seeks credit. I'd say that would be out of character for Michael. So that was crucial there, but then she also painted Cohen as someone who often went rogue, helping the defense. She told them under cross- examination, quote, he liked to call himself a fixer or Mr. Fix It and it was only because he first broke it. Well, no love lost there. After nearly three hours, Hicks left the stand, Trump did turn and nod to her with a small smile, but she did not look at the man that she had worked side-by-side for, for so many years. Well, that's according to our reporters who were there. And as Trump left court, he showed little emotion when asked about seeing Hope Hicks he obeyed the gag order. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

TERRI AUSTIN, HOST AND LEGAL ANALYST, LAW &amp; CRIME NETWORK; FORMER TRIAL ATTORNEY:  Well, the room was shocked. I've got to tell you, not just the jury, but also all of the press corps was shocked and I think the parties were shocked. She didn't actually start crying. She stopped and she turned to this side. And then she just kind of got choked up. And then Bove asked, do you want to take a break? Let's take a break. And judge said, let's take a break. So I think the jury and everyone else was wondering what's going on, and I believe the reaction was because just like Jeremy said, she had just finished testifying. She said something that was damaging towards Trump's. She said yes, he did say it's better that this happened before the election then after the election. And I think when Bove got up there, she felt comfortable. She felt at home. This is my family and sometimes that's a very sensitive moment. That's when you break down.",

So the idea he would pay $130,000 of his own money out of the kindness of his heart, doesn't really fit. So again, which of those is more powerful?

CNN learning that Israel is now briefing the Biden administration ahead of its military operation in Rafah in southern Gaza, which could be days away. The United Nations in a briefing today says the intensity and scale of the destruction in Gaza is like nothing the world has seen since World War II.When you've had seen what's going on in the ground in places like Ukraine, that is an absolutely stunning thing to say. OUTFRONT now, Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS and author of the new book, \"Age of Revolutions\". Get it online, or like it is in my bookstore, I'm sure it is on the front shelf of every bookstore. You walk into right now. So, Fareed, the -- let's just start with this bloodbath warning from the who about what they say will happen if Israel goes into Rafah. Are they right? Are those words fair bloodbath? FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\":  It sounds pretty fair. Remember, this is one-and-a-half million people who had been herded into Rafah because they were forced in there when the Israeli government displaced most of them from northern Gaza and northern Gaza was then essentially destroyed. There's another U.N. report, I think it's -- I think it's the U.N. that says it will take 80 years to rebuild the homes and schools and hospitals that have been destroyed in northern Gaza. So all these people are not now clustered. Gaza was already densely populated. They're now in this tiny area called about Rafah. If Israel goes in and again, the truth is Hamas does use human beings as shields. It does use civilian facilities as shields, but the reality of that means devastation for ordinary people.",

[19:35:02] They've gotten nowhere. So I think the answer to your question is, no, it's -- whatever they're doing, it isn't working. And so, the question -- and it's a hard one is do they condition some of the aid that is coming to Israel and say, you can't use this in Rafah. I think we are getting to a point where there may be a major break between Washington and Israel. And we haven't seen this in a long time. If that happens, Biden faces this very difficult choice.

And it comes in the context of more pro-Palestinian protests, as we've seen through the week, Fareed, right, on campuses across the country. These pictures you're looking at here on the screen are from New York University. More than 2,100 were arrested, all in as the demonstration as of now spread at last count free to more than 40 campuses across the entire United States.I know though that in the complexity of this, where these situations are very complex, some words are thrown around very lightly that shouldn't be, you see a double standard and how colleges are treating speech on campus.

In other words, they've jumped in almost sided with some protesters particularly after the George Floyd protests. And in other cases, they've said, well, its free speech, we can -- we can get involved in this.So give you a simple example. Would colleges take -- have been as reluctant to disperse some of these protests if they had been white supremacists? If they had even been big rallies and favor of Trump and MAGA and things like that? You wonder right? Part of the reason you wonder is that colleges have not been near neutral in the way they have -- they've kind of applied these principles. So what happened particularly for Jewish groups is when they started to hear what was often, unfortunately, antisemitic rhetoric, and college president said, oh, this is all protected free speech. A lot of Jewish groups said, wait a minute, you didn't say that when it was anti-Black rhetoric. You didn't say that -- so there's -- there's a sense in which why is it free speech sometimes and not free speech other times? And that -- that adds to this is a difficult challenge. But I think one thing we should always remember, civil disobedience is okay. It is one of the great traditions of American protest. The key to it, as Martin Luther King said in 1965, is you have to be willing to take the punishment. If, you know, if you are breaking the law because you want to call attention to something, you got to accept the consequences of breaking the law. BURNETT:  Right, and that means it being arrested and maybe being expelled, right? That's the price. And if you do it, you have to be willing to pay it. But the price of this for Biden -- what's at stake, right, is the deep passion that is clearly felt by many young people across this country. We knew that before these protests, but these protests certainly cemented it for people and Bernie Sanders told Christiane Amanpour that Biden is out of step with much of the Democratic pace on this issue in terms of how he sees it and his support is his support for Israel. So let me just play what Senator Sanders said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  This maybe Biden's Vietnam. I worry very much that President Biden is putting himself in a position where he has alienated not just young people, but a lot of the Democratic base in terms of his views on Israel and this war.

But it is true, the fundamental point Bernie Sanders made true. Biden doesn't seem to get how strongly the base fields about this and what could happen and the replay that is possible is the Democratic Convention this year is being held in the same city it was in 1968 and that year, the protests around Vietnam send a signal to the world that the Democratic party was in disarray, was divided, and that signal could easily be sent to the world again from Chicago.
