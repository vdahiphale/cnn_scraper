I will say one of the delegates also told me that the difference in the engagement between when Biden was in top of the ticket versus when Harris was night and day in terms of how the campaign is engaging with these activists. Also, a lot of folks -- a lot of Democrats saying to people like this, well, you know, if you don't vote for Harris, you might help Trump and that's not going to be good for Arab-Americans or for Gaza for this cause, your cause.

Not kind of, he has been unhinged the last couple of weeks. I think as a reaction to Kamala Harris getting into this race.KANNO-YOUNGS:  I think that's right. And also, how much of it could be the fact that you have something new here, you've had a change, you've had a switch on the ticket. There was so much sort of frustration when you had, you know, President Biden at the top of the ticket going up against the former president, which very much represented the same. You know, it was a repeat of the last election cycle. You had people at that point frustration. Now, you have something new. And the big question here, is this enthusiasm that's specifically tied to Kamala Harris or is it enthusiasm about the fact that the Democratic Party just had an injection of energy because of something new here? And that's where this convention is really important for the vice president. Can you continue to sort of build the momentum here or do we enter a phase where you're going to see additional scrutiny on whatever her policy platform could be and how much it could change or pivot from the Biden administration?",

You know, it's basically half the country. Joe Biden was less than that. And that's the challenge for Trump. He has to make Harris something less than a generic Democrats. So, what is that radical Democrat, progressive Democrat, you know, something that's not just a generic avatar for one of the two parties, which I think is what she's occupying right now. And for.

Both are great.The thing about coming in and not having a divided party right now is that it also gives an opportunity to draw a contrast to what is going on in the Republican Party. You have the president handing and passing the torch to the vice president. You have Donald Trump who doesn't even speak to his former vice president because he tried to send people to the Capitol to hang him and overturn the election. That is a strong contrast. And I think Joe Biden can talk about that tonight. Talk about how we have every sitting -- former sitting president speaking, how we have people from the whole -- the big party in the tent of our coalition and how this is a place where all Americans can fit in, whereas like, in the Democratic Party, your former boss didn't even come to the RNC.

I mean, you can look at the polls and see that as well. And, you know, when I talk to Democrats, I mean, one, they want the rest of this week to be about sort of the described change that they say the vice president would amount to. They want it to be about moving forward. But at the start of this convention, you have to -- at least for these Democrats, the strategy is you have to also pay respect to kind of who paved the way as well. And you're going to see other public officials as well that are speaking today. The thing I'm going to be paying attention to when it comes to President Biden's speech, how much does he actually emphasize the -- his legislative record, right?
