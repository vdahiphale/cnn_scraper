She described Trump as unhinged and unstable and also added that in a second Trump administration, there would be no John Kellys around to restrain him from his worst instincts.",

He's certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators. He has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.

But they can convince them, do you really want to go to sleep at night knowing you voted for Donald Trump? And if they can plant that seed in the minds of enough of these Republicans who really don't like Trump, I think it's clear that that is a strategy they want to pursue. This reporting is obviously pretty serious, and it seems clear with her taking the bold step of saying, I'm going to do a press conference in the middle of the day, not taking questions, but I'm going to do a statement in the middle of the day, it's clear this is a message they want to drive home.",

This is a woman who's concerned about Social Security recently diagnosed with cancer, so her health care is on her mind. I don't hear him talking about me. I hear him talking about revenge, and my husband and I are worried about that. So, I think part of it is also to say, if he's so focused on revenge, he's not going to be focused on you. So, voting for him is a risk. Is it a risk you're willing to take? And we think he's focused on -- he's not focused on you. He's focused on himself. And so I think they're trying to do a couple of things, and, frankly, suppress votes of people who may not vote for her, but maybe they will just say, you know what, I'm just not going to vote this time and won't vote for him again.",

      "sentences": "We want to keep this conversation going, but we do want to go to Alayna Treene, who is in Georgia, following Donald Trump, because there is some reaction from the Trump campaign.Alayna, what are you hearing? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER:  That's right. There is. We have heard a number of Trump advisers and people like Mark Meadows, Kash Patel really heavily push back on this. I'm going to read for you something that Steven Cheung, a top Trump campaign adviser, told me in response to some of this last night. He said -- quote -- \"that Kelly had totally beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated because he failed to serve his president well while working as chief of staff and currently suffers from a debilitating case of Trump derangement syndrome.\" So, clearly, they are pushing back very heavily on this. But I do want to take a step back, because I have covered Donald Trump for a number of years. I also was covering the White House when John Kelly was serving as Donald Trump's chief of staff. And I think it's important to add the context of who John Kelly is. He served in the military also. I'd note that his son was killed, and he also served in the military. So this is something that is deeply personal to Kelly. I know that he is someone who very much takes the Constitution very seriously, and he took that role very seriously. I think that's why when you listen to some of the recordings from \"The New York Times.\" You heard him say that he had told Donald Trump in the past while they were in the White House that: \"I don't serve you. I'm serving the Constitution.\" So that's some of the context around this. But, also, I don't think we can overstate how big of a development this is coming just two weeks before the election. We know that it's not just Kelly among those who had served with Donald Trump when he was in office who have been kind of trying to raise alarm bells about what it would mean for him to be president once again. We have also heard criticisms from Mark Milley, from Jim Mattis, from John Bolton, from Bill Barr, a lot of people who had served with him. And I think the timing of these comments is important because I think you're really seeing people in the 11th hour now say a lot of this publicly. And to that point as well, Kelly, this isn't entirely surprising from him. He has been very critical of Donald Trump in the past. And I know privately he has made similar comments about what has been said, the conversations between the two of them. I think the reason that he's taking it public now is clearly because he wants this to be seen in front of voters right before this November 5 election. Now, look, when I talk to other Trump advisers about this, this is really -- that statement I just read is kind of all of what they are saying. They're pushing back on this. They're saying the generals who have served with him are those who have been criticizing Donald Trump over some of these comments that they argue are not true, they're saying this is because Donald Trump has since turned on them. And so that's what you're going to hear a lot of his advisers continue to say. Now, as for Georgia today and whether or not Donald Trump will address this, I have a hard time believing that he's going to talk about this, either at his staff -- his first stop here in Georgia, which is in Zebulon, when he's meeting with faith leaders. And then, later today, he's going to be doing a much larger rally hosted by Turning Point Action. But, again, I think I cannot overstate the importance of the timing of this and also to keep in mind where these are coming from, which is John Kelly -- Boris, Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Listen, one thing I will say about John Kelly, John Kelly has no desire, as a man who served in uniform, because he believes that men and women in uniform should not play a political role.He resisted going public with this. I have had conversations with him face-to-face where I asked him, do you want to go on CNN and discuss this? he said: \"That's not my place.\" So him going public -- and that began as background comments. Ten they began -- then they went on-the-record comments in print. And now you have a recording out there -- is something he does not do lightly. He is not desperate to be on TV. He is not desperate to be the center of headlines, in fact, quite the opposite. And then when you look at Steven Cheung and others -- and, by the way, I have gotten statements from Steven Cheung to the same degree when you come to him with firsthand accounts about Trump comments before. And it's a reflexive answer practically cut and pasted. So you have to place that statement against the reputations and credibility not just of John Kelly, but Mark Milley, Mark Esper, who served as his defense secretary, his vice president, who is not endorsing him, right, I mean, members of the Cabinet, et cetera. So, listen, it's -- you and I can't decide for anybody who we believe. You can only say to folks who are watching right now, who do they find more credible?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's certainly part of a broader argument, Boris, that the vice president has been making on the campaign trail, that the former president has been exhibiting behavior, especially over the last several weeks, in her view, that illustrates that he is unhinged, that he is unstable.She's telling Americans, as she did today, do you want leader in the White House who would view the military as their personal militia? And the reason why she has been holding these country-over-party events in an appeal to conservative voters, Republican voters, is, they believe they have strength in this argument. There are going to be voters that don't agree with her on every policy matter, but when it comes to this existential question and the future and the health of our democracy, the campaign very much believes they are in a strong position to make that argument. So that's why we saw the vice president almost engaging in a rapid response here talking about this in real time. That being said, they know that Trump is not the only issue here. We expect her tonight at the town hall to lean heavily into her personal biography in an attempt to humanize herself, connect on a human level to the undecided and persuadable voters that will be asking her questions in this town hall tonight, as well as make an affirmative case for herself as she outlines her policy vision for America, which she describes as an opportunity economy.

So when you speak of guardrails, unlikely that they or many of them will be present. And, by the way, that's not just -- we're not just imagining that that took place in the first Trump term. I have reported about it. Our colleagues have reported about it, times when Trump wanted to do X and they pulled him back. I will just give you an example. Trump, by accounts in my book and others have had this as well, wanted to pull out of NATO at the summit in 2018. And it was Kelly and Bolton who pulled him back. And, by the way, he wanted to pull out because he felt like he wasn't treated well by the other NATO leaders at the time. There was not a grand strategic conversation about how we have got to realign ourselves towards whatever. It was, he was angry and he's, like, I'm leaving. And Bolton and Kelly in the moment were able to pull him out of that. So, if you imagine decision-making like that without those guardrails, there might very well be consequences.",

You're constantly reminded of it while you're on duty. It's reinforced multiple times. So, look, I fully believe that the uniformed officers will live up to that oath to obey the Constitution and will not be will -- will not swear a loyalty oath to the president of the United States. And so my concern, of course, is to the institution, what will happen. That was my concern during my tenure and, of course, in the summer of 2020, when he wanted to use the active-duty military, considered using the active-duty military to put down the protests and possibly even shoot protesters. And so my concern was about the institution of the military and then, maybe even more importantly, along those same line lines, the importance of the civil-military relationship in this country. It's very unique. On one hand, the military is completely subordinate to civilian authority. But, on the other hand, we serve the American people. Our oath is to the Constitution, but we serve the American people. And what you don't want to do is break down those bonds of trust that have been there for decades and decades. We saw that happen after the Vietnam War. We saw that happen after the killings at Kent State, if you recall. The National Guard opened fire on civilian protesters. We don't want to go back to that. The last institution, it seems, it has anything greater than a 50 percent legitimacy rate among the American people right now is the U.S. military, and we need to preserve that no matter what.",
