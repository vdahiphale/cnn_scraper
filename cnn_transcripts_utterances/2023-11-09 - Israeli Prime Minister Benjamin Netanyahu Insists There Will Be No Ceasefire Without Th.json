He specified that Israel would provide a three hour heads up before the pause would begin. And he said it was meant to allow humanitarian aid to come into Gaza, but also to allow civilians who are trying to flee, to get out, to try and open these new humanitarian corridors to alleviate the civilian suffering that we've seen on the ground in Gaza. And he did cast this as a significant first step for Israel, as it continues its assault on the enclave. He said that it came after significant engagement by the United States, sort of up and down the chain, all the way up to President Biden, who we know did speak to the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, and did raise the need for these humanitarian pauses in the fighting. And when we did hear from Biden today, he was at Joint Base Andrews departing for a trip to Illinois, he said that he is pushed for much longer pauses, perhaps even longer than the three days that have been reported earlier in the week. And that he said he had hoped that it would take much less time for Netanyahu to come around to an agreement on this. Because this has been a real key priority for the White House, and for the Biden administration, is to establish these pauses. We first heard from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken in late October, pushing this idea, and there had been this resistance on the part of the Israelis, to agree to any sort of significant pause in the fighting, if it did not include a release of hostages. And so, the big question is, what can be accomplished in those four hours, when it comes to the hostages. Because we had heard from American officials that they would require a significant pause in the fighting, if they were to get out those 200 or so hostages. Four hours and certainly less than that, but the hope is that perhaps, a smaller handful could come out in these pauses, as they proceed, over the next several days.",

This follows U.S. intercepting Houthi cruise missiles and drones headed for Israel. For a closer look at all of this, I'm joined live by Natasha Bertrand, at the Pentagon. So, Natasha, the U.S. has set military assets to the region, including warships. The goal here was to send a deterrence message to Iran-backed militia. Are they getting the message?",

And the attacks have pretty much kept on coming ever since then. And so, the question has been are these retaliatory airstrikes actually working. The administration seems to think that they are even though we are continuing to see these attacks by these Iran-backed proxy groups against U.S. Forces in Syria and Iraq. The attacks are being waged using drones, small rockets, and they are not always successful, in fact they're usually not successful. But they still have resulted in quite a few injuries amongst service members, including several traumatic brain injuries. And so, the U.S. feels that they have to retaliate in some way. And they are doing that by destroying, they say, IRGC -- Iran-backed stockpiles of weaponry that they are using to conduct these attacks. B But the question remains, whether this is a sustainable approach, because it is very cheap, of course, and easy, for these groups to launch these kinds of drones in small rockets at U.S. bases and coalition bases across the region. Whereas, for the U.S. to conduct these very large strikes, obviously, it is a more significant action in terms of the implications for the wider regional tensions, and whether this will perhaps spiral and escalate even further. That is something that the U.S. says they are seeking to avoid, and they say that the strikes are for that reason very limited self-defense strikes. So, they say that they reserve the right, of course, to respond in the time and the place of their choosing. But look, the administration getting a lot of pushback from some Republicans, especially, who say they should be doing more. But again, the tensions are so high in the region right now, that they are choosing they say very specific targets to avoid things escalating and spiralling even further.",

No, we're not reading too much into thelanguage because the language reflects quite accurately a divergence of perception and a divergence of interests. The U.S. has asked repeatedly for what it calls humanitarian pauses or localized ceasefires. The U.S. never asked Israel for a general comprehensive ceasefire, both Secretary of State Blinken in Tokyo two days ago, and indeed President Biden himself, have made that clear, that anything, any ceasefire or anything that leaves Hamas with residual political power and some military capabilities is unacceptable. And so, Israel agrees with that. But in terms of the conduct of the war, the Americans are not clear on what Israel's vision of how long this would take. You know, the scope is understandable. The scope is visible of the operation. But how long it would take, also leads to the second question of the second issue that you raised and that is, okay, fine. You've done what you can. You've destroyed the Hamas. You've obliterated Hamas. You've degraded its military and eliminated its political power. Let's assume that is attainable. Then what? Who rules Gaza? And you take those two, the conduct and the longevity of the operation and visions or ideas of the contours of a future Gaza, and you see a clear divergence of interests.",

I mean, people in Gaza have seen things that you and I cannot even imagine, right? He wrote a whole CNN.com piece about the fact that he believes that Palestinian lives simply do not matter on the world stage.

That said, we all know that Hamas is controlling Gaza in a tyrannical way -- tyrannical way, that Hamas is essentially occupying Gaza and holding 2.2 million people hostages. So, something has to give. You have to understand the devastation and the shock and you know, the total dejection of October 7th hit very raw nerves here. And so, at this point, most Israelis, and I think Mr. Ron Ben Yishai in that footage that you showed a moment ago, referred to that. Most people are oblivious or indifferent to the Palestinian suffering. Now, take that into the international court of opinion. And yes, you know, I won't go as far as to say that Israel is shooting itself in the foot because what needs to be done needs to be done according to officials. But if Hamas' -- part of Hamas' strategic objective is to isolate Israel, expose Israel to a criticism and show Israel as excessively violent, unfortunately that is succeeding. And I say unfortunately because people tend to forget the horrific, barbaric carnage of October 7th. But yeah, going back to your point, I do agree with what he said. There is an indifference. I think that'll change in the next few days, partly because of domestic pressures and partly because of the Biden administration's requests and pressures.

Now, as for negotiations, you know, Israel will need to deal with a proposal once it's made. If there is a proposal, and I'm quoting what I read just like what I saw just like you did, if there's a proposal for a 24-hour ceasefire or 36-hour ceasefire or call it humanitarian pause to enable some kind of a hostages deal, whether it's two, 20, 22, or 100, the more the better, obviously, then I think Israel will take that very seriously. But as of now, if you look at the two trajectories, one is the negotiations in Qatar, among other places, and the second is the military operation, it's as if they are not synced. The military operation is going forward as if the hostages are, or the issue, negotiations on the hostages rather, is not taking place.

He has aligned himself squarely with the Republican Party. He has called his relations or his relations with Donald Trump cannot be better described than a bromance. He has alienated the vast majority of the Democratic Party, including, by the way, Joe Biden. The fact that Joe Biden, as president, as he calls himself or describes himself the first Zionist president, aligned himself so closely with Israel and is paying a domestic price. If you look at the polls, \"The New York Times\"- Siena Poll and the CNN Poll, and is paying a price, particularly among the younger voters, college age or just after college age, should be a factor that influences Israel when it comes to heeding Mr. Biden's, President Biden's advice. Look, 75 percent of American Jews have -- vote for Democrats as a pattern, on average since it was measured first in 1952. So, the Democratic Party's allegiance and alliance with Israel is as strong as it can be. That Israelis, particularly Mr. Netanyahu, aligned himself with the Republicans, basically replaced American Jews and Israel's interests with those of evangelicals is, you know, an issue for a different and a deeper program.

We're getting higher wages, higher minimum wages for these actors, better benefits, and also bonuses when it comes to streaming. But then there's also the artificial intelligence protections. That's really one of the key points in this new contract. So, many of the actors were extremely concerned about what AI could do to their work.
