That has always been my vision of our country and I know it's many of yours, to restore to soul of this nation, to rebuild the backbone of America, America's middle class, and to unite the country.

There are millions of other Americans who don't or are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with type 1 diabetes and needed this insulin to stay alive. Let's finish the job. Let's finish the job and close the loophole that allowed very wealthy avoided paying their taxes. We want to have the best educated workforce. Let's finish the job by providing access to pre-school for three and four years old. When police officers and police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable.

LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  White House officials are feeling pretty good this morning because they mostly feel like the president accomplished some of the main things that they wanted him to in last night's primetime address. Obviously, a big one is just getting the president to layout some of the strides that they believe the country has made over the last two years, whether it is the economy turning around in a big away, whether it is the COVID pandemic now being in the rearview mirror or the president really talking in great detail about some of the bipartisan legislative accomplishments over the last two years. We also know that White House officials really wanted the president to be able to reach out to constituents who feel invisible. We had some messaging that we know was catered towards the blue-collar rural workers, for example, and just people who generally -- across the country, who feel left behind. And then, of course, there was a forward-looking vision, sort of trying to lay out and make the case to the American people on why the country would be better off having two more years or even perhaps six more years of President Biden. Now, there were, of course, moments in the House chamber that got quite rowdy. I do not know that even White House officials might have anticipated just how rowdy the speech might in moments.

So, the pressure is going to grow as the investigations do as well. And on the floor last night, there was ample tension. Republican members calling out Joe Biden, heckling Biden, calling him a liar over his comments in saying that Republicans are pushing for cuts to entitlements, like social security and Medicare, even though Kevin McCarthy himself urged members not to have outbursts of sorts, worrying it would undercut their message coming out of the state of the union.

I think one of the things that really resonated, I know it resonated with you, but when he called out all of these different fees, saying it is $50 for your family to sit together on an airplane, just so you can your seats so your kids are with you, and these resort fees, those are actually all really relatable.
