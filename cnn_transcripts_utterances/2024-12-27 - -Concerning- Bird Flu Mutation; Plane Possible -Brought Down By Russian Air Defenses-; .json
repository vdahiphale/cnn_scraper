      "sentences": "Well, hopefully nothing. You know, what we've heard from the CDC about this is that the good news is it appears the virus mutated in the patient while they were in the hospital past the time they were potentially infectious to other people. They haven't been shown to have spread the virus to any other people. And it also doesn't appear that they picked it up from the flock of where they're suspected to have caught the virus. And so it's not thought that this version of the virus that essentially has mutations that make it better able potentially to infect our nose and throats, the upper respiratory tract of humans. They don't think that this is really floating around in the environment. So that's why I say hopefully nothing happens next and we don't start to see this spread between people.So far, as you noted, the CDC says we haven't seen person to person spread. We have seen 65 confirmed cases of bird flu among humans in the U.S. in this outbreak. And all of these have come from animals, most of them from dairy cattle, some from poultry flocks. Those farm workers, in both instances there, this one person picked it up from a backyard flock. And then there's two cases where we don't know the source of exposure. But because we're not seeing it spread between people as of now, that's why the CDC is saying the risk at this moment is low to most people.",

Thank you.Also joining us to discuss Dr. Peter Hotez, who's Dean of the School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and the author of Preventing the Next Pandemic Vaccine Diplomacy in a Time of Anti- science. Dr. Hotez, good to see you today as always. You know, I was struck by those comments too from Dr. Birx earlier this morning, saying that the U.S. has its head in the sand. She says essentially we're not testing enough when it comes to bird flu. But at the same time, you have the CDC saying, look, we haven't really seen human to human spread. You don't need to be that concerned about a public outbreak. How do we weigh all that information? Essentially, how concerned should we really be? DR. PETER HOTEZ, DEAN SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE, BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, the way I break it down is we need to be concerned, although the threat is probably not imminent. You know, as you've pointed out, there are two possible routes by which H5N1 avian flu could adapt to humans. And we could start seeing human to human transmission. Right now we're not there. The first possibility is that this virus undergoes mutation. And we know this virus is capable of that. There was a paper in Science magazine from the group at the Scripps Institute showing all it takes is a single mutation for H5N1 to bind to the human flu receptor. The same thing happened as a low frequency event in the virus that was in this woman in Louisiana. But that does not necessarily -- just because it's binding to the receptor doesn't necessarily mean we're going to see increased transmission. So that mutation may actually be the less likely route. The more greater concern that I've been reading about and hearing about and knowing what we know about influenza is the second mode, which was also mentioned in your report, that is reassortment. So imagine for instance, that a farm worker working -- working in dairy farms gets infected both with the H5N1 from cattle and simultaneously influence seasonal influenza, which likely will happen because we're going to start seeing the big increase in seasonal flu. There is that possibility of reassortment and that may be actually the greater danger. And so one of the things that I've been advocating for is for people to get their seasonal influenza vaccine. You should get it anyway. And I would recommend that regardless of anything that's happening with H5N1, because flu is a serious killer and causes a serious cause of morbidity mortality in the United States. But there's the potential that if that reassortment does happen, that seasonal flu could offer some partial protection for that new avian flu that's circulating around. So I think we've got to get that message out more. The other thing we're not doing right now is we need to be stockpiling H5N1 vaccine and starting to think about vaccinating our farm workers. They're already doing that in Finland. So there are a lot more steps that we could be taking right now that we're not. And I am concerned as we head deeper into the flu season.",

      "sentences": "And so I hear you on getting vaccinated, get that flu vaccine. That seems like a thing that people can go do today and is pretty simple to do. What else can people do to protect themselves? Again, reminding everyone we don't have human to human transmission at this point. And this is mostly infecting people who come in contact with these animals. But I think there are also questions from people out there. Can I drink milk? Can I eat chicken? Things like that.",

      "sentences": "You can certainly drink milk and eat chicken, but it needs to be pasteurized milk, not raw milk, because there is that risk of the viruses is in raw milk right now. And it's in raw milk in many areas of the country, particularly in California and elsewhere. But also other poultry products, chicken, eggs, you need to cook that at the specified temperature as well.So those are also important measures. And of course, the usual things to prevent you from getting seasonal flu, hand washing is going to be very important. And by the way, we still could see an uptick in COVID. So remember to keep up to date with your COVID immunizations and boosters. And we are also moving into RSV season, Respiratory Syncytial Virus season. And there's a vaccine for that too, for those who are eligible. So being mindful of that we are moving into respiratory virus season. There is that possible risk that avian flu could reassort with seasonal flu. Get your flu vaccine, I think is going to -- is probably one of the most straightforward things you can do right now.",

These two black box recorders will be crucial for investigators examining the evidence in order to figure out exactly what led to this plane crashing on Wednesday.They will be of course assessing the flight data recorded as well as potentially internal recordings within the cockpit. But according to authorities, it could take around two weeks for investigators to complete that assessment and examination. But of course there are a whole range of lines of inquiry that they will be looking at, at this stage, including damage to the aircraft. We've seen of course, video and images emerging showing the wreckage, the fuselage showing holes and perforations in parts of the plane's body. So that will certainly raise questions, particularly as many continue to speak speculate around shrapnel hits midair on this plane. And as you mentioned, we have been hearing from U.S. officials. Reuters has also heard from a number of unnamed sources familiar with the ongoing investigations suggesting that the plane may well have been downed by Russian anti-aircraft air defense systems. Now, it's important to underscore that as far as we understand at this stage, the plane crashed shortly after drone strikes hit parts of southern Russia. So there has been some concern around drone activity in the region, the potential for this aircraft to have been targeted by mistake in the midst of these drone strikes happening nearby. And of course, we've been hearing these reports now from the survivors. Remarkably, 29 people survived that crash and they have been discussing the terrifying final moments before the crash. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At this stage, Azerbaijan Airlines says, as you mentioned, that it believes that the plane was subject to external physical and technical interference. So that'll be something that investigators are looking at, at this stage. Azerbaijan Airlines has now canceled flights from its capital, Baku, to at least seven cities in Russia, potentially as a result of the concerns surrounding nearby drone activity and the safety precautions needed to operate in this particular region.And we are learning, of course, that both survivors and the family members of those that have been killed are now being offered compensation by the authorities. But again, many will be waiting to hear those firm and clear answers as to what led to this crash. That investigation could take several more days, if not weeks for a final answer to be ascertained.

The Russian economy is on a war footing with regard to the production of arms and ammunition. So they're very focused there.And I think what's happening on the ground is if you're in these border towns, whether it's southern Russia, where this happened in the Caucasus, or between the line of path between Ukraine and Moscow, you've seen over what, two years now, you've seen a variety of Ukrainian drone attacks against Russia. So if you're an air defense gunner in Russia somewhere, you're nervous, you're concerned about missing a target that may attack the motherland, Russia. And so I think you have antsy soldiers manning these systems, not wanting to make a mistake in terms of allowing enemy drone to pass through. And I think they're -- they're taking shots at aircraft. In this case, we do know, or we believe at least that there was electronic warfare taking place where the Russians were jamming the GPS system of this aircraft. And we also know that there was fog in the area. That's what prevented the aircraft from landing the first time. So now you have plausibly, Russian air defense gunners shooting at radar targets that they can't visually verify shooting up in the air. And again, that concerns me for any type of commercial aircraft flying in and out or through Russia, for that matter.",

JAKE AUCHINCLOSS, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: There are two shipping companies domiciled in Hong Kong that have a presence at the Panama Canal Zone. No evidence that I have seen that that represents a security threat to the United States. I actually, 10 years ago, commanded a combined riverine training team. It combines Colombian and U.S. special operators to train the Panamanian public forces and how to do patrols on the Panama Canal Zone. And I found the Panamanians to be professional, to be pro-American. These are our allies. The world, Jessica, is complicated enough without picking fights with our friends. I would really encourage President Trump to look at the two hot wars that we've got to handle right now, one in Ukraine, one in the Middle East, and ensure that we are supporting Ukraine to unconditional victory and that we are supporting Israel now that it has the upper hand against Iran.",
