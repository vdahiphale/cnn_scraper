Any doctor you speak to, any emergency room doctor, will talk to you about why this is such an urgent issue, and yet there is very -- not only very little action, but not as much discussion.

As you heard in that byte, he said - in that sound byte where he said 2 percent. I can show you the charts from this week. The positive inflation news from this week. You don't have 2 percent CPI. You're still double that. PPI yesterday fell to 1.1 percent, but some of the core numbers that he's looking at are still a little higher. So, you can see, inflation has moderated, but he's worried that parts of the inflation story are sticky, as economists say, and will be harder to root out. So, a pause after ten rate hikes. What it means for consumers is, you know, credit card rates probably won't rise from here. Mortgage rates may be stabilized here. And of those rates that are based on - on the Fed Federal Funds Rate, they're not - they're not going to rise for now, but they probably will rise later on this year.",
