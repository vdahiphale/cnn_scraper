It's on the grounds of Gaza's largest hospital, which has been under siege for days amid growing outrage. Now, CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of this Israeli military video, which also shows a nearby building from the Al-Shifa complex.The Israel Defense Forces have faced mounting pressure to justify their raid on the hospital, which Israel says conceals what it called a Hamas terror headquarters and tunnel network. So far, the proof that Israel has called concrete has been less than overwhelming. But the IDF insists more evidence is coming and that it is carrying out a careful operation that could take weeks. The army also releasing images of weapons it says were found at the hospital complex. Hamas has repeatedly denied using Al-Shifa as a command-and-control center, calling the claims from Israel and the U.S. baseless lies, fabricated narratives, and distorted information. The United Nations Human Rights Chief called on Israel to grant international investigators access to Gaza to investigate the competing claims about the hospital. Meanwhile, the Israeli army says troops recovered the body of a 65- year-old Israeli grandmother near the hospital. She had been kidnapped during the Hamas rampage on October 7th. No details were released on how she died. The Israeli Prime Minister telling CBS, it's possible other hostages were held at Al-Shifa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks so much, Doctor.The World Food Programme has spoken of what they call \"the immediate possibility of starvation because of food shortages and distribution issues.\" How dire is that food situation? DR. RANA HAJJEH, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION REGIONAL OFFICE OF EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN:  Yes. Good evening, Mike. The situation is really catastrophic. Extremely, extremely dire from food, from water, from overall health situation. We have not been able to get much supplies to Northern Gaza in terms of either food supplies or medical supplies. As you just mentioned, the communication, we've been getting some. We have an office in West Bank, and we've been getting some information about how bad the situation. We do not have, right now, staff on the ground in Shifa, but they are able to communicate with them whenever we can have some network connections. In Shifa, in particular, from the patients -- I mean, we have already lost about 40 patients. Three of the babies that we know of. 35 premature babies are still hanging onto life as far as we know. But also, many other patients who were on life support also machines in ICUs and others could not survive because of the lack off of power. So, I mean, whether it's food, whether it's water, they don't have access to clean water, which, of course, you know, they can die from hunger and thirst, but also, all the issues related to very poor hygiene and the spread of severe infections in these areas.",

That's 24 of them. And that is extraordinary when it comes to trying to help the wounded.DR. HAJJEH:  Yes. Shifa in particular, the information we have, because Shifa is a complex. There are multiple buildings. And even if people try to move between buildings, they are attacked. So, there are wounded people on the ground. We have seen this before. I mean, even people who were ordered to evacuate on their way from North Gaza to South Gaza have reported many, many dead people on the way. But all the health care in North Gaza, which is actually the majority, 60 percent of hospitals in Gaza, were actually in the north. So, the few south ones that are also still functioning are partially functioning and they cannot, you know, manage the significant burden. But it's a humanitarian catastrophe.",

How dismayed, how disheartened are you at the inability of the world to deal with what guards and civilians are facing in the humanitarian sense and be able to effectively help them? How frustrating is that?DR. HAJJEH:  It's beyond what words can describe, as a humanitarian and as a public health professional. It pains me. It pains all of us to see what people in Gaza, just civilians, innocent civilians, babies, women, children are -- have to go through. And we have condemned repeatedly. We have called for stop of ceasefires, at least a humanitarian pauses since the beginning of the crisis. All our calls have gone to deaf ears. It is -- I really -- I mean, I've been through many emergencies through my career in the region, we have never seen anything like that where we have become completely desensitized to the suffering of human beings who are just like us, like our children, like our relatives, our parents. And we just call, yet again, on the International Community to please look and listen and listen to all these people who are suffering. Make sure they have access to supplies. We do have supplies.

He's got a struggling economy. The housing market is in crisis, record unemployment. So, really, what we have seen in some of these meetings for Xi Jinping is a pitch for more investment to come into his country. Now, he also on Thursday met with Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida. We have heard from the Japanese side, of course, there are some historical issues between these two countries, and from the Japanese side, they have said that Fumio Kishida did express serious concerns about increasing military activity near Japan and also collaboration with Russia, pointing out as well that they have said that a free and open Taiwan Strait is important, not just for Japan, but also for the rest of the region. This is, of course, an issue that President Biden and Xi Jinping spoke about as well, during their meeting, the issue of Taiwan.

Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms. Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr. Combs' reputation. and seeking a pay day.\" The next step in all this, the defense, Mr. Combs, will be filing an answer to the very serious allegations in this complaint.
