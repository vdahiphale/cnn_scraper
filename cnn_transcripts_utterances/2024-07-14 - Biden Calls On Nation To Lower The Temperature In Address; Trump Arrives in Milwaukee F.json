(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: a former president was shot, an American citizen killed while simply exercising his freedom to support the candidate of his choosing. We cannot, we must not go down this road in America. The political record in this country has gotten very heated. It's time to cool it down. We all have a responsibility to do that.

The FBI says that the 20-year-old gunman appears to have acted alone. They are still investigating and say that he did have crude explosives in his car and are also looking into whether or not this was an act of domestic terrorism. I want to get right to our CNN team here on the ground in Milwaukee, Audie Cornish, Dana Bash, Jonah Goldberg, Van Jones, and Scott Jennings, all here listening to that address from President Biden tonight.

And I was proud of him taking on it.And to your point, we've been moving this direction for a while. 2011, you had a Gabby Giffords shot. She survived barely. 2017, Steve Scalise, a Republican, gets shot. 2020, you have Gretchen, our governor from Michigan, almost kidnapped. January 6th, maybe you hang the vice president. 2022, you've got Paul Pelosi. Don't forget, you also had real fears about what's going to happen to Kavanaugh. And then also then you get to 2024, you have this. This is an exponentially rising curve of political violence being normalized. And so Donald Trump dodged a bullet, but he did not blame one. America dodged a bullet last night. America dodged a bullet, because if that thing had been a quarter inch over, you would have had an assassination. And then I don't know how this country comes back from that because half the country would have felt that the other half of the country took their leader. And if only a small percentage of those people felt that means we're in a war, you have millions of people ready to do -- to shoot back. And so I was proud of Biden. I thought his tone was right.

And a few days later, it's time to put Donald Trump in the bull's eye.Now, if the president United States had said, I bear some responsibility here and I'm going to do my part, this would have been a home run. He didn't do that. Instead, he spread it all around, which I guess is as far as he's willing to go. But let me tell you how Republicans are going to take that. They're going to take that as a president who has repeatedly said, I want to heal the soul of the nation and the buck stops here, but with an unwillingness to acknowledge some of the things that he has said to bring us to a place that he says we're in. So, I'm not -- look, let me stipulate two things. I'm praying for Joe Biden. I have been since the debate. We got to do better.

Obviously, if you're familiar with these rallies, they have an outer perimeter, a middle perimeter, an inner perimeter. That's just the stage where Donald Trump himself usually is with agents around him. But outside of that, where the shooter was, it's about 120, maybe 130 yards from the lectern.

That information was related to the Secret Service, but it's not just on the Secret Service. What about the officers that were closest by to? Who reached out and actually tried to put their hands on this guy to find out who he was? He never should have been able to get on a rooftop. Supposedly, this was identified and hopefully was identified a few days before, as they began to look at the location where the rally was going to be held. You know you've got a building there. You know you've got the possibility of somebody getting high ground and being able to take a shot, should they choose to do so. You have to pay attention to these things. Did they use drones?

And the press conference today, I watched it and I don't know what the goal was, but if it was to reassure the public that, you know, they've got this and that they'll make whatever changes they have to make and that security is going to be enhanced. They failed at it because they just didn't say anything.I mean, someone from headquarters, in my opinion, should have been there, or at least given permission to the coordinator to be able to at least say, we had -- the incident that occurred last night is under investigation. We're going to take a deep dive into it. We'll make whatever adjustments we have to make to make sure this doesn't happen again and so forth and so on. They didn't even do that. You know, in fact, there's my understanding that the prior to the press conference, one of the people said, told the members of the press, don't ask me a question about last night. Well, what do you think the press is going to do? That's going to be the first question they ask. You have to be out front and you have to address this. You can't hide from it. Bad news doesn't get better over time.",
