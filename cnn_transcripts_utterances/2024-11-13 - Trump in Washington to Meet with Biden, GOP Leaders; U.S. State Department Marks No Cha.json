Trump meeting with Republican House members this hour. After that, he will sit down with President Joe Biden. It's traditional for the incoming and outgoing presidents to meet. And Mr. Trump declined to do so when he handed off to Mr. Biden. Melania Trump skipping a meeting with Jill Biden, someone who was on the plane with Donald Trump when he landed just moments ago with Elon Musk, who got his role in the new Trump administration. CNN's Arlette Saenz connecting us from the U.S. Capitol. And it will be, I'm sure, described by Trump's campaign as a triumphant return to the Capitol. This is his first stop in Washington since he won the election. What can we expect today, starting with his meeting with Biden, in an hour's time?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly the Trump side is painting this as a victorious return to the White House after he had beenousted by voters back in 2020. And President Biden and president-elect Donald Trump will sit down in the Oval Office face to face around 11 am, in just one hour from now. And it comes at a very contentious time in the country. You have had President Biden really trying to stress that he is committed to having this peaceful transfer of power to Trump. And this meeting is a key portion of that, a symbolic moment, as Biden is now grappling with the reality that the man that he had beat back in 2020 is now going to return to the White House after voters made that decision in the election last Tuesday. Now this has the potential to be a quite awkward meeting. Of course, Biden and Trump have gone after each other for years now, including in this campaign, as Biden had initially been seeking reelection before that halting debate performance about Trump, which really derailed his bid for a second term. But it appears for the time being, Biden is trying to put those hard feelings about Trump aside as he is trying to show to the country that he is committed to this transfer of power. Now it is interesting to think about where this meeting will take place. The two men will be face to face for the most substantive time since that debate. And they will be sitting in the Oval Office just a few feet away from the dining room, the private dining room for the president, where then president Trump watched the January 6th insurrection unfold. That is something that Biden himself has oftentimes pointed to as an example of how he believes that Trump is a direct threat to democracy. It's unlikely Biden is going to engage in any of that type of language today. Officials have been very closely guarding what will be on the agenda but we do know that they are expected to talk about domestic and foreign policy issues, including Biden's belief that the U.S. should continue to give aid to Ukraine beyond his presidency. That comes at a time when Trump has really cast doubt about the future support for Ukraine going forward. So this meeting will be a very significant one for Biden, who, personally, up until a few weeks ago, had confided in some that he believed he could still beat Trump in this election. And now he is facing this reality that Trump will be returning to the White House. It certainly is expected to be an emotional day also for staffers. But we're told that, really, they've been taking their directives from the president, that this is going to be a professional day as he welcomes Trump to the White House. And so we will see how this all unfolds in a little bit over an hour.",

This is happening now. Trump -- I'm sorry. This is at the Hyatt, of course, in Washington, where he is meeting House Republicans. Both the Senate and the House looking to vote in new leaders today. So let's just have a listen to the president-elect. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT:  So you know, we had like historic kind of numbers, especially for the president. But we won't get into that. But the House did very well. And I think we're responsible for 31, helping you with 31, meaning we could have lost by quite a bit. And we ended up, I guess you'll be five up.

So I just want to thank everybody. You've been incredible. We worked with a lot of you to get you in. And you helped me and you helped me, too, and my numbers were, so they say, the -- 129 years, the most important election in 129 years. That's pretty good. I said, who is the 129 years? What was that dark Ronnie? What was, who was the 129 years ago? I never looked because it started at being 100. And then they upped it to that. But it's a great compliment. We won the majority by 7.1 million. We won, which is great, because Republicans aren't supposed to be winning the majority, Marjorie. You know that, right? And we won that. And we won it every, every way, all seven swing states by a lot. And Michigan was great. Couldn't be better. I'll tell you, Michigan was great. And, we had a couple of people -- almost New Jersey is right. Just a few points. It's got them very worried because they say, well, next time, if we go up even a fraction of what we went up, you're going to win New York, you're going to win New Jersey, you're going to win places that weren't winnable.

And when I spoke with people who are familiar with what he was going to tell the group this morning, they told me that, yes, he wanted to, you know, praise his win, to talk about his win but also to really try to remind them that, in his mind, as your other guest just said, in his mind, he has a mandate. He believes that he is going to win the popular vote. There are still millions of votes that are being counted. But he believes that the -- if he wins the popular vote, that means that he really has the American people on his side to carry out his agenda. And what he's supposed to, what he's planning to tell House Republicans this morning, I'm told, is that they should do that as well. That they should, you know, be taking cues from him, that they need to be a unified party, that he wants to hit the ground running as soon as he is sworn in in January and that he needs all of the Republicans in Washington to be at his back. Now, one other thing I was told is that he's likely to walk them through his different cabinet positions. Some of the decisions that he has made, obviously, overnight, we saw in the last 24 hours him announce a flurry of new hires. And one other thing I'll note as well is who he traveled with today. First of all, we know Elon Musk has been a huge influence on Donald Trump, particularly in the last few weeks. I was told by two Trump advisers that Musk traveled with him on his plane this morning from Palm Beach, came here to D.C. with him and is intending that meeting with him right now with House Republicans. Now, of course, there's another meeting today, where Donald Trump will be face to face with Joe Biden, the first time since they faced off at that debate in June. I am told Musk is not accompanying Donald Trump to that meeting. But, of course, he is a very unpredictable man. Things can change.

They know what number of trucks they are coordinating and what they're being able to bring into the Gaza Strip. But they don't know what the other organizations are doing. The only body that has the ability to look at it holistically is COGAT. We have representatives at all five crossings, who see what is going into the Gaza Strip. We are also the ones who are coordinating the movements. And so we know what is going in and that is based on that information. We are able to present our numbers and to stand behind our assessment.",

The time in New York, ofcourse -- not New York, Washington is 10:36, 10:37 in the morning. Well, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump is back in Washington this hour. He landed a short time ago, accompanied by the world's richest person, Elon Musk. The billionaire joining the president-elect for some of the day's meetings. However, CNN is told he is not expected to accompany the president-elect to his meeting with President Joe Biden later today. Trump just named Musk and the conservative politician and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new department aimed at trimming the federal budget. Well, let's stay on this. Tyler Pager is a White House reporter for \"The Washington Post.\" Doug Heye is a Republican strategist and a former Republican National Committee communications director. That's a title and a half, isn't it? Doug, thanks for -- to both of you for joining us. Let's start with you, Doug. What do you make of these two very significant announcements, these picks? Elon Musk, world's richest man, and Vivek to lead what is we will all get to know as a department known as DOGE. (CROSSTALK)",

It caught a lot of peopleby surprise last night and in part not because Vivek was in was in the mix or Elon Musk is obviously been everywhere on Mar-a-Lago and now Washington. But this isn't a government body that existed until last night. And we'll actually see if it fully exists. And so there are a lot of questions about what this will be and then what will be the mission of this organization. And how deep will it go into specific cuts and streamlining of services, of which Republicans and Democrats should be able to applaud in a bipartisan way? Or does it get to just rhetoric without, you know, real substance behind it? And one of the things that makes me slightly nervous about this, if you're talking about streamlining and reducing waste, having co-chairs of a committee to do so suggests that maybe we're not streamlining this. This should be a one person at the top, maybe not two. (LAUGHTER)",

Trump's grandchild, you know, saying that he has achieved uncle status. Elon has been sort of bopping around Mar-a-Lago with his son. It is very clear that he is enmeshing himself in Trump's inner circle, sitting in on phone calls and meetings. I think the question becomes, once Trump moves to the White House, Elon has a lot of business interests that he's involved in -- SpaceX -- you know, there's a whole lot of things that Elon -- X formerly known as Twitter -- that Elon Musk does outside of government. So I think it's an open question right now of what his role looks like once Trump takes office. But it is very clear he is deeply engaged in this transition process and enmeshing himself in Trump's not just inner circle, in his family life as well.",

Anybody who goes into any senior sort of level of government, whether it's in the Congress or the administration,certainly Supreme Court, you have very real financial disclosures that you have to make and very real limits on what you're able to accept as a gift, what you're -- what you have to refuse. I've dealt with it a whole lot in my career and it can be maddening paperwork but it's there for a reason. That this organization is going to operate outside of government, it looks like, means that that transparency isn't necessarily there. And that means there are going to be a lot of questions, not just today but moving forward. And I think one of the one of the challenges here, Becky, is I've seen this for 20 years now. If you go to a department, whether it's the Department of Treasury or the Small Business Administration, and say we need you to cut 1 percent of your budget, they scream and howl and say we can't do it. We can't do it. And that answer has not been good enough for the American people. It's something that Donald Trump has been able to take advantage of. So rhetorically, Musk and Vivek here are in a place where the American people are, by and large, going to agree with them. The devil will be in the details. And what actually then they want to cut, on the 30,000 foot level, they may be in a strong position. As you dig down that's where it gets a bit more challenging.",
