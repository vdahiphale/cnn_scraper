She may want to make a last political stand in '24 in South Carolina.But let's say she surprises in South Carolina. Remember, you know, Newt Gingrich surprised everybody in 2012 in South Carolina. Then - then it becomes a real race coming into Super Tuesday. But - but the money's there for Nikki Haley. And the money is there because people really know the danger of Donald Trump. They know that he's a threat to the institutions of the American democracy. Most of that money is from patriots. They're taking a position that they're patriots first and partisans second. And they don't want Donald Trump. And - and, by the way, you know, if you look at the people that have worked for Donald Trump, if they're not politically motivated, they've been extremely honest about his behavior and his lack of executive capabilities.",

So, we haven't even reached the beginning of last cycle's primary season beginning. So, we still have a long way to go. And, all right, obviously Nikki Haley is still involved in this race. South Carolina doesn't occur until February 24th. Let's just say for whatever reason she decided to get out at that point. The earliest that a primary season has ended since 1972 was March 9th in 2000 when Bill Bradley and John McCain decided to leave their respective party races. So, that's the earliest. That's what we're potentially looking at. The average since 1972 is late April. So, we are way before that.

That is where Donald Trump just left moments ago. He's headed to the courthouse. On your right, that is E. Jean Carroll arriving at the courthouse for her defamation lawsuit against the former president. We're waiting to find out if Trump himself will take the stand and testify today. Court is expected to resume in less than an hour. It was adjourned for a couple of days because of a sick juror. Also this morning, new details about the House Ethics Committee investigation into Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz. According to a source familiar with the committee's work, they've reached out to the woman who Gaetz allegedly had sexual relations with when she was 17- years-old, so a minor, something he has not been charged with and has repeatedly denied.",

Of course the most notable is this woman who was still 17 when she allegedly had sex with the congressman.Now, you may remember, the Justice Department investigated the congressman for several years. The investigation actually began until Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr. And it started out with these allegations about sex with a minor. But then it expanded to look at potential sex trafficking, obstruction of justice, lobbying violations. But the probe ended last year. We actually broke the news that they were not going to charge him. So, it is significant that now the House Ethics Committee wants to go back and potentially try to review the Justice Department's decision and get access to some of the evidence they had. Now, I will note, the congressman continues to deny these allegations and in a statement he said, look, \"this is not true, this has never been true. And those who spread those lies have been exposed, indicted, and imprisoned.\" There he is likely referring to his long- time friend and colleague, Joel Greenberg, who is in prison.

And Gaetz told people privately that he believed this was the fault of then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He couldn't believe that he allowed this to go forward. Now, Kevin McCarthy has publicly said he believes Gaetz's frustration over the ethics probe is a large part of why backed Gaetz backed that effort to push McCarthy out of the speakership.

So, to most people you'd think, oh, probably not worth it. I don't have much to offer. But really what he wants to get out of this, his return on investment is really getting into any kind of conflict with the judge.Now, so far they've really had to work hard to manufacture drama here. There's no big constitutional question, right? Instead, he's getting in trouble for not following basic rules that all of us would have to follow if we're in federal court. Don't be disruptive when a witness is talking. If you're a lawyer, you have to follow the federal rules of evidence, Alina Habba. But Trump and his attorney, Alina Habba, they have both repeatedly sparred with the judge over the basic rules that everyone else follows. They then run outside the courtroom and say, this is so unfair. This judge is so biased.

But it's unclear if Jack Smith is going to be able to bring either one of his cases. We thought that the federal election subversion case would be the first one to go. It was scheduled for March. But right now they're litigating larger questions about whether Trump has immunity. Legal experts don't expect he's going to prevail on those questions, but he absolutely has the right to litigate those. Right now we're waiting for the court of appeals to give us an answer. Then it could go to SCOTUS. And as important as the answer to that question is, the timing is even more important.

Yesterday, Smith's team received two legal rejections, one from the Supreme Court, who denied blocking the execution, and then one from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals that not only denied blocking an injunction but also on the substance of their legal claims. So now Smith's team has gone to the Supreme Court, appealed, asking them to look at the actual substance of their cruel and unusual punishment claim. Still, Poppy, that does not appear to be highly likely that they will grant appeal having been that the Supreme Court has already denied a temporary stay before. But that's still an open avenue for them. Then there's also the governor, Governor Kay Ivy, who has the authority to grant Smith clemency, although she has said that she does not plan to do that. So, that is two last-minute options right here for Smith. Now, in term of how the execution will work, I've been looking through the state of Alabama's execution procedures, a lot of it redacted just like you see here. And what we can expect is for Smith to be strapped into a gurney, a mask - a five-point mask to be put on him. The warden will read the death warrant, allow him to speak to make a final statement for up to two minutes, and then that mask will pump 100 percent nitrogen gas in. And they will be pumping that until he is deprived of oxygen until death. Poppy.",
