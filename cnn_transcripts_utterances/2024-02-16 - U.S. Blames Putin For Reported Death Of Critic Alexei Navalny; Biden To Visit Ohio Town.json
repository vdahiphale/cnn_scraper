And of course, as you say, it's come to the moment when Tucker Carlson, reminiscent of people went to the Soviet Union in the 1930s, Americans and said they'd in the future and it worked, is praising this country where President Trump has said, Russia can do anything at cancel.So I think that the Kremlin is realizing that it will have people even in the United States who are not going to criticize them for Navalny's death and will brush it off. So I think it's a real moment where, hopefully, the Biden administration will take action. I would just caution, of course, that we have two American journalists, including Evan Gershkovich, who are imprisoned. We have Paul Whelan, the ex-Marine. We have a teacher from the now-closed American School in Moscow. We have Americans who are in prison in Russia and who we're trying to get out. And so I think this will be a very delicate balance for the Biden ministration as they react to Navalny's death.",

We can clearly prevent other Russian officials from traveling here, but we've already done that with most of them. So our options are less limited.",

But what they really have to do is to reach the people inside Russia. So we have seen today queues of Russians presenting flowers to a monument to victims of the gulag in Navalny's name with an official -- this is in Moscow -- barking at them and telling them to move on. In other cities, they've already turned people away who tried to lay flowers or arrested them. So this shows you the struggle to continue the work inside Russia because of the repression there. And because the Kremlin won't brook any opposition. And Putin wants to ride into glory with his so-called election in March with 80 percent of the vote and an adoring public. So it will be a challenge to carry on this work, but I'm sure that his followers and his family in exile will continue to do it.",

And for a time, folks were wondering whether or not the president would show up. Now that he's finally here, some -- some are saying, why at this point? What took so long? It just -- we were in the center of town just a short while ago, a number of Trump supporters were there. They'd gathered voicing their opposition to President Biden coming at this time. But still, we've spoken to residents who say, now that the president is coming here to East Palestine, the focus should be on helping the community. What they're looking for is long-term health monitoring. They're also looking for some sort of program to make sure that economically this town is looked out for in the long run as well. And of course, has been a lot of talk, Boris, about why the Railway Safety Act, which received bipartisan support to -- in the wake of this train derailment -- why it's still has not been passed, why it's stuck in Congress? I spoke to the transportation secretary about that to get his insight. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But so far, they have yet to find what they went looking for inside that hospital.And that is the bodies of hostages that they acted on credible -- the Israeli military says they acted on credible intelligence that they were there. And that was their reason for going into a hospital, which can only happen under extraordinary circumstances under international law. Now, what the Israeli military says that they did find is they say that they detained over 20 suspects on the grounds of the hospital that they say were involved in the October 7th attack. They also say that they found weapons, releasing photos of mortar shells, and a case of ammunition that we could not independently verify where or when that photo was taken. Now, the Ministry of Health in Gaza is saying that, as a result of these operations and the damage to the hospital, the cuts in power and in oxygen supplies, that five patients have now died because of a failure in the power generators and oxygen supplies at that hospital. They also say -- the World Health Organization is now saying that they are coordinating with the Israeli government, urgently seeking access to the hospital, calling the situation they're deeply alarming. And all of this is happening as there are still questions about this potential ground offensive in Rafah. I met today with the Israeli defense minister who held a briefing for reporters. It was clear that there is still no fleshed-out plan for evacuations from Rafah. But what he did say is that Israel has, quote, \"no intention of sending Palestinians into Egypt,\" which is a question that's been raised in recent days.",
