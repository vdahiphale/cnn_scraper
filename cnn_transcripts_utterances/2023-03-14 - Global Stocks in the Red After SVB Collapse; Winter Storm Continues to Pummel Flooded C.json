European markets were down, the main one some 3 percent yesterday. I think that we can take a look how they are opening this hour.  It looks like we haven't got the new number yet but we can check back on that.But I can tell you that in Asia we did see some fallout, particularly in Japan where the Nikkei was dragged down by some of the country's biggest banks which we saw a sharp falls in the region of some 7 percent. In some cases now, this is not about to deposit. This is not about a run on Japanese banks. This is about the situation that got SVB into the situation that it ended up in its huge interest rate hedge. Japan is also a major holder of U.S. government treasuries and those big banks in Japan are now having to reprice their estimation of where there is treasury yielded should have come up sharply in the past couple of years. Its interest rates have risen of where they are going to go in the future. Now, the questions are being raised and markets are pricing and perhaps a slower path of interest rate rises from the front. This is a macroeconomic issue that we are not dealing with alongside the banking issue in the United States. And speaking of interest rate in the Feds today -- in the U.S. rather today, we'll bring U.S. CPI inflation number, a key part, obviously, of the calculus for the Federal Reserve. That will be closely watched and could bring some more marketable volatility. I think we can look at U.S. futures they're coming up a little bit today, not too much volatility.

Out west, the Golden State was already dealing with major flooding. Some 30 million people across California are under flood watches. And on the other side of the country, a major nor'easter is expected to cover New England and parts of New York in snow. Millions of people were under winter alerts ahead of the storm. Days ago, U.S. President Joe Biden declared a state of emergency in more than 30 California counties. That includes Monterey County on the central coast where officials are warning that rising waters from the Salinas River could cut off the Monterrey peninsula from the west of the state. [03:05:01] Some 5,000 residents there were under evacuation alerts on Monday, and that number could rise. In Massachusetts, a local energy official says wind is among the biggest threats to residents of the state. Boston is under a winter weather advisory beginning a few hours from now. In New Jersey, the government declared a State of Emergency in five counties, which could receive significant snowfall. The back-end of the storm could bring potentially damaging wind gusts from today into Wednesday with possible power outages. A state police official has urged residents to stay off the roads.

Most of the rain concentrating from Central to Northern California, but this is expected to pick up later on into the morning and especially through the afternoon, one to two inches possible, widespread, isolated higher amounts. If you look at the legend there, the yellow and orange, you'll see it in Northern California and especially along the southern coastline. We could pick up four to six inches of rain through Wednesday, part of the reason why we still have a moderate risk for flooding especially on the northern coastline Monday overnight. But into Tuesday, we have the high risk of the southern foothills in that fuchsia color, and along the southern coastline of California, as well.So these are areas that are most vulnerable, especially as we get up to 5,000 feet or lower. When we get all of this rain to push on the shore, which is expected Tuesday morning 6 o'clock local time, and then that's on top of the melting snow. So, we have catastrophic flooding within these locations. The rain doesn't really taper back until we get into, let's say, Wednesday as it starts to push farther east. So, all of Tuesday, we'll be going to be inundated with rain. Now, that first A.R. that happened earlier on, all that moisture has tied in with this nor'easter that's really starting to work its way in. Some of that heavier snow already falling in the interior New England, like the Berkshires. This is just going to be an ongoing process, through the morning and into the afternoon, where the heaviest snow expected through the Catskills as well as the Adirondaks. And these are areas that can be picked up to two to three feet of snow, and some of the snowfall rates expected two to three inches per hour. So, widespread power outages is a possibility with that heavy, wet snow, tying in with wind gusts of 40 to 60 miles per hour into Tuesday afternoon. And that shifts further north as we roll into Wednesday. So it's an ongoing situation over the next 24 hours where we are expected to be dealing with travel concerns. We're already starting to see delays in places like Boston and the airports. So, if you're traveling, it's one of the things to keep an eye out for, the delays, and I'd say just stay indoors, if you can Rosemary.",

It's just a wrapped up a huge political event, the National People's Congress, with the president vowing to build the Chinese military into a Great Wall of Steel. Meanwhile, China has been playing mediator in the Middle East while building stronger ties with Russia, and taking swipes at the United States.CNN's Selina Wang explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Chinese leader Xi Jinping vows to build the country's military into a Great Wall of Steel in his first speech of his unprecedented third term as President. But the biggest applause from the rubber-stamp parliament came after Xi repeated the pledge to unite Taiwan with the motherland. It marks the end of a week long political meeting that saw Xi further consolidate his power and drive home how China needs to fortify itself against America's campaign to contain the country. Less than a day after the speech, U.S. President Joe Biden hosting British and Australian leaders to discuss details of the new AUKUS defense pact that is seen as a bid to counter China in the pacific. China's new foreign minister Qin Gang has accused Washington of plotting an Asia-Pacific version of NATO, and called America's China strategy a reckless gamble. But Li Qiang tried striking a more conciliatory tone in his first press conference as premier, China's number two official. Li said that U.S. And China decoupling is hype, pointing out that trade between the two countries reached a record high last year. One of Xi's most trusted proteges, Li is the former Shanghai Party boss that oversaw the city's brutal two-month COVID lockdown last spring. He tried downplaying Beijing's crackdown on tech and private businesses, calling on officials to support private sector growth. But Li steps into premiership with a tough road ahead, the economy, still battered after three years of tough COVID restrictions, U.S. sanctions, and deteriorating diplomatic relations with the west. But China's economic and political powers are growing elsewhere. Beijing hosted talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran that led to a breakthrough. The two nations agree to bury the hatchet and restore ties. It's a geopolitical win amid growing concerns of Beijing's deepening ties with Russia, and refusal to call the conflict in Ukraine an invasion.",
