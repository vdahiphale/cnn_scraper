      "sentences": "Well, Erica, I don't know how much you've played around with some of these AI chatbots, but they can already do pretty incredible things, right? Things that we thought only humans could do. They can generate artwork and craft song lyrics. They can even write news articles like the one I wrote on this very topic.So it's awe-inspiring, but from the perspective of an employee, it's also kind of scary. So this report shows that White House officials, they are thinking deeply about what AI means for the workforce. And for good reason because like all technologies, AI is going to help some workers and it's going to hurt some others. And what they found is that 20 percent of U.S. workers are in jobs right now that have high exposure to AI. These are the ones who are going to have the biggest impact, either positive or negative. Now, to drill down further about who's really vulnerable though, they look to see how complex those tasks are. With the thinking that the more complex the job is, the harder it is for a robot to replace a human. And they found that 10 percent of U.S. workers are in jobs that have both high AI exposure and low complexity. So these are the ones really most at risk here. And I talked to Jared Bernstein, the White House economist, and he rejected the notion that all of those jobs are going to go away because of AI. He said, that's just not the way technology or automation work. A White House economist, they point out that humans still fly planes, even though we've had autopilot for a century now. Still though, Erica, I think it's clear that some jobs are going to be negatively impacted by AI.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. And there were some interesting findings on that front.First on education. Researchers found that workers with less education are more negatively exposed to some of these AI risks. You see 14 percent of workers who have a high school graduation and a diploma, no more than that, they're most exposed. That compares to 6 percent of workers who have a bachelor's degree or more. Similarly, workers in the lower middle income brackets, they are more exposed here as well. And so that does raise some inequality concerns. The report they wrote quote: AI could exacerbate aggregate income inequality if it substitutes for employment in lower wage jobs and complements higher wage jobs. We've heard a similar warning from the IMF recently, as well. Another White House stresses, it's too early to say that AI is definitely going to worsen inequality, in part because that very risk should inform policy. And Jared Bernstein, he told me, listen, the Biden administration is not going to let technology worsen inequality. But Erica, I would just stress that AI, it's moving fast, really fast. And at the end of the day, I don't really think anyone truly knows how this is going to play out, not even Chad GPT.",

The 11th letter is K, Aryan Knights.And that he was taken to the hospital, as we said, for self injuries. They escaped together in a gray Honda Civic, a 2020 gray Honda Civic. And about his alleged accomplice, there is now a warrant out for Nicholas Umphenour, a warrant of $2 million bond, and that is for aggravated battery against law enforcement and aiding and abetting an escape.

Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And you hear the bell there. We're starting with breaking news in our Money Lead. The Dow closing right now at a record high. 39,780 points plus. Almost 40,000 for the first time in the Dow's 128- year history. The market soaring today after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates the same yesterday and signaled that the U.S. will get three rate cuts this year. Let's get straight to CNN business anchor Julia Chatterley and Diane Swonk, the chief economist for KPMG. Good to see both of you. Julia, how significant is this milestone? JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR, FIRST MOVE: Well, this is definitely going to be a Dow wow moment when we get to 40K. I remember vividly sitting here, if you remember in March of 2020, when we were talking about the Dow flirting with 19,000. Now we're talking about 40K in the space of four years. So I will be enthusiastic about it, but I'll also curb that and say for investors, and that's 60 percent of Americans, by the way, it's the gains that got us here that's more important than the level, which arguably is symbolic. But it is also a symbol of how we got here, and that's important, and it's a number of things. As you said, it's the fact that we're still expecting three cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, despite the fact that they raised their inflation forecast. It's better than expected growth in the resilience of the U.S. economy and beyond. It's the strength of consumer spending, and it's all those things like technology and artificial intelligence that's driving us too. And you can see all of those things if you look at some of the best performers in the Dow, American Express, one of the big performers, Disney, Walmart, Microsoft, and IBM, the big tech players. For those of you who have owned stocks, congratulations because you've made money this year. It's tougher, of course, Jake, for the 40 percent of Americans that don't and didn't benefit from these gains. And finally, it's also symbolic for an incumbent president in an election year who's trying to illustrate a message about the strength of the economy, and of course, getting very little credit for it.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think the most important thing is that we are seeing, the reason the Fed is expecting three cuts but not more than that is because they are willing to no longer take a recession.First of all, they see the resilience of the U.S. economy. The good news is that wages are now outpacing inflation. The bad news is, of course, price levels are still very high and we need time to really feel that regaining of purchasing power needed to feel better about the economy. But the wealth effects tied to this, it is now a record-breaking nearly 60 percent of households up from 52 percent, 53 percent prior to the pandemic that do own stocks. Also, people have seen significant increases in the wealth in their homes as well. So we've got about 12,000 millennials turning 35 each day, and they're out there waiting and nipping at the bit to buy homes as well. And that's keeping those prices buoyant in the housing market. So I think this is going to be continued improvement in the U.S. economy, despite the fact that the Fed's not going to be cutting aggressively because we've proven to be remarkably resilient.",

I'd go to the point I made originally. 40 percent of Americans aren't stockholders, so they're not getting, as Diane said, that wealth effect.And they're also probably the most likely to be squeezed by high inflation and by high interest rates, of course. And yes, inflation is slowing, but it's still high. And it's the same with interest rates. I've got a stat on this. The annual interest cost increase for Americans and that they're paying on mortgages, on credit cards, and on debt has risen $420 billion. That's seriously painful, and who are you going to blame? You look around, you blame the government because they're supposed to help. And as Diane said, there's a catching up effect, and that takes time.",
