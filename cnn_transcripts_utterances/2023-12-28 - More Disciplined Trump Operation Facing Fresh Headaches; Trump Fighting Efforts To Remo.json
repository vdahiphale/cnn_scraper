And maybe the biggest question, the candidate himself.CNN's Kristen Holmes is digging in on this. And Kristen, you have some new exclusive reporting about this question. And it really is a contradiction because when you think Donald Trump you definitely don't think discipline. But at least it sounds like from your reporting, his campaign is trying to build something around him that is as structured as can possibly be with a candidate with his personality.",

I mean, for example, one of the anecdotes that we use in this piece is that at a recent fundraising dinner, Donald Trump looked across the table to a group of donors and said, now who do we think should be vice president and started rattling off a bunch of names.Well, a few minutes later, a few days later, I got a call that Donald Trump was considering these names for vice president. That's hard to do when your own candidate is putting that out there. And something we know about Donald Trump is he seeks counsel from a huge swath of people. So if you are trying to control who he talks to, that's going to be very hard. I don't think they think that's possible. But that might be the biggest hurdle in all of this. You can't control the messaging from Donald Trump himself.",

Great reporting.And one thing his campaign is trying to control but this is going to be up to Donald Trump's lawyers in -- and of course, the people who are involved in these cases is whether he appears on the ballot in multiple states where major 14th Amendment cases are playing out. The former president is fighting back against those states considering removing or at least have already removed him from the ballot because of his role in the January 6 insurrection. Donald Trump's legal issues, though, extend far beyond that fight. He's currently defending himself in cases involving classified documents, January 6th, fraud, election interference, hush money payments, defamation. So how will all of these cases play out and when will they play out in this year ahead? CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is here to walk us through it. This is very confusing --",

They said that if you can appeal to the Supreme Court by then, they'll put their ruling on pause, which means he will be on the primary ballot. And Trump has not appealed even though he is expected to. But late last night, the Republican Party of Colorado appealed this ruling. Now they are actually a party to this case. They have been fighting in court for their right to list Trump on the primary ballot. And it's the understanding of the parties and the legal experts we've talked to that that appeal is enough to put that Colorado decision on hold for now.

This is all about timing. Because whatever happens at the appellate court, likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

She doesn't actually live there, but it is friendlier to her brand of politics, one that she has been very vocal about at a national level for the past three years.My panel is back with us. Let's just kind of set the table with some facts. First of all, she only won in 2022 by 546 votes, and yet it's not like the third district that she represents now is a purple district. It is a red district. Donald Trump won there by more than 8 percentage points. It's not as red as the one that Ken Buck is going to leave empty because he is retiring. Donald, you see, he won there by, you know, more than almost 25 percent. Donald Trump did by 18 percent. So look, Democrats, Republicans, they district shop. It's not a new phenomenon. It's been happening for a very long time, but it is fascinating that she is doing this right now, especially given how close it was in 2022.",

A Republican generic is likely to win the third congressional district. But people -- she just wasn't -- there was a lot to run against her, right? And she clearly saw the writing on the wall.And she said in that announcement video, this means that we'll get a -- you know, I can win in the fourth district and we'll get a Republican in the third district and it'll be all better for all of us. You know, I don't know that there are a ton, you know, of her Republican colleagues. I mean, I don't -- some of them will probably say it publicly, but I don't think there's going to be any love lost for her if she doesn't return to Washington, even among her fellow Republicans here. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Right. So what she's doing is almost guaranteeing that Republicans won't lose a seat in Congress, right? Because now that there's a generic Republican on the ballot in the third district, it's more likely, I guess, that Republicans can hold onto that seat. But she's not necessarily guaranteeing that she will return to Congress because there's already a crowded field in the fourth district with the incumbent announcing he's not going to seek another term. Now, does she come in with a lot of name recognition? Sure, but not always for the right reasons. So what -- I mean, it's early, it's day one, but it's going to be interesting to see if she clears the field in the fourth district or whether people say, no, we don't want someone like you representing us in Congress. We've got other, you know, tried and true Republicans who we think are just as conservative with you without the baggage. Now, I will say that in Marjorie Taylor Greene's district, that didn't work.
