We're covering all the angles at this hour. Senator Jeremy Diamond is in the Israeli city of Ashdod, 20 miles or so north of Gaza. Senator Ben Wedeman is in southern Lebanon.

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, over the last several hours this evening, we had not one but two barrages of rockets over the city of Ashdod. That second barrage was very, very close to our hotel. The boom from the intercepts of the Iron Dome hitting the rockets being fired from Gaza in the air was very close, very loud, indicating its proximity to our hotel. When we went into the shelter on the floor of our hotel, we met a family there who spoke to us about the fear that they have been feeling over these last several days.They actually live in Ashkelon, which is the city closer to the Gaza Strip that is right over my shoulder. And they said that they fled over here slightly further north for aiming, you know, trying to get to a sense of security. And also, because they do not have a bomb shelter in their home. The father said that his children simply could not sleep when they were in Ashkelon out of fear of rockets landing on top of them. Now, at the same time, what we do know is that, you know, the Iron Dome system is incredibly effective, but it is certainly not foolproof. And there is a deep, deep psychological impact on the population here. At the same time, we know that what we can also hear from this balcony, and we're hearing it right now, probably not loud enough to pick up on the mic, is the rumbling of the bombing by the Israeli Air Force over Gaza, as well as artillery pummelling the Gaza Strip. And we know that the death toll in Gaza has been rising in recent days, and we have seen horrific civilian casualties emerging from there. At the same time, there is this broader humanitarian question with the UN Human Rights Chief raising questions, accusing Israel effectively of violating international law by not allowing food, water, electricity, and fuel into the Gaza Strip. There's no question that however this unfolds, as Israel prepares for the next phase of its military campaign, which by all indications appears to be likely a ground invasion of Gaza, the death toll is only going to grow. And we know more often than not, civilians are all too often caught in the crossfire. Anderson.",

Secretary Blinken spoke in very personal terms and very emotional terms about Hamas's terrorist attacks in Israel over the weekend, about the brutality of the way in which Hamas mowed down citizens at a music festival, the way in which they attacked women and children in their own homes in towns in Israel close to the Gaza border. And Prime Minister Netanyahu did the same. And I think what's important to recognize here is why they are doing that. And one of the reasons why they're doing that is because they are laying out the rationale for this widening Israeli military campaign that is all but sure to come..[14:05:09] Whether it is in the coming days or weeks, we do not yet know. But what they are preparing the public for, they are preparing the Israeli public on one side for the possibility of increased, significantly increased Israeli military casualties if indeed a ground invasion moves forward. And they are also preparing the world for the images of destruction in Gaza. And like I said before, the possibility of more civilian casualties, because that is simply the reality. Every time there is a conflict with Gaza, every time the Israeli military has to go after Hamas in Gaza, they bomb buildings and there are civilian casualties. It is just a reality and it is one that certainly the people of Gaza are bracing for in terrible times. Anderson.",

And certainly, there have been years, several incursions over the years, some of them lasting for weeks, sometimes more than a month, but nothing on this scale. Now we're just, what, 6 days into this war, we can call it. The death toll is in excess of 1,400. Back in 2014, which was the most severe flare-up between Gaza and Israel, in more than a month, the casualty, the death toll was in excess of 2,000. So certainly, we're off to a very, very bad start.The people I've spoken with in Gaza, I've never heard them so terrified as they are at the moment. Now, we understand from the UN that 340,000 people have fled their homes. Many of them are taking shelter in UN schools that have been converted to shelters. Those are overcrowded. Also overcrowded are, of course, the hospitals of Gaza, where the Palestinian health ministry says the health system is in a state of collapse. They don't have enough beds anymore. The injured are basically just lying on the floor. Operating theatres are overcapacity. Basically, if you walked into the hospital with a wound, they'll dress it, and you're going to walk right out. So really it is in a dire situation. Of course, without fuel to run the generators, and that fuel is quickly running out, they will no longer be able to operate, for instance, incubators and dialysis machines. In fact, the Red Cross today said that the hospitals of Gaza are at risk of turning into morgues. Of course, caught in all of this are the civilians of Gaza. These are people, many of whom don't like Hamas, many of whom really just want to get by, feed their children, let them get an education. But that's not happening at the moment. And as we can hear from this one resident of Gaza, people there feel abandoned. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABDEL AZIZ AL FAGAM, GAZA RESIDENT: No one cries over us. There's no chivalry, no feelings. Hearts are dead. Only shocks and body parts remain. People are blind to this. People can't find food in their homes. And there's an extremely tough social condition in Gaza. Siege above the siege.

But let's be very clear. The civilian horrors that we're going to see in Gaza are going to create enormous amounts of diplomatic pressure on what has been Israel's geopolitical strengthening in the region.

He said quite famously during his 18 months of shuttle diplomacy that there can be no peace in the Middle East unless you resolve the Israel-Palestinian problem. Well, turns out that a lot of countries in the region just didn't agree with him. That's why we got the Abraham Accord. So, you've got the UAE. And if you go to Dubai, you see Jewish tourists like crazy now from Israel. It was just announced a couple of weeks ago, this major investment deal where the UAE puts money into Jordan for solar power, and the Israelis provide desalinized water, inconceivable five years ago.So, a lot of business happening in the region with Israel. Meanwhile, what are the Palestinians getting? More settlements. What are the Palestinians getting? Intolerable living conditions. No ability to drive an economy. No ability to educate your kids. And so, in that regard, you know, everything that Hamas was driving for, which is we refuse to recognize Israel. We want liberation for the Palestinians. Well, they were the only one saying it. No one else cared. And I've spoken with CNN over the last six months. God knows how many times on Israel. We weren't talking about the Palestinians. We're talking about judicial reform. So even in Israel, this was becoming an irrelevancy. And that is, I think, a big driver that explains why the timing, nothing justifies the attacks, the atrocities don't even go there. But in terms of what made a group like Hamas decide that they were going to sort of throw the dice on a suicide move, I think we have to look at the geopolitical context and we have to look at the domestic Israeli context, Anderson.",

That is their priority number 1, 2, and 3. And if that means that a lot of Palestinian civilians are going to be killed, then that's what it means. Again, I'm not justifying this. I'm telling you what the perspective is overwhelmingly for the Israeli government right now. That's why you have a siege of Gaza.
