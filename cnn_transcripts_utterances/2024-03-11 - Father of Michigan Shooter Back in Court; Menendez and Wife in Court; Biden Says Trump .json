And he just testified that it was as early as May of 2021, so this is months before the mass shooting happened, that he does not remember it, but he got an email from the English teachers saying that Ethan Crumbley was failing English and was sleeping throughout the course of the English class continually. Says he doesn't remember the email. He was asked to meet with him. He doesn't remember meeting with him. But he believes that he followed through with that.Now, the thing that is so important, this piece of evidence so important that prosecutors have put into evidence is the substation interview with James Crumbley and his wife. It was shortly after the mass shooting. It was videotaped via surveillance video. They -- there is audio. The jury is actually going to get a transcript. The reason this is so important is that James Crumbley talks a lot. And if he doesn't testify, this is what both sides can use to hear what comes out of James Crumbley's mouth. James Crumbley says and that meeting that he had hid the gun in the armoire, in their master bedroom, and that he had hit the gun in one area and then he hid the bullets in another area under some jeans. No mention at all of a cable lock. Now, here's what the defense countered that video with in their cross- examination. All right, it looks like that we don't have time for that. But the testimony continues. This trial is proceeding very quickly. The judge has told the jury they could have this case by the end of the week.",

All of these new details outlined in this superseding indictment. They are now facing 18 additional charges, including conspiracy, acting as a foreign agent, bribery, extortion, and wire fraud.Now, the senator and his wife and two other associates were already facing bribery charges, but what prosecutors are alleging now is that they tried to cover all that up once they found out that they were under investigation, basically saying that those bribes weren't bribes at all, they were basically trying to say that instead that they were loans. So, in other words, money that Nadine Menendez had received for a mortgage, she says that wasn't a bribe, that was a loan. Also money that she had received to buy a brand-new Mercedes. Again, wasn't a bribe, that was a loan. Prosecutors say not true. Prosecutors also alleging that they gave false information to their attorneys and that their attorneys, in turn, gave misleading information to the U.S. attorney's office when they had meetings with them last year. Now, Senator Menendez and his wife have already pleaded not guilty to those bribery charges. They deny all wrongdoing. And Senator Menendez released a statement about these new charges, saying in part, \"it says that the prosecutors are afraid of the facts, scared to subject their charges to a fair-minded scrutiny of a jury. It says once and for all that they will stop at nothing in their zeal to get me.\" And, John, the arraignment is scheduled to get underway just about a little more than an hour from now. John.",

It's a state he only narrowly won in 2020, and voter outreach and mobilization is going to be key for - for him to notch another victory in the state this November. That according to Democratic strategists.And the voters I talked to on the ground, they - they -- this message of protecting democracy really resonated with them, but so did lowering healthcare costs. And the president is headed to New Hampshire today where he's going you talk more about that and attack Republicans on health care, of course a state that has one of the country's oldest populations. All of this as the White House is preparing here to release its fiscal 2025 budget blueprint. It's an aspirational budget, but it's also a messaging event to appeal to voters who are sour on the economy. Some of those proposals include to lower costs for families, increase manufacturing, strengthen - strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and also reduce the deficit.

      "sentences": "Well, that's right, Sara, the former president was on CNBC this morning railing against social media companies, and namely Facebook, arguing that a ban on TikTok would benefit Facebook, while calling the social media company an enemy of the people.Now, I'm just going to read for you some of what he told CNBC. He said, quote, \"the thing I don't like is that without TikTok you can make Facebook bigger. And I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media.\" Now, Sara, his comments come as the House is preparing to consider a bipartisan bill that would force the sale of TikTok by Bytedance, the company that owns it, or face a ban in the United States. But then last week we saw Donald Trump post on Truth Social. And again I just want to point out that while President Donald Trump had repeatedly himself pushed for a TikTok ban or sale to a U.S. company as president, but he weighed in online saying, quote, \"if you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business.\" And that's, of course, referring to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. But these comments from Donald Trump on Truth Social came after the former president met with Jeff Yass at Mar-a-Lago last week. Yass is a hedge fund manager and a huge Republican donor with a stake in TikTok worth more than $30 billion. But I also just have to point out here, Sara, that some of this is clearly political. TikTok is hugely popular in the United States, especially with young voters who Donald Trump and his campaign are eager to pull away from Joe Biden as they prepare for a general election rematch in November. But this could also create headaches for those on Capitol Hill who have long worked to try and find a solution to the national security risks that the app poses. Sara.",
