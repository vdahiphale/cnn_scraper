I was here after that happened. And now, once again, he's trying to take territory that is Ukrainian national territory. They have sovereignty. This is recognized by the international community. The only person who doesn't recognize it, essentially, is Vladimir Putin and that echo chamber of yes-men. And so, for him to stand there and flippantly refer to the explosion at the Crimean bridge two months ago, which then Russia used as an excuse to start a series of horrific strikes on the civilian power infrastructure here that had plunged millions of people into darkness and cold -- and now, of course, with the official start of winter later this month, the cold is only going to get worse, and the strikes he is promising will continue -- it is -- it is indicative of the fact he is not living in the reality that is shared by certainly, NATO and its allies in much of the Western world, but much of the world in general. Even his proclaimed good friend, Chinese President Xi Jinping, while not condemning the invasion, certainly is not condoning it and certainly has expressed questions about it.

That's how much more Americans could have saved in the third quarter if they put their money in the five highest-yielding savings accounts instead of the five biggest banks. Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo only paid an average of 0.4 percent interest during the quarter, according to The Wall Street Journal. But the five highest-yielding savings accounts paid an average of 2.14 percent. All right. Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets are higher. The Hang Seng up more than two percent on a report inflation cooling in China. On Wall Street, stock index futures leaning up a little bit here this morning after stocks surged Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 snapped a 5-day losing streak, pushing aside, for now, worry that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates higher for longer. Mortgage rates fell again, the lowest since September. The rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage declined to 6.33 percent. Gas prices are falling. The average price for a gallon of regular, $3.32 a gallon. Another inflation gauge, November's Producer Price Index, is due out later this morning. All right, 85 percent of Americans are worried about inflation, but only 44 percent feel prepared for an economic downturn, according to a survey on LinkedIn. That's why the latest workplace trend, career cushioning, is taking off. What is this? It's a term derived from the world of dating. It's designed to soften the landing after a layoff. Let's bring in our friend Jessica Kriegel, chief scientist of workplace culture at Culture Partners. What is this career cushioning? JESSICA KRIEGEL, CHIEF SCIENTIST OF WORKPLACE CULTURE, CULTURE PARTNERS (via Webex by Cisco):  It's having a backup plan. I mean, you hear about all the layoffs, you think you might be next, and you think OK, I either need to get a side hustle or I need to get a plan b. I start applying for jobs even if I love my job -- I don't want to anywhere -- but you never know, so let me just start applying. Just testing the waters out there. And then you end up potentially leaving or not, or waiting for the news.",

Then Amazon starts having it and everyone starts realizing well, maybe Twitter layoffs weren't as rare and now we're going into a new phase.

What if we didn't keep it so top- secret?If you know that there's going to be layoffs at some point in the future, usually the executives are very tight-lipped about that. They keep it a secret. They figure out who they're going to lay off and then, maybe the day before, they give people some warning. But really, it's always blindsiding the employees who are getting laid off. I was talking to one CEO who said he believes that if people are not safe at his company, he wants to make sure that everyone can get themselves to safety, so he broadcasts it. Hey, we're having economic challenges. In the next quarter, we may have layoffs. And he almost encourages career cushioning so that he's building that brand equity and people know that they can get the real truth from him. And ultimately, the people who care about the purpose -- who understand the impact the company is trying to make on the larger world and their mission there -- they stay because they trust the CEO.",

You are going to have major problems with diversity, equity, and inclusion when you have the kind of culture that Elon is creating. There are a lot of people who might love to continue working at Twitter but can't make that work because they're single parents. I'm a single parent. I couldn't sleep at the office if I wanted to, even if I believed in the mission.But Elon's biggest problem, in my opinion -- and we've seen this in social media reflected from the people who did not sign the agreement to be extremely hardcore -- is that he didn't share the purpose. He didn't share his vision. People are having to put blind faith in him before he even explains where Twitter is going. So what are they fighting for? They don't know. And so here, you see a lot of people have left. And the people who have stayed are sleeping at the office, apparently. It's an interesting way to deal with the real estate.",
