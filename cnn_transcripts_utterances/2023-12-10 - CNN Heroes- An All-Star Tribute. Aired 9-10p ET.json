SARAH CARTER, GRANDDAUGHTER OF FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER: On behalf of my grandfather and my late grandmother, thank you for this very special recognition. When my grandparents left the White House, or were involuntarily retired, as my grandfather likes to put it, they dedicated their lives to empowering people to improve their own situations, whether in Plains, Georgia, or in the tiniest village at the end of the road in Ghana, they trusted people to make the best decisions for themselves and to work hard for their own benefit. My grandparents always reminded us that the people the Carter center aimed to help were just as intelligent, just as hardworking, just as dedicated to their families as everyone else. The grandparents they forced and the truth that they earned in those communities all over the world are at the heart of the Carter Center's success. My grandparents had the ability to envision the world as it should be, with astonishing moral clarity, and the audacity and determination to pursue that vision over decades. They touched so many people's lives along the way. So I'm honored to join you this evening to accept this award on their behalf. Thank you. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)",

And every morning, Mike Goldberg did that well. But he knew in his heart that he belonged someplace else, underwater. So, he quit his job and eventually settled his family in the Florida Keys, opening up a dive shop. And back then, during the dives, they'd see the car-sized brain corals, stag horn, horn large as trees, fish, life, colors, quarter-mile each direction. But year after year, he saw the coral destroyed. And often, while underwater, he'd cry of the devastation. And instead of letting it continue, he built a community to fight it. He cofounded I.Care, which grows resilient coral in nursery, uses recreational divers to transplant it, and informs them about the reefs. In the last few years, they've educated 2,000 divers and planted more than 15,000 pieces of coral. The news about the reefs is devastating.

What I believed would work was and is the recreational dive community coming down and helping us rebuild the reef.It's just amazing how fast this coral is growing. They look beautiful. I'm happy that I get to be part of something that I know is a solution. I see things every time I go in the water that give me hope. One percent of them are thriving. Those are some happy corals.

I'm calling on everyone to take an active role restoring this most precious ecosystem, the one that connects each and every one of us. I do see hope.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) If I, as a child, could dream of doing something that was impactful, then I think I found it, or it found me. And I'm so lucky to be doing what I'm doing. And I have so many people to be grateful for. There's so many people that have helped get me here. My parents, who instilled good values. My brother who helped me start the charity. Ian, thank you. Our volunteer veterinarians and technicians. My family, my better half, who's here tonight. My wonderful kids. To name my technician who's home crying right now, thank you. I -- it's been a wonderful journey, and as I get older, I start thinking about those big questions in life. Why are we here? What defines us? Why are we human? And I think the answer, at least for me, the answer is in the question. What does it mean to be human? And I believe it's humanity. It's looking out for each other, believing in each other, helping one another. And all of these people embody that. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) This part certainly wasn't planned, but the $100,000, I want to celebrate with all of you. It splits evenly ten ways pretty nicely, so it is my contribution to all of us. I want to say I'm honored to know you and to be a part of this fraternity. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) I'm here in part because -- I'm here in part because I've been willing to share and give throughout my life. There's no reason to stop doing that tonight. I have one last quick thought. I was in the streets one day, and an unhoused man and his pet, after I delivered care, we got to talking. And he said sort of nonchalant, he hadn't eaten in almost two days. And I was due for lunch myself. I returned with a sandwich for myself and for him. He tore off -- it was a Sub sandwich. He tore off a corner of it, a piece of bread. He ate it, and he gave the rest to his dog. And they've taught me a lot, too. I'll close by saying this. An act of kindness can change your day. Change someone's day. An act or gesture of kindness can change somebody's life. Thank you. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)",
