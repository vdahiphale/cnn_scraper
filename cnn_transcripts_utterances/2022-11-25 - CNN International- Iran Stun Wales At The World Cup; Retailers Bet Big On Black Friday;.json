Since the Russians were driven out of Kherson City and lost 40 percent of a province that they laid claim to, illegally conducting a referendum, a bogus referendum and incorporating it into Russian territory, they have switched their tactics to try to break the back of the energy generating structure here across Ukraine with what the government here say, have been seven waves of cruise missile swarms or storms of cruise missiles about once a week, I'm sorry, yeah, but once a week, once every 10 days, it takes them to wine these max attacks up. Most of the cruise missiles are getting shot down. But, those that get through, do cause damage, do cause extreme strain.Of course, with each wave, the whole energy structures gets further denuded. It gets eroded, no matter how efficient the Ukrainians have been in repairing it. The energy system here is under extreme strain. Now, they're saying that in most cases, they are able to get up, back up to production of electricity, and get it to the essential locations for public transport, hospitals and so on. But, individuals are still struggling in different locations. It is different situations around the country. But, as winter approaches, of course, water is absolutely essential, and it is electricity that pumps water around the system. It is electricity that heats most homes and it is electricity that generates so much power for people to cook. So, the effort now by the Russians is to put pressure on the civilian population, whilst the fighting continues on the ground. Their main effort, Max, at the moment, seems to be in the East of the country where there have been reports from Ukrainian officials that they've seen a redeployment of elite troops, Russian troops, to the Eastern Front. That's the area in Donetsk where the Russians have now, for weeks, been concentrating their efforts in very very bitter fighting indeed. But, generally speaking, the main effort could be described as one in the air, and it is in the air where the Ukrainians are asking for most help from the international community, asking for more remorse surface-to-air missiles so they can defend themselves against these cruise missiles swarm attacks, Max.",

But, China right now shows no sign of budging on zero COVID. Authorities, they're clamping down with even more lockdowns, and this cycle of quarantines, lockdowns, mass testing, it continues. That is why we are seeing this frustration. Now, three years of all of this, that is why we're seeing more of this spill into public protests.Last week, in the southern city of Guangzhou, some residents revolted, during lockdown, by tearing down barriers, marching through the streets. There, of course, were also the violent protests that we talked about yesterday at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou. Now, adding to that anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. 10 people were killed and nine injured in a fire at an apartment building in Urumqi. Now, most parts of Xinjiang, Max, they've been under lockdown for more than 100 days. The deadly fire sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos, which have now been censored, show that COVID lockdown measures may have delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. Well, as to the tragedy, Max, is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building, if not entirely. Now, state media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building that was considered a low-risk COVID area. But, the video, some of which we have just shown, shows firetrucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance is partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences, tents and metal barriers that are likely because of COVID measures. And, the video we showed earlier shows smoke and flames coming from the high floor of the building, but the water from the fire trucks actually unable to reach the fire. And, Max, this really strikes a chord with the public here, because we've seen these scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again in these past three years, countless stories of people during lockdown struggling to get food, daily necessities and emergency care in lockdown.",

Five activists, including Zen, were fined $510 each. Authorities arrested Zen back in May under Hong Kong's controversial National Security Law for colluding with foreign forces, which, if convicted, could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.Cardinal Zen and five others, including a famous singer, veteran lawyer, and legislator, were trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, providing legal and financial aid to more than 2,000 protesters who had been arrested during the 2019 pro-democracy protests. The fund which raised almost $35 million disbanded in 2021 after police ordered them to hand over information on donors and beneficiaries, while freezing their assets. But, in the end, the prosecution was forced to downgrade the NSL charge to an administrative technicality. Pope Francis is yet to comment on the case. However, it comes at a sensitive time for the Vatican as it renews its controversial agreement with Beijing over the appointment of bishops in China. Cardinal Zen has called the deal a sellout of China's underground Catholics who have faced persecution for remaining loyal to Rome, claiming it's like giving the flock into the mouth of the wolves.

Wales played the last part of the match with 10 men after their goalkeeper was red carded for a reckless challenge. Host nation Qatar and Senegal are underway in the day's second match. Later, Ecuador plays the Netherlands, and then the highly anticipated match between the U.S. and England. Amanda Davies watching all of the action for us from in Doha, some pretty rough play there in that Iran-Wales match. AMANDA DAVIES, CNN WORLD SPORT: Yeah. It was a really incredibly emotionally charged affair, Max, but, as you mentioned, ultimately an Iran win which really gives their hopes of making it out of the group stage at a World Cup for the first time, a massive, massive boost. In the build-up, the Iran Boss Carlos Queiroz had pleaded really with the media to allow his players to focus on the job in hand, which is the football, to stop asking them questions about the politics and the anti-government protests at home, because of how we saw it impacts them, affect them, in their performance against England earlier this week. In terms of the scenes at the ground, as the anthem was played, some of the Iranian fans did boo it, a number held up T-Shirts and messages against the government, supporting the protesters at home. There were a member -- few members of the crowd in tears. But, when it came to the match, you could see the players had regrouped. They put in a really dogged performance against a Welsh side who equally wanted a result in this match. As you said, there was a very reckless challenge from the Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey with six minutes to go. Iran took advantage. So, they get the victory that they were looking for. And, what that does, is set up a fascinating climax to this Group B. The second match from that group, as you mentioned, England against the USA, the one we've very much been building up to here, the England boss, Gareth Southgate, ramping up the pressure on his players despite the fact they won 6-2 in their opening encounter. He said they need to do better against the U.S. He wants them to book their place in the next round with a game to spare to really take the pressure off. But, this is a USA who are young. They're excited about being at this tournament. 25 out of the 26 members of the squad are playing in a World Cup for the first time, and they really don't need any extra motivation for this match against England, a team for whom there is now something of a historic tradition with the U.S. They caused upsets against England, as they did in 1950 when they beat them. There was a shock draw in 2010. And, this young group of players that are confident of a three peat. That one much later on, myself and a lot of members of the team heading there. But, as you mentioned, Qatar against Senegal, now 15 minutes in, Qatar hoping to show something of a display as the host of this tournament, after a real disappointment in their opening encounter, but currently, still goal-less, Max.",

I'm talking about for November and December.But, the economists tell me that when you factor in inflation, that's higher dollars, but when you factor in inflation, it's actually people aren't spending as much on many things. So, they're not buying as many things because they're spending more on the things that they are buying. However, the economists does say although we're not going to see the mass spending that we saw last year, which was actually out of the ordinary, we are not going to see a significant decline either. So, how the economists explained it to me was, we're kind of getting back to normal that although the spending this year, once you adjust for inflation, it's flat.

Carroll is bringing this lawsuit under a new New York State law called the Adult Survivors Act. That law allows any adult to bring a lawsuit against someone that they say sexually assaulted them, no matter how long ago the alleged attack occurred. Trump attorney Alina Habba responded to the lawsuit, saying, well, I respect and admire individuals that come forward. This case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this Act, which creates a terrible precedent and runs the risk of de- legitimizing the credibility of actual victims.
