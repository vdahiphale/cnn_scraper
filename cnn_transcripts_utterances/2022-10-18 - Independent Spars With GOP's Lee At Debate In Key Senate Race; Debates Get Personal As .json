Then you might be thinking, didn't we just go into a recession two and a half years ago? And we did. So it is pretty incredible that we're already preparing for the next one. but the problem is that inflation, after being very low, almost no inflation for years, now inflation is really high. And so this is crushing families and businesses, and our retirement accounts. And worse, this is also causing the Federal Reserve to slam the brakes on the economy by rapidly raising interest rates, and they are -- they are basically trying to slow this economy down. And if they lob enough massive interest rate hikes at the economy, eventually, they're going to succeed. One other key point here from Fitch is they're worried about a spillover from Europe.

And during the COVID recession of 2020, we saw this massive increase of more than 11 percentage points for the unemployment rate. More than 5 percentage points during the Great Recession. But Fitch is calling for something more like that 1990 to 1991 recession, which was considered relatively mild. Now, we don't want to minimize any job loss, right? Anyone losing a job is painful. But there are some reasons why the next recession could be more mild. The jobs market is strong. Consumer finances are pretty solid. People don't have quite as much debt as they have in the past recessions. There's no epic housing glut like the one that preceded the Great Recession. And banks are a lot stronger than they were in 2008. I do think, though, at the end of the day, you know, there are a lot of moving forces here. High inflation, aggressive Fed, war in Ukraine.

I think people need to realize you have to have a lot of humility to be trying to forecast what's happening or will happen in the economy. Because this is a very unusual period. If you have high-interest credit card debt or high-interest debt, you need to be paying down that debt. You need to be handling -- controlling the things you can control. You know, I've said this before. Personal finance rules, those boring personal finance rules, are more important today than they were last year, because interest rates are higher. Right? And it's going to cost you more to carry that debt. So you just really have to get your own financial house in order. It's still a very good job market, still a good time to be trading up for a different job. It is still a good time to be paying down debt and, you know, getting a flexibility fund, emergency savings fund. But for the most part, there's a lot here you -- normal people cannot control, except for how they're handling their own money.",
