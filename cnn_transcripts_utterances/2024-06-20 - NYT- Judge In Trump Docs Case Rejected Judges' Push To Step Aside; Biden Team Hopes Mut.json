Trump's favorite judge, Aileen Cannon, could be hours away from deciding if Jack Smith gets fired and at this hour tonight, Cannon is facing new questions as to whether or not she should be even overseeing this classified documents trial, the Mar-a-Lago case. According to \"The New York Times\" and new reporting tonight, two senior Florida federal judges reportedly told Cannon to step aside after she was assigned to this get case. And in the world we live in, it's important to just say some of the facts here. One of the judges who recommended this to Cannon is named Cecilia Altonaga, Republican appointee. She is the district's chief judge with decades of experience. Keep in mind, Aileen Cannon wasn't even a judge until Trump made her four years ago. And according to \"The New York Times\", Cannon rebuffed any suggestion from these judges that you should give up the Trump's case completely, rejected it, a case in which she has done thus far everything that she possibly could in her power as a judge to slow roll the proceedings. That includes appointing a special master to review the sensitive documents taken at Mar-a-Lago to now taking up Trump's request to challenge Jack Smith's appointment, he's even being involved on the case, an issue that other courts have resoundingly rejected. But not Cannon. She has given Trump exactly what he hoped for. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I did nothing wrong.

In fact, she hasn't even decided on at least eight major issues, six motions to dismiss, a gag order request, and I guess on top of all of it, important to note, she has even set a trial date.

She had been on the bench just three years at that point after being confirmed by the Senate in 2020, when she was asked if she had any loyalty to President Trump, she unequivocally responded, no.Then, one of her first decisions related to the classified docs case favored Trump by granting his request to have a special master oversee the review of classified documents first seized by the FBI at Mar-a- Lago. It was a decision that halted the ability of DOJ's prosecutors to review the documents. And a conservative appeals court, including two Trump appointees, rebuked her by reversing her ruling, that they described as untenable, and allowing the DOJ to resume its investigation that led to Trump's indictment. Attorneys who have practiced before Judge Cannon tell CNN her drawn- out decision-making process isn't unique to Trump's case. Attorneys saying \"she is not efficient\", calling her \"indecisive\" and noting \"she just seems overwhelmed by the process\". Some of the defense attorneys who asked CNN not to use their names also say she is typically tough on criminal defendants and she is a very harsh sentencer. But they questioned her decisions on Trump. One of them saying, \"She's certainly playing a different game with the current defendant before her\". Trump's former attorney, though, argues her decision so far are about what he would expect in a criminal case at the beginning stages. JIM TRUSTY, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: There's a lot of people that are already kind of preemptively throwing stones at her saying she's overmatched, she doesn't know what she's doing. The reality is, she's doing stuff that's actually pretty typical to federal practice for a non-incarcerated defendant.",

You know, I think I raised this time I wonder why the chief justice or chief judge of the district didn't impose her will and make this -- make this go to another judge.Well, I'm relieved today to see that she actually did that and I think very highly over for that, she's a very highly regarded judge, very experienced and thoughtful and I'm glad she attempted to do that. And it's shocking the level of disrespect that young, inexperienced judge of Cannon's sort would disrespect or chief judge in connection with that or and another elder, particularly when as we know, that there was a -- there's a specialty compartmentalize information facility in the Miami -- accessible to the Miami courthouse that's not accessible in Fort Pierce.

I was speaking to one senior adviser tonight who was pointing back to the 2020 debates between Biden and Trump, especially the first one where I think we all remember there was a lot of yelling and shouting by the former president, a lot of interruptions, some long-winded rambling answers, some name-calling at times, a moderator couldn't even get their questions in. I mean, it was widely viewed as having been utterly chaotic. And this adviser was saying, look, there's no question that voters' interests were not served during that particular debate. And the muted mics could mean that the audience, this time around has a better informed view after the debate about exactly what President Biden and former President Trump stands for. And we know from all of our reporting that showcasing that contrast is probably the top priority for Biden and his team. They want the audience members to see Donald Trump as this divisive chaotic figure and President Trump is being the steady and wiser alternative that's how one campaign official put it.
