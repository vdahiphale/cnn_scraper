The entire Francis Scott Key Bridge is in the Patapsco River. You can see the footage right there. Just stunning imagery right now of this large container ship that slammed into a pylon supporting the bridge overnight. At least seven people are believed to be in the water. There are search and rescue operations underway. There were two people who were rescued soon after the collapse. One is fine. One is in serious conditions. Among the missing are said to be members of a construction crew that was doing concrete repair work on the surface of the bridge itself when the cargo ship struck. We just got some new footage in of the damage to the ship itself. You can see the hull just crashed in their of the vessel. This is the bridge. You can see the steel truss bridge. Some of the substance there. The bridge in the water. This is the newest footage we've seen and the closest images we've seen of the situation there. We have been told that no one on board the ship was injured. We have CNN's Gabe Cohen and Pete Muntean both on the scene. Pete, let's start with you. Sorry, Gabe, I should say, let's start with you.

We're going to push in on that cargo -- on the container ship. And you can see those massive pieces of steel, the chunks of the Key Bridge that are now laying in the water. One of them laying across the deck of that huge ship. And rounded it are several upwards of a dozen, I've counted, search and rescue boats. They have divers in the water. They are trying to find people. They've used sonar to figure out that there are cars, vehicles in the water. And as you mentioned, they think there could be at least seven people in the water as well here in the river. And so those crews are very much still trying to find them, even though things grow more bleak and dire by the minute out here, several hours after this all began.If we pan to the left, you can see emergency vehicles that are parked along the river bank that are also assisting in this rescue. And you can clearly see where the bridge collapsed. The part of the brigs that is still standing and then suddenly its gone. And it is a huge section, John, of the bridge that's missing, that has collapsed into the river. And so that tells you that crews are really having to search out a vast area. They are using every technology that they can, including that sonar. But it is not going to be an easy operation.

We're standing by for Maryland Governor Wes Moore to address the cameras here on the Dundalk side of the bridges. This is the east side of the Patapsco River.You can see essentially the bridge to nowhere behind me now. That is the normal portion of the bridge up to the suspension portion that collapsed into the Patapsco River there. To give you an idea of where we are, this is the mouth of the river that goes into Baltimore's inner harbor and Curtis Bay. This is right essentially in the center of the channel there. As you heard, about 50 feet deep. On the other side of that bridge, about 20 feet deep. A lot of big questions that investigators will ask here about the collision and why this container ship flagged out of Singapore apparently lost control and went into one of the pilings of the Key Bridge here, completed in about 1977. So, it is getting on the aging side of a bridge. The big question they will want to know is, why the bridge, when this collision happened, folded so easily. But then also why this boat essentially went out of role. By Maryland law, a pilot needs to be on board the boat with local knowledge of the channel and the harbor itself, going into the Port of Baltimore here, one of the busiest ports on the East Coast. You can see the container ship still in the Patapsco River, off in the distance there, filled up high with containers. This was going to Sri Lanka. The timeline here is really interesting. And we've been able to interpolate a few different things, not only from maritime tracking data, but also from the surveillance video of this bridge collapse and the moments leading up to it. At 1:25 in the morning, we know that there was a puff of smoke that apparently came from this container ship. At 1:26, the lights on the ship itself flickered. And then at 1:27, the lights flickered again, followed by the collision only about 60 seconds after. So, there are some big questions here about the reported power failure on board the boat and what the implications on board that ship and the power failure were. Was the pilot, or were the crew, able to control the boat? And what did they lose? What were they able to still control, or did they completely lose the impetus of control of this boat as it was careening toward that piling in the Patapsco River here. Some really big questions and some really big questions about who will investigate this. The National Transportation Safety Board tells me that they're gathering early information right now in conjunction and in tandem with the Coast Guard. Likely that they will launch an investigation here because there's so many things that they want to know about what led to the collision with that bridge that ultimately collapsed. Really an incredible scene here.",

So that's been a while. And that the crew on the ship, that no one was injured. We now know that from the company itself. There was concern about the crew being on the deck there where you see the bridge collapsed and sort of strangling it, if you will, after it hit that pylon. So, everyone on the ship, OK at this hour.I want to switch to now the search and rescue. That is the urgent thing ongoing now. We have -- we are now more than eight hours after this collapse. The water is frigid. But we are hearing that divers have been able to get in the water from local officials. What does this look like when you look at the expanse of -- of area and the depths of the water about -- I think it -- they said about 50 feet, to -- to try and get to, for example, someone who might be submerged in a car or get to someone who may have survived this somehow?",

Earlier they said that they were aided by sonar to help find the vehicles were -- that were submerged. For the persons they've already rescued it sounds as though, obviously, they could, you know, make it to the surface or they were on the surface. But for underwater, the visibility is going to be getting bad. It's going to be very cold. Hypothermia, you know, sets in. So, they're going to have, you know, they're going to have a problem locating and then freeing people.But, you know, there are cases where a submerged vehicle does have air pockets. So, they are going to be searching very earnestly and frantically because it is possible for people to survive if hypothermia does not get them first.

A 1977 bridge. Standards have changed. And one of the most important things we can see from the video are that the stays, the attachments of the bridge to the support pillars did not fail, just in the place where it was hit.

A group of anti-abortion doctors and advocates sued the FDA over its approval of Mifepristone. Now, that drug was approved back in 2000. But as the case has gone on, they have instead started to focus on additional approvals the FDA granted that expanded access, both in 2016 and 2021, that allowed Mifepristone to be available through a telemedicine appointment and then be mailed to an individual. Now, the FDA insists they followed the appropriate procedures when they made these approvals and they emphasize that this is one of the most studied drugs in the country and that it has a demonstrated record of safety. So, in a short time, the justices will hear arguments from both sides, but so much at stake here, John, not just for people seeking access to this drug, but also for the FDA and other medications that it has approved.",
