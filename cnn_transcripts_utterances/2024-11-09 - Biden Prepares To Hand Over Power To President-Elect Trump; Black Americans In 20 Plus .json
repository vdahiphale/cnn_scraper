And I think it's a good preview of what to expect when Donald Trump is sworn into office in January. But yes, Donald Trump announced tonight not new hires, but two people he said, that will not be joining his second administration. And that includes Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo.I'm going to read for you just a little bit of what he posted. He said, quote, \"I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the Trump administration, which is currently in formation. I very much enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously and would like to thank them for their service to our Country.\" Now, some background information on where this is coming from. I've been talking with several of Donald Trump's top advisers over the last 24 hours, but of course, over the last week repeatedly and how -- and in the process of them working on this transition stuff. And essentially, when it came to Pompeo, I was told that many people in Donald Trump's inner circle, in his orbit, believe that he did a really good job as Donald Trump's Secretary of State and that he deserved a seat at the table this time around. However, his relationship with Donald Trump is not what it once was. Pompeo distanced himself from the former President after he had left office in 2021. Donald Trump, I'm told in private, has questioned whether or not Pompeo would actually be loyal to him or if he could trust him. Obviously, that is something that Donald Trump values above all else. And so many people were skeptical of whether or not he was actually going to be put up for a top tier job. Now, one job that he had been floated for, I'm told, and some people had put his name into consideration for was Secretary of Defense. But clearly, that is not going to happen now. Now, as for Haley, look, Donald Trump has told people who he is close to that he appreciated that she got on stage at the Republican National Convention in July, that she called for unity and ultimately supported him. But he still harbors, I'm told, a lot of animosity toward her for the attacks that she lobbed at him during the Republican primary. I mean, it was a very bitter primary between the two of them. But then also, that she had kind of hung on so long during that primary and didn't drop out sooner. That is something that Donald Trump believes it wasn't appropriate. So that's where some of this is coming from.",

That's what we're being told from sources. That's what's happening behind the scenes. CNN's Arlette Saenz has more on this.

Meanwhile, Biden is trying to arm them with missile systems as quickly as possible.The other things is the deportation of undocumented workers. And I think for Donald Trump, that's first and foremost in his mind. With hyperbole, on the campaign trail, Trump talked about 11 million undocumented workers being rounded up and deported. You're not going to get 11 million, but there will be millions. And that has to be Project 1 for Trump along with securing the border.

I suppose Department of Education a target, EPA, perhaps Agriculture and Interior.

Trump might be happy just putting it as Trumpcare and reforming it a little bit and try to get a win with that in the history sweepstakes.

So I doubt he would sign that. I think he's going to want to assert a new kind of power of the presidency.You know, executive orders are really a more recent phenomena. You know, we call sometimes Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation executive order number one, but they weren't that much in the 19th century. But by the time you get to Franklin D. Roosevelt, you're getting 3,700. And Trump sees the power of executive power with the Supreme Court, which gives him immunity. Basically, Supreme Court went with Richard Nixon on David Frost that the president does it, it must be legal. So Trump's going to try to weigh in onto -- in presidential power in a way we haven't seen. What's hopeful for the Democrats is look back to 1980 and look how Ronald Reagan took the map over. You know what Reagan wanted to do? Drill the public lands and extract and they put James Watt as head of Interior. Watt was gone shortly later because the public wouldn't tolerate the mauling of our natural resources in such a fashion. And Reagan had put in somebody like Alexander Haig, his Secretary of State, this ultra hawk, only to fire them and replace them with the more moderating George Shultz. So, you know, things will -- the doors of politics swing. But this is not good news for employees in Maryland and Delaware, the District of Columbia. There is going to be a big downsizing of the regulatory state. That's the goal of Trumpism. Get the federal government out of your life. And as for those blue collar workers you were talking about, there's been bitterness over NAFTA, which was passed really by or embraced by Bill Clinton and George Herbert Walker Bush. Ross Perot ran got 19 percent in 1992. On the sucking sound that you hear of the jobs going to Mexico, meaning the gutting of cities like Milwaukee or Akron in the rights. And so Trump means his tariffs, but it's not going to be anywhere near as high Mexico or China sees intimating. There was a lot of hyperbole by Donald Trump on the campaign trail. That's going to get shrunk down to size. It doesn't mean it's not going to be ardent.",

And to date, the IDF said it dealt a severe blow to Hamas after claiming forces killed 1,000 fighters and captured 1,000 more in northern Gaza over the past three weeks. CNN's Chief Global Affairs correspondent Matthew Chance has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Head of the Israeli military says about a thousand Hamas militants have been killed in northern Gaza in the past three weeks. And another thousand captured visiting troops in the Jabalia, a refugee camp area of northern Gaza on Friday. Herzi Halevi, who is the Chief of the General Staff of the IDF, described those figures as, quote, \"A significant achievement for Israel and a severe blow for Hamas.\" The Israeli military encircled Jabalia more than a month ago and launched a new ground operation there, forcing residents to flee amid heavy fighting. It said the operation was necessary because it had seen signs of Hamas rebuilding in the area despite a year of heavy bombardment and two previous ground operations. Meanwhile, the U.N.'s children agency, UNICEF, says at least 64 attacks have taken place against schools in the Gaza Strip in the last month. That's almost two a day. An estimated 128 people were killed in the strikes, according to the UNICEF report, many of them children. Israel's military says civilians, including those in schools, are often used by Hamas as human shields. The United Nations has also issued a new and detailed report on casualties in Gaza in the first six months of the conflict there, saying close to 70 percent were women and children. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk said the report showed that civilian casualties were a direct consequence of a failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law.

Strong winds have died down and humidity levels have risen. The bad news, the winds that fueled the fire could return next week. The fire has destroyed more than 100 properties while burning more than 20,000 acres of land. And the cause of this fire remains unknown.Seattle authorities have arrested a man that they believe is linked to a 38-hour stabbing spree in the city's Chinatown International District.

Authorities also saying that they found a weapon in the area where the suspect was arrested. And they also were able to recover a knife that was still in one of the victims. So they will be able to test this and use it to verify their theories. Now, this all happened within 38 hours in the Chinatown International District. And we know that at least nine, maybe even 10 people were stabbed.Now, on Friday, five people were stabbed and of those, one was treated at the scene and then released. The other four were taken to Harborview Medical Center in critical condition. The hospital was able to say on Friday night that two of these victims had been upgraded in terms of their conditions. Two others were still in critical condition. Now unfortunately, four, maybe five other people were also stabbed on Thursday. And again, police believe that the same person is responsible. Take a listen to what authorities are seeing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That group has become a cornerstone of his base even as Republicans continue to lose support among women voters.Joining us now to better understand how and why they propelled Trump to a second term as founding editor of Gawker and contributing opinion columnist at the New York Times, Elizabeth Spiers. Elizabeth, thank you for coming on. So you make the case in your recent opinion piece in the New York Times, quote, \"On the long road to Election Day, no group of voters was more loyal to Donald Trump than young white men. Mr. Trump offered a regressive idea of masculinity in which power over women is a birthright. How so, in your view? ELIZABETH SPIERS, FOUNDING EDITOR, GAWKER: So Trump is basically a walking avatar of an idea of masculinity that not just young white men into, but is very dominant in our culture. And it says that the good kind of masculinity is a masculinity that represents strength, physical toughness, mental toughness, resistance to adversity. And a lot of these things seem like they're, you know, good qualities. But it also represents things like aggression or anything that might be construed as non-feminine. And so if you look at the way that Trump talks about himself, he said -- he talks about himself as a strong man. And he tends to cast his opponents as being weak and he feminizes them. Even, you know, Tim Walz, who encapsulates a lot of the masculine ideals, he referred to as tampon Tim. And for younger white men who are seeking that kind of validation, the top of the hierarchy where they rest is appropriate, and that's where they should be. Donald Trump reinforces all those things for them.",

So in your article, you're really -- you are trying to make the argument that, look, Donald Trump appealed to men who may not be where they want to be in life by saying, look, it's not really your fault. It's because of the, you know, it's because of women and DEI programs, and that kind of thing. But then you look at, you know, a hire like Susie Wiles to be his Chief of Staff, the first female Chief of Staff, a very powerful position. What do you make of that?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's not representative of what he's done generally. He certainly has an elevated women in his policymaking. And one of the things that you have to consider when you think about what our dominant mode of masculinity is, is that it's not just men that buy into it. White women voted in huge amounts for Trump, and partly because they consider themselves adjacent in that power structure to white men.There are a lot of non-white men who voted for Trump on the same basis because they have an idea of what a leader should look like. And it's someone who should embody all of these qualities. So Trump can occasionally hire a woman in a position of prominence or a non-white person, or maybe a gay person, or any other person who has an identity that he spent most of the campaign denigrating. And it doesn't really change the fact that his rhetoric heavily elevated white men and told white men that this is, you know, you belong at the top of the hierarchy. This is the natural order of things. And that's what makes it morally correct and good.",

But then, their definitions of what a healthy strong person is skew heavily toward these very regressive masculine ideals.So you don't have to go very far from somebody like Joe Rogan, who's very mainstream, to get to somebody like Andrew Tate, who is a more, you know, directly misogynistic podcaster who's very popular with younger men. And what these people are promising younger men is a way to live a life where they're successful, they're successful with women in particular, and they can make themselves into figures like Donald Trump who are wealthy and, you know, at the top of the power hierarchy.",

He had already done the interview with Trump on some of Trump's terms and he'd done it earlier, you know, that it seems like the as to Harris was last minute. But also, you know, he could have made that work and he chose not to.And I think partly because he knows that his core audience is heavily composed of people who like Donald Trump because he embodies these ideals of masculinity. And I doubt he wanted to alienate them. You know, Joe Rogan is still a businessman, you know, so it's not just a matter of him. He's not a journalist. He's not trying to get to the truth. He's running his own show in a way that he would run it personally.",
