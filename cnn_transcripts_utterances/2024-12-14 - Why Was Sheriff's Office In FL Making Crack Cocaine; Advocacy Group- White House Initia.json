And so there's a strong black liberation presentation that comes out of the city of Chicago as it relates to being a sanctuary city.Look, the law is very clear. Local police officers are not federal agents. That is clear. This so-called border czar seems to be getting educated more and more throughout, you know, his, I guess, his speaking tour. It's unfortunate though, that there is an abominable ignorance that exists within the Trump administration that continues to displace and cause chaos. If they're really serious about reforming the immigration policies in this country, President-elect Donald Trump has control over the Senate, the House as well as the judicial branch of government. President Biden put together a bipartisan bill to strengthen the border, to create more judges so that we can move asylum seekers through the process faster.

And so how this all came to be, at a Greyhound bus station, in a locker, there was about a kilo of cocaine powder cocaine that was found. It was abandoned, and it wasn't pursuant to any type of vet investigation that was in Broward County at that time.And so the Broward County Sheriff's Department sees that, and pursuant to the department's policy, they were supposed to destroy the powder cocaine or the kilos of cocaine that was found in that locker. Rather than destroy that abandoned evidence, they decided to go to their crime lab and submit it to a chemist and cook up crack cocaine to then distribute in a reverse sting in primarily black and brown neighborhoods and also advantageously, within a thousand feet of certain schools and certain buildings that are prohibited by statute.",

I grew up in a generation, or I was a part of a generation of youth that were negatively impacted by the crack epidemic, whether it be by the violence that was exhibited in our communities or the addiction that my loved ones and close friends and family members had due to the drug, but also the failed policies by decision makers that negatively impacted our communities for the worse.And so it was important for me, once this was brought to my attention, that we do the right thing. Look, these files are in our archives department, our archives storage unit. Old boxes with dust tucked away in a storage unit. And so we were in the process of following through with our statutory permissible retention schedules, where we could destroy certain records past a certain period. This was brought to my attention by my archives department and attorneys in my office who had worked here during that time period. And it was unsettling to them at the time when all of this was going on. And when I read it, quite frankly, Victor, I thought it was from a bad episode of The Wire. I thought it was a script that they were. They wasn't going to use it anymore. And I was. I was unsettled by that. And actually, it disturbed my spirit.

So sadly, there are many people like her who are dying at this very moment in Gaza, many people like her who want to get out of Gaza and they're not able to because president Biden has not changed his policy.I'm so happy this young girl is going to get out and get the treatment she needs, God willing. But there are so many more who need it. And the key thing is to stop the war. That is the thing that needs to happen so people can get out whether going to Europe, Egypt, America to get treatment, that's fine. But the war has to stop for that to happen.",

The National Council on Teacher Quality Study finds that only 21 percent of teachers now are from historically disadvantaged racial groups. That's compared to 49 percent of the students. That is a massive gap that is continuing to widen.Let's talk about this now with Dr. Tequilla Brownie. She's the CEO of TNTP, formerly the New Teacher Project, an education nonprofit. It's one of several groups backing a campaign to add 1 million teachers of color to the workforce by 2031. Dr. Brownie, thank you for being with me. I think most people, let's start here, understand the value and virtue of diverse teacher workforce and having that reflect the students. But is it measurable? Are the outcomes better if the -- the teaching staff looks more like the students? DR. TEQUILLA BROWNIE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TNTP: Well, good morning, Victor, and thank you so much for having me on the show this morning. And your question is absolutely the fundamental question. And that question is what all needs to be true for all students to thrive in the -- in their educational experience as well as in careers and in life. And it's no one thing. We know that multiple interventions are needed to help our young people gain the way that they need to academically. And we also know that the research is clear. A more diverse teacher workforce does lead to improved academic outcomes for all students, including and particularly for students of color.",

When we did the calculation, we found that we would need to add 1 million new educators of color by the year 2030 if we wanted to close that gap, the diversity gap that you mentioned. And so we've been collaborating with policymakers, with elected officials, with leaders in all sectors, across national levels, state levels and local levels to actually do the work to increase that number. We know some of the things that would turn that number around and we need to make sure that we're implementing those.",

And when first gen co -- when first gen students enter their professions, to your point, do the math, is it logical to go into a profession that's not going to have the return on your investment?Now, unfortunately, the path to getting to teaching does include several financial hurdles. There is also the work of once you get into the profession, what are the working conditions? And what we find is that between the barriers to entry, financial seat time and otherwise, and then once teachers of color get into the field, we're not doing enough to retain them. So it's not an either or. We have to do more both to increase the number of teachers through recruitment, but also elevate the profession to make sure it's actually a meaningful, worthwhile and tenable job and then do the work to retain our strong, effective, diverse teachers.",

The milestone the Recording Industry Association of America gives to songs that sell a million units. The song was released back on January 9th, 1981, nearly 44 years ago. But the new milestone comes just three months after Frankie Beverly passed at the age of 77. His band Maze described the song as the unofficial theme of summer and any gathering of people who have come to party. That is the truth.Art offers sanctuary to everyone willing to open their hearts as well as their eyes. That's a line of a poem by Nikki Giovanni, who we lost this week at age 81. Nikki Giovanni was an acclaimed poet, an activist, an author, professor, an icon of the black arts and civil rights movement. She knew and worked with Rosa Parks, Aretha Franklin, James Baldwin, Nina Simone, Muhammad Ali, Tupac. So for this latest edition of Art is Life, I spoke with Shinique Smith. She worked on an installation that featured Nikki -- Nikki Giovanni's poetry and voice. I asked Shinique to reflect on that project and what collaborating with such an influential figure was like.
