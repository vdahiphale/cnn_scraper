I know you try to reach your husband and your kids -- you try to get them to talk to himHow do you do it? When was the last time you managed and how long can you talk for? KARA-MURZA: The last time I talked to my husband was last summer, in summer 2023. My kids were allowed a 15-minute phone call with their dad at the end of December of last year. And since we have three kids it meant that each of them got five minutes on the phone with their dad and that was the first call in over half a year. And I obviously had to measure those minutes with a timer because I could not allow one of our kids to speak to their father for longer than five minutes. So in the conditions in which Vladimir is being kept now, and that is a punishment cell in so-called special regime prison colony in western Siberia, he's not allowed any visits by family members. He's not allowed any calls and only under exceptional circumstances. So in mid-February, we celebrated our 20th anniversary and Vladimir requested a phone call with me and was denied. The Russian -- the prison authorities told him that this was not an exceptional circumstance. As was not our oldest daughter's 18th birthday. So they told him that death would be an exceptional circumstance. Other than that, he's not allowed any phone calls.",

He then survived yet another one in 2017.

Here is even an intercepted signal one unit told us they had hacked from a Russian drone. You can see it maneuvering into a Ukrainian target. Near the heavily-contested village of Robotyne, down in the bunkers where the drone wars are fought, this change is huge and has come with an apparent complication for the Ukrainians too. Their Starlink speeds have been getting slower, said this commander. ANTON, UKRAINE'S 65TH MECHANIZED BRIGADE: Before New Year the speed was much higher. Now it decreased by half.
