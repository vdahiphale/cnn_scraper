Well, Kasie, I mean, clearly no one going into yesterday was expecting what happened to unfold about a little after six just shortly after Donald Trump had taken this stage. That is when we had heard. I mean, I was standing on the risers reporting on his speech on what was happening. I could hear from the right side of the stage right of Donald Trump's shoulder.That was where the shots where the shots were coming from. Of course, in the moment, it was unclear what it was. We later learned that it was these shots and bullets being shot toward the venue. Now Donald Trump immediately dropped to the ground. You could hear chaos in the crowd. People were screaming. You could hear Secret Service telling everyone to get down. It was absolute pandemonium in there. And then afterward, I would say people were really angry. Everyone was -- I saw who I saw in the crowd immediately after we're shocked at what had happened, some people had turned to their anger on the press I think seeking an outlet for what had happened. And I did have an opportunity to talk with many of the attendees immediately following the event after we were all escorted out of the premises. I spoke with one man. His name is Joseph Meyn. He actually was sitting behind the stage in the bleachers and was next to where one man was fatally killed. I want you to take a listen to what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH MEYN, RALLY ATTENDEE: You know, I knew it was gunfire, but I couldn't quite tell where it was coming from. It's not like it was coming from behind the bleachers. And a man in the bleachers kind of to the right of me in the bleachers, took a gunshot wound to the head was killed. And another woman -- I don't know exactly where she was on bleach, I think she was either behind me or to the right of me, she got around in the -- she got hit in the forearm and hand it looked like.

They told me that they had heard him screaming, asking for his shoes as Secret Service was trying to escort him out that they were very relieved to see him get up and put his fist in the air and scream fight.

Very grateful to all of you for joining us in the historic aftermath of this horrible event.

What you're looking for in those hundreds of interviews is a person like this who had direct eyewitness account of the moments leading up to the attack.So it's amazing -- it's a great interview and I'm sure that guy has probably been identified and talked to by law enforcement already. So what -- one of the things that the FBI is going to be looking at is how did this person gain access to the building? We all know there's huge questions about why the Secret Service may have left that building unattended. But this person gives us additional perspective. We know from what he said that there were police in the area. He described them as police, which would be consistent with the way the service protects a large area like this. They keep the closest place around the protectee. That inner circle is covered exclusively by secret service officers. And then as you go further and further out from the protectee, that's where you have the partners stepping in to assist in securing the premises. And typically local police officers are on the outermost perimeter for a variety of reasons. There's more of them and they know the community better. And there -- that's what they're there for, to kind of spot things like this. This witness can also help you identify the actual police officers that were in the area. So you, you know, these are additional interviews that you'll be able to conduct to find out exactly where people were, what they were looking at, what they saw or didn't see. And all of those facts are going to go together to form this kind of, you know, patchwork of information that gives us the big picture exactly how this guy got to that roof at that moment. And that's a big, you know, a big thing that the FBI wants to know to understand how the attack happened, but it's also going to shed a lot of light on whatever investigation the Secret Service does. And of course, now we know the congressional investigation as well. And these moments help expose for us weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the security plan.",

Thank God that this was a close call. I'm just -- I'm struck today by where we are in this political moment, the parallels to 1968.The fact that we live in an era of heightened political rhetoric. And I think it comes down to all of us with platforms and with voices in the media to our political leaders. We need to take the tone and tenor of our rhetoric down. I am a critic of the former president, a man, I once greatly esteemed and deeply care about and I still try to pray for every night. You can critique policy. You can critique our politician's character. But there's legitimate political rhetoric, and then there is rhetoric that is meant to incite, and we see it too much. Then add to this, we're living in the era of information warfare. On your device every day, we are all targeted with information meant to make us hate our fellow American. Meant to tear us apart from within to divide this country. And our adversary's fingerprints are all over it. This past week alone, if you spent any time on X, you would have seen rampant disinformation about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, stuff that a simple Google search could show you was not true. No credible news outlet had shared it, but there it was getting retweeted by resistance Twitter millions and millions of times. Already today, you see wrong information about the known shooter. We have to be careful in what we're sharing, what we're spreading, and how we're engaging in this political space. Policy is OK to critique. Critiquing politicians is as American as apple pie, but violent or escalatory rhetoric, it needs to stop for the sake of our country.",

And what we -- we hear this phrase very often is, is both siderism (ph). No, my rhetoric's not the problem. Your rhetoric is the problem. When we say it with anger. Everyone's rhetoric needs to calm down and tone down. And if we look at the days after Gabby Giffords was shot -- and Bryan Lanza brought this up earlier. Sarah Palin was sort of accused of with her rhetoric and using terms like bullseye and target. You can't say that. That's fair. But we all use that rhetoric. And we don't just use those terms that we use in sports and football games and baseball games and so forth. But we use it to attack people. We use it with hate. We use it with anger. And to Alyssa's point, yes, we can disagree over policy. Of course we can. The problem is, and this has ramped itself up in the last six, seven years. Trump and his campaign have done that. Trump's opponents have done that. Is whatever we say isn't just a disagreement on policy. It's that you're not wrong on something, you're lying, you're evil. Well, sometimes you're lying. Sometimes you may be evil. But everybody is lying. Everyone is evil. And therefore, these things, and January 6th, and the shooting on Steve Scalise, isn't accidental, it's inevitable.

And I feel like that's what's coming given that it is a very easy political point. And just to clarify, this is Andrew McCabe and Jonathan Wackrow were talking about this a little bit. The Secret Service is responsible for the president's safety, but also candidate safety. Former President Trump is a candidate for office, gets Secret Service protection. The FBI will be responsible for any terrorism or counterterrorism investigation that happens here. Those are two very different functions under government.

This would have been the summer of 2020. You all will remember President Trump was moved from the press briefing room. Turned out it was off campus. And he had sort of that same poise that we saw last night, where he actually reacted quite quickly under these circumstances. And I would hope that for him and for those around him, it's a moment to realize the whole world is watching him, his supporters are in the tone of his rhetoric around this matters. We're going into the convention. There's going to be really high emotions. There's going to be really strong feelings. People have a right to be angry. I am angry that somebody tried to assassinate the former president. But how do we convey that? It's our words matter. Looking forward and bringing the country together matters. And I'm just really praying that this could somehow be a unifying moment, which feels distant in our current politics, but I'll be looking at both of the candidates to see how they use this and how they try to bring the country together.",

There's been a fairly consistent messaging from the director of the FBI, from the secretary of Homeland Security and from their kind of counterterrorist experts that the kind of political discourse in this country was fueling greater concern about domestic terrorist threats. And we're seeing more and more groups arise. We're seeing more activity among those groups. The numbers bear it out. The number of domestic terrorism investigations in the FBI is elevated considerably over the last few years. The number of threats targeting political leaders and political leadership and political figures is off the charts.The Capitol -- U.S. Capitol Police is like overwhelmed with threat traffic and threats that they have to respond to, to cover the protection of members of Congress. So, the temperature has been rising, you know -- we, you know, often we use that metaphor of like, you know, the frog and the kettle of water as it boils. We -- if we're not thinking about this all the time, we're not perceiving this elevation of threat within the country. But it has been happening all around us for the last several years. I mean, you know, hopefully, this is a moment in which specifically political leaders think about the things they say and the way they interact with their supporters. There is no question that as that rhetoric becomes coarser, more confrontational, more kind of militaristic allusions to violence and like vanquishing your enemies and all that kind of nonsense, that's the sort of speech that really appeals to extremists. And those are the folks that law enforcement and intelligence are worried about. It's not the average, you know, person who has a strong political belief and goes to rallies and things like that. You're worried about what the most extreme elements of the political spectrum, how they hear those -- that language and how they respond to it. There -- you know, they oftentimes in their manifestos or comments they make after attempted attacks, they reference things that they believe that that language -- that those leaders are speaking to them. You've heard a number of January 6th defendants have said exactly that. They explained the fact that they were on the Capitol and they participated in the violence because they thought that the former president had told them to go there. So, what people say, and particularly political leaders, what they say and how they say it has an enormous impact on the most concerning and vulnerable part of the political population, and those are people who are so extreme in their views that they might resort to violence.",

They were reporters telling me about covering Ted Kennedy in 1980 and being worried about that family's history. And then, of course, what happened with Ronald Reagan in 1981. And I of course had grown up with my family, my mother and others talking about the John F. Kennedy assassination. And I have to say that when I first started out here in Washington, these were memories, this was history. Now, it is real. It is with us. We are back in this place. And I just want to -- we'll be back in just a minute. But I do want to leave you here with a look back at one of the times when our nation collectively had to experience something like this.

And then, there were three -- I think it was three more shots after that, but the caliber of the gun was very different than the first shots. So, I guessed in that moment that that was, you know, a response to what happened. And you know, the president was almost defiant in wanting to get up and get up on his own and to want to -- you know, I've covered the president for eight years, nine years, I've interviewed him 10 times, you know, that moment when he puts his fist up, when you're -- whatever way you feel about the president, that was very him. He wanted to project to people that he was OK. I think elected officials and in particular presidents, right, they always -- because America is thought of as this pillar of strength, they always want to project that to make people feel safe, no matter who is the president. They always want to project that because I think that they have -- they feel, and knowing Trump in the way that I do, they have this sense of it is what people need and the need to see it's OK.
