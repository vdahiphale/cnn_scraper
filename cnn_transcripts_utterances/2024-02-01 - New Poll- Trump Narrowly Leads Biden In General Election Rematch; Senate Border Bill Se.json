What she said today in defense of her parenting. And later and just in time for our election, CNN's Donie O'Sullivan brings us the story of a recent election elsewhere, which was touched by AI deepfake technology and the candidate is warning us to brace for impact here. Good evening, everyone. John Berman here in for Anderson. We begin tonight with fresh evidence for anyone who believes for better or worse, that the Republican Party is not on its way to nominating the strongest candidate against President Biden. New CNN polling, now, as with all polling is just a snapshot, but it does follow a trend. In it, President Biden trails Donald Trump by four points which is just outside the margin of error. That's the same as it was as far back as last October. On the other hand, when matched up against Nikki Haley, that gap widens to double digit, 13 points. Thirteen points versus four points for Trump. Her problem continues to be persuading Republicans even in South Carolina, her home state where she is the underdog in the primary there later this month. CNN's Jake Tapper spoke with her earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, we remember Nikki Haley for being the one who didn't accept Medicaid and hospitals shut down. I mean, we remember the assault on the poor. We remember the assault on women. We still have a corridor of shame under Republican leadership. So Democrats aren't fools and are going to play this national game. I do think though that to the point that was made a minute ago, Donald Trump actually is very scared of Nikki Haley, and South Carolinians know that Nikki Haley is a very shrewd politician. I think most people would want to see Nikki Haley and Donald Trump on the stage together, but we know that's not the case.

Almost a month ago, to the day, he told CNN: \"Let me tell you, I'm not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help Joe Biden's approval rating.\" As we and others have been reporting and as a number of Republican senators allege, that is also the former president's motivation, Donald Trump's motivation, none of which is sitting well with another Republican in the Texas delegation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): I'm extremely disappointed in the very strange maneuvering by many on the right to torpedo a potential border reform bill. That's what we all ran on doing. So if we have a bill that decreases illegal immigration, that's an if. Right? We didn't see what's in it. But if we have a bill that -- on that -- significantly decreases illegal immigration and we sabotage that, that is inconsistent with what we told our voters we would do.

But it is very unclear whether this is actually going to pass. As a reminder, anything needs 60 votes in the Senate in order to advance, but this package is already facing opposition from the right, from former President Donald Trump, and even from the left with some Democrats concerned that this conservative proposal goes too far in heeding to some of Republicans demands. And even if it passes the Senate, John, this bill is dead on arrival in the House.

Perhaps the lawyer is saying, look, you may want to call that person, you may think that person is helpful to you, but remember, you can be attacked on credibility, they can be impeached, not just a political term, but in a courtroom to mean at their credibility is attacked, that something as a part of the trial has already come up, that you open the door for the prosecution in their rebuttal case, after we rest as defense to come and use against you.

One is the the waves of migrants who have come here and the city struggled to be able to provide for them with what the mayor has said many times, Eric Adams, not enough help from the federal government. At the same time, you have this incident that highlights some of the tensions where you've got an assault on police officers trying to make an arrest by a group outside a migrant shelter.And then they are tracked down and arrested by detectives, brought to court where the district attorney's office does not ask for them to be held on bail, even though they literally have no roots in the community here. And now they are traveling, according to my sources in the NYPD, on a bus towards the Mexican border under false names after getting tickets from a faith-based charity organization. So, you see a lot of tension here and some anger on the idea of what the police detectives union, Paul DiGiacomo, is calling a broken criminal justice system.",

Now this ex-girlfriend ended up really being a key witness in the federal investigation into the congressman. She was granted immunity for any criminal liability she could potentially have. And she testified before the grand jury in that investigation. But, of course, the Justice Department wrapped up its probe into the congressman last year without any charges being filed. Now, this outreach is significant because it's another sign. This ethics probe is expanding to include looking at potential sex trafficking, possible illicit drug use, and also these questions about whether the congressman received anything improper in terms of trips and other gifts he may have received. These are the kinds of things a sex girlfriend was asked about in the federal investigation and may be asked about here. But she is not expected to cooperate voluntarily in the ethics probe.

WATSON (on-camera): It's a big question. It's long been a big question for economists and investors the reliability of these numbers, especially back in August when the government announced it would stop publishing youth unemployment numbers after several months of record highs. The mood has changed a lot. You know, foreign companies, they used to line up to try to get access to the huge Chinese market. Last year, for the first time in 25 years, John, foreign direct investment into China went into the negative. That means foreign companies appeared to be pulling out more money than they were investing into their corporations -- into their operations. Companies like Vanguard, that asset management company, telling CNN it was selling its stake and closing its office in Shanghai at the end of last year. So the Chinese government, it's got a long way to go to rebuild its credibility with international corporations, and also I'd argue with ordinary Chinese consumers.
