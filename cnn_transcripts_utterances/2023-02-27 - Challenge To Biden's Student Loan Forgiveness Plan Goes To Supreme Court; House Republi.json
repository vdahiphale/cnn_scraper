But one of the big reasons and perhaps the first one the court has to deal with is whether the states even have the right to sue in the first place. Tell us about that.",

It is very consequential for borrowers but also for how the Supreme Court handles challenges to executive branch actions.And the first thing is, if you're going to sue and get into court and have your case heard on the merits, you have to show a direct injury from the action that you're challenging. And in this case, six states and two individuals who didn't qualify for the full forgiveness have sued. And the states say they're -- they have a couple different claims on the standing issue for why they should be able to bring the case. That some of their general taxes to the states for loan discharges and consolidations would be effective. And the most specific allegation is that a Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, which actually services loans and receives fees from borrowers, that that would be affected. So that is how states are claiming that they have standing. The Biden administration counters that, in terms of the general taxing issues, they are too speculative and indirect. And for the Missouri Education Loan Authority, what the Biden lawyers will argue tomorrow in court is that that is not an arm of the state. That Missouri entity, which does have issues and could have some consequences, cannot be considered one of the states. Any losses it suffers cannot be attributable to the states. And -- (CROSSTALK)",

And here, the challengers are saying the government has gone too far affecting a half trillion of money due to the Education Department. But the Biden administration says that that Heroes Act, as it was called, from 2003, precisely allows this kind of action in an emergency, as Covid-19 was and how Covid-19's economic fallout continues. And what the Biden administration says is, look, in the past, the court has certainly brought down the hammer on executive branch regulations, major regulations. But here, it is saying those precedents shouldn't really apply because this isn't a regulation. It's just pure forgiveness of these loans.

So EPA saw this plan of Norfolk Southern's on Friday, stopped those shipments to both Texas and Michigan. And now they have identified two approved sites in Ohio to deal with both the liquid waste and the solid waste from this derailment. There are hundreds of thousands of gallons of liquid waste that need to be dealt with and tons of solid waste that needs to be dealt with as well. This is going to be a long-term effort though. They're digging wells around the most contaminated part. They're testing the air, the water, both the municipal and private wells. So far, no signs of contamination outside the immediate area. But the wells they are digging around the contaminated site will tell officials probably over the next months if not years to come whether that ground water is seeping and moving into other parts of the ecosystem -- Abby?",

What authorities are saying about the death of this high-profile social media influencer when we return. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:46:38] PHILLIP: A horrifying story out of Hong Kong now. Four members of the same family are charged with the gruesome murder and dismemberment of a model and social media influencer. I want to warn you, you might find some of the descriptions in this next story disturbing. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout reports for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A fashion model and mother brutally murdered in Hong Kong in a case that is sending shock waves through the usually safe city. Twenty-eight-year-old Abby Choi was a well-known social media influencer with more than 100,000 followers on Instagram who, just weeks ago, appeared on the digital cover of a luxury magazine. She was reported missing on Wednesday. On Friday, police say pieces of her body were found in a refrigerator in the northern district of Hong Kong. They also found a meat slicer and an electric saw. And later police discovered a head, ribs, and hair in a soup pot. (END VIDEO CLIP) SUPT. ALAN CHUNG, HONG KONG POLICE: It was a skull with hair. OK? As I said, unfortunately, there is a hole on the right-side rear on the skull, so the pathologist believes that that should be the fatal, fatal attack on the victim. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They are all accused of murder. Kwong's mother also appeared in court. She's accused of obstructing the case. All four were denied bail. (voice-over): Over the weekend, authorities launched a massive search operation to track down the rest of the model's remains. They deployed more than 100 police officers, including a team and divers to search a cemetery and nearby catch water. They're still looking for several body parts.

      "sentences": "Yes, Abby. So it is always great for a jury to take this field trip to the crime scene because they can actually see, they can measure distance. In this case, it is not just about the acoustics. They can really seehow this two-shooter theory may have worked out, how long it takes to go from the golf cart from the house to the kennels and back. The phone service, I mean, that is key, right? The time of death that this prosecution has been proceeding on for seven weeks is based on phone data and a lack of activity on a phone. Part of the argument being that, in certain parts of Moselle, the property, you don't get cell service. They could turn their phones on and see if that's really true. It is really important. And it is not a dire know, but I think they will be given a chance to go there and see for themselves. One of the things I want to add about today's testimony of the pathologist, the time of death. If the time of death can be determined by just a lack of texting or calling or activity on the phone , I mean, you and I could technically be dead right now because we're not using our phone. It is the most preposterous thing I have ever heard. So today is the first day that we're hearing science after eight weeks of trial. The defense is bringing the science. And they're, in fact, introducing into evidence the autopsy report that the state pathologist did that obviously was not good for them. It's major today.",

It was right -- the gun was up against his head. It was that force that literally blew his brain out of his skull. So that was very different than what the state pathologist had said. Then there was a forensic scientist, Abby, who came on. This was really impactful because the defense had floated this theory a while ago about maybe two shooters because there were two weapons used, a rifle and a shotgun. And this forensic scientist came on and he said he believes there were two shooters. He doesn't think that one person, man or woman, could have done this. Here is what he said in court.

You can't handle and shoot two of them. So you either have to put one down, use one and then swap out and grab the other one. Or I suppose you off one on a sling.
