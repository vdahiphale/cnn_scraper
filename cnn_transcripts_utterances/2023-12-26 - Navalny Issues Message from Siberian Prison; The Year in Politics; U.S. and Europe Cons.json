Navalny has been missing since December 11th, just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his re-election plans. Navalny set out a series of tweets. One of them reads, \"don't worry about me, I'm fine. I'm totally relieved that I finally made it.\"Nada Bashir joins us live from London with more. When I saw the news break, I was first relieved, right, that he's OK, people were wondering where he was, but what do we know about where he is now being held?",

And, of course, while we have now heard directly from Navalny after two weeks of no contact between his legal team and the Kremlin critic and what has certainly come as a moment of relief for many, this is a huge moment of also concern considering the conditions that are said to be inside that penal colony.Now, as you mentioned, we have heard from Navalny. He shared those updates via his aides who posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, this morning. He spoke of his relief after what he described to be an exhausting 20-day journey to get to this remote penal colony in the northwestern Siberian region of Kharp. He also spoke of seeing what he described to be like a movie scene of a convoy, including soldiers, security forces with machine guns. But, again, he said he is doing well, that he had been able to meet and speak with his lawyer. And he thanked supporters for their concern. But, again, there is concern amongst his closest supporters, including the director of his anticorruption foundation. He shared an update yesterday upon the news that Navalny had been located, issuing this statement regarding the penal colony, saying, \"the conditions there are harsh, with a special regime in the permafrost zone. It is very difficult to get there, and there are no letter delivery systems.\" There is also reporting in local government media in Siberia regarding the more general conditions of this Polar Wolf penal colony, saying that the focus there is on re-education through occupational therapy. Navalny, of course, a key Kremlin critic. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison back in August on charges relating to extremes. And, of course, these are charges he denies. His legal team believe these are politically motivated charges.",

MCKEND (voice over): Menendez and his wife are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, including gold bars, cash, and a luxury vehicle, in exchange for the senator's influence. The indictment led Menendez to step aside as chair of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee. But the New Jersey Democrat and his wife maintain their innocence and have pleaded not guilty. He has pledged to remain in his seat despite calls from many lawmakers to resign, including from some of his fellow Senate Democrats.

It was, if countries are -- get accustomed to putting money in the New York Federal Reserve, some of which they keep in the form of gold, some of it they just keep as assets in U.S. dollars, and they think the United States could seize that money in a war time situation or for any other reason without going through a lengthy legal process, they might be less willing to put their money and their assets in U.S. dollars.But I think as time has gone on, and as it has become clear that Congress either won't provide additional aid to Ukraine or will provide it in lesser amounts than we've seen in the past two years, there has been greater and greater pressure to find a way to go do this.

Obviously, it's going to take more than $300 billion to make up for the damage that the Russians have done in nearly two years of war.
