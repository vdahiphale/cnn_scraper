He will reportedly highlight Donald Trump's role in those threats. He is expected -- Biden, that is -- to say in part, quote, \"There is something dangerous happening in America. There is an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of our democracy. The MAGA movement.\" At the same time, the House Oversight Committee will hold its first hearing in the Biden impeachment investigation, and they will also discuss the Constitution. Chairman James Comer says a constitutional expert is going to testify today as to why he thinks an impeachment investigation is justified. And last night, Biden was one of the chief targets of attacks at the second Republican presidential debate -- listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Joe Biden should not be on the picket line. He should be on the southern border working to close our southern border because it is unsafe, wide open, and insecure. MIKE PENCE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Bidenomics has failed. Wages are not keeping up with inflation. Auto workers and all American workers are feeling it and families are struggling in this economy. And Joe Biden's Green New Deal agenda is good for Beijing and bad for Detroit. GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The reason why people are striking in Detroit is because of Joe Biden's interference with capital markets and with free markets. The subsidies -- we're subsidizing the automakers but particularly, we're subsidizing electric vehicles. (END VIDEO CLIP) HARLOW:  Joining us now to respond to all of that, one of the president's closest allies, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons. Senator, good morning. Thank you for being here. SEN.

And we've had unemployment at its lowest level for the longest time in our lifetime.

Given this administration's stance, is it a guarantee from the administration that they will not cost those American jobs in the auto sector?[07:35:03] COONS:  Look, in a global competition for who is going to be building the automobiles of this century, Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress have made a critical strategic bet. A bet that the economy is going to follow a clean energy future globally. That's what our competitors in Europe, and in Japan, and in China are doing. All of their automakers are transitioning rapidly to electric vehicles. And in the Inflation Reduction Act, we lay the groundwork for that -- not with mandates, but with incentives. With tax incentives that are part of why you're seeing record groundbreakings in new battery factories, new automobile factories, and new manufacturing-related construction here in the United States. In fact, I've been in meetings in Europe where our close allies and partners in the fight to help Ukraine regain their territory have complained bitterly that we in the United States are rocketing ahead of them and creating a risk of their major industrial companies choosing to move to the United States. So I'm optimistic about this. And frankly, if you look back to when the auto industry was in bankruptcy -- was nearing collapse in the United States in '08-'09, it was then-Vice President Joe Biden who fought hard to save the American auto industry.
