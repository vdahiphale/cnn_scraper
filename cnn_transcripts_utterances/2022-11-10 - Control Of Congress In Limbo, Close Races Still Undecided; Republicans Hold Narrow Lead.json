Let's just get that out of the way right now. But results are coming in and we made a projection last hour. There are several, several of the close races that we are tracking still have not been called.Right now, Republicans in terms of the balance of power in Washington, Republicans hold 49 Senate seats, Democrats 48 Senate seats, three races are still undecided. And let's look at those races. Arizona is one of the keys. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, he's currently leading his Republican challenger, Blake Masters. And then in Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt holds a narrow lead over Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. And in Georgia, Senator Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker, they are back on the campaign trail. They are headed to a runoff. Again, this all happens next month. Now, let's look at the House. The Republicans inching closer to retaking the majority, but right now we have to say it is far from a done deal. Nearly three dozen races remain undecided. President Biden, his take on all of it. He says the results represent a good day for democracy as his party avoided and expected Republican blowout. Though we still will see, if Democrats or Republicans remain in the majority in the House especially, we are covering all of this for you with reporters in key states throughout this hour. And John Berman on those undecided races here with me in studio in the Senate especially, all right. What do you say in this hour?",

      "sentences": "Well, one thing I just want to make abundantly clear is not only, do we not know who will control the Senate, we don't know when we will know, right? These are the races that are still undecided. Georgia is going to a runoff in December that much we know, Nevada and Arizona. Well, let me show you what happens. Right now, you have a Republican ahead in Nevada, a Democrat ahead in Arizona. But if the Republicans happen to win both the states, they get 51 seats, they control the Senate. The runoff in Georgia doesn't impact that. However, the Democrats are ahead in Arizona. If they happen to also win Nevada, then they have 50 seats. Kamala Harris would break the tie and they maintain control. So, either of those scenarios are possible. It's especially possible given how close those races are right now in both Arizona and Nevada.Let's take a close look at where things stand in Nevada. 15,000 votes separate Adam Laxalt from the incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. His lead has shrunk overnight as there was more mail ballot counted from Clark County and also from Washoe County. We think there's about 135,000 votes left. That is an estimate. That's what CNN thinks the estimate currently is left in Nevada. If Catherine Cortez Masto can win 60 percent or maybe even a little less than 60 percent of that, she could overtake Adam Laxalt. And in Arizona the situation is almost the reverse. You have Mark Kelly, the Democrat ahead by 95,000 votes, Blake Masters, the Republican, he is behind. That was closer last night, but there were new ballots counted or there were ballots that were counted in Pima County right here last night. Also, in Maricopa County right here, Mark Kelly's lead grew. There are 560,000 votes remaining roughly in this state. That's a lot of vote left, predominantly from Maricopa County, but also a bunch from Pima County. The trick will be what does this vote look like. The vote that was processed yesterday, it's skewed toward Mark Kelly. But we've seen in the past some of the late arriving male vote in Arizona has skewed toward the Republican, not impossible with that much runway, 560,000 votes for Blake Masters to make up that 95,000- vote margin.

We know that there are 560,000 ballots still yet to be counted in the entire state, but the bulk of those 400,000 to 410,000 are right here in Maricopa County.You see that the election workers are diligently doing their jobs at this hour. There is a huge load of ballots that has just gone through the machine. You see the young woman putting those ballots in a box. So those ballots have gone through the tabulation machines. And we will hear in the evening our time, around 6pm, Arizona time 8pm your time, new numbers, the new tabulations from some of those early votes. And then eventually, once they get through some of those 400,000 votes, as we get closer and closer to Friday, Saturday, we're expecting to have about 95 percent, potentially of all of the votes counted. And it'll give us a much better idea just how close these cases are and if someone is a clear winner. Back to you guys.",

How many outstanding ballots are out there. What I can tell you based on our latest news gathering and editorial, we know that there are at least 100,000 ballots that officials say that they have in their possession, that are being processed but are not reflected in the results yet.Here's the breakdown. We know that in Washoe County, there are about 20,000 ballots, and these are election day drop box and mail-in that they are still processing. They're still working through those to count them. And the results are not reflected yet in the totals. And then there is Clark County, we know of at least 80,000 ballots and these are election day drop box ballots, mail-in ballots, ballots is still need to be cured, and also provisional ballots. And again, these are not reflected yet in the totals, but officials tell us that the biggest thing here in Nevada, Kate, is that they don't know how many are outstanding. And that's because all point one- eight million of registered voters on this they opted out. They received a ballot in the mail, and so long as that ballot is it was turned into a mailbox on election day, postmarked it could be counted until Saturday. Kate?",

What we're also seeing, Kate, is just money pour into this state. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, they are a key fundraising operation for Senate Democrats. They have pledged $7 million to boost Senator Warnock. And that is going to go to field organizing, really to help get out the vote. For his part Walker, getting a boost as well, more than a million dollars from an anti- abortion group. You know, Georgians actually don't have all that much time. It's just about four weeks till this run off.

And more broadly, a power sharing situation that this White House has not yet had to deal with.Now, the last thing that we also heard President Biden talk about yesterday was the successful exercise of democracy.

In 2018, a lot of those late arriving ballots that were dropped off on election day actually benefited the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. In 2020 that election day drop off piece of the equation was a very heavily pro Trump vote and made Biden's, you know, why did vantage in Arizona remarkably narrow. I mean, he won it by, you know, I think 11,000 votes or something like that, maybe a bit more than that. So, I'm watching that. And in Nevada, everything I'm speaking to Democrats and Republicans, our analysts at our decision desk, everybody is waiting to understand the nature of these votes that are in these drop boxes that were dropped off on the day of the election. It is like a black box to everyone right now. We just do not know the nature of those votes inside those drop boxes, that will give us as clear picture as possible going forward in Nevada.",

The Republican rebuttal is, no, no, no, it was raining. There's a whole bunch of votes in that box of people who are probably Republicans that didn't want to stand in line.

So, what happens in a runoff when you don't even have somebody at the top of the ticket, who is actually bringing Republicans along. And so, it doesn't particularly bode well for Republicans. And I think that Biden's approach here is exactly right. It's not really the way Donald Trump thinks though, right?
