President Zelenskyy has a clear message, Ukraine will make NATO stronger. Then Israeli protests, tens of thousands of people are on the streets for what they call a day of disruption. We'll explain what's made them so angry. And historic and catastrophic. That's how the governor of Vermont described the flooding in his state, and it's nowhere near over. We begin tonight with major diplomatic movements in NATO. The chief of the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine will be invited to join, but only when the time is right. He laid out an easier path for the country's membership, but with no clear timeline on when it might happen. Moments after that announcement, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took to the stage in Vilnius, continuing his push for NATO's accession. He says Ukraine would make the alliance stronger. Well, this all comes as NATO gets closer to welcoming another member to their ranks, Sweden, after months of stalling. Turkey's president agreed on Monday to back Sweden's bid to join the group. Melissa Bell has all the details now from Vilnius. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (APPLAUSE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The sound of applause signaling a picture of unity. NATO kicking off one of its most consequential gatherings in recent decades, with a celebration of its growth. Finland is now a member, and Sweden will soon follow.

One of that hurdle being the membership action plan, which is essentially a series of steps, reforms, economic reforms, diplomatic, economic that other members have had to take in the past before being allowed into NATO. Ukraine has already proven itself, the NATO alliance says in many of those respects. And therefore, it will not have to go through those same steps before it can become a member. But there are still conditions that it needs to meet before it can become admitted into the alliance. And that is where Zelenskyy is likely not happy about what the communique that was released today, outlining their path to membership ultimately said. They still have to complete certain conditions that were not actually named. So the communique was very vague in that sense. They also can't join until there's unanimity among all the members that it is the right time for Ukraine to join. But again, that timeline was not exactly spelled out. And so what Ukraine had been asking for over the last many months leading up to this summit was a clear picture of its place in the NATO alliance and when it would actually become a full-fledged member. It did not really get either of those today. They did, you know, ease one hurdle for Ukraine to join the alliance, but others still remain, and ultimately, the alliance is still united on the fact that there will be no Ukraine in the alliance until the war with Russia is over. Of course, that raises additional thorny questions about whether that is simply incentivizing Vladimir Putin to continue the war and to remain in Ukraine so that Ukraine does not actually end up joining the alliance. So, all of these questions really still unanswered here, and Zelenskyy made it very clear that he's not particularly happy about this. Christina --",

He's always been demanding before they -- before NATO would even want to discuss it, tanks and air defense systems and the fighter aircraft. He was always ahead of the curve. And it feels that he's very much ahead of the curve again demanding this. I think there is a greater degree of frustration because it appears that he thought he was perhaps going to get some stronger language. And he explains it this way. He says it leaves open a window of opportunity to bargain Ukraine's membership in NATO, away in negotiations with Russia. It sounds like he's fearful, but at the end of all of this, somehow, Russia would still be in a position to have enough influence over the outcome of negotiations, that it could somehow tip the scales and influence the West, not to let Ukraine into NATO. Where we stand today, that seems inconceivable. So, is his fear irrational or is this a deep-rooted fear and a better understanding of the realities of the way that President Putin operates. So it's hard to tell. But for him, it seems very clear, and in keeping with everything we're seeing him doing in the past, demand and get the best for Ukraine. I think there's one tiny analogy here that's worth thinking of for Zelenskyy. He's got thousands of fighters in the trenches, fighting, losing their lives in a terrible war. His battle is to go in against, yet with, the world's biggest heavyweight diplomats and providers of armaments and get them to give him what he wants. He's fighting a battle in his own trenches, and I think, you know, it's a tough one, the same.",

What are the levers that the international community has over them? Well, one of the levers is the weapons that are supplied and the money to help finance the government. But the other one is to say, look, there are security guarantees you're going to get. NATO membership could be part of that package. But, you're going to have to stop the war here, because this is the best terms you're going to get from us, and from Russia. And I think Zelenskyy is aware of that, and he wants to be able to preempt any of that. And that's why it's so -- that's why he wants to get what he can't have at the moment, because he wants to shut down the possibility then in the future, this could be used as leverage to get them to back down and sue for peace, when they would like to go another year or whatever it is.",

ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): The move represents a stunning about face from Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had been opposing Sweden's accession for a year, leveraging his position and demanding concessions in exchange. Even linking Sweden's NATO bid to Turkiye's long-standing effort to join the European Union less than 24 hours before the summit. In response to the news, Russia said Turkiye is turning into an unfriendly country. After a series of, quote, \"provocative decisions.\" In another significant move, Erdogan violated an agreement with Moscow over the weekend by allowing five Ukrainian commanders, part of the Azovstal defense, previously captured by Russia, to return to the battlefield in Ukraine from Turkiye. The announcement came as president Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Erdogan in Istanbul, as part of a tour of NATO countries. Russia called it a stab in the back, claiming Turkiye was being pressured by NATO. Since the start of the war Ankara has opted for a delicate balancing act, keeping an open channel of communication with both Moscow and Kyiv. But Erdogan's surprise announcement on Sweden serves as a major blow to Vladimir Putin, paving the way for NATO to complete its expansion launched as a response to his invasion of Ukraine. It also comes just weeks after an attempted mutiny inside Russia by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, exposing cracks in Moscow's leadership and Putin's hold on power. Turkiye's decision has been welcomed by U.S. President Joe Biden, who had been ramping up pressure on Erdogan for months. Hours after the announcement, Washington said it intends to move forward with the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Turkiye, a request that has been on hold for nearly two years. It is unclear, however, if this aid came in response to Ankara's reversal. A flurry of armed support is now headed to Ukraine. France announced it would be sending longer range missiles to Kyiv while Germany pledged nearly $800 million in military aid, including Leopard tanks and other equipment, underscoring another severe blow to Putin. But while it may be some time before Sweden officially joins NATO, Turkiye's decision will undoubtedly lighten the mood in Vilnius, where alliance members had hoped to project unity over the war in Ukraine.

But fundamentally, I think both President Biden and President Erdogan are going home with a win. Biden gets to say, I've made NATO bigger, stronger and President Biden in an interview recently with Fareed Zakaria also sort of caveated or poised this giving F-16s to Turkiye or selling F-16s to Turkiye as a way of upping the military capabilities of NATO, which is just another perspective to see.

According to theWorld Meteorological Organization, the levels were 17 percent below average this year, breaking the previous June record by a large margin. While those numbers went down, global sea surface temperatures went up, reaching record highs for the periods of May and June this year. Experts say these are worrying trends caused by climate change. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We are used to seeing these big reductions in sea ice in the Arctic but not of the Antarctic. It's down by five standard deviations for the mathematicians, below what we would expect and what we've seen in the past. This is a massive decrease. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The gift card mogul has owned half a dozen private jets and is now selling his last one. After realizing he could not ignore the cost to the climate and future generations. He's vice chair of the Patriotic Millionaires group. Prince is pushing for higher taxes, in part so that those who do fly private have to pay more for the privilege. CNN's Richard Quest, joins me now, live from New York, ahead of his interview with Stephen Prince in the next hour. So I should probably be careful what I say, Richard, I admire his stance on higher taxes. But to put it bluntly, why should we care about a millionaire selling his last jet? What does this signify?",

And even though it's coming from a millionaire who -- or a billionaire, who is quite clear about wantinghigher taxes for the rich and, indeed, he says he is not going to go out proselytizing for others to do the same, this is a personal decision, for him to tell his Citation -- sorry, his Cessna 650 Citation 3. It is a midsized private jet that can do medium to longish haul routes. It's worth about $1 million, $1.5 million or so and it costs about $2 million a year to run, depending on how many hours you fly it. The significance is he's gone out and said he's doing it. He's going to fly either commercial or he is going to lease a smaller twin engine prop plane for his private flying.",
