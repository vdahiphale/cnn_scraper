This was took us through residential neighborhoods where an areas where there's shopping, malls, stores, that sort of thing where there are hotels, everything that we saw had been touched by destruction flattened, burnt, charred bullet holes in it, shell holes in it. We didn't see any civilians, any people there. The place that we finally got to buy the hospital the IDF was still fighting a battle with Hamas nearby. There were gunfire exchanges; there was tank fire, a few 100 meters away from the hospital. Inside the hospital the IDF showed us what they said were weapons discovers that they've made in places they said they believe that hostages might have been held a chair that had rope around by the legs that had some women's clothing on it. A woman's hairband, they said that these were things that might mean that they've been hostages. They're not definitively that they would do DNA tests on it. There weren't some other things. They pointed out a motorbike they said they believed Hamas used in the October 7th attacks. All of this, they said indicated their belief that Hamas had been using the basement of the hospital. And this was one -- this was the reason that they said that they wanted to get into the hospital. The hospital was evacuated. The doctors are forced to take the sick children out of the hospital as the IDF wanted to get into it. And ultimately broke their way in at the back of the hospital because they said they were taking gunfire from around the front of the hospital. There were tunnels nearby as well. But the IDF didn't say those tunnels connected to the hospital. But indicative of the network of tunnels, the IDF said, runs through the civilian neighborhoods, one of them, they said was connected to the house of a Former Hamas Commander so all of this for the IDF, painting the picture of Hamas, using hospitals as a place to shield their operations, and therefore setting out the case, if you will for why the IDF is going -- wants to get access to other hospitals. But I think the big take away from us, because it's very hard to -- you know -- to come to -- come to a conclusion on the evidence that we saw, because even the IDF said they still have to do DNA tests and all those sorts of things. The big takeaway has to be the massive amount of destruction that we saw in Gaza. I went into Gaza after the 2014 incursion, the scale and scope of what we saw, much bigger than back then.",

DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): You know we're still listening to leadership talking among ourselves having serious conversations. I don't think anybody thinks this is the way to do the budget.

It authorizes the Agriculture Bill for another year, which is critical to many programs that I care about. So we still have to figure out what's going to happen at supplemental funding. I'm worried about Ukraine, and we're desperately about humanitarian aid in Gaza. So I think nobody wants to shut the government down. It would be the most irresponsible thing for us to do. We have to make sure that we don't keep it open at a cost. And I think we will continue to move forward in sort of the tone of at least this is a clean resolution.
