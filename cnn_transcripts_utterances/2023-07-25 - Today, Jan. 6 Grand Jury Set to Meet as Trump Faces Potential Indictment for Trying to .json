We do expect that federal grand jury that's been looking at January 6 in the case that Special Counsel Jack Smith is bringing together, where Donald Trump is a target, we do expect them to meet today. We won't know if they actually are convening or what they're doing until they do it, because grand jury proceedings are extremely confidential until there is an indictment that would emerge.But in this story that last night was broken by Sean Lyngaas and others here at CNN, it essentially is capturing just an aspect of what happened even before the election, even just a month or two before Donald Trump was out there saying that people may be cheating in the 2020 election. He was being told by senior intelligence, national security officials that the election was going to be very secure, that they were very confident in that. The confidence kept up among the intel community, among homeland security through the election. [07:05:00] It was ultimately a very secure election with no widespread fraud. But Donald Trump was briefed on this in February of 2020. It is something the special counsel understands that this briefing happened, that Donald Trump was receptive to this information, that he was encouraging of the officials. But then there are other questions that the special counsel has asked, not just about what happened at this meeting. But also there is a piece of this investigation about how Trump retaliated apparently against some of the officials that were telling him that the election was secure. There were people that were fired in the administration, people who resigned in protest near the end. And so all of that and how it fits into what the grand jury is looking at, we don't exactly know yet. But it is another aspect that the special counsel's office has pulled in as they build a case.",

And there were people working with him. One of them was Bernie Kerik, a close old friend of Giuliani's. Kerik is the person that was holding back these documents from everybody who had been seeking them, not just the special counsel's office, but also House investigators. No one had gotten access to them. And then Kerik now is saying that they can have access to them. We'll see how that factors in if there's even more investigation to be done now that the special counsel's office has indicated they're near the end of what they're looking at.",

If we don't stop burning fossil fuels rapidly, our summer of heat hell that we're experiencing now will be considered a cool summer in the future.Now, scientists for decades have been able to attribute weather events like coastal flooding, heavy rain events, as well as these extreme heat events, to climate change. But now, the World Weather Attribution Initiative, the report we're talking about, has the ability to compare our current climate, which is 1.2 degrees Celsius above post industrial averages to that of the past. And what it's finding is that the role of climate change is absolutely overwhelming. Take, for instance, the current heat wave this month of July across North America with manmade climate change is actually two degrees Celsius warmer than what it would be without these heat trapping gases that we release into the atmosphere. And they're becoming more frequent every 5 to 15 years. And if we continue to burn fossil fuels, we'll see that frequency become every two to three years for these extreme heat events. And what you and I used to consider as extreme heat, 95 degrees, is becoming easily more achievable. So, not only is it becoming more frequent, but we're seeing these extremes become even more extreme yet. Take, for instance, the entire globe, the average temperature we have set records since July 3rd. So, we're on a 20-day or 20-something day streak of breaking this global average temperature record across the entire planet. And we're recording temperatures that we've never seen before. Take, for instance, China, as these heat domes continue to propagate across the northern hemisphere throughout our summer months, it is making these heat waves, like I said, and what this report states, virtually impossible without the effects of manmade climate change.

And what the country did, and our party and the Republican Party did, was turn to a conservative governor from a blue state named Ronald Reagan who understood how to get things done.

You can't regulate something but then vacate the field and not do your job. If you're not doing the job, the states have the right to do it.

But he has convinced himself by trying to convince others that the truth is otherwise, despite the fact that there is no evidence that the election was stolen in 2020. And I've been saying that since election night, 2020. I've been demanding to see the evidence, and there is none. So, he never looked me in the eye and said to me, I know I lost, but he was very concerned beforehand about losing. And so it doesn't surprise me at all the reporting that you gave overnight.
