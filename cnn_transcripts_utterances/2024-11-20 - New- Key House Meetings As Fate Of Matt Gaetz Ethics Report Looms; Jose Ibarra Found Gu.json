At this hour, both sides of Capitol Hill behind me are weighing what to do about President-elect Donald Trump's explosive pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz. Currently, the bipartisan House Ethics Committee is behind closed doors discussing next steps in their investigation into Gaetz, including allegations the former Florida congressman had sex with a minor and paid for sex. Gaetz denied those allegations and today made the rounds to Republican senators, pleading his case alongside the Vice President-elect J.D. Vance. Let's go to our reporters who have been following this closely. Alayna Treene who covers Trump and Annie Grayer on Capitol Hill. Annie, CNN caught up with the House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest on his way into this meeting. I want to play what he said and get your sense of what he meant on the other side. Have a listen.

People like Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr., many of them who Donald Trump also recognizes they might have a tough time when it comes to the Senate confirmation process. However, Matt Gaetz from my conversations with those close to the former president, now president elect, is that he is his number one priority. We know and we've reported this repeatedly, that attorney general is the most important role to Donald Trump. And if he's going to have to sacrifice, I think there's a lot of questions -- other people arguing. Could Gaetz be the one he sacrifices to get his other nominees through? That is not the conversation right now. If he's going to have to sacrifice anyone, it would not be Matt Gaetz because he is so firmly behind wanting him in that role. And the reason he wants him specifically in that role is because he really wants a disrupter. It's also loyalty. We've talked about that a lot, but he wants someone who really will shake things up at the Department of Justice, and he thinks Matt Gaetz is the only person who will do that.",

And the reason for that is that a lot of the programs that the U.S. Department of Education administers are programs like Title One, which gives funds to students in poverty and those programs are really popular with Republicans who represent areas that have a lot of poverty and need those resources.

Riley, you may remember, was a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University, reported missing in February after she didn't return from a run at a different school, the University of Georgia in Athens.Authorities say that Ibarra, an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, struck her in the head with a rock and choked her. He requested a bench trial, meaning the verdict was decided by a judge rather than a jury. Riley's father had requested her death not be politicized, but Ibarra's migrant status made the case very much a flashpoint in the U.S. election. It came to light he had already been arrested in 2022 after entering the U.S. illegally. Here's the moment the judge announced the verdict earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) H. PATRICK HAGGARD, ATHENS-CLARKE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE:  I will now announce the verdict, in the state of Georgia versus Jose Antonio Ibarra, case SU24 CR0323.

The judge had earlier issued a guilty verdict on all ten counts, the defendant was facing, including malice murder, felony murder and kidnapping with bodily injury.The verdict was announced in a completely packed courtroom. The family and friends of Laken Riley filled four of the eight rows available inside. Before reading the verdict, Judge Haggard made two observations. One the closing statement by special prosecutor Ross was very powerful, he said, and two, he took into account the defenses request that he set aside his emotions before issuing a verdict. The special prosecutor said in fighting her attacker, the victim left more than enough evidence to convict him. We also heard an emotional statement by Laken Riley's mother, Allyson Phillips. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALLYSON PHILLIPS, LAKEN RILEY'S MOTHER:  There's no end to the pain and suffering that he inflicted on our family and our friends.

Some might oppose that because they don't believe in a death penalty, everyone has their own opinions.The reality, though, is that, you know, listen, it's life without parole. It's a couple of life sentences in addition to other years being somewhat symbolic.

Ukraine has asked for anti-personnel mines to slow those advances, and the Biden administration changed effectively. It's long standing policy and agreed within the last few days here or perhaps the last couple of weeks to grant that request and send anti-personnel mines. It's worth noting that back in the summer of 2022, so several months after this war had started, the administration said, look, we're essentially getting out of the business of landmines. We're not going to store them, make them produce them, export them, with the exception of the Korean peninsula. So, a fairly major reversal here. And then, Jim, I'll just point out one more thing, Ukraine itself is a signatory to the Ottawa Treaty, which bans the use of landmines.

And that's just simply not practical here. But the question is not whether people want peace. It's the nature of the peace that they want. I spoke to a young girl called Anya down in that square, planting a flag for her lost father, who died on October the 28th, but spent five months in a coma from his battlefield injuries. She said, look, you know, we want peace. We want this to stop, but we don't want Russia as part of our lives. And so I think its quite easy to say, hey why don't we just stop the fighting? But the broader concern is exactly what the nature of the peace is going to be. I was speaking to a senior presidential adviser here who said to me, look, you know, you have to understand Putin only understands strength and if you come to a negotiating table saying, okay, we're tired of supporting Ukraine, Ukraine is tired of fighting. What can you give us? He will just push and keep going. And we've seen, Jim, you know, you've seen this too.

Wade and is now included in his cabinet, people accused of sexual misconduct returns to the Oval Office, some women are encouraging each other to swear off men entirely as a form of protest. In the days following Trump's reelection, searches for a Korean feminist movement surged on Google and on social media in this country.The 4B movement, as its known, B being the shorthand for \"no\" in Korean encourages women to practice these four no's -- no sex, no dating, no marrying, and no having children with men. Kelsey Ables is a Washington Post reporter based in Seoul, South Korea. She co-wrote a piece about that surge in the movement here in the United States. Kelsey, thanks so much for joining me. First, I want to go back to the roots here. Can you explain how it started in South Korea?",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. Thanks so much for having me on, Jim. It's great to be here. So the 4B movement is usually traced back to the 2010s in South Korea.There was a kind of renewed surge in discussion about gender inequality and feminism at that time. It was sparked by a few things, in part by a 2016 murder of a young woman in the Gangnam, in a bathroom in Gangnam, a kind of bustling district of Seoul and her murder was by a man who later said that he felt ignored by women and that was kind of a motive for it. So, that kind of prompted this frustration and online discussion that kind of renewed this conversation about gender inequality in Seoul. And around that same time, the Escape the Corset movement emerged, which was this movement where women were dressing androgynously. They were shattering makeup palettes on social media in this kind of protest against gender expectations. And then those kind of led into the 2018 #metoo movement, which then spilled over into South Korea. And experts that we spoke to for our reporting said that this movement can kind of be seen as an offshoot of any of those kind of 2010's feminist movements in South Korea. So tell me about the appeal -- appeal here in the U.S. because I understand you spoke to a 21 year old from Georgia who said she got interested in the movement about a year ago. Can you tell us why she and others that you spoke to in this country have been drawn to it?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. You know, its interesting. I mean, I think that it's important to know that, you know, 4B is a pretty fringe movement in Korea. I mean, Korea is a place where feminism on its own is a polarizing subject, let alone, you know, this kind of more extreme movement.So I think when we're talking about the birthrate, what we're really talking about is issues that exist kind of beyond these kinds of choices. It's more an issue of gender inequality in pay, the kinds of ways women are treated when they return to the workplace after having children. The high cost of housing, the kind of cost of living in big cities like Seoul. And so I think that that kind of question is a little bit maybe separate from the 4B movement. But at the same time, certainly there are parallels between these two countries. And I think that the kind of emergence of this movement in the U.S., which has existed in Korea for quite some time is a sign of some similarities for sure, the experts that I spoke to for this story kind of trace it to in Korea, more of an economic inequality between men and women. And sort of opportunities for men that do not exist for women or kind of the pay gap in Seoul, whereas in the U.S., they kind of say it tends to be more politically motivated and more about sort of the kind of political differences between men and women. And that kind of increased gap that we hear a lot of conversation about these days where, you know, a lot of men are kind of voting for more conservative candidates, whereas women tend to fall on the other side of that.",

This would have been a category three Atlantic hurricane wind event had it come on land. Now, we still had a lot of wind, winds over 100 miles per hour in places, less gusts. But what a -- what an amazing looking storm here. Now, we have talked about rapidly intensifying hurricanes. I think we probably talked about that ten times, this year already. That's what -- this is a rapidly intensifying low pressure center, just a different process. We're not talking about a warm core and a hurricane. This is a cold storm making somewhere in the neighborhood of about I would say 12 feet of snow in some of the higher elevations and making winds 77 miles per hour there at Mount Rainier. It's an atmospheric river combining with that, we talked about this before, too. We talk about Honolulu and we talk about it. This is '80s, '90s and 2000s, the pineapple express. Well, when you take that moisture that is around Honolulu all the time and you push it onshore in the Pacific Northwest, you're going to get rain and you're going to get snow, and you're going to get a lot of it. That is a stream of humidity coming onshore, making all of that rain and all of that snow. And there will be spots with 20 inches of rain. There will be spots with 15 feet of snow.",
