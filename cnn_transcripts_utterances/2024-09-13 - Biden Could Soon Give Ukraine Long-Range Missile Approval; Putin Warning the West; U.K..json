So, this is going to be discussed between President Biden and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, here in Washington today.The Brits have a role in this as well, because alongside the ATACMS comes that the Ukrainians want to use, there's also a British missile called the Storm Shadow that Ukraine wants the Brits to give them permission to use as well. Now, we have seen some signs that the U.S. and Britain might be willing to do this. We heard Secretary Blinken in Kyiv and in Poland earlier this week saying that, as the battlefield changes, so too does U.S. foreign policy and policy towards these weapons evolve. This is something we've heard him say in the past before the American position changes. Now, my colleague Kevin Liptak is reporting that we are not expecting an announcement out of that meeting today, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't come at some point in the near future. Ukrainian officials have been pushing for this very hard. Recently, top Ukrainian officials came to Washington to present a list of targets that they would use with these American ATACMS. I spoke with the Ukrainian defense minister at the time, he told me that it included airfields that could be targeted inside Russia that are being used to hit at Ukraine. But at the same time, Sara, there are significant American concerns. Concerns that you mentioned about the fear of escalation. Putin now warning that if the U.S. gives Ukraine permission to use these weapons that Russia would then be at war with NATO. So, there are those concerns over Russia escalating the fight against Ukraine and against NATO countries. There are concerns about the supply of these missiles. There is not an infinite supply of them, and some U.S. officials believe that they could be used with -- more effectively inside of Russian occupied Ukraine, like Crimea. And then, there's also the concern that they might not actually move the needle, that Russia has moved many of its targets beyond the range of these ATACMS. And that's where we start to see the daylight between the U.S. and Ukrainian military strategy. But no doubt, Sara, if Washington made this decision, if President Biden made this decision, it would send a strong signal about American support for Ukraine.",

That 47-42 that you mentioned post-debate. But that's actually not a lot of movement from where we were in August when Harris was up by four. Now, that is movement from where we were in late July when Harris was up by two. But the bottom line here is this, at least in the first polling that we're getting post this debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, maybe slight, slight, slight movement in Harris' direction, but not overwhelmingly so, which I don't think is really much of a surprise given the 50/50 nation we are right now. But the bottom line is, in the average of polls, Harris had a slight national lead. And at this particular point, I think she'll probably hold on to that, at least based upon this initial signal.",

Our viewers, many will remember you ran for Senate in Missouri in 2016. Got very close in a red state there. So, you've got a lot of experience in electoral politics.Jason, you wrote an op-ed where you said that years ago, Vice President Harris, before she was vice president, made you feel seen. What do you mean by that? JASON KANDER (D), FORMER MISSOURI SECRETARY OF STATE AND U.S. ARMY VETERAN:  Yes. First of all, good to see you again, John, Kate, too, both of you. Yes. Look, what I really was trying to write about was the fact that I'm not close friends with Kamala Harris. And we know each other. We've been work acquaintances. We both ran for Senate in the same year. And I think it's important, particularly as people are getting to know Kamala Harris, to learn a little about what she is like when she's not on television, when she's not, you know, in a debate, beating Donald Trump, like he stole something, like what she's actually like as a person. And what she's like as a person is somebody who, when I dropped out of public life, dropped out of politics to get help for post-traumatic stress disorder at the VA, you know, there was a period where everybody was calling. I mean, everybody in the world was calling because I was a public person. And then, there was a period where the world, which I had given it permission to do, sort of forgot about me. And that was OK. I was working on therapy and that kind of thing. But Kamala Harris had no real motivation to continue to check in on me, but she did. She did what a friend would do, even though we weren't very close. And, you know, so now that she's running for president, I went ahead and thought it was best to tell the world about that experience.",

Maybe I was helpful, maybe I wasn't, but she was doing what a friend would do for another person, which is basically saying, you still have value to me, and I'm going to make sure to communicate that. So, you know, I think that's the kind of person that not only would we all want to be friends with. But it's also the kind of person who we would want to lead anything, our corporation and on profit, a PTA, our country. And I would just ask people to imagine for a moment Donald Trump calling anybody to make them feel anything other than, you know, somebody who he finds useful to him.

I think that what veterans want is to see candidates who understand them as more than political props in a campaign. You know, when I think about the difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, they're both people who didn't serve. But Kamala Harris is the person who didn't serve and is genuinely interested in your service, is genuinely interested in learning more about the military, because it furthers her ability to do her job. Not somebody who just puts you on a pedestal and thinks of you as a hero who is invulnerable or, in Donald Trump's case, pities you.Donald Trump is a different person. Donald Trump is somebody who most veterans recognize as the guy who, you know, finds out you served, feels immediately insecure, then tells you about how, well, you know, he was going to go be a green beret, but he figured he has a problem with authority and he would have just ended up punching out his drill sergeant during basic. So, he never bothered to join. Then he takes out his phone and he shows you pictures of his guns because he thinks that's how he's going to relate to you.
