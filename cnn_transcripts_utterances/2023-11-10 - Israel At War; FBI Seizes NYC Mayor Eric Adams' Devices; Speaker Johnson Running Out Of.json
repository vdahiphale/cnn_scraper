      "sentences": "Jim, those pictures right there practically speak for themselves. Our cameras, our teams have seen heavy bombardment in Northern Gaza throughout the previous few hours, throughout the evening here. That as the IDF spokesperson says Israeli forces are operating deep in Gaza City.Several days ago, the IDF said it had encircled Gaza City and Northern Gaza, and now was working its way in. Part of the target, part of fighting here on the part of the Israeli military is to go after Hamas' tunnel infrastructure. And the IDF says that's where they're focusing a lot of their effort, though, acknowledging it is deep and difficult fighting because underground Hamas has the advantage, so Israel is trying to do what it can, attacking with grenades and trying to destroy some of that tunnel infrastructure. Again, that's on top of the bombardment we have seen from outside of Gaza. Meanwhile, there have been strikes near hospitals and the same sort of argument, or conflicting account of a strike or damage. We have seen to Al Shifa Hospital in Northern Gaza, that's one of the biggest if not the biggest hospitals in the Gaza Strip. The World Health Organization blamed Israel saying the hospital was coming under bombardment. Meanwhile, Israel denied any involvement and damage to the hospital, saying they have not carried out a strike there and saying, according to their information, it was a failed rocket launch that had damage to the hospital. Very reminiscent of the debate, the argument and the conflicting accounts we saw some three and a half weeks ago over another hospital in Gaza. Meanwhile, humanitarian quarters opened up for another day for six hours earlier, during which thousands, if not tens of thousands Gazans fled from Northern Gaza to Southern Gaza as Israel allowed for that humanitarian quarter, along Salah al-Din Street one of the main north south arteries in the Gaza Strip. That -- the IDF says that they will not strike at the humanitarian quarter even as the war continues around there. The IDF says tens of thousands of people have fled each day over the past several these days. Israel urging the residents there to move south as the operation deepens and continues. We're also hearing increasing criticism and concern on the part of the US from the rising number of civilians killed in Gaza since October 7th. According to the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza, more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed on the ground there since October 7th, a number they say includes 4,500 children and 3,000 women, Jim.",

And in a cable that was obtained by my colleague, Priscilla Alvarez, the US embassy in Oman told the White House that they are experiencing outrage like they've never seen really, and that they \"are losing Arab publics for a generation over the US' support for Israel.\" And that the support for this military operation is being seen in the Arab world as \"material and moral culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes.\"So obviously, all of this is contributing to the administration's wariness of Israel's military operation in Gaza right now, particularly how it's being carried out with regard to civilians and how the Hamas commanders that Israel says it's targeting are obviously in areas that are densely, densely populated inside Gaza. And so, this is something that the administration is going to be really urging the Israelis to take another look at in terms of their military operation in the days ahead, Jim.",

At the same time, I think our hearts and minds have to be open to the suffering of thousands of innocent Palestinians. You have a humanitarian catastrophe and far too many Palestinian deaths.I think you're right. The administration is navigating a very fine line. Secretary's comments today were not an observation. It was an implicit warning. When you say far too many Palestinians are being killed, it's almost a direct sort of warning to the Israelis to change course. Real question seems to me, and the administration has offered suggestions, change the ordinance. Don't drop 1,000, 2,000-pound bombs on Jabalia refugee camp. Go to something smaller, use targeted intel. The real question, I don't think the administration has a compelling alternative, Jim, as to how the Israelis eradicate Hamas as a military organization. They won't destroy it as an idea. How they eradicate Hamas as a military organization while working in densely populated areas where Hamas assets are co-located with civilian populations. How do you do that? And I think that's the real dilemma. And I suspect administration will continue to walk that fine line. I'm not sure there'll be dot-dot-dot or else.",

Now they're turning around and saying, yes, we condemn it but we'll continue basically to provide Israel with weapons and with bombs. They're unwilling to condition military aid to implementing or even complying with international law.They said there's no red line. And they never even stopped when Rantisi Hospital was bombed, when the Al Ahli Hospital was bombed, when now we're looking at a catastrophe where people have (inaudible) 20,000 injured all over Gaza. People are being amputated, children without anesthesia. So you can say, yes. We will give you 4 hours to stitch a couple of kids, but then we'll go back to carpet bombed you. And the worst element of all of it that they're looking at the reality, not only in Gaza, they're looking at what Bibi Netanyahu is doing and saying regarding the West bank. He's saying he will occupy Palestinians everywhere in perpetuity, forever. He is annexing more land in the West Bank. He's unleashing the settlers who are being violent. They killed 150 people in areas where there's no Hamas, in Hebron in the West Bank. They look at both the elements of the conflict, both in the West Bank and in Gaza. And they see the administration that's continuing the same policy that Donald Trump put in place, which is Abraham Accord, do some deals with Arab leaders.

Let's get we're on this important story with legal expert Shan Wu and Karen Friedman-Agnifilo.Karen, let me start with you first. What sort of information would prosecutors need to have to take this kind of drastic step of getting a search warrant to seize the mayor's phone? I mean, that is no small thing. KAREN FRIEDMAN-AGNIFILO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: No, this is a very big deal. And prosecutors and the FBI, they could have just asked for the phones and the iPad, or they could have gotten a subpoena for them. But they took them the higher more drastic step of getting a court authorized search warrant. And to do that, you have to go before a court, you have to establish that there is probable cause that a crime occurred, and that there will be evidence of that crime located on his phones and his devices. So the fact that the FBI believes that a crime occurred, and that evidence of that crime will be on the mayor's devices, I think says a lot about the seriousness and severity of this investigation. They didn't give him notice, they didn't give him an opportunity to turn it in and just hand it over. They showed up and surprised him, which also leads you to believe that they believe that the evidence could be lost or destroyed.

And they'd have to run it up the chain to do that, as opposed to asking him nicely for it or issuing a subpoena.The evidence they would look for there would obviously be communication, confirmation of contact with the people, perhaps who are going to be accused of making these illegal donations, but more immediately too what kind of communications he had with his staff. Because from a defense standpoint, what you're trying to do is staunch the wound and tie it off as low as possible on the hierarchy. Prosecution wants to see how high it goes. So of great interest to them would be to see what kind of communications he had with his staff who was telling him about these donations. It's a little bit unclear to me from what Polo had learned whether the approach means they tried to interview Adams, or whether they were simply saying, hey, sorry, you know, we have this warrant, we're taking your phones. The absence of an interview at the moment might be good news for him. It might be that they're really focusing more on the people who might have made the donations or conversely. You know, they just haven't reached the stage where they want to ask him for more in depth interview.

Obviously, when he has an official cellphone, people other than himself may have access to it.

And that is because the House Republican conference has been very divided over what path they should pursue. There are moderates and appropriators who are pushing a more straightforward clean stopgap spending bill that extends funding until the end of this year or early next year. But then there's conservative hardliners who are pushing this much more complicated idea that would extend funding for government agencies for various lengths of time essentially teeing up multiple fiscal cliffs, and that option would be dead on arrival in the Senate. So that would risk a government shutdown. That's something that speaker Johnson absolutely does not want. But at the same time, he does not want to risk infuriating his right flank especially so early on in his tenure. Now I will say that conservative hardliners have signaled that they're willing to give Johnson a longer leash than they did his predecessor Kevin McCarthy, who is facing very similar problems from within the divided conference.
