Around the same time as that attack, the U.S. military announced it is sending an advanced anti-missile system and about 100 U.S. troops to Israel to operate it. The Pentagon says the U.S. troops will, quote, \"help bolster Israel's air defenses\" following Iran's unprecedented attacks. Meanwhile, it's believed that more than 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza. Hersh Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped on October 7th. I first learned about him a few days afterward, when an IDF soldier showed me this video of a young man being loaded into a pickup truck. His head had been blown off. I didn't know it was Hersh, who's Israeli-American, until a few days later when I happened to interview his parents. At the time, they were unaware the video existed, and they didn't even know if he was alive. I called them after the interview to tell them what I'd seen and I sent them the video. Since then, I've spoken to Hersh's parents a number of times. In April, a propaganda video was released by Hamas showing Hersh. He was -- he urged his family to stay strong and gave proof that he was alive. But at the beginning of September, the Israeli military said they recovered the bodies of six hostages who were murdered by Hamas, including Hersh's.

And to get the news on August 31st that they found six bodies, including Hersh's was just such a crushing blow. And we are still grappling with it. We are oddly blessed because there are hostage families who know that their loved ones were killed and their bodies are still being held, and they were not able to give them, at least yet, a proper respectful burial.

You know, there was so much trauma and terror that we were experiencing as parents of someone there, that I was shoving all of this emotion and fear and terror in, I like to think of it as, you know, suitcases and shoving those suitcases into a room and not dealing with that because we were in battle.

So a bullet went through his right hand, through his shoulder, actually, then into his neck and then out of the side of his head. It looks that then he would -- and supposedly he was standing crouched over because of course he couldn't stand up straight because he was too tall to stand in the 5'5 tunnel. They think that then he dropped to his knees and then he was shot with the gun on his head, the back of his head, which exited the top of his head. And he was found on his knees two days later. And Eden Yerushalmi was resting, her head was resting kind of on his side or on his lap. And she had also been shot multiple times as had all four others.",

And the way that you do that in Judaism is when you find yourself in that same situation next time, do you choose to do differently? And we've had so many people say to us that they are so sorry and they feel so bad about what happened to Hersh and these other five beautiful young people. And we have said to everyone, don't be sorry, go save the 101. And so as people from all over the world, people of power and influence from all different countries, people in the negotiating room, people adjacent to the negotiating room, I would just beseech you, go and get these people.",
