[18:10:03] It had committed kind of one of the most elementary errors in banking of borrowing money in a very short-term way and then investing it in a long-term way and then when interest rates went up, those assets lost their value and that loss of value put the institution in a very problematic position.",

And if it happens naturally, then there's less need for the Fed to do it. So, they'll have to make a judgment about how to set interest rates at their next meeting. But I sure do think it would be a real mistake if the priority that has been attached to getting inflation under control was something that we lost sight of. And, you know, if you ask the American people, the American people are very clear that the thing they're most worried about in the economic sphere is inflation. So, I think we need to focus on getting it down, because if we don't get it down quickly and it comes to be something everybody expects that it will come over time to be an even larger problem that's even more costly to resolve.",

The fact that they put him into the grand jury suggests to me that they do believe him and that they are going to try to use him. Although today may also have been a little dry run.

Joining us now is CNN Anchor and Chief Correspondent Kaitlan Collins and CNN Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Kaitlan, two days after we heard, and we were there, we heard Mike Pence sharpen his rebuke of Donald Trump, the former president is responding. What do you make of his argument that, in many ways, you can blame Mike Pence for January 6th?",

      "sentences": "I don't think it's surprising at all. What I have been told is that Trump has been complaining about the positive press coverage that Pence has gotten from making those remarks that he did on Saturday night, saying that he does believe history will eventually hold Trump accountable for what happened on January 6th.Obviously, the roles that they took on that day and then the events leading up to it were quite different. Pence was the one who sought legal advice on what he could do legally that day. He was the one who is pushing back and had attorneys pushing back on Trump and his attorney, saying that there was no way that he could send those votes back to the state legislatures. Obviously, that is something that settled. We have established what has happened there. Trump is also suggesting though that Pence is only speaking out now because of the numbers that he's seeing as he is preparing to launch his own presidential run. He hasn't done so yet but, obviously, other reporting has been that he plans to do so. And I do think timing was a factor in what Pence said on Saturday night. You know, the 2024 field is starting to take shape. Pence kind of set this standard of what other candidate are going to be asked about when it comes to Trump's role on January 6th. But I think this is Trump being unhappy that Pence not only came out against him so forcefully but also that he's doing so and injecting that into the 2024 race even more.",

I think if you talk to Pence's team, they're going to say, well, the reason he's pushing back on the testimony, they believe, is that he doesn't have to testify about everything. They do believe ultimately he is going to testify in part potentially, Wolf. They don't believe they want it to be all the private conversations he had with Trump and that's why they are invoking this speech or debate clause argument, is saying that's why he can't because he was technically acting as president of the Senate that day as they were certifying those votes.It is true he did not go speak before the January 6th committee. That is something they wanted him very much so to do. He did also write a book about his experience that day and talked about that. That's something legal experts have said could complicate his fight on that subpoena from the Justice Department. But, Wolf, the other thing from the comment that stood out to me, was he wasn't just going after Trump. He also criticized Fox News and one of their most prominent hosts for selectively editing the 40,000 hours or so of January 6th footage. He went after them saying it mocks decency to portray it the way that they did. That's just as significant is going after Trump is going after one of the most popular hosts on Fox News when you are about launch a Republican presidential campaign.",

ZELENYSo, the former vice president obviously, you know, he said that it simply isn't decent. I mean, he said simply it mocks decency. Those are very strong and simple words, unmistakable words and messages there. You get the sense of the former vice president, yes, he is on the verge of likely jumping in again but he's also trying to essentially return to the old Mike Pence, if you will, to the extent that's possible, perhaps trying rebrand himself as the former governor of Indiana, a social conservative and try and get out and distance himself from some of this Trump orbit, but that was absolutely significant that he said it mocks decency.
