      "sentences": "Well, look. This is an unnamed whistleblower who is writing to Congress through his attorneys. And he says he and his whole investigative team were removed from this investigation and that it was done at the request of the Justice Department. So, in the letter to Congress, here is what the whistleblower's attorneys write. They say this move is clearly retaliatory, and may also constitute obstruction of a congressional inquiry.Of course, we know there has been this long-running criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, most of that investigative work has largely concluded but the case awaits a charging decision. And my colleague, Evan Perez, has been hearing for months that there were some agents who were concerned that they were being left out of discussions amid allegations of leaks. So as this came to Congress today, we heard from Republicans and Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee who say they want to hear more context from the IRS commissioner about what exactly is going on here. And, Sara, I think you can look at these two ways. I mean, there was one argument to make that you know, this is retaliation against a whistleblower who wants to share information with Congress. There's another argument to make that you have someone who clearly wants to speak out publicly about an ongoing criminal investigation, you know, when there have been alleged leaks in some of these right-wing media outlets, and you can't compromise the underlying federal criminal investigation. So, we're going to continue to see this saga play out and we're still waiting to see when this whistleblower is actually going to show up on Capitol Hill, Sara.",

Every one of them raised their hand. How many of you want to go to New York? They wanted to go to New York. So, you know -- and he asked him why. And they answered to him. Because we've seen New York on TV and we want to take our families where we can make it a better life and a better way for families to live. So, it's important. But to your question is that we will never send anyone that doesn't want to go anywhere. You know, once they get their A-number which is processed through the immigration system, they're free to go. And our job here is to help them go to the destination of their choice, but not to send them where -- and use them as pawns as they have been. We would never do that.

And we do have to see a light at the end of the tunnel. And we have to see some of the compromises so that they can make to make sure that we have immigration reform. It's been decades.

Too often, we have seen what happens when technology outpaces regulation. The unbridled exploitation of personal data, the proliferation of disinformation, and the deepening of societal inequalities. If you were listening from home, you might have thought that voice was mine and the words from me, but in fact, that voice was not mine. The words were not mine. (END VIDEO CLIP) O'SULLIVAN: And so, there, you had an AI-generated voice of Senator Blumenthal. It was used creating software that listens to his voice making speeches on the floor, and it sounded pretty convinced there. Also, the actual words that he said, the speech that the AI voice I read was not written by his staff. It was instead written by ChatGPT. So, I -- that kind of sounded like Blumenthal, right?",

(END VIDEO CLIP) HOWARD: And what he means by more acute, Sara, he did say when you look at the numbers, we know that 13 percent of the U.S. population is black, but only 5.7 percent of U.S. doctors are blank. So, the diversity seen in the workforce does not reflect the diversity of patients served. And when you look at federal data just in general, we do know that in areas where there's a shortage of health care workers, we need more than 17,000 primary care practitioners, more than 12,000 dental health workers, more than 8000 mental health practitioners.
