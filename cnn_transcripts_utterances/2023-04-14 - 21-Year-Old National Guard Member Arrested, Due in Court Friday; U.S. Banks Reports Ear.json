A whole group of Finance Ministers, Central Bank Governors, thought leaders are meeting here at an incredible and exceptionally high risk moment. I think for the global economy, we have growth and I can take you through all of the issues and the debates going on growth, but it's slow. Inflation is retreating, but of course, we know it's still too high. There's unsustainable debt levels across emerging markets. Plus, the recent wave of let's call them tremors across the banking system too. All adding to what the International Monetary Fund's had coming into this meeting is a fog of economic uncertainty. Well, the good news is, we're going to be here and hearing from a distinguished group of newsmakers over the coming hour just to get and test their level of concern at this moment. How do we reach consensus? How are they debating some of the big issues and what are the most important aspects to focus on as we head through the rest of the year? Coming up, over the next hour, we have the World Bank President David Malpass. He of course has been leading this global debt roundtable to discuss the urgent need to tackle the growing debt crisis hitting emerging markets. We have also Mohamed El-Erian, Adviser to both Allianz and Gramercy Funds on the huge challenge that still faces. Policymakers including Central Bankers how to fight inflation, while at the same time preserving financial stability and not denting growth too much further. Also we're going to hear from the Euro Group President Paschal Donohoe, on how EU nations can jumpstart growth while balancing the books. Of course, we all know reform is hard consensus is hard too, as we're seeing right now across France. Plenty to come on the show, and much to discuss. For now, though, we do begin the show and start in Boston, where a 21-year- old man is accused of leaking classified information, and is due to appear in court later today. The FBI has arrested Jack Teixeira on Thursday, is believed he posted the highly sensitive documents online to impress his friends. Natasha Bertrand joins us now from the Pentagon. Natasha, huge questions to ask ahead of this appearance in court. But primarily, I think how someone's so young and so junior have access to this information was available to leak it in the first place?",

The Pentagon Press Secretary about yesterday, someone who is so junior really had just entered the military a few years ago was an E-3, which is one of the lowest rankings of an enlisted member of the military. How did he access these top secret documents, many of which are briefed up to the Senior Pentagon Leadership every day, including his high, of course, as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley? So the question now is what is the military going to do about this problem, because clearly, this kind of highly sensitive, classified information is just being seen and disseminated to too many people? Well, what we're told is that the Defense Department has launched an internal review of intelligence access, and they're going to be looking at basically best practices here. Do they need to change how this information is distributed, because previously, we were told this information was seen and disseminated to thousands of people in the government? Clearly, this individual who is alleged to have leaked these classified documents was able to see them somehow, he may not have had the proper clearance to actually access them properly, that is still being figured out here. But still, he was part of the intelligence wing of the Air National Guard in Massachusetts, which would presumably give him access, or at least visibility into a lot of these documents. So the Pentagon now saying, according to our sources that they're severely limiting the distribution of these kinds of materials. In the meantime, as they do this review, and we are told that officials across the U.S. government who were receiving these kinds of documents over the last several months and even years have actually stopped receiving them in recent days. So clearly, the Pentagon is already trying to crack down on where, why and how this information is distributed, Julia.",

It became very tedious for him after a while. And so eventually, he just started taking photographs of the documents themselves and uploading them onto this server. It is not clear at this point, whether he altered any of them, they do appear to be photographs of these of these hard copies printed out copies of these documents themselves. So it would have been likely a little bit difficult to edit them in that way. But once these hit the internet, and once they started being spread around. For example, on pro-Russian telegram channels and on Twitter, that is when bad actors could have potentially taken them and altered them. And in fact, we are told that at least one of the documents was altered after the fact, by someone who had the motive to inflate Ukrainian casualty numbers as part of the war in Ukraine, for example. So it wasn't necessarily that he altered them, although that will be investigated, but that once those bad actors got a hold of the documents that were already out there. They seized on them to produce disinformation, Julia.",

But when we are doing that, we can still maintain investment and -- things that really matter to our societies. And the EU is playing a huge role and our true our recovery and resilience bond. And then the second scene that you just said there, which is the sea of communication.

I mean, it does appear to me that further trade with China is an inevitable feature of the global economic model that we're in. But from a European perspective, I want us to be involved in those trade discussions and those commercial opportunities in a position of greater strength than we are at the moment.

And even though our growth expectation for this year is less than 1 percent, it's still growth. So I am more optimistic. But that then leads into your excellent second point, then, which is so much of our economic outlook continues to be contingent on what happens with regard to the war. But leaving aside the economics of all of that there are some things that matter more. And what is more is Ukraine winning, what matters more is repelling their invasion, which they're suffering from, because ultimately, if the values and principles that are at stake, there are fragments and are weakened. The political, ethical, not to mention the economic consequences of that, in the long run, will be so negative and so big.

And since then, it has, you know, the most sacred place in Ireland, in the Catholic faith, so very significant that he is going there.

Then he's going to be speaking to some genealogists about his links to Mayo, his great, great, great grandfather, Edward Blewitt actually grew up on this street. And his ancestral home is just here at was just here behind me. And then tonight, he's going to come here to Ballina. For really what is the main events of this visit a spectacular setting down by the river Moy outside a cathedral, and he's going to address what is expected to be thousands of people, we're already seeing hundreds of people lining up here already so, a lot of excitement for the great, great, great grandson of Ballina to come home.",

So, you know, there is we were actually shown by the person who now owns the property where the ancestral home used to be on that there is a wall which they claim as part of that original home. So, I believe that is a piece of that wall is going to be gifted to him. I will say, in our days, I hear a lot of people making a lot of different connections to Biden, I'm not entirely sure.

So, you know, JFK, President Kennedy began this tradition 60 years ago, of coming to Ireland. He was, of course, the first Catholic President of the United States, Joe Biden is the second. He came here 60 years ago started this tradition of tracing Irish roots. And since then, many, several U.S. presidents have come back, Nixon, Reagan, and Obama.

It's a subject that we've spoken about many times with the World Bank president here on \"First Move\". This is the first of its kind meeting to bring both public and private creditors together to help give emphasis and importance to debt restructuring relief to help some of the poorest nations in the world. Finding a solution is something that the entire world needs to care about. The World Bank says developing nations will be unable to find trillions of dollars they need to combat big issues like climate change if these debt burdens and sustaining repaying these debts remain too high. I'm pleased to say World Bank President David Malpass joins us now on the show. Fantastic to have you great to see you in person as well! I think there are two big themes here. For the advanced nations, the growth is too low. And that needs to be reinforced and measures need to be taken to boost that. But also, for the poor nations, they need some debt relief. I know this is something that you've been working on now for years. Talk to me about the sovereign debt roundtable, there was some progress.

And in fact, the debt payments are, are really drawing down their international reserves and weakening their currencies. So that shows up as inflation for the poor in those countries. So, the urgency is clear. The question is, for example, for Zambia, they're going to have a meeting in a week or so with their creditor committee. And the hope is that there'll be a restructuring deal. This has been going on for two years. So, it's time to actually write down what the restructuring deal would be. And for China to agree to recognize that it's in China's interest to really get this moving along. The private sector has said that, that it would be better for the private sector to have predictability. Just tell me what the future is, because then I can invest either in that country or in other countries, China's should come to that same recognition that this is actually a good way out of these debt amounts.

As we were discussing earlier on the show though the big banks have benefited, I think from some of the broader uncertainty that we've seen, what we really want to hear is what the smaller banks are saying. We also got some U.S. retail sales numbers falling at 1 percent last month. You'd expect that in light to think again of the banking sector volatility that we saw in Silicon Valley Banks collapsed. The question is what happened here on out the U.S. retail sales, no shortage of things to discuss, of course, and I'm very excited to say. Richard Quest joins me now.
