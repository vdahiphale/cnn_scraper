The judge overseeing the case just indicated that opening statements are expected to begin tomorrow.The President's son has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges related to a gun that he purchased back in 2018. He's accused of illegally buying and possessing the weapon while abusing or being addicted to drugs. CNN's Marshall Cohen has been inside of court during today's jury selection process. And Marshall, there were a lot of questions to prospective jurors about drug addiction and guns and their particular experiences with both of those subjects. What stood out to you?",

And many of the prospective jurors did say in court that they have loved ones that struggled with addiction. Some of them were killed by overdoses or died from alcoholism.That's in many ways what this case is about, addiction and Hunter Biden's drug use while he bought that gun in 2018. So the whole purpose of this exercise today is to pick a fair and impartial jury. And that means that the parties had to kick out some people that said that they frankly could not be fair. There was one man who said that he believed it was every American's God-given right to own a gun and that there was no ifs, ands or buts about it. So because of those very strong views, he was excused. But then there was also someone from the other side of the political spectrum who said that she wishes that she could ban all guns in America. She also was excused. And then, Brianna, there's of course the politics hanging over all of this. This is President Biden's son standing trial, of course, here in his home state. One man said that he only gets his news from Fox and Newsmax. And frankly, he didn't think he could judge the son of the Democratic president fairly. He was excused. And there was another woman who said that she officially joined the resistance after Donald Trump took office in 2017. And she didn't think that she could be a hundred percent fair either. But I do want to be clear, most of the people that have been brought in have said that they think they can judge this case on the facts and the facts alone. Brianna?",

And that's why we heard the judge questioning on that very issue, because so many people have been touched by drug addiction, either in their family or people that they know. And so it plays into the case because it's expected that Hunter Biden will use the defense that he did not have the requisite intent at the time he was filling out the documentation. And by that, I mean, he will say that he didn't realize that he was a drug addict, because drug addiction is something that you don't really see clearly when you're the individual who's going through and suffering from those issues.And so the issue of addiction and the - and how that plays into the factor of intent is really relevant to both the prosecution and the defense.

So in state court, it's a little bit different. The lawyers will do voir dire. But here, the judge does the initial questioning and it sounds like she got down to the heart of the issues, where there were individuals who had really strong feelings either about politics or about gun rights on either side, whether it be conservative or more liberal views.The - and they said that they could not be impartial, they were eliminated from the jury pool. So then we get down to these 36 individuals, and now it's time for both sides, the defense and prosecution, to use what's called their preemptory strikes. This is when each side gets to eliminate certain jurors without making an application for cause, so they don't have to give a reason.

What would you be focusing on most as they move into the trial?So it's a tough case for the defense, especially since they were dealt some blows in yesterday's evidentiary hearing and evidentiary decisions by the judge. First, the defense wanted to bring an expert on drug addiction into the courtroom to speak to that very central issue that we were just talking about, forming the requisite intent when Hunter Biden was filling out that form. The judge said, no, that expert is not going to testify. They also wanted to question the veracity of the application itself, because a couple of years later, there was a doctored application. And so they wanted to say maybe this isn't valid or maybe this was not valid at the time, the actual form. So from the defense perspective, you are laser set and focused on saying the prosecution did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, and focusing on that issue of formulating the requisite intent, that knowing intent to falsify that record at the time. So that's going to be where the defense goes. And that's why I think we're seeing the prosecution say, well, we think this case is going to be about two weeks. We don't know whether the defense will actually put witnesses on or we'll just try and poke holes in what the prosecution puts forward.",

But until now, they hadn't been able to hit those forces that were massing there and carrying out strikes from there.So take a look at what the Ukrainian government minister had to say as she posted this picture on Facebook. She said, \"It burns beautifully. It's a Russian S-300. On Russian territory. The first days after permission to use Western on enemy territory.\" An S-300 is actually a surface-to-air missile that Russia had repurposed to carry out ground attacks. As a surface-to-air missile, it was a capable system, but as a ground-attack system, it is far less accurate and therefore creates a far greater danger to Ukrainian civilians when Russian forces have used it in this capacity. So Ukraine claiming that in the days in which they were allowed to use U.S. and other weapons to strike into Russian territory, they were able to take out a fairly significant system, one with a range of dozens, perhaps up to a hundred miles, so a significant claim from the Ukrainians. We haven't seen a Pentagon statement about this at this time. It's worth noting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Singapore for the Shangri-La dialogue. He met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. During his time there, he thanked President Joe Biden and the administration for making that decision, that change in policy, to allow them to carry out some limited strikes in Russian territory. But when he was asked about it, he said it's not enough. Yes, he says they have the permission to use HIMARS. That's a precision U.S. system to carry out strikes in Russian territory. But what's really needed, he says, is to carry out longer-range strikes, and at least for now, at the time being, that's something the U.S. has explicitly forbidden the Ukrainians from doing, to carry out strikes with, for example, long-range ATACMS missiles deep within Russian territory. That is still not allowed. According to these essentially limitations, Ukraine can right now use the systems they have to carry out strikes right across the border and to try to put pressure and to stop this Russian offensive near Kharkiv, Brianna.",

He explained that the Israeli military was now able to assessed through intelligence that there were killed a few months ago. And he said that they were killed while they were together, quote, \"In the area of Khan Younis during our operation there against Hamas.\" And we should note that one of these four hostages, Hamas actually said last month that he had been injured in an Israeli airstrike and had subsequently died of his wounds. And that Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman acknowledging that there will be, quote, \"Difficult questions about exactly the circumstances of their deaths.\" I want to read the four names of these men: Haim Peri, 79 years old; Yoram Metzger, 80 years old, his wife was actually released last year; Amiram Cooper, 84 years old. His wife was also held hostage and released last year. And then, Nadav Popplewell, that 51-year-old British-Israeli citizen who Hamas had mentioned in their statements last month. Now, we should note that as the news of this emerge, the hostage and family forum which represents many of the hostage families, once again renewing their call for the Israeli government to make this deal that is on the table, this Israeli proposal to make it a reality to stand by despite the pressures that we are already witnessing beginning to bare on the Israeli Prime Minister. Over the course of the last couple of days, we've watched as right- wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition, namely the Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and the National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have been threatening to pull the rug out from under Netanyahu and to collapse this government if he follows through with this Israeli proposal. A big reason for that has to do with the way in which President Biden framed this proposal on Friday night, framing it as a way to end the war, and the Israeli prime minister in the days since has been working to unwind some of that, insisting that he can still accomplish the goals of not only releasing the hostages but destroying Hamas before agreeing to a permanent ceasefire. There are a lot of questions about how exactly you square that circle. But it is true that the first phase of this ceasefire, during that time, there would indeed be negotiations about getting to a permanent ceasefire, getting to the withdrawal of Israeli troops in the second phase of this deal. But, of course, once a ceasefire is underway, once you're talking about weeks, maybe even months of a ceasefire, the U.S. administration believes it will be very hard, if not impossible, for the Israeli war machine to get back into gear. And therefore, very likely that this will indeed lead to an end of the war. Now we await, of course, Hamas' response. Jessica.",
