Hamas has not yet signed off on the potential deal.Also this week, the U.S. is sending its top humanitarian aid official to the region in hopes of improving critical supply shipments to Gaza's vulnerable population.

So, you know, we've been talking a lot on this anniversary about U.S. aid being held up on Capitol Hill. What do you see as the real battlefield impact right now and in the weeks and many even months to come if U.S. aid does not arrive? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's going to be catastrophic, Fred. It certainly is a dangerous situation because what we're talking about is Ukraine facing truly an existential threat. We use that term often and it doesn't mean what we're seeing right now in Ukraine. President Zelenskyy's comment that many people will die as a result of this delay in aid. We're already starting to see that along the frontline on the tactical fights within Ukraine in several areas of operations. They are withdrawing from key positions, but they continue to fight. And in fact, from my take, in terms of monitoring their fighting, they are doing quite well even as they withdraw to new defensive positions and the Russians continue to try and attack. So yes, all of the things we've heard from the reporters, all the things we've heard from President Zelenskyy are certainly true as we enter this third year of war, and the next few months will be critical.",

But what we're seeing right now is the rest of Europe is concerned. They're concerned that they might have to defend against Russia if Ukraine doesn't succeed.So they're holding and hoarding some of their ammunition and some of their stocks which they otherwise would have given to Ukraine. So now we're at a very balanced inflection point where, can Europe and the United States continue to give arms that they may or may not have in their reserves? Ukraine desperately needs it right now. And at the same time, Ukraine is building factories and coordinating with Western nations to try and get more ammunition.

And our reporter, there in Tel Aviv, also said that a ground offensive in southern Gaza seems like it may happen. And that impacts some one-and-a-half million Palestinians.What are your concerns about this threat of a ground offensive? SHERMAN: I think it's clear that the ground offensive would be put on hold, if this hostage deal is created. And a period of time to get the aid into Gaza. And a period of time for Israel, if it does go into southern Gaza, to make sure they do it right, to plan it well, to minimize civilian casualties. And, again, suspending fighting during Ramadan. That whole package is one that I think is very attractive.",

They're currently in the eastern Caribbean, trying to find their parents.And I can tell you, they are currently devastated. They told me they are without words, but not without hope. Already days into the search for their parents, and they are still hopeful that they will be found alive. However, they've also been told by authorities to prepare for the very real possibility that they will likely be confirmed to have been killed. Likely the victims of three individuals who were in custody at the island of Granada. And, according to authorities, they had -- those three individuals had escaped. And then, they believe had then encountered both Kathy Brundle and Ralph Henry, while they were in the middle of their winter adventure through the Caribbean. Her children, their children, telling me that they have been saving. They had been preparing for years. Preparing their vessel, \"The Simplicity,\" to go on this, as they described it, adventure from Virginia. And then, spending the winter in this paradise. However, investigators believe that is, sometime last weekend, when they crossed paths with these three individuals. And the reason why the family members of this Virginia couple have been told to prepare for the possibility that they may have been the victims of a murder. It's because they found that the cabin of that catamaran on Wednesday had been discovered by authorities, had been ransacked. They found blood aboard that vessel. And also, according to the sons of this couple, some of the property that was recovered on these three individuals that are now in custody also came from \"The Simplicity.\" And that is what leads investigators to believe that this is certainly something sinister. They suspect foul play but they do not have any bodies, at this point. And this is why, according to the sons of Kathy Brando and Ralph Henry, they are still searching in and around St. Vincent, which is where that catamaran was found this past Wednesday, for any potential signs of that -- of this couple. This was their home. They actually sold their belongings and their home many years ago. And they are these adventure seekers that have been married for 27 years, according to their sons. And this is the adventure of a lifetime that they were on, when authorities believe they encountered these three individuals. Now, investigators, the State Department, saying that they are aware of these three missing Americans in the Caribbean, and they are certainly looking into this. Now, as far as their sons, they tell me they are currently there, right now on the ground, trying desperately for any sort of answers. But, again, the main headline here, Fred, even after not having seen or heard from their parents, they are still hopeful that they are alive, but also preparing for the real possibility that their parents were killed.",

He's the executive producer of the new Vegas series, as well as the author of \"Elvis in Vegas.\" How The King reinvented the Las Vegas show.OK. So, I think there's going to be so much history that people really didn't know about. That being, you know, one page of history. So, how did it all begin anyway? How did such a sprawling entertainment metropolis sprout from the desert in the first place? Where'd this come from? RICHARD ZOGLIN, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, \"VEGAS: THE STORY OF SIN CITY\": Well, I think it started in 1931, which was the year that the state of Nevada legalized gambling. The first state in the union to have legalized gambling. And it was also the year that construction began on Hoover Dam, which was the hugest, biggest public-works project in the United States, up to that point. And it drew thousands of workers to the -- to the area. And what did they do on Saturday night to let steam off? They went to downtown Las Vegas. They gambled. They drank. And that's what Vegas sort of started become centers, kind of a fun city. And as the years went on, in the 40s, what happened was people started to build hotels outside of downtown on Highway 91, leading to Los Angeles, which we now know as the strip. And it was those hotels that really launched the kind of celebrity-heavy entertainment capital that we know today.",
