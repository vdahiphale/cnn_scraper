      "sentences": "Tonight on \"360,\" all aboard in New Hampshire, just four days before the primary South Carolina Senator Tim Scott is expected to endorse the former president, snubbing South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and becoming the latest Republican of many to fall in line.More breaking news tonight, a new Georgia court filing adding to the controversy over the Trump special prosecutor, the DA Fani Willis who hired him and allegations of an improper relationship between the two. And later, Alec Baldwin and how he came to be charged with involuntary manslaughter again today after similar charges were dropped last year in a deadly shooting on the New Mexico movie set. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with breaking news. Within the next hour or so, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott is expected to endorse the former president who has been working to establish himself after just one contest as the inevitable nominee. To that point, Senator Scott and his fellow Republican lawmakers are certainly helping. And it shows in how early and eagerly they've been falling in line compared to the first Trump campaign. On February 28th, 2016, then Alabama Jeff Sessions became the first Republican senator to endorse then candidate Trump. This was after Trump victories in New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. Now this time around, the endorsements have been coming earlier, in some cases, much earlier. Most recently, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Senator Rick Scott gave his nod before any votes were cast back in November. That's slow compared to Alabama's Senator Tommy Tuberville who got on board almost a year before that, on the 17th of November 2022. We'll have more on what this says about the former president and his party in a moment. But first, CNN's Alayna Treene at the New Hampshire Trump event where Senator Scott will give his expected endorsement. So what do we know about this event tonight?",

And in typical Trump fashion, they are trying to make this potential, or this expected Tim Scott endorsement a moment.We saw the senator tease this endorsement earlier today. He tweeted a photo right before boarding the private plane that Trump flies on and flying with him to New Hampshire for this event tonight. And I'm told that during his remarks, Trump will call the senator up to the stage and have him give remarks and praise the former president and call for four more years of Donald Trump. But I think, you know, what's important to note here, Anderson, is how this came together. Donald Trump and his team, according to my conversations with his campaign, have really pursued Tim Scott for this endorsement ever since he dropped out of presidential race last year. And they were really hoping that he would give his endorsement before South Carolina. But in recent weeks, as Trump and his team have closely watched Nikki Haley rise in the polls here in New Hampshire, they accelerated that time line as just another way to try and undercut her momentum here in the granite state.",

And yet, now they're falling in line. While at the same time, a New York court has found Donald Trump liable of rape. It's really just inconceivable to me that this has happened to the Republican Party. But the reason Donald Trump is winning is because he is giving Republicans what they want. Nobody is making anybody vote for Donald Trump. And he's running away with this probably unlike anything in modern history. He's really performing like an incumbent president.",

And as a Democrat, you saw that picture. An African-American, a Latino, and an Asian. There it is right there. And you were shocked, like, holy crap, is this the new face of the Republican Party? Democrats are in trouble. If you had said eight years later that Donald Trump would be the face of the party, and Rubio and Scott would like it, and would be happy to pile on against Nikki Haley while she's being slammed with racist innuendos from Donald Trump, he said, no way. That would be some crazy twilight zone black mirror episode. It's impossible. This Republican Party is moving in a positive direction. And yet, here you are eight years later with this -- it's a clown show.

He certainly, if he came out against Donald Trump, he might be a Trump challenger in a primary. But, you know, Tim Scott also could just not say nothing. I mean, you're literally in a situation, let's not forget, where Donald Trump is, you know, using her foreign-sounding name, saying that, you know, she can't run for president because her parents weren't born here. The same kind of crap that he pulled with Obama. This is really bad stuff. This is not good stuff. One of the great things about Tim Scott is, you know, he stood up to President Trump on some of this stuff, you know, after massacres and stuff like that.

I mean, I've been in these positions where I, you know, there's times I should have taken on the president, and I didn't. There's times I did and I knew what the cost was because you recognize like I'm going to be out of the game if I take this too much because he's convinced his base. Donald Trump is a masterful victim. He is actually one of the weakest men you'll ever meet. He's actually somebody that is scared of his own shadow, and he's frankly scared of everybody, but he puts up a really good front that he's not. And he puts up what appears to be a tough front, and it cajoles people like Tim Scott to not even wait until after New Hampshire. Give Nikki a shot to actually take it to New Hampshire.

They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those or at least they weren't checking them consistently. And then they somehow got loaded into a gun, handed off to Alec Baldwin.

Now, prosecutors appear to say, yes, this grand jury said yes, that he should be indicted. But, of course, we'll have to wait and see how -- what happens next.
