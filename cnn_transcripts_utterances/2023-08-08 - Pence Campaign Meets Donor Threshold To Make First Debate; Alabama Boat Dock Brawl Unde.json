It creates now a DMZ, a border situation of two hostile countries, if this thing stops tomorrow, if the Russians decide from a military perspective.The other thing though, it does put a little bit of a problem with Ukraine joining NATO. We can't bring a country into NATO that has a border conflict.

Last year, we had the lowest per capita homicide rate since 1964. This year, we're 37 percent below that number. That is very different from what's happening in other cities across America. And then we leaned into innovation. We have the lowest unemployment in America, the highest wage growth, and the highest tech job growth. That is a recipe for American prosperity. And my vision for the future of this country is to get the deficit under control, fix immigration once and for all, and focus on the rising threat of China as an economic and national security threat. That is the challenge of our generation. And we need a president that's ready on day one that has the background, and has the ideas and how to chart a path forward into this uncertain future.",

The polling you get the 40,000 unique donors.If a donor gives you $1 to get a $20 gift card, that doesn't say anything about their support for you. It's just that they're smart enough to take up 20 to one return on investment. SUAREZ: Yes. No, I understand. And I think, look, I was a late entrant into the race. I've only been in the race for about 60 days. I'm probably one of the least known of the top eight or nine candidates that are running. So certainly given this criteria, which is never been imposed before. And the understanding of how important it is, as you've indicated, to make it to the debate stage, because you're going to be one of nine with, you know, obviously not equal time. But, you know, and a great opportunity to articulate the message that I just articulated on your show. It's incredibly critical to a campaign to have that opportunity, particularly to a candidate who is not as well-known as some of the other candidates.

As it goes down, resistance comes down. So it's a strong correlation. And they saw this in, you know, some 166 countries around the world. So now, you know, the deeper investigation begins what exactly is going on here? A couple of theories. First of all, when we talk about these particles, these are tiny, right? Less than 2.5 microns in size. To give you some idea, you know, human hair is 50 to 70 microns in size. One theory is that these particles, they're in the air. We know that they can get into our lungs in our bloodstream. They may also carry some of these bacteria around, making them more -- making people more susceptible and increasing resistance. It could also be that there's more infections as a result of those bacterias going around, more people then using antibiotics. And that increasing resistance to those antibiotics.

Typically, it's due to overuse of antibiotics, use too much of it, the bacteria or the pathogens become smart, figure out how to evade it. We also overuse in farm animals and there's often poor infection control in some parts of the world. So these things can all lead to antibiotic resistance. This air pollution link, that's a new one.

So people who are more vulnerable, they develop an infection, their body can't clear it, and there's not a good bacteria to do it. So that's what we were dealing with in 2019.The potential, if you fast forward going to 2050, is about 840,000 additional deaths. Now, I want to be careful here. These are modeling studies.
