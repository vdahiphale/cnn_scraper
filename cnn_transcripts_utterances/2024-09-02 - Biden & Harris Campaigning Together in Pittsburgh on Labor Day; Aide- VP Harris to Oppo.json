Either it's familiarity or it's the way he comports himself or the fact that he fought for prescription drug price caps for them. But whatever it is, he's very valuable.

But I wonder how you are seeing that no real bounce and how maybe the Trump campaign may be seeing it.I think what you've been hearing from Democrats and I'm sure you all have been hearing the same thing, they're not taking anything for granted, be it, you know, the bounce you received out of the gate or what wasn't out of the DNC. They know this is going to be close no matter what. We're in the margin of error right now in several states. She has made up some ground than what we were seeing as opposed to Biden.

And Netanyahu insisted that despite what his own security advisers have been saying privately to him, that he believes that Israel will not be able to return to that Philadelphi corridor if he moves forward with the first phase of a ceasefire agreement.

And indeed, that appears to be what happened hours before Israeli troops reached the underground tunnel where these hostages were being held. These six hostages were killed, shot in the head, it appears, according to the Israeli military, before those Israeli troops were able to reach them. And now Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades is warning that Netanyahu's insistence on liberating prisoners through military pressure instead of concluding a deal, they say, will mean that the hostages will be returning inside of coffins instead of alive in a prisoner exchange.
