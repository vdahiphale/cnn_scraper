There's a new focus on his comments against sending arms to Ukraine. CNN's Nic Robertson has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice over): Robert Fico, Slovakia's pro-Putin populist leader has been here before. 2006, 2010, and 2016, winning the biggest vote share in national elections. 22.9 percent. But not enough for his Smer-SD party to govern alone. As they did, following the elections in 2012, he's challenge now, build a governing coalition. The clock is ticking, he has two weeks. ROBERT FICO, LEADER, SMER PARTY (through translator): I want to say to all Slovakia that we are ready. We are enlightened and we are more experienced in the fight we have taken. ROBERTSON (voice over): If he succeeds, it would be his third-term as prime minister, and could have a big impact beyond Slovakia's borders.

And I think that the likelihood is that he'll move with the party that came third in this election that is known as Voice. That is an outgrowth of his party and with whom they share these very important issues that played out in the election, which is the interruption of military aid and support for conflict in Ukraine, the end to sanctions on Russia, and for arguing for peaceful talks and negotiations. Highly controversial points. And all they would need if those two parties that have been partners before to join up would be at one of the smaller parties, probably the Nationalist Party of Slovakia would join up with them. For the party that came in second, they would need three more coalition parties. Their positions are diametrically opposed in the sense of their allegiance to European Union and to European Union talking points.

The European Union and NATO, I should add, have been very clear on this. In this particular conflict, there is a clear aggressor, it is Russia, and there is a country that has been illegally occupied, and that is Ukraine. Moving to a negotiating table, even though everybody hopes for peace is essentially to argue, without Russia having been withdrawn, that somehow both parties have a legitimate claim. This is a very risky proposition. It sets an awful precedent in terms of invasion. But I think the bigger issue, Rosemary here is that we see a kind of fracture, developing amongst European Union member countries on these particular questions.

And we can see some of the support for Ukraine for a neighbor and partner in the European Union here dwindling.

      "sentences": "Yeah, pretty eventful day for the first day of the civil fraud trial, brought against Donald Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Opening statements kicked off today with Trump inside the courtroom. And in those opening statements, the state's attorneys laid out what its case will be for the next three months or so that this trial is expected to last.Talking about how Trump and his sons and Trump or conspired to commit persistent fraud and saying in doing so, banks took on hidden risks. They talked about how they'll be calling several witnesses to the stand, including Trump's sons, and possibly Trump. And even Michael Cohen, who is of course his testimony to congress is the whole reason why this case even got started in the first place. When it was the defense's turn to bring its opening statements they talked about how Trump made billions off of just good business deals in real estate. Essentially saying that he did everything by the book and pointing out the fact that no fraud was committed. And that there are really no victims in this case. And some, they say, there is no illegality, there was no fraud, and there are no victims. Now as far as what was happening inside that courtroom, Letitia James was there inside sitting, as well as Eric Trump and Donald Trump was seated with his defense attorneys. Donald Trump did not acknowledge Letitia James several times as he walked past her, except for maybe one time. Eric Trump actually went over to Letitia James and shook her hand twice throughout the duration of the day. But Trump did take the time outside of the courtroom to lash out not only at Letitia James but about this trial in general, and about the judge who will be deciding really the balls and the stripes of this entire case. So it'll be interesting to see if he shows up later, on Tuesday for court. But as of now it is unclear if he will show up, although he is eager to testify again in a trial that is expected to last three months. I'm Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's Will Ripley has our report.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A fight for the future of a much loved Tokyo park. Protesters urging officials, respect history, stop the Jingu Gaien Urban Redevelopment Project. HIROSHI ONE, PROTESTER AND TOKYO RESIDENT (through translator): The Jingu Gaien is ours and our kids' cultural inheritance. It's not fair to push through a redevelopment plan without properly consulting citizens. RIPLEY (voice-over): Protesters fear heritage ginkgo trees will be endangered by a new stadium. Hundreds of others axed, making way for tall buildings of concrete and steel. This, they say, is not just a fight over one part, it's a fight for the future of Japan's green spaces, the right to have a say. Built with public donations in 1926, the Jingu Gaien is seen as a people's park. Home to a famous rugby venue, a historic baseball stadium where Babe Ruth once played. It's center piece, an avenue of one hundred year old ginkgo trees.",
