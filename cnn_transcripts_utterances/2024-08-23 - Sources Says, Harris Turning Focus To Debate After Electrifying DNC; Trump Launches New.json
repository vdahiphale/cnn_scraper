A source telling CNN Kamala Harris plans to scale back her very busy campaign schedule so she can spend more time preparing for the debate showdown.This hour, I'll be joined by a top Harris supporter, the North Carolina governor, the Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. We will get his take on the party's newfound momentum and the Harris campaign's all out push to win his crucial battleground state. And there's more breaking news we're following. Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail tonight armed with fresh attacks on Kamala Harris after her rousing convention speech. This as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is officially throwing his support behind Trump and suspending his long shot bid for the White House. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to our top story right now, the new focus for Kamala Harris after she fired up her Democratic base at this week's Democratic National Convention. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has more for us right now. Priscilla, what will this next phase of the Harris campaign look like?",

That's when that presidential debate is expected between the vice president and former President Donald Trump. So, the next couple weeks are going to be focused on those preparations. Those have already gotten underway and she'll do more of that.Now, of course, she is going to be hitting the road, but one source was telling me that that pace is going to look different from the last couple of weeks, where she hit every battleground state. This time, she will continue to be on the campaign trail, but also spending a lot of time on those preparations, making sure, of course, that those don't just start in earnest until a week before the debate. Now, of course, the other question still lingering is whether and when she does that sit down interview. Of course, the campaign has said that she planned to do that before the end of the month. But the vice president gave a glimpse to voters as to what they're going to be hearing over the next several weeks and months in her speech last night. Take a listen to how she plans to appeal to them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Our nation with this election has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past. I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They know it's going to be a tight race, and they want to make sure that they are on the trail and reaching voters, especially in battleground states. The battleground state director for the campaign saying North Carolina is an example. They want to be bullish there. That is a place where there may not be diehard Democrats, but there also may be voters who are disillusioned with Donald Trump.So, they're trying to make inroads with all of these voters and they're also going to enlist the help of surrogates, especially the Obamas and the Clintons. A senior adviser for the former president, Barack Obama, saying that he wants to go to places where he thinks he can move the needle. So, anticipate a lot of movement on the campaign trail over the next several weeks, but at least in the immediate future, Wolf, the focus is certainly going to be on that September debate.",

He did that repeatedly to Joe Biden throughout his time on the campaign trail. He's now, of course, trying to use that method of attack against Harris.But, look, it's clear as well that she's been getting under his skin. I've been talking to Donald Trump's allies and they've said, you can clearly see that he's very frustrated with the enthusiasm that she continues to sustain and the energy that surrounded her, particularly this week in Chicago. Now, Donald Trump also criticized her for her plan for no taxes on tips. That's something that Donald Trump first proposed at a Las Vegas rally in June. That was really what this event today in Nevada was all about, about trying to court some of the hospitality workers, the service workers that make up such a big part of this state's economy. He said that Harris was stealing his plan. He called her a copycat and a liar, and said that she can't come up with ideas on her own, so she has to steal his. I will note though, that many policy experts argue that neither of them have shared detailed plans on how to actually eliminate taxes on tips and say that it would be very hard to do. And just very quickly, Wolf, I do want to bring up as well, what he also discussed, which was RFK Jr.'s endorsement. He thanked him, said that he is looking forward to seeing him later tonight. And we have some new reporting that RFK Jr. is going to appear at that Arizona rally with Donald Trump this evening. You'll see them side by side, something that Donald Trump's team is very much excited about and had been working toward for several weeks now. Wolf?",

And that is perhaps one thing that that we sort of take for granted now, but that would not have had to be the case, given everything that happened over the last month with the Democratic Party. But leaving the convention, talking to Democrats they are energized, they are enthused, but there is no doubt that at least the vice president believes that she is still the underdog.And I really pressed some of her advisers today. Does she really think that? And they said this is how she is approaching this race. She met with some supporters last evening after that speech we're seeing there on the screen. And she said, look, tonight is great, but now we have to get back to work. So, they are viewing this as one more sort of piece of the wave of momentum that she's had in the first month. But they realize as well that the next 74 days or so are unlikely to be as lofty or soaring as these. But I'm told right now she's already and she's going to be turning her attention to the debate. So, her campaign is going to be campaigning. All those Democratic governors we saw on stage this week are going to be out campaigning on her behalf. She'll be campaigning some but not nearly as much as she has been, because she has to prepare for that debate. 18 days, that is the next real moment here, the big moment, perhaps a defining moment of this campaign. Wolf, she has never been in the same room as Donald Trump or on stage with him at a close to close range. That's how, you know, sort of unusual this moment is, but it's so significant. So, I'm told she's turning her attention now to that.",

Having Republicans come out, endorse her, my friend and former colleague, Adam Kinzinger, Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia, as well as some Trump administration officials, but also I was paying most attention to the words she was using and the things she was saying. And that, that clip that you played at the top resonated with me last night where she said, she asked independents or Republicans for their votes, juxtaposed to Donald Trump who said, we don't want the Nikki Haley voters, much less trying to bring in Democrats.So, I think she is running knowing that she needs to bring in some folks who wouldn't traditionally, necessarily be with her. I thought it was a very smart message, but now she's going to have to answer some really tough questions around policy. Luckily, Donald Trump also has some weaknesses around policy. So, I think who can first define where they're going to stand and moderate toward the middle is the person who's going to win.",

I think that there is a lot of pressure around what that's actually going to look like in real time, and the fact that the man is unraveling before our eyes, acknowledging that he's running against a black woman.All that said, she also recognizes that she is the underdog in this race. So, we're going to see more movement in the battlegrounds, not only from her, but more so from her surrogates as well, acknowledging that this truncated timeframe is what it is. The DNC brought a love fest of Democrats, independents, as well as moderates and some Republicans to Chicago, my hometown, I'm still here, to actually celebrate what this new ticket is. But that does not mean that this is going to be smooth sailing through November. She recognizes that. And the investments in the rollout as it relates to digital campaign ads that are going to come after September 1st, after Labor Day, that's going to be huge. We know the influencer community is huge and bringing in consistent younger voters. But moreover, it's going to be organizing on the ground, getting people to understand and acknowledge her story, being very strategic about the rollout of what her policy plans actually are. We already heard an economic agenda, but putting the nuts and bolts together of that economic agenda, specifically in the battleground states, is what we're going to see next.",

If nothing else, just to sort of get away from the question and the growing storyline, why isn't she taking questions.I mean, up until now, she's had a very scripted campaign, which is not necessarily easy, but it's not as sort of challenging as the unscripted moments. But I think one of the best ways to prepare for that big debate is taking questions from an interviewer. So, I do believe that will happen. Of course, many people are vying for it.

Now, there's someone new, there's someone energizing, there's someone who would be historic if she wins. And I think it was also just frankly a well-orchestrated convention that was a mixture of different kinds of policies, a mix of national security, having speakers from all over the country. I think it held viewers' attention.But 75 days is a long time. Donald Trump is a master at reclaiming the spotlight and getting eyeballs back on him. He obviously got the RFK Jr. endorsement today, which there's some pros to that and there's some real cons, but this is an incredibly tight race. And I come from the David Axelrod School of Thought on this, she should be running two points ahead, Democrats need to be, if they think they're going to win.

So, it was something that was very noticeable in addition to the fact that there has been a very longstanding supportive Democratic Party when it comes to Palestinian voters.At this point, I think that I personally would have liked to have seen, at least on the last night there to have been one of those speakers. Several of them were actually in the room. But in addition to that, it matters because the Cook County seat, the seat that Chicago sits in, has the largest Palestinian population in the entire country.

You know, I could make a case for why someone from Syria or Afghanistan should also be represented there. But what they did do was head-on talk about the fact that which for me, by the way, was a little bit surprising as a lifelong Republican who worries that oftentimes Democrats are too soft on their support for Israel, that they leaned into unequivocal support for Israel and its right to defend itself, but also calling for a humanitarian aid and ceasefire in Gaza. Addressing the issue, I think, is equally important as representation, and I actually was stunned by how well they threaded the needle for voters like me, who -- it's an absolute no go, if it seems, like you're in any way equivocating on your enduring support for Israel. And Kamala Harris specifically said she supports self-determination for the Palestinian people, which I thought was significant as well.

Bobby Kennedy claimed that Trump was going to appoint him to some kind of a vaccine commission, and then Trump's aides quietly distanced Trump from it, but Trump is open to having discussions with him. He likes him. Trump is a credentialist, and he likes the Kennedy name. So, this all began shortly before the Republican National Convention, and it's been moving toward this.

There are a number of Trump's aides who would like him to basically just be saying Biden- Harris, Biden-Harris all the time. And so that's his way of doing that. We'll see if he can sustain it.",

But what you also saw were comments that I think were designed to bait Trump. That was one of them. The more that Trump reacts self- destructively, the better Democrats feel it is for them.",

It was also important for her to talk about how she was going to be a president on the international on stage, contrasting herself, someone who is -- she is going to stand by her allies, people will be able to count on the United States of America. Our allies will, unlike Donald Trump who cozies up to dictators, those broad strokes were important. Many people were tuning in for the first time to hear Kamala Harris in depth. And I think it was important for her to give a broad idea of who she was. It was important for her to talk about her personal upbringing for middle-class upbringing, what she did. I told the story of serving as attorney general with her and how she went toe to toe with the banks and was able to help -- help us get to the largest consumer finance settlement in the history of our country.

Now, look, this is not going to stop the calls for accountability from Congress and from others who said that the failures that day are a fireable offense, but they investigation internally at the Secret Service is still ongoing, even as we continue to learn new details about those failures and specifically learning new details today about the communication breakdown that occurred between local officers the ground and the Secret Service agents that were there in charge with protecting Donald Trump. The district attorney for Butler County, the local district attorney, revealing to CNN that local officers had put aside radios for the Secret Service to use, basically an attempt to establish a direct line of community occasion between the officers there that day.

But even if a ceasefire deal is reached, Israel says it reserves the right to continue its war against Hamas in Gaza.CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv for us. Jeremy, what are we learning about this new proposal? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, this new Israeli proposal reduces the number of troops as well as military positions that the Israeli military would maintain during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. And this proposal is now on its way to Hamas via the Egyptian mediators for their review. And that's significant for two main reasons. The first of which is that the Israeli prime minister appears to be showing at least some flexibility on this issue of the Philadelphi corridor, even as he insists that Israel must retain security control of this strategic route. Secondly, it also suggests that the Egyptian mediators view this as somewhat more serious. That's because earlier in the week, they had actually rejected a previous Israeli proposal regarding the Philadelphi corridor, saying that it was a nonstarter and they wouldn't even submit it to Hamas. But now, this new proposal with a new map showing where these really troops would be located is on its way to Hamas. This was the result of significant pressure from the United States the Israeli prime minister agreed to submit this proposal a day after speaking on the phone with President Biden, who urged him to show more flexibility. But now the question his will is actually get Hamas to the negotiating table? That's because on Sunday, we expect that the negotiators may be meeting again in Cairo, Egypt. Last time they met Doha, Hamas only met with the mediators afterwards. The hope now is that if Hamas is sufficiently positive on this new proposal, that would at least agree to proximity talks. They would be in one room. The Israeli delegation would be in another room and the mediators would be going between the two. One thing is clear. We are seeing the urgency of a cease-fire every single day in the Gaza strip. Airstrikes in central southern and northern Gaza continuing every single day. And also now, a dangerous new development, the emergence of polio in Gaza. According to the United Nations, a 10-month-old baby is now partially paralyzed due to polio. This is the first such case in 25 years, and U.N. officials say they need a ceasefire to get children there vaccinated -- Wolf.",
