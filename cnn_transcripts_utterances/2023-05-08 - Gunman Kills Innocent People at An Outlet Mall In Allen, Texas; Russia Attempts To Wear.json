I just got off with a law enforcement source who tells me that of the multiple weapons that were recovered, that were owned by that suspect, all of them were purchased legally. Most of them were via private sellers, which means that they didn't go through a federal background check. That is legal here in Texas, obviously. If you buy from a private individual, you don't have to go through that federal system, but that's something that we continue to hear from gun safety advocates ridiculing the so-called private seller loophole.

Number one, the President and the Speaker and the Senate majority leader must negotiate in good faith. Number two, we must cut spending over the long term because we cannot continue to sustain this.
