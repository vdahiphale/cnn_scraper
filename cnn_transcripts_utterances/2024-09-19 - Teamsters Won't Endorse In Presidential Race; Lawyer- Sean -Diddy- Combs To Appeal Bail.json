(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN O'BRIEN, PRESIDENT, TEAMSTERS UNION: This was not an endorsement for the Republican Party. This is a wake-up call that the system is broken. If far -- it's far too long that the Democratic Party -- and I'm a Democrat -- has just got there a way. We need to hold them accountable. But this is an opportunity as well for both parties to take a hard look. Our goal in this whole thing is to work bipartisan and get things done for working people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Shouldn't there be some kind of wake-up call for Democrats since they are seeing some of those voters cleaved from what are normally dependable voters for them?",

And our union members are not influenced as they once was.We have to encourage our members to be active in who to vote for. And our members have they own minds. And they're moving in a different direction. And we've got to make sure, as union leaders and advocates, that's from stewards, the business agents, rank-and-file members, elected officials. We've got to make sure we educate our cohorts about what is best for us. And I say \"us\" as working people. We cannot vote against own best interests. And we talk about strikes? Donald Trump laughed and talking about strikes. He -- he applauded Elon Musk on rai workers. And any elected official, past or present, to laugh at us and workers standing up for their rights is a problem.",

I attended my union meeting, took part in that straw-poll vote. It was dead down the center, a third, a, third, a third, pretty much Biden and Trump, Cornell West, undecided. No -- no commitment. But we had a very low turnout in Malmo (ph). And you know, I can -- I can say I believe and my conversations with people around the country, it was a low-turnout also.

But he's also going to try to ask the judge in this case to recommend that Combs be transferred to a county jail in New Jersey where he thinks he will have better ability to help prepare in his defense for this trial. But that is another long shot. The judge doesn't have any authority to move him. It would just be a recommendation. But that is something that they're also trying to work on. Again, though, this is a high hurdle. Two judges have now rejected and denied giving Combs any bail. Their concerns about the physical violence that was caught on that tape that CNN had obtained in March, as well as the -- the evidence that has been laid out in this case. Including prosecutors pointing to numerous conversations that Combs has had with some women involved in this, whether they are witnesses or victims. That is something that the judges were also focused on in both of the hearings over the past two days. And what we also learned from these hearings, prosecutors saying they have a massive amount of evidence in this case. They've collected over 100 laptops, cell phones. And what we learned is that, on Tuesday, that the head of Combs' security was served with a search warrant for his electronic devices. And a prosecutor said in court yesterday that that is because they have learned of that individuals personal involvement in some of the issues that are under investigation. So this investigation, as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Damian Williams said the other day, is active and ongoing. It seems that they are still taking steps to try to obtain evidence in this case as they are working to build out this this investigation. There's charges already against Combs and the prosecutor signaled it's very possible there could be additional charges, whether that's against Combs are other individuals still remains to be seen -- Boris?",

Remember, that's the company that owned the submersible and ran it. His name is Steven Ross. He gave some pretty shocking testimony towards the end of it, not getting into too much detail, but did talk about how there was a malfunction of the sub just days prior to that implosion that you just talked about. He described the weather conditions at the time. He described what it was like inside that submersible, and the five people on board, what happened to them. I want you to listen to his testimony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. STEVEN ROSS, FORMER OCEANGATE SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR: The pilot crashed into the rear bulkhead. The rest of the passengers tumbled about. I ended up standing on the rear bulkhead. One passenger was hanging upside down. And the other two managed to wedge themselves into the -- the bow end cap. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
