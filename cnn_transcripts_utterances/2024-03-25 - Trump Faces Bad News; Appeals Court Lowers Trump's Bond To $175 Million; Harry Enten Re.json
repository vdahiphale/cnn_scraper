And a Diddy insider joins us in just a few moments. But first, Donald Trump ducks and weaves but a bunch may have just landed. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"Some bad news for the former president, current candidate. His hush money trial, you know, the one over his alleged attempt before the last election to cover up an also alleged affair with adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels, well, that's now been set for April 15th, whether he likes it or not, by the way, and apparently, he does not. During a hearing today with Trump in attendance, the judge threw out his motion to toss out the indictment altogether or even to delay the trial any further. Now, that trial is just three weeks away. Remember when it seemed everybody was questioning why the Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg's criminal case against Trump was going to be the first one out of the gate? Remember all the headlines? Well, here are some of them. Why did the Stormy Daniels case lead to Trump's first indictment? Bragg's case is a legal mess. What is he even charging Trump with? Bragg's case against Trump hits a wall of skepticism, even from Trump's critics. Now, it's the only criminal case so far with a firm start date. But wait, there's more. Control room, music please. (MUSIC PLAYING) Tonight, who wants to bail a billionaire? Hmm. A New York appeals court gave Donald Trump a lifeline. Anybody got a spare, a $175 million bucks? See what I did there? That's the size of the bond Trump has to now put up in the next 10 days. This after Judge Engoron ruled he fraudulently inflated his net worth. And let's be clear, this did not somehow lower the $464 million civil fraud judgment against him, his sons Don Jr. and Eric and, of course, his company. This just simply lowers the amount of the bond to go forward with the appeal. Now, only in Trump world would having to post a bond for $175 million be considered a victory. But it is roughly a 60% discount. Hey, bonds are on sale. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

March 25th, he was granted that 10-day extension for the bond that has now been lowered. You see September now, the appeals court ready to actually hear the arguments.And so, this is actually going to prevent Attorney General James from being able to actually enforce this judgment until I think, what, the appeals court rules September at the very latest or even beyond?

That's always been his goal, Tiffany, to push his trials after the election. He is now saying that there's a, you know, a pre-trial publicity issue and that he couldn't possibly have this case before the election.

He's confronting delay tactics which, as a judge who's here to do law and do justice, that has to be very frustrating. And so, I don't think it's the D.A.'s office. They're ready.

And if there's one case that Trump would perhaps be okay with going forward, given the politics of it, it is, in fact, the New York hush money case because -- take a look here.View charges as very serious. Only 32% of the public view the charges in the New York hush money case as very serious, significantly less than the classified docs case at 51%, the Georgia election case at 54%, or the federal January 6 trial at 56%. So, New York hush money far below those other cases. But, of course, let's broaden this out and let's just talk about the effect that the indictments have had on the general election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. So, this is the Biden versus Trump matchup, and this is among registered voters. Let's look at March 20, 2023 pre-indictments. Biden was up by two points. Look where we are today in the general election matchup. Trump is actually up two points. And keep in mind, this isn't just among Republicans. This is among the electorate at large. There is one thing, though, that I would worry potentially about if I were Donald Trump. Go back to 2016. Why Trump is the best candidate to help you on your finances? Among those who said that Trump had the best policies on this, what was the plurality reason for it? He's a successful businessman at 32%. So, if all of a sudden Trump can't pay these fines from the Trump civil trial, fraud trial, this may, in fact, impact his support because if voters don't think he's rich anymore, that may, in fact, drive his support down.

I think that's a fair point to ask. Who's the victim? Who has been harmed? The money was paid back. The bank was satisfied, whatever the interest was, although it was reduced interest, clearly, right, because of how he appreciated the assets. But nevertheless, they're saying there isn't anyone harmed, so there shouldn't be anything. Would this be the case if it was someone else?

It was an extramarital affair that was alleged. The nature of her employment as an adult film actress and director, given that Access Hollywood tape, of course, that can be talked about, but not played in the courtroom in this case. Is this now the revival of this going to harm him with those same demographics? SINGLETON: I don't think so. I think from the perspective of a lot of those conservatives, this is sort of existential at this point. I think it's fair to say they really view Trump in many ways as the last defender of what they think the country should look like politically, socially, culturally. I mean, he is that final arbiter, if you will. And if you get rid of Trump, then who is going to stand up for the religious right? Who's going to stand up for the pro-Second Amendment guy who says, I want to keep my guns? Who's going to stand up for just the lay conservative, generally speaking?

Now, a Homeland Security official in Miami tells me that the agents arrived at this property at around 3:00 this afternoon and quickly got to work. Around that -- around that time across the country out in Los Angeles, they were spotted walking the property of a house that also belongs to P. Diddy. Now, neighbors out here in Miami Beach tell me that when all of this unfolded, anywhere between 30 to 40 law enforcement officers lined up the street where this house -- this home is located. And so, again, Laura, at this hour, we're being told, at least we've witnessed, that Homeland Security investigators appear to have finished their work here in Miami Beach, having collected, as you noted, some evidence, though they have yet to detail exactly what that evidence is, and we're told that the work out in Los Angeles is still ongoing.
