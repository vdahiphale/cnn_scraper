So, what we're seeing is that Latinos understand that the traits and the policies that are humane, that is about family unification, that is about the values of our community are trending much, much higher with Kamala Harris.This is an opportunity also because doing our poll we also find that because of the short term of these new announcements, many Latino still want to hear more about policy, policy platform, for Kamala Harris ticket. So, this is the opportunity to solidify that and to give some of the answers that our people are looking for.

I was a teacher when I started - when I changed my career and started working for the Obamas because we want to be a part of something. And that's what's happening with Kamala Harris. People want to be a part of it. They want to be in the moment.And then they're like, well, what do I do? Well, you talk to your neighbors. You talk to the people in your community. You tell the story of yourself so they can tell their story. Organize and convert that to votes. That's the something.

And there are people who do want combat because they're put out with the government. They don't think the government can help. Obama talked about this. There are people who don't believe the government can help or that the government is inherently corrupt. And there are a lot of Americans who feel like, after everything they've been through economically, that that is exactly the condition they're in. And so what I think the Obamas are betting on is that there's slightly more than 50 percent of the people that will go for this, and then there's slightly less than 50 percent that will go for the politics to come. I don't know who's going to be right, but to me it is a stark contrast. But I do think there are a lot of Americans who don't want to - I mean they don't want to hear it because they feel like they have been absolutely beaten down for years between Covid and inflation and everything else. And they're not here to be uplifted. They're, here to be rescued. And that - that will be, I think, how Trump tries to combat it.",
