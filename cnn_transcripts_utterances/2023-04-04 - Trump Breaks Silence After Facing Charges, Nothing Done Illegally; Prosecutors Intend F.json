Now, the story centers on the payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels, that $130,000 hush money payment, but it zooms out to also include other payments that were made to suppress unfavorable stories in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. That includes $150,000 payment made to Playboy model Karen McDougal about an alleged affair with the president, as well as $30,000 paid to a doorman who alleged that then candidate had fathered a child out of wedlock.So, prosecutors are looking at this pattern of efforts to try to suppress unfavorable stories to help, as they alleged, Candidate Trump's electoral prospects, and that, they argue, is what elevates this beyond just falsifying business records to something that impacted the 2016 election. But, Erin, it's still just charged as falsifying business records. And, usually, that is a charge that is part of a larger crime but that's not the way they have constructed this case, and that is somewhat surprising. Now, the district attorney was pressed on why he's bringing these charges now or if he has new evidence. He did suggest that there is new evidence they've uncovered, but that was not revealed in this indictment right now.",

Was she doing this because she felt that her story would be more valuable at that time period? Who reached out to her? How is the money exchange?

We don't quite know what that is now. He said at the press conference. So, we shall see how this all plays out. There was a back and forth with the former district attorney in the last hour of the program. He said that, you know, it's actually quite a detailed document. The document itself is not that detailed. He submitted a statement of facts with that that had some details in it. But there're still some questions. I see Carrie is nodding.

And what was interesting today was to see that very little information, just the crime at issue was in the indictment, a little bit more of the contextual facts were in the statement of facts, but then it was really the D.A.'s press conference where he talked about this other potential ancillary violation of criminal law, which is still very vague.And I think that will be one area that presents really an opportunity for the former president's defense attorneys in their motions practice which this -- really, this has such a long way to go now, this case, before it is resolved, and there's going to be a lot of motions filed that can potentially get at some of these issues of what still is unclear about the prosecutor's theory of the case.",

I think we're trying to sort of make predictions about how this is going to play politically for Donald Trump. It looks like the next hearing is going to be like in December, maybe a trial in January, maybe a trial in the spring. That's what Donald Trump's lawyers seem to prefer. So much is going to happen between now and then. Obviously, you know, they're going to file motions to dismiss as well, but I do think there is sort of a lane of the groundwork that a former president can be indicted, right?There are other cases that we're going to hear, other investigations that are going on around January 6th, around the documents case, as well in Georgia. I think one of the themes that we're going to hear from Republicans and Donald Trump about all of these cases is that somehow all of these cases end up helping Donald Trump, right, and somehow they're all political. But I think, in some ways, we should really take that as spin in some ways and sort of with a grain of salt, because that is what Donald Trump has been saying throughout his time in public, like throughout his presidency, that all of these scrutiny, the impeachments would help him and that it was all sort of a political witch hunt. And I think, you know, you heard from the voter in Pennsylvania, for instance, this is one of the reasons why voters turned against him, because of all of the scrutiny and all of the sense that he was doing something in different instances that he shouldn't be doing.",

Well, the New York district attorney already took care of that. Now, Jack Smith and his team of prosecutors are -- you can tell from some of the activity we've seen in court, are working to try to make a decision on bringing charges and whether to bring charges.And one sign of that Wolf, as we've seen, is that we've seen witnesses who had gone before and been interviewed by the FBI now being brought before the grand jury. So, it's very likely, Wolf, that at least for the Mar-a-Lago investigation, the investigation into whether the former president was willfully obstructing and willfully keeping national security information, that investigation appears to be in a different timeline from the second investigation at the Justice Department, which is whether the former president has committed a crime in his efforts to remain in office.

No. This is politics, and it's gross politics. This is a type of thing that the American people don't want to see. Look, you can have disagreements between Republicans and Democrats.

He ordered nobody. He organized nothing. Those are the fact patterns. We looked at that in the oversight committee, frankly, before Nancy Pelosi shut down the oversight committee, but we'll move on from that.I'm not as concerned about what they actually might legally come up with.

We've heard a lot of the similar reaction that we heard in the aftermath of the leak of this indictment over the last several days, people like Speaker McCarthy, saying that Alvin Bragg will be, quote, held accountable, vowing that he would use the power of their House majority to investigate Alvin Bragg's actions.There are other Republicans also falling in line, but in a notable reaction from one very prominent Trump critic within the Republican party, Mitt Romney, someone who voted for two Trump impeachment, someone who says that Donald Trump should not be elected president again. He came out and he criticized Alvin Bragg in the aftermath of the unsealing of this indictment. He said in a statement, I believe President Trump's character and conduct make him unfit for office. Even so, I believe the New York prosecutor has stretched to reach felony criminal charges in order to fit a political agenda. He goes on to say, Wolf, the prosecutor's overreach sets a dangerous precedent for criminalizing political opponents and damages the public faith in our justice system. Now, not all Republicans have been vocal. In fact, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has not commented since the news broke on Thursday that Donald Trump has been indicted. And in the aftermath of the actual details coming out, he still has not commented, neither has the number two Senate Republican, John Thune. Both of them have been silent and both of them view Donald Trump much differently than Kevin McCarthy does. Kevin McCarthy aligns himself with Donald Trump because he credits him for winning the speakership on the 15th ballot. McConnell and Thune are eager to move past the Trump era and are staying away from the details of this endowment right now. And some Democrats are weighing in, but not many in the top Democratic ranks are embracing this yet. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, did issue a statement before this was unsealed, saying that this investigation, this case really should be devoid of outside influence. But he has stayed away from weighing in on the mirrors of this case, as has the top Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries up to this point. And, Wolf, Congress is on recess this week and next week for the Easter holiday. So, that is one reason why there are not many members who are weighing in. Some of the most vocal ones are siding with Donald Trump, but some other ones who might be more critical, staying quiet for now.",

That number two, no copies should ever be given out, that you should only be able to look at them in the attorney's office in the presence of an attorney. And number three, you cannot give these materials to a third party or post on social media. And what was interesting was the prosecutor who asked for this protective order on the record, said it's because of the fact that Mr. Trump has been threatening witnesses and trying to try this case in the court of public opinion, and he said we are -- we are the -- we're working out a way that the defense and the prosecutor will consent to the limits of the protective order, and it looked like they were coming to an agreement. But then afterwards, Donald Trump's lawyer said, but we just got this indictment and this prosecutor filed a statement of fact. That's not fair for us to not be able to respond.

Now, Weisselberg pleaded guilty last August, a felony tax fraud charges. Judge Merchan was heavily involved in those negotiations. In January, Merchan sentenced Weisselberg to five months in jail and said he wished the plea deal had allowed him to make the sentence longer. Judge Merchan was also very publicly upset at the trial that Weisselberg's wife got a payment of several thousand dollars for a no show job to qualify for Social Security. Even after all that, though, Weisselberg's own attorney, Nicholas Gravante, emailed CNN, saying the Judge Merchan was, quote, efficient, practical, well-prepared, accessible and a man of his word. But there is another person who looms large in Trump world who's also on Judge Merchan's docket, and that is former White House strategist Trump's White House strategist Steve Bannon. He's facing charges that he defrauded donors to a nonprofit group. He has pleaded not guilty. Judge Merchan is handling that case as well. We should note, though, that despite Judge Merchan's record for being tough, he did side with Donald Trump on one very important matter today. Judge Merchan, of course, ruling to keep video cameras out of the courtroom for today's proceedings, Wolf. So, we'll see how Judge Merchan negotiates this case.
