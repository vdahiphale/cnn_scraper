      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, it's Super Tuesday, the most importantday in the 2024 U.S. presidential race so far. And it's all eyes on Donald Trump as his big delegate lead, and it is expected to grow. We'll tell you the key races, of course, to watch. Also ahead, President Biden says that potential Gaza ceasefire deal is in the hands of Hamas, as well as pressing that more aid needs to be getting into Gaza. And the EU says it needs to ramp up its defense capabilities in light of Russia's war in Ukraine. This as the bloc looks to decrease its dependence on American weapons, that latest on that a bit later this hour. But first, tonight, millions of voters in the United States are going to the polls on Super Tuesday. One of the most critical days on the primary calendar. Races are being held today across the U.S. in 16, as you can see there, states and American Samoa. With a strong showing, Republican Donald Trump could come close to clinching his party's nomination and putting an end to Nikki Haley's campaign. On the Democratic side, U.S. President Biden is looking to shore up his base after more, if you remember, than the 100,000 Democrats voted uncommitted in Michigan, many of them protesting his handling of the war in Gaza. Our Brian Todd joins us now from Sandy in Utah. And Brian, it's worth pointing out to our viewers that Trump won Utah in 2020 with a pretty strong showing. It is something around 58 percent, but the challenge here, and you correct me if I'm wrong, is whether Nikki Haley can chip away at that support, give us a sense of what to expect today.",

      "sentences": "Right, Isa, this could be Nikki Haley's best chance to chip away at Donald Trump's support on theRepublican side. As you  mentioned, Donald Trump won the state of Utah pretty handily over Joe Biden in the general election in 2020. But in the 2016 Republican caucuses here in Utah, he lost handily. So, Utah has a history of kind of a lukewarm support for Donald Trump. First, let's set the scene for you. This is where the caucus is going to take place, where we are. This is Alto High School in Sandy, Utah, a very big high school, 32 precincts are going to be voting here. We are not allowed to go inside right now because school is in session, but later tonight, 32 precincts are going to be -- people are going to be gathering inside those doors, they're going to be gathering and hearing speeches. And then at about 7 O'clock local time here, they're going to be voting, putting ballots like this into a container, a simple ballot. You've got Ryan Binkley, kind of a random third candidate running for president, then Nikki Haley, then Donald Trump here, very simple ballot. They filled this out after hearing speeches and talking to each other, that's how a caucus works. Then they put it into a container, then at about 8 O'clock local time here, they're going to start the vote-count. We're going to be able to kind of see all that in motion. That's what makes a caucus so interesting to cover. Now, as we kind of pivot over here and give you a panoramic view of the beautiful mountain ranges around here, let's talk about Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley does have a chance to chip away at Donald Trump's support because as I mentioned, Donald Trump has had kind of lukewarm support in previous caucuses here in Utah. Also, the Utah Governor Spencer Cox has said openly that he is not like Donald Trump as a candidate, he does not like Joe Biden as a candidate. This is a Republican governor of Utah. Now, the governor has not formally endorsed Nikki Haley, even though he says he likes her, but the governor's wife, Abby Cox, has endorsed Nikki Haley as has the Lieutenant Governor, Deidre Henderson, she has endorsed Nikki Haley. Also here in Utah, you have the Mitt Romney factor, the senator who is retiring, a former presidential candidate, Republican senator is clearly an opponent of Donald Trump, he's been very critical of Donald Trump for years, and Mitt Romney is still a popular figure here in Utah. Can Mitt Romney, can that factor kind of pull some votes away from Donald Trump and toward Nikki Haley? Donald Trump needs to win 50 percent of the vote or more tonight to take all of the 40 delegates here up for grabs in the state of Utah. Can he do that? And can he add to his sweep of all of these states? Well, Utah, maybe the last best chance for Nikki Haley to really chip into that, and maybe, just maybe she pulls an upset win here in --",

She has come out very openly and said these are not the two candidates you want, but what's also interesting here is that the governor I was mentioning a moment ago, Spencer Cox, he has spoken openly about the age factor with both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and said these are not the candidates you want. You know, this is again a popular governor here in Utah, can he sway the votes over to Nikki Haley? Who a lot of people believe could be a good candidate against President Biden if she were to win the nomination. She's not going to do that, of course, but could she may be put up a good last stand here in Utah, given all those things we've been talking about.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's been really interesting because we've heard from a variety of different voters who have been exiting thispolling location just behind me, and they've been voting for different people. We've heard that some vote for Biden, some vote for Trump, and some vote for Nikki Haley. But what I found really interesting about the conversations I've had today is, those who did vote for Nikki Haley said they weren't sure who they would vote for in November if it ended up being a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. They argued that they really see Nikki Haley as the only candidate that they can support at this time. And it's really in line with some of the conversations I've had over the past different primaries in different states this year, a lot of people who are very, you know, excited about Nikki Haley are not feeling so excited about the other two candidates, and that also aligns with the polling that we've seen, which is that a lot of Americans are dissatisfied with who they think are going to be the two options to go on into the general election. Now, I also just wanted to share some other interesting things about this state. One is that it is an open primary, it's one of few states participating in Super Tuesday that have this type of dynamic, which is that Republicans, Democrats, independents alike, can all vote and they can all choose whichever candidate they want to vote for despite party registration. And that's really important because in some of the other states where you have to be a registered Republican in order -- Republicans in order to participate in the primary, Nikki Haley and her campaign have seen that as a disadvantage. We know that they've really been making a play for Democrats, moderates, independents to all come out and try to boost her campaign. And so, she has an opportunity to do that here in Virginia. And just one other thing that I want to share with you, which is from some of my conversations with the Trump campaign and some of Donald Trump's senior advisors. In Virginia, they really do see this as a potential battleground. Donald Trump lost this state both in 2016 and in  2020. But in my conversations with them, they argue that they think it's in play in a general election. And part of that is because they think the economy really resonates with voters here, and mainly, the idea that the economy is not doing well, that inflation is hurting them. Of course, all of those comments being made by the former president and his team despite the economy in the United States actually doing much better.",

Well, U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken says it's on Hamas to accept an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Blinken met with Qatar's Prime Minister at the State Department today. Qatar is playing a critical role in efforts to indirectly broker a truce and hostage agreement between Israel and Hamas. Blinken also met behind closed doors with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, the State Department says they discussed the urgent need to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

We know that Israel wants the names of the prisoners that are the hostages rather that got -- Hamas is willing to release from Gaza before any ceasefire is reached. And we saw a Hamas official today saying that there would not be any prisoner-release until there is that ceasefire. However, the State Department said today that they continue to believe that a deal can be possible, that they can reach this deal, it's crucial deal to get more aid into Gaza and to get those hostages out.

On the one hand, it is the fact that they don't believe that they can fully rely on the United States anymore as far as defense production is concerned, certainly, with the uncertainty that you were talking about as far as NATO is concerned. But the second thing is definitely the war in Ukraine, and the European Union certainly saying that they feel that they need to get very real about their defense production. Now, they say the funding for this is going to come in the years between 2025 and 2027, and it's going to mean joint defense procurement on a much larger scale than the European Union has seen so far to make it more independent of the United States. And I think shells are definitely going to be one of the very important things that the Europeans are going to produce, because the stocks in Europe themselves have been quite depleted as well. You know, one of the things, Isa, that we've seen here in Europe -- and I was recently -- added artillery ammo factory in central Germany is that certainly, the Germans are ramping up production, other countries are as well. And now the European Union is trying to get that under a common umbrella to make it more effective, but to also make sure that European countries have enough ammo, but the Ukrainians also have enough ammo as well, Isa.",

They areacknowledging that the call was real, that it was apparently intercepted. They obviously called this a Russian information operation. Now, it appears as though all this took place a couple of weeks ago in mid February, and it was between four people, one of them being the German Air Force chief, but apparently, one of the participants of this call, which was conducted on Webex, was at an air-show -- a German senior official at an air-show in Singapore. And apparently, he dialed into that call on Webex, which the Germans say that itself is fine, but he did not adhere to the security protocols that he should have adhered to. And that's why that call was compromised. The German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius came out and he says, he does not believe that communications within the German military are generally compromised. He says that this was an individual error. Nevertheless, of course, the political fallout has been massive. On that call, the senior generals, they talked about the Taurus missile, what it would mean if the Ukrainians got it, they also talked about how many missiles would be needed to destroy the Kerch Bridge, which is of course, the bridge linking Russia to occupied Crimea. And the Russians very angry about this are accusing -- or some Russian officials have accused the Germans of planning an attack on the Kerch Bridge. The Germans obviously very much denying this, saying they were just talking about the specs of the missile. But it is an interesting time for this call to be leaked for exactly the reason that you were saying that Olaf Scholz has very recently publicly rejected at least for now, giving the Ukrainians the Taurus missile. He's gotten a lot of criticism for that, not just here in Germany, but from NATO allies as well, particularly, the French and the Brits who of course, have given the Ukrainians cruise missiles in the past. They're saying that the Germans really do need to step up. Isa.",

Donald Trump has already secured most of the delegates and his path looks very strong today. If Nikki Haley -- she always says that she wants to improve on previous performances, but it's becoming much more difficult for her. The states are more numerous. They're closer together, and it's hard to campaign. And I'm going to be looking at states of Virginia and Vermont, two states that she could perhaps do well there. But the reality is, is that Nikki Haley has had a phenomenal last two months of fundraising. $28 million dollars or more she has raised yet she's hardly spending any money right now in this Super Tuesday primary states which is a big sign that perhaps her campaign will end relatively soon, especially if she doesn't win anything today or exceed expectations.",

You not only have discontent among Democrats about his handling of the war in Gaza, but you have frustration that he has not been doing enough for the Democratic base voters.

But when the first batch of survivors of hostages were released, I did issue a first statement on the 8th of December about the plight of the hostages. And I issued a second one on the 75th day of the hostages being in captivity. I have met with families of hostages since December. And whilst in Israel, I also met with other families and relatives of hostages who are still in captivity. And that's my main concern.
