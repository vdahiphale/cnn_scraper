It's why this meeting is happening behind closed doors. And, you know, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner, told some reporters the other day that he wants to go through some possible recommendations for reforming the FBI with Durham today. It will be interesting to see what Democrats want to ask Durham given the two very different interpretations of his report.

Another disturbance waiting behind it. That's expected to develop here in the coming hours and days as well.But let's focus on the more immediate threat, Tropical Storm Bret, 40 miles per hour wind. You can see both disturbance, the one behind Bret is going to curves to the north. We're going to focus to on Bret as it heads towards the Windward Islands. And this is incredible because look at the water temperatures here. They're running about 3 to 5 degrees above average where you see that shading of orange. And because the water temperatures are so warm, we're seeing this early season development, hence the not so typical start to the hurricane season. This is the forecast track. The National Hurricane Center does have this becoming a minimal category one hurricane by Thursday morning. But then you start to notice some weakening in this storm system. And that is because it is going to be forced into a lot of sheer and dry air. So what that's going do is help kind of de-strengthen the storm as we head into the second half of the workweek. But, nonetheless, it will still pose a threat to the eastern Caribbean going forward. The other major story we are following is the excessive heat that is going to yet again challenging the power company across the deep south, particularly into Texas. Excessive heat warnings. This was pretty astounding. Yesterday in San Angelo they had a temperature of 111. That ties the hottest temperature that San Angelo has ever recorded in the state's history. That is just incredible. And 120 degrees for Corpus Christi. That is what it will feel like today. That is the heat indices. So, extremely warm temperatures, especially when you factor in the humidity. And the relief really comes to the second half of the workweek. That's when we start to see some rain settle in. You can see temperatures dropping to a cool and balmy 93 in Houston. Victor. Poppy.",
