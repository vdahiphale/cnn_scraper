And in the nation's capital, another suspected killer wanted for breaking loose from a prestigious D.C. hospital.

I'm Jake Tapper.And we're going to start in our law and justice lead today, and two manhunts that are baffling law enforcement and leaving communities on edge with many, many questions. In the suburbs west of Philly, Pennsylvania state police have given an update on the search for Danelo Cavalcante who escaped from a prison in West Chester one week ago. Police shared new details of reports yet again -- yet another sighting of Cavalcante just this morning. And in the nation's capital, Washington, D.C., it is day two of the search for an accused killer who escaped police custody while at a hospital. Police say that Christopher Haynes escaped during a change of his handcuffs, assaulting an officer in the process. But, first, let's go to Chester County outside Philadelphia where just moments ago, police gave an update on the frantic search to find this internationally wanted criminal who has been on the run for eight days. Danelo Cavalcante, seen here on the left side of your screen, literally crab-walking his way out of prison. You see him there about to scale the brick wall. There he goes, managing to get through layers of razor wire right after that. The tower guard who failed to see that is now on administrative leave, we're told. A reminder, this escaped killer was in prison for stabbing his former girlfriend to death in 2021, stabbing her 38 times, all in fronts of her two young children. Cavalcante also wanted in Brazil, his native country, for allegedly killing someone in 2017. CNN's Danny Freeman is live for us outside the Chester County prison outside Philly. Danny, are police any closer to finding Cavalcante do they think?",

      "sentences": "Listen, Jake, police here in Chester County, they're still projecting strengths, they're still saying they believe they are getting closer to capturing Cavalcante. But the reality is, is that Danelo Cavalcante, the escaped inmate, continues to evade capture day after day for a week now since that video of him escaping the prison behind me.I do want to tell you some of the things we did learn from that press conference that just wrapped up. First, police believe, that's Pennsylvania state police who are running this operation, they still believe that Cavalcante is in the perimeter that they have set up in recent days. The perimeter basically is to the southeast of where we are at the prison. It's now an eight-by-10 square-mile radius. There are a couple of reasons they believe that. First is because police said there was a potential sighting earlier today just east of Longwood Gardens in this perimeter. And Jake, you know, Longwood Gardens well. It's a large botanical garden area, a popular tourist destination, sprawling, a lot of wooded areas, meadows, also creeks. Right next to there, that's where we actually happened to see helicopters flying low after this reported sighting. Someone came up to police and told them they saw someone running through some of the wooded areas over there. But that is still not a confirmed sighting at this time. Law enforcement, of course, did not capture anyone. But the main reason police actually still believe that he's inside the perimeter now, Jake, is because they say they have no reports of him popping up outside of that perimeter. I want you to listen to what Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens, though, had to say during this press conference about the challenges when it comes to the question of why aren't police basically going shoulder to shoulder marching through some of these areas. It's not that simple. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:  Not just a perfect open piece of land that you can march through. You've got businesses, residences, highways, hills, valleys, wooded areas that can't be pushed through. The number of people that it would take to contain that area and be able to walk shoulder to shoulder through that area and squeeze and the amount of time that it would take, it's just simply not realistic to do that.

Police say because the tower guard was able to see him escaping at that time. This is the escape back in May.

Michael, let me start with you. Police in Pennsylvania say there have been about eight sightings of Cavalcante, they've shifted their search perimeter. It's now eight to ten square miles.

So there's a bit of an advantage there. What they need do now is be secure in the fact that they have him within the perimeter based on credible sightings. There's been a lot more reporting of sightings than these eight or ten. They have to tightening that perimeter and putting the pressure on, meaning, keep the action up. When he hears the helicopters above, he hears dogs barking, we want to deprive him of sleep, of food, of water, of any kind of comfort, and wear him down to the point where he wants to give up. We have to keep the pressure on, and we also want to do it quickly hoping he doesn't get any more resources such as money or most likely we don't want him to have a weapon.",

Sentencing will be in January. I'm wondering what your reaction is. ADAM KINZINGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR (via telephone): Well, Jake, it's great. I mean, you know, it's -- it's sad that we have to get to this. I mean, the role of the people's house is to do things like investigations, and especially on something as importance as January 6th, as serious as January 6th. And we have people -- we had many people, he's obviously one of them, that simply refuse today to acknowledge that, that simply tried to hide. You know, we weren't asking them to come in and embarrass themselves or whatever. We were just asking for information, asked what they knew, and they decided to turn against Congress. I have no sympathy for Mr. Navarro right now. We tried over and over to sets up different times, different meetings, different opportunities, and he refused. And so this is justice. We'll see what he ends up getting, but I think certainly it's vindicating for the committee.",

Clearly, those examples have not made their way into the consciousness of the American public. Fifty-eight percent say that his policies have worsened the conditions. When you go a little bit farther, stamina, that is one of the central questions here. Does the president have the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president? Seventy-four percent of Americans say no. Only 26 percent say yes. Go into that a little bit more. You compare this -- Democrats and independents and Republicans, now versus March, these numbers have fallen throughout the spring and summer months. Sixty-two percent in March, now only 50 percent of Democrats. Of course, independents, a central number here, Republicans, of course, would be lower than that.
