We've got economic data that's come through, corporate earnings dominating investor sentiment. Of course, a lot of worries in the banking sector still coming to the fore. Well, those are the markets and these are the main events: The Fed finds fault in its own oversight of Silicon Valley Bank. Amazon rattles investors with a warning about its cloud business. And the BBC Chairman resigns after report says he breached impartiality rules. Live from Abu Dhabi, it is Friday, April 28th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very good evening. Great of you to join us. And tonight US regulators are blaming mismanagement and their own weak supervision for the recent collapse of two banks. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC really separate reports on the failure of Silicon Valley and Signature Banks. The crisis rattled confidence in many regional and midsize lenders and raised questions about the adequacy of US deposit insurance. Now, the Fed reports and lists four main reasons for the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Let's go through them. First, it says bank managers did not effectively mitigate risks. Second, it points the finger at itself saying Fed regulators did not fully understand the extent of the bank's problems, and once they did, supervisors did not do enough to make sure the bank fix them. And finally, the Fed blames Congress. It says loosening bank regulations in 2018 in the way of strong supervision. So these are the reasons that the report states and this is going to be quite important in terms of ascertaining what this is going to do to the rest of the banking sector, what rules and regulations we see being activated in place. And Rahel Solomon is with me, perhaps you can give us a little bit of insight. I think what is quite important here and I think we've spoken about this before, the loosening of the regulations playing a big role here, but it was a confluence of reasons, and one of those was the Fed not doing enough when it saw that problems were looming.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. So that's certainly a part of this equation, right, Eleni, the Fed not acting quickly enough,but the other part is the first line of this report, a textbook case of mismanagement. This is the letter that accompanied the 118-page report. So, it was a very thorough report, and the conclusion was pretty scathing. So the report saying from Michael Barr, the Federal Vice Chair of Supervision saying that, look, federal regulations were too low, federal standards, federal regulatory standards were too low and federal supervisors were too slow to react to some of the problems. And Eleni, as you pointed out. We have known this for quite some time. I mean, Federal Reserve Vice Chair of Supervision Barr has said in testimony on Capitol Hill that Federal Reserve supervisors had been raising the alarm, or were at least aware of some of these problems at SVB from as far back as I want to, say November of 2021. So the question was, why didn't they do more? Why did we still see SVB fall the way it did? And the report saying, look, the firm grew too rapidly, but it was a slow transition to heightened standards of scrutiny. So, they are clearly going to be looking at that correlation moving forward. Moving forward, they also say they're going to be paying closer attention to certain risk factors that SVB exhibited in terms of growing too rapidly, growing very quickly, a concentrated depositor base and also new industries like FinTech and crypto. In terms of what regulation or sort of how this process could look in the future, one expert told me this comment coming from Derek Tang, he is the CEO and co-founder of Monetary Policy Analytics, and I think we can pull this quote up for you, Eleni. But what he told me is that, \"I think they're going to be looking a bit more holistic as to looking at broadening the scope of what they look at from financial measures, such as cash levels and the composition of their deposits to more qualitative metrics about the character of the bank. So there certainly is going to be a look in terms of regulation, but also looking at more qualitative metrics in terms of determining the real risk of some of these banks -- Eleni.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I mean, to your point, so that number currently is closer to about $250 billion in assets with which SVB had fallen just shyof, and what it had been prior to the loosening of regulation was closer to $100 billion. So yes, there was some acknowledgment that they clearly need to revisit some of the thresholds. Now, some of this will not be within completely their control, obviously, right, but there are things that the Federal Reserve can do currently in terms of increasing scrutiny, in terms of sort of jiggering some of the metrics that they look at in terms of qualifying some of these banks. So there are certain things that the Fed can do right now, and there are certain things that will take regulators and will take lawmakers rather to change. But yes, there is a big question about that $250 billion threshold, which is what's considered a systemically important bank. And I think the question that clearly becomes a concern in this report is that the fall of SVB, the demise of SVB, was considered to create a systemic risk. There was the potential of creating a systemic risk. Well, how can that be true, but it also not be considered a systemically important bank? And that sort of -- that difference there is what's coming under scrutiny now because both things can't necessarily be true.",

He is now a professor of International Economics at Harvard University. Sir, really great to have you on.

And so if they don't guarantee it, there are a lot of banks, which would have problems quickly, but if they do guarantee it, you have to put some parameters on it. There are a lot of losses in the banking system still.

The problem when they put the bank into receivership, as opposed to getting another bank to buyit as an ongoing concern, may be greased by some government money. When it goes into receivership, it really falls apart. The depositors leave, the people who are depending on loans get orphaned. And so, there is sort of a balance to strike. I would also just like to say one thing about Silicon Valley Bank, if I may. It was lending to the startups. It was the most important lender to the tech sector, to the most successful sector in the world. It is the pride and joy of the US economy that produced trillions of dollars in returns. And so there is a balance regulators have to think about between putting the financial system into a coma with its regulation, and at the same time, not you know, being too generous with taxpayer money.

Given time, they can earn it back because they pay a much lower interest rate to depositors than they get, but there will probably be more trouble to come. Financial crises go in waves.

There are concerns about a recession, but what happened, in fact, was that consumers seem to be spending, you know, steadily. The net product sales for Amazon were up this quarter. Its revenue was up nine percent, which beat expectations, but what seems to be happening is that actually, business customers are pulling back their spending and that is sort of a broader theme that's happening across the economy, but that is what's weighing on the cloud growth, both in the current quarter and Amazon expects in the coming quarter, and so that's a real concern. You know, the cloud is Amazon's major profit driver, and so if businesses are pulling back spending there, that's a big issue. But overall, it was an okay quarter.
