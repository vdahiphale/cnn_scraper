I am Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi.This hour the United Nations General Assembly is holding a vote on a resolution to upgrade Palestine to the status of a full member of the U.N. It is widely seen as symbolic, but could have an impact on the post-war reconstruction of Gaza. And Israel's prime minister says the country will fight with its fingernails if it has to after U.S. President Biden threatened to hold back some weapons shipments. Plus Donald Trump now back in court after Stormy Daniels' explosive testimony this week. Well, we want to begin this second hour of CONNECT THE WORLD with a CNN exclusive. Stark accusations. The Palestinian detainees have been abused by Israeli troops and these are claims coming from inside Israel's military. The accusations surround a shadowy detention facility in the Negev Desert. Three Israeli whistleblowers who have worked at the prison are describing a systemic pattern of abuse that includes sensory deprivation, beatings, and torture. They tell CNN they are speaking out now as a matter of conscience. CNN chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance has our exclusive report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It's a place the Israeli military doesn't want us to see. How many Palestinians are there in there right now?",

And remember, just back in April, the United States vetoed the U.N. Security Council vote. The U.K. and Switzerland abstained. Twelve others voted for it. And the expectation here is that the general assembly where there are no vetoes that there will be overwhelming or high support, at least for this motion to move. Now, the United States deputy ambassador yesterday said that what was happening here is an effort to circumvent the normal procedures, but should this motion pass, what would be expected to happen? Palestinian representatives would have the right to propose topics for discussion at the U.N. General Assembly, to answer back in debate, to engage in conversations on topics that don't just involve the Palestinian issue and the Middle East.

Our next stop, we're expecting to hear from the Israeli representative at the General Assembly there who will I'm sure reinform us of Prime Minister Netanyahu's view is that he does not want to recognize Palestine as a state. So we'll likely hear a lot of that. We'll also hear from U.S. representatives. Look, it's a long list from the UAE through to 109 on that list. I think it's Cyprus number 100 as the U.K., whether or not they'll all speak the question is how will the vote go at the end of it? And that's going to be the telling point. And I think there's a couple of things to consider here. You know, they're talking about the draft, this resolution. It's already had a revision. We know back at the U.N. Security Council resolution vote back in April, where the U.S. vetoed, both China and Russia wanted Palestine to be recognized as a state. But now when they look at the terms of what this draft is about right now, Russia has concerns about giving too much influence to essentially powers at the U.N. to Palestine because of Kosovo. China equally has its concerns about Taiwan. So the language has already been sort of watered down to what Palestine short of a U.N. Security Council vote can get.
