I speak to Prime Minister Netanyahu's Senior adviser Mark Regev. Then, a rare glimpse into Gaza under siege. We bring you a firsthand report from there, and talk to a British Palestinian surgeon who rushed to help. Also, ahead, renowned author Yuval Noah Harari helps us digest the worst week in modern Israeli history. Plus, Hari Sreenivasan talks to former USAID chief Rajiv Shah about how big conflicts can sometimes lead to big change. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Cheers, tears, and hugs for Tony Blinken, America's top diplomat in Israel today.

This is not another round of Israel Hamas fighting in Gaza. This is war. What they did on Saturday morning when they attacked across a long front in scope and in scale and in sheer brutality of their behavior, which both the prime minister today and the visiting secretary of state described as ISIS-like, that was an escalation of massive proportions.

There is agreat deal of anger, despite this slaughter that civilians have gone through and that the country is in shock about, there is a huge amount of anger directed at what they believe was eyes off the ball, incompetence in government. And I'm just going to read you a couple of polls from the Dialogue Institute. 84 percent of the public believes that the infiltration of Hamas terrorists into the southern settlements were due to negligence of your country's leadership. 94 percent believe that the government is responsible for the situation that led to the collapse of the entire system of protecting the settlements in the south. And 56 percent believe Netanyahu should resign when this fighting is over. And today, we saw images on television of a minister being literally heckled and being told by people in a hospital that it's your fault, you've ruined the country, you're responsible. So, my question to you frankly is, how should your people have confidence that this government, which claims to have been taken by surprise, can actually redeem its people and get the hostages back and do what you say you want to do in Gaza?",

And we're now uniting to win this war, and though Israel has suffered from a very divisive and polarized politics over the last few months, you see us coming together because of the crisis. And as you saw last night, the formation of this national unity government with parties that used to be in the opposition so as to show a united front, and this is an expression of what the Israeli public wants. And once this is over, once we have won, you know Israeli history, we've had inquiries after wars, we know how to investigate ourselves. We will look into what went wrong, what was right.

If they perceive weakness, if they believe that you can hit Israel with impunity, we'll just be hit again, and again, and again.

Also, all of the hospitals now are completely dependent on generators for electricity. And diesel is one of those things that are now not coming in as a result of this total blockade. You see these water tanks that are being delivered to homes and to hospitals all around the clock, even though there is continuous bombing. Food at the moment is not short, but there are over 250,000 people displaced. A lot of them, thousands, living in the compound of Al-Shifa Hospital, the -- Gaza's main hospital or with relative. And so, these people who have lost their homes have lost their ability to fend for themselves and feed themselves.

We've seen this in Syria and Aleppo. We've seen this in so many different settings. And the truth is, there are tactics and approaches one can take to get protect humanitarian priorities even during conflict, and they can be baked into defense strategies and most importantly, baked into diplomatic strategies. You know, Israel has rightly suggested for the purpose of saving civilian lives that people in Gaza evacuate. Now, evacuation, obviously, in that region is very, very, very difficult. There's -- you know, it requires active collaboration with other likeminded nations to take people in. And you could imagine all kinds of different efforts that are already being discussed to help people and civilians in particular not be present when there are impending and significant violent attacks that are coming and already present. So, those are the types of things that we've seen work in some other settings. Because it -- I just keep coming back to this basic point, it is in our national security interest and Israel's national security interest to be on the right side. And right now, Israel is 100 percent on the right side morally and from a defense perspective to protect itself and to protect its people and to respond to a horrific, condoned terrorist attack. If you're trying to help Israel, you want Israel to maintain that position in the region in the world for many, many weeks, months and years to come.",

SHAH:  Well, this is where America has to help the neighbors. You know, during the crisis in Syria, we provided debt relief and access to capital markets for Jordan. We put resources into Jordan to build out Zaatari, a large-scale refugee camp. We even built out water infrastructure to support the provision of public services to both refugees and Jordanians. I think you need a full engaged dialogue, taking into account all three D's, defense, diplomacy and development, to help neighboring countries have the resources, have the support, have the external financing quickly to be able to take in as many people as they can and protect civilian lives.

And how do you get leaders to sit down at a table and start thinking about a blank page when usually there's so much subtext, there's so much in the background, there's so much sort of sometimes history, sometimes painful history that people want to bring up, and that can be between, you know, adversaries on a battlefield or a boardroom or anywhere else? DR. SHAH:  Well, you know, I write about it in the book in the context of the very early days of, of Bill and Melinda Gates's extraordinary philanthropic efforts and they wanted to immunize every child on the planet because they had read an article about 600,000 kids dying of a disease that was killing kids in poor countries, this was rotavirus, but vaccines were available only in rich countries where kids weren't dying. And they just said, that's wrong. Why? And by asking simple questions and starting with a blank page, you have the ability to reimagine what the future could look like. And the book, \"Big Bets,\" is really about reimagining those futures, sitting down with the right people and saying, look, I -- right now, I would start sort of second and third track planning efforts with the partners that will be involved in the post conflict environment to create more stability and more peace and more growth and infrastructure and development opportunities. You know, the United States already provides significant infrastructure support for the West Bank, for example, via Israel via, you know, Israeli financial institutions, and with the explicit support of the Israeli government, because they know that human opportunity and human dignity is ultimately the baseline for stability and peace. And right now, we're in a global food crisis where food prices have been elevated because of the Ukraine war, but they're also elevated because climate change is causing a 30 percent reduction in food production in many agrarian economies around the world, and we're systematically seeing hunger go up by tens or hundreds of millions of people over the next several years, and we know that's going to lead to conflict and instability as it did after the crisis of food, fuel and financial crisis of 2008. I write in the book about a big global effort President Obama made to have a big bet to address that food security crisis and succeeded by moving almost 100 million people out of hunger and poverty over a decade. Those big efforts can be successful. It's just too often because of what you mentioned, we just don't aspire to do the right thing with the right level of resources and the right level of commitment.",

How do you evenfigure out, kind of, what that simple question should be how you attack such a massive problem with so many different causes, so many different effects? Lead me through, like, you're thinking about it. DR. SHAH:  Sure. Well, we've had for 110 years a mission of lifting up humanity and in particular, vulnerable communities using science and innovation. That's the founding principle of The Rockefeller Foundation. And when we look at climate change, we see we're blown past all the ecosystem tipping points, whether it's ice melt or El Nino effects or heat in particular. And we are doing that in a way that is nowhere near the trajectory of the Paris Agreement of 1.5 degrees centigrade, which came to represent a target the whole world could adopt and abide by and live with. And so, we said, well, what's the most effective thing we can do? And as we did analysis, we found that by 2050, 80 -- 81 countries around the world that are today relatively lower income will account for nearly all 75 plus percent of carbon emissions. And even as we're taking down coal and moving to renewable energy in the United States and Europe and China, in developing nations around the world, we're actually building more coal every year, more heavy fuel oil every year, more diesel generation every year. And it's both a huge constraint to growth and economic job creation. And it's going to be the one thing kills our chance of achieving anything close to 1.5 or 2 degrees warming on a global basis. So, we got a bunch of companies together. We got scientists together. We invented some new technologies that can provide distributed renewable electrification of very poor communities and built an alliance of unlikely partners, raised about $11.5 dollars. Today, we're active in in about 22 countries, reaching millions of people with renewable energy that would otherwise not have had access to power outside of some diesel generators, and it's changing their lives for the better. And it's offsetting and displacing coal, heavy fuel oil and diesel and hopefully, protecting our planet for the future. Our big bet is we can accelerate the momentum and actually bring a billion people power and energy that don't have access to electricity at all today. And in the future, they will through new renewable technology.",
