Carlee Russell apologized in court yesterday saying that she had made a grave mistake after mysteriously disappearing last July.Police spent two days searching for her until she showed back up at home and said that she had been abducted. She later admitted the kidnapping was a hoax. And then she said this in court. \"I made a grave mistake while trying to fight through various emotional issues.\" The FBI has a message for passengers who were on that terrifying Alaska Airlines flight where the door plug flew off mid-flight -- they all might be victims of a crime. The FBI out of Seattle sent a letter to people who were on that plane noting that the FBI is currently investigating the incident. CNN has previously reported the Justice Department was looking into this and also looking into Boeing after the incident. Boeing has declined to comment. Now, only one day into March Madness and there is a good chance your bracket has been busted. Said another way, one day in and we already have Cinderella stories.

This Truth Social sell likely to go through. If you are ranking Trump's options to come up with the money that he needs by Monday, how does this rank? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, FORMER FEDERAL AND NEW JERSEY STATE PROSECUTOR:  It's a B-minus for Trump because it looks good on paper. As Matt said, by the end of the day, Donald Trump could be worth several billion dollars more. But the problem is all about timing here, Kate because in all likelihood, Donald Trump's shares are going to be locked up for six months -- meaning he can't sell them off until six months from now. Now, there is a possibility he could go to the shareholders and ask for a waiver -- ask for special permission to sell off some of them early. So that may give him a way around this. So he's going to be much richer, likely, by the end of the day on paper, but the question is when can he turn that into cash?",

Through who knows what means? And the other thing we need to watch for is the appellate division. Remember, Donald Trump went to that court of appeals earlier this week and asked them to either delay or reduce the amount of the bond. Now, appeals courts do that sometimes. They have the power to do that. It's hard to know how often they do it. There's no real data available. But there are certainly examples of appeals courts coming in and reducing bonds by 50, 60, 80 percent. So we've not heard yet from the appeals court and we could hear from them at any moment today.",

The bond does not impact his appeal rights. He has the right to appeal the case itself and he will appeal it. Here is the difference. If he posts a bond, the attorney general cannot start collecting the judgment until the appeal is over. We're talking months or years from now. If he does not post a bond, however, the attorney general can start collecting on Monday. So we may have, simultaneously, Donald Trump appealing and the attorney general starting to collect on the amount of the judgment. So that's the difference.

That is just not a realistic ask. I think it's posturing by the D.A. I think she wants to put out this perception of I'm ready to go.

Sometimes you'll have a potential juror who will say yes, I can be fair and impartial, but you don't believe them either way. And there's no science to that. It's really an art. You have limited information about the potential jurors and sometimes you just have to rely on your gut instinct and say I like this juror or I don't for our side.

And he was expected to continue these tough conversations with the Israeli government. Among the things we expected him to raise is the need for more aid to get into the Strip even without a ceasefire. He said yesterday that Israel needs to do more. That there have been some improvements in the aid getting in but it is not enough. And he stressed that 100 percent of the population in Gaza is experiencing acute food insecurity. At the same time, he was also expected to bring up this prospect of an invasion into Rafah by the Israeli military. This is something the U.S. does not approve of. Blinken said that they would not support it. And he had some really tough words in a press conference yesterday about this potential military offensive into Rafah. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  On Rafah, again, we've been very clear. President Biden has been very clear that a major ground operation in Rafah would be a mistake and something that we can't support.

And also, one of the things that we've been seeing over the past couple of days is that the Russians appear to have stepped up their attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. There was a big attack that took place yesterday on the Ukrainian capital -- on Kyiv. The Ukrainians there saying they managed to shoot down 31 Russian missiles, but this attack that we saw in the early morning hours of today was a whole lot larger. The Ukrainians are saying that the Russians fired 151 missiles and drones towards many Ukrainian cities and other suburban areas as well. The Ukrainians say they managed to take down 92 of these missiles and drones but, obviously, some of them very much got through. We just saw that video there that apparently was the Russians striking a major hydroelectric power plant in Ukraine, and that's something that the residents on the ground had to deal with. So far, we have confirmed that several people have been killed on the ground. Obviously, scores of people have been injured as well. But the big thing is that about a million people in Ukraine are without power. Also, in some of these areas that are close to the border with Russia, there's a lot of people who are even without water as well. And you can see on the map that we have up right now just some of the places in Ukraine that have been hit. And you can see that this was a sustained missile barrage by the Russians that happened over large parts of Ukraine and caused a lot of damage there. One of the new things that I actually have for you just in the last couple of minutes is the Russians have come out -- the Defense Ministry -- and said that, yes, they were behind these attacks that took place. They claim that they hit an energy infrastructure, which is what the Ukrainians are saying as well. They also say that they hit military targets. Obviously, the Ukrainians not commenting on that.
