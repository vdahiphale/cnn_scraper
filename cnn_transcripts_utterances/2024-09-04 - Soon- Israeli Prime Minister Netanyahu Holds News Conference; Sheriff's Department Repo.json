But the prime minister still has strengthened his cabinet, is only the defense minister who voted against the decision in cabinet last week about keeping troops in the Philadelphi Corridor. So the vast majority of the prime minister's cabinet are still behind him, which gives him sort of this political strength, but where he seems to be losing the negotiating strength and potentially the military impact in Gaza as well. Or certainly there will be big consequences if he ignores, it appears what Hamas is threatening, threatening in detail that if the IDF tries to rescue more hostages, then those hostages will come home in coffins, they're threatening to execute them if the IDF gets close to rescuing them. The prime minister has already said it's a military solution here to pressure Hamas. Hamas is holding out and they are now threatening that the likelihood of more hostage rescues, which is always to the prime minister's benefit because that fits his narrative.

In 2016, the U.S. officials were really caught off guard. They were slow to react. There was quite a bit of criticism from various corners of the country about the tepidness with which they reacted. Now they're trying to come out on camera and say, we've seen this before and we're warning you, both Russia and the American people, to look out for this stuff ahead of time. So that's the big thing that's changed. There's also been changes, important changes, to the way that we elections are run. There's been more paper backup ballots in terms of auditable records that Americans can be sure that their vote is being correctly counted and that sort of thing. So there's been a lot of progress. At the same time, the domestic disinformation environment has grown.
