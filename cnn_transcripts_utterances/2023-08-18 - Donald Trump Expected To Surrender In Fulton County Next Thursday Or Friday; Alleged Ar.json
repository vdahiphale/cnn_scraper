      "sentences": "Tonight on 360.First, a canceled press conference, now apparently a debate no show. What's behind the former president sudden attack of reticence? That and news on when he'll surrender in Georgia. Also tonight, a CNN exclusive. Meet the Trump adviser who took the fifth when asked what he was doing January 6th. Well tonight, we know what he was doing and with whom. And later, what Hurricane Hilary could have in store for Southern California, which is bracing for its first storm this magnitude since 1939. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. The former president is expected to turn himself in at the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta next Thursday or Friday. That, according to a senior law enforcement official with knowledge of the surrender. Friday is the deadline for all 19 defendants. Trump, his former chief- of-staff, several of his lawyers, a top Justice Department official and others all being booked, fingerprinted, and with probably the exception of the president, former president, photographed. In the last two days, the former president has backed out of opportunities to be seen by millions of television viewers. Yesterday, he canceled that press conference he had announced for Monday to repeat lies about election fraud in Georgia, what he calls irrefutable evidence of fraud. Today, we learned, he is planning, as of now, to skip next week's Republican debate on Fox in favor of a sit down with Tucker Carlson. We will talk to lawyers about the extent to which criminal defense considerations play into his decision. We start with CNN chief correspondent, Kaitlan Collins with new reporting on the politics first and foremost driving it, she joins us along with conservative lawyer and \"Washington Post\" contributing columnist, George Conway; and CNN contributor, John Dean who served as White House counsel in the Nixon administration. So what is -- do we know the reasons he's backed out?",

And so they didn't expect him to show up. It would have been a big difference if he had decided to go. Obviously, Monday with the news conference, that's a legal decision, really. I don't think that's as much as what Wednesday is. I think Wednesday is a political decision not to show up to that debate, because he does feel like he doesn't really need to go and show up. I mean, certainly everyone has tried to goad him into being there is saying that it's weak if he doesn't show up. It's disrespectful to Republican voters if he doesn't show up. None of that really has registered with him, though in a way that he cares about. But it's surprising given, I mean, they went to great lengths to try to get him to come to this.

But obviously, this is the most high profile prosecution in the country right now and the idea that it's going to be anything standard is obviously not likely to happen when he does show up. We're expecting Thursday or Friday right now. We'll see if that changes. That's the expectation at the moment. The question is, does he go in and get the exact process that any other defendant would get? We don't know about a mug shot yet. We do believe he'll be fingerprinted. We don't believe he'll be handcuffed. But they do medical screenings. They have all of these other steps that he has to go through and what -- we were reporting this out, I was thinking about how my reporting when he was in Washington being indicted there, he was so -- he'd grown irritated, essentially. It just the process of going through the standard procedure, having to wait, having to be fingerprinted, sitting in the courtroom for 20 minutes waiting on the judge to show up and it's just completely silent in the room.

That's how he views this. I mean, he thinks that they are in the pocket of Ron DeSantis. That is his view. So I think it has multiple avenues that he wants to go down by, by sitting down with a host that they fired, having this moment. And I just think he also understands that there is a potential at that debate for someone like Chris Christie, he knows they will only be attacking him. They're going to go after him on these issues. And so in his mind, he just avoids all of that by not showing up.

The story however, is not about where he'll be next week, it is what CNN's Shimon Prokupecz and the KFILE investigative team discovered about where he was on January 6, 2021, something he himself refused to say when asked under oath.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): He is one of the alleged co-conspirators in two cases against Donald Trump for 2020 election interference. Now for the first time, CNN has identified Kenneth Chesebro outside the Capitol on January 6th, shortly before a mob stormed the east side of the building. He followed right-wing conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones for about an hour. Chesebro is the alleged architect of a plot to use fake electors to stop the certification of Joe Biden's win. This week, he was indicted along with Trump and 17 others in Georgia. He has also been identified as an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal case against the former president. WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST, \"THE SITUATION ROOM\":          CNN projects Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is elected the 46th President of the United States. PROKUPECZ (voice over): In the days after the November 2020 election, Chesebro wrote a memo to a lawyer for Donald Trump. It is among the earliest known documents outlining the legal strategy Trump would allegedly try to use. His memo focuses on January 6 as the hard deadline with ultimate significance to determine the validity of electoral votes. E-mails obtained by the January 6 Committee showed Chesebro later suggesting to the Trump campaign that that fear of \"wild chaos\" on that day could provoke the Supreme Court to take action.",

Bush and John McCain presidential campaigns is now a columnist for \"Vanity Fair\" joins us tonight. So you think it's wise for Trump to skip the debate, Mark? MARK MCKINNON, TOP ADVISER TO BOTH GEORGE W. BUSH AND JOHN MCCAIN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS: I don't. You know any candidate that I've ever worked for over the course of the years, Anderson, either was anxious for a debate or wanting to avoid debate, but whenever they wanted to avoid a debate, it is because they were worried that they weren't going to do well. And voters -- it is an expectation that voters have, but that's just the price of admission for running for president. If you want to be president, you've got to get on the stage even if you're a former president, maybe especially if you're a former president under indictment, but I think Trump will regret this decision because it's the hottest spotlight. It'll be the hottest spotlight in the world next week. All the attention will be there. And I think he'll watch it. He'll think I could have cleaned their clocks and they probably would have had he showed up on the stage. But it's going to be exciting to watch Chris Christie. I mean, he is a human wrecking ball and if Trump is not there, I do expect him to go after the next biggest kingpin on stage, which is probably Ron DeSantis. And it was interesting, he talked about the power of authenticity, or your reporter did. And I think that's really important commodity in politics these days. It's very powerful when you can do anything that comes across as authentic. And the problem for Ron DeSantis is he now has that memo out there where -- so that now anything that he does that reflects anything that was in that memo is going to look like it was scripted. And believe me, Chris Christie will point that out, just as he did against Marco Rubio in the famous debate where he put him in a microwave and melted him.",

He did a great job.But because of all the legal problems and everything else hanging over him, he's not the best general election candidate to go up against the Democrat next year. And increasingly, I think we'll see that between now and Iowa, that he's going to get underwater and that he's increasingly going to be seen as somebody who's going to lose a general election.

And increasingly, as the fourth indictment has come down, it's looking that there are problems, there are problematic signs in Iowa. And listen, if Iowa goes south on Trump, then it's the man who would be king. They see the blood, they see he's mortal, and then you could see his support evaporate pretty quickly.",
