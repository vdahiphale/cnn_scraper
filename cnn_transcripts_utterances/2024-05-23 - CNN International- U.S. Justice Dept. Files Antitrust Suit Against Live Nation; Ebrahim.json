We will take you live to Washington, D.C. That's what we have learned the U.S. Department of Justice, as you're seeing here, has filed a groundbreaking monopoly lawsuit against ticketing and entertainment giant Live Nation. We're expected to hear from the U.S. Attorney General any moment now. Once we do, we will bring it to you. Plus, President Biden and Kenya's President William Ruto will soon hold a bilateral meeting at the White House. Why China's influence looms large over this visit? And later, we'll take you to Louisville, Kentucky, where police there are expected to release their findings after an internal investigation into last week's arrest of golfer Scottie Scheffler. But, let's get back to this news out of Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. It's a move that could have huge implications for millions of concert goers in the U.S. who have claimed that they have faced soaring ticket prices and headaches trying to get seats to see concerts which reached a breaking point with the Taylor Swift fiasco. Remember this? (VIDEO PLAYING) Well, thousands of fans were not ready for it. They were left out in the cold ahead of her historic \"Eras Tour\". What now? The U.S. Department of Justice is suing the entertainment giant that critics say controls ticket prices in the U.S. The DoJ and several states have just filed that lawsuit against Live Nation, this is the company that owns Ticketmaster, and they accuse it of being a monopoly. They say that its exclusive contracts with concert venues, well, they say that that has led to high ticket prices and exorbitant fees. Ticketmaster, meantime, has long denied these claims, and they say that ticket prices are actually set by the artists. Let's bring in CNN Technology Reporter Brian Fung, who joins us with more on this. Brian, this is obviously a story that you and I have been talking about for quite some time now. We now have a sense of these allegations. What could the impact of this suit be for consumers?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Rahel. This is a monumental case. It could change everything about how concert ticketing works in the U.S., and officials say a breakup of Live Nation is absolutely on the table. According to the Justice Department and 30 attorneys general, Live Nation has a monopoly in live events ticketing, and enjoys huge leverage over artists, fans and competitors, because it owns big chunks of every industry needed to put on a successful tour. So, that stack includes not just the sale of concert tickets through Ticketmaster, but also the concert promoters who work with artists on shows and even many of the most popular venues where they play.So, DoJ says Live Nation has weaponized that integration using things like threats and retaliation to make sure venues and rivals stay in line, and that means the ability to charge fans higher fees and impose restrictions on what they can do with their tickets. Now, this suit has been a long time coming. For most people, this became a high- profile issue after that Taylor Swift debacle you mentioned when millions of fans were locked out of buying tickets for her Eras Tour. But, lots of other antitrust critics say the problem dates back to Live Nation's merger with Ticketmaster in the first place in 2010. Now, the DoJ is looking to fix that situation and they're asking for a jury trial which, given how much of a headache Ticketmaster has been for consumers, might help them win the case in the long run.

I want to read you a little bit of a statement that they just put out moments ago. They're saying, quote, \"The DoJ's lawsuit won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows. Calling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DoJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment. We will defend against these baseless allegations, use this opportunity to shed light on the industry, and continue to push for reforms that truly protect consumers and artists.\"Now, Rahel, obviously, this is setting up a major court battle, a showdown that could potentially take years to play out. But, if the DoJ gets its way, it could potentially lead to lower prices for consumers or more ticketing options for fans.",

And we've seen a lot of pushback from consumer advocacy groups about this, this tie-up that they say has harmed consumers and harmed competition.

One thing that Brian said that caught my eye and the Ticketmaster response is that the government will lose in court, which makes me wonder, how high is the burden, Norm, to try to break up a company like this? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, &amp; FMR. HOUSE JUDICIARY SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP'S FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: It's a substantial burden and the government is going to be put to its proof.

So, they will be presented with the evidence and they will -- if it reaches the jury, they will rule.But, Rahel, as I was about to say, given the nature of the allegations and the evidence we've just heard about from the AG, I think Live Nation is making a mistake with that defiant tone, because this is a rare issue where you have not only the Biden Department of Justice, but you have over two dozen Republican and Democratic attorneys general from across the country saying that the vertical monopoly here, the fact that Live Nation has rolled up all these companies, is hurting consumers, artists, promoters, venue owners, and there is a massive amount of evidence. So, my first judgment is that Live Nation, despite that steep hurdle in court, is at substantial risk. They've managed to do the impossible, unify everyone against them.",

So, for example, if venues are free to contract with other ticket providers, not just with Ticketmaster, we'll see ticket prices come down for consumers. We will see better customer service, unlike that Taylor Swift fiasco, that was so crushing for so many Americans. So, prices will come down. Consumer service will go up. That is how competition is supposed to work. Artists will have more choices. Venues will have a freer hand in booking.

Here you can see the massive crowd of mourners and circling Ebrahim Raisi's coffin in northeastern Iran. The late leader's remains have been taken into the shrine of Imam Reza. This is considered the holiest Islamic site in the country. Raisi was killed after his helicopter crashed near the Azerbaijan border on Sunday.

He was always affiliated with this city. He was always affiliated with that shrine. In fact, his father-in-law is still the prayer leader at the Imam Reza shrine. So, the folks here in this town of Mashhad, many of them aresupporters of Ebrahim Raisi, and many of them told us that while they're in great sorrow at this point in time, they also say they will remain loyal to his ideals, which, of course, were very tough on the United States. You can hear them screaming now \"Death to America\" here in the streets of Mashhad as the casket is being wheeled through those streets. So, they hope that this conservative ideals of Ebrahim Raisi will remain in place.

      "sentences": "Well, I think these two leaders really do want to mark what is a historic relationship. It has been 60 years since the U.S. and Kenya established diplomatic ties, and they are in the Oval Office now. And I just got a little bit of a readout what they said, and what President Biden wanted to emphasize is that this meeting, the state visit, is not just about that history, but it's also about looking forward, developing new ways and deeper ways to establish these ties.And of course, as you mentioned, the backdrop to all of this is the strategic relationship that Kenya also holds with China. Of course, Beijing has spent a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, investing in infrastructure projects, not just in Kenya, but across Africa, that has also left countries like Kenya saddled with debt, and that's something that Ruto, President Ruto does want to discuss with President Biden. And I think from the American perspective, they do want to position the United States as a better, more reliable partner than China when it comes to investments. But, at the end of the day, the U.S. is lagging behind China on that. And part of what this visit is intended to do is to demonstrate American commitment to those projects and to the African continent more generally. But, I think for President Biden, of course, a number of foreign conflicts have proven a distraction to this goal, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Ukraine. And remember, Rahel, President Biden at the end of 2022 promised he would visit Africa within the next year. That visit never materialized. And part of what this state visit in Washington is intended to do is to demonstrate that he remains very much committed to Kenya and to the broader continent.",

And I think part of what the President is trying to do is also expressed gratitude to Kenya for this security mission that it's sending to Haiti. That is part of what this specific visit was timed to demonstrate. That mission is largely funded by the United States. 1,000 police forces from Kenya going to Haiti to try and restore order on that Caribbean nation.And President Biden, part of what he is doing today is trying to express gratitude from the United States for that, of course, the Haiti situation is in the United States' backyard. But, Kenya has really stepped up to provide its own police forces to help quell the gang violence that has been sort of racking that island for the last several months. And so, that's part of why this visit is timed to right now. The other reason, I think, is this a matter of China. The U.S. is trying to bolster its own infrastructure projects. And it was interesting to hear from the Ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman, she told us earlier today that the U.S. will announce a new road from Mombasa to Nairobi. That's a route that China has also built a strategic rail line. So, you can see the U.S. and China literally in parallel, trying to develop their own infrastructure projects in Kenya as part of a way to gain leverage and gain influence on a very important continent.",

President Macron says that security forces will stay in the French territory for quote, \"as long as necessary\". The comments came during the visit to the Pacific territory where he toured areas hit by deadly riots. The violence was sparked after the French National Assembly voted to change New Caledonia's Constitution, expanding voting rights for some French residents there. Meantime, in Ukraine, officials there say that Russian airstrikes in the northeastern Kharkiv region have killed at least seven people. 23 others were wounded by the strikes which hit several locations. Russia's attacks have intensified as its troops advanced towards the city, which was liberated from Russian control earlier in the war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that Russia is taking advantage of Ukraine's lack of air defense support. And China has launched military drills around Taiwan as punishment for what it called separatist acts. Dozens of fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes alongside its warships. Now, this comes just days after Taiwan sworn in a new democratically elected leader. He called on China to stop intimidating Taiwan. Beijing claims the island as its own. Well, officials in Louisville, Kentucky, are giving an update really any moment now, we expect, on last week's arrest of PGA star Scottie Scheffler. The Louisville mayor and police chief are releasing their findings of an internal investigation. They are also expected to release video of Scheffler's arrest. The world number one -- the world's number one golfer was taken into custody at the Valhalla Golf Club and charged with felony, second-degree assault on an officer. He was also charged with third-degree criminal mischief and reckless driving. Now, Scheffler says that it was all a misunderstanding. Let's bring in Carolyn Manno.

And now, ahead of this news conference, which was expected to start right now, around 11:30, high-ranking police officials in Louisville have privately said that they feel like that felony charge against him is excessive. That's a source familiar with the discussions telling CNN that they feel like that felony might be a bit over the top, given the circumstances very early in the morning, a lot of chaos and confusion.

And so, I'm taking away exactly what you, Rahel, is that the mayor of Louisville is basically saying -- apologizing for not having that video available. He came out and talked about wanting to be transparent, wanting to get the Louisville Police Department on the podium to say, listen, this is video that we don't have, and now the legal process is going to have to play out, which is that arraignment that he alluded to on June 3.So, now we're going to have to wait and see.

Shares right now are trading above $1,000. For the first time ever, you can see, it's up almost close to $1,050 there. That's after the company posted another quarter of strong financial results on Wednesday, the company reporting an increase in revenue by 262 percent and a 462 percent increase in profits year-over-year. But, the company also announced a 10-for-one stock split and that will make shares more accessible for individual investors.All of this, of course, fueling that AI boom taking advantage of the AI boom, and AI's ascent could mean the fall, though, of some jobs. The FCC also considering AI rules now for political ads. And remember, just this week after Scarlett Johansson said that she could be open to suing open AI after they created a voice assistant that sounded really similar to hers without permission. Joining us now from Los Angeles is Brian Merchant. He is the author of the \"Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech\". Brian, great to have you. It's certainly been a very busy week for AI. First is your reaction to this news from Scarlett Johansson. I mean, she is the epitome of Hollywood A-lister, now potentially going after open AI. BRIAN MERCHANT, AUTHOR, \"BLOOD IN THE MACHINE\": Yeah. Sure. It's a real encouraging development, I think, for a lot of artists and actors who have seen companies like OpenAI take their data, take their likeness, and turn it into an automated product. So, I think a lot of creatives are kind of cheering her on, on one side, and a lot of people are watching how this battle is going to play out for the industry on the other.",

The artificial intelligence sort of component of the industry was a really big sticking point. And if I remember correctly, it is part of the reason why it took the two sides so long to reach an agreement because of AI. Talk to me a little bit about the damage you think AI could potentially create for creators in that industry.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Well, you have to keep in mind that what these AI companies, led by OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, have done is vacuumed up all of the data and the work, the creative labor of people across the world. That means creatives here in the United States. That means people everywhere, anybody that's put something to digital tape, so to speak. They have vacuumed that up and used it in their training data and transmuted it into a product that they're now selling for profit. And this does not sit well with artists, with writers, and it was a key part of that strike that you mentioned last year when the WGA and SAG-AFTRA went on strike. They were still telling the studios that, no, you cannot use this technology to replace us, to erase us, to degrade our wages.",
