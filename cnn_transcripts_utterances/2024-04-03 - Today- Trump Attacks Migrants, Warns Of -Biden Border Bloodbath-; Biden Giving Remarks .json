Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden try to win votes on what Americans are most worried about.Trump stokes fears of American carnage at the hands of migrants, while Biden warns of an America where abortion is unavailable and health care is at risk. Plus, Joe Biden puts out a blistering statement after the Israeli government apologizes for unintentionally killing aid workers. But some fellow Democrats say words are no longer enough. And the special counsel does something remarkable. He puts pen to paper, blasting the judge presiding over the classified documents case for what he views as making basic mistakes that may cost him at trial. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and INSIDE POLITICS. Up first, Donald Trump is betting that he can scare voters on what he calls migrant crime into choosing him in November. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I stand before you today to declare the Joe Biden's border bloodbath, and that's what it is. It's a bloodbath. They tried to use that term incorrectly on me 2 weeks ago. You know, it's all about misinformation. That's all they do is, cheat on elections and disinformation, misinformation. Fairly closely related those two words. It's a border bloodbath, and it's destroying our country. It's a very bad thing happening. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's leaning into his inflammatory, incendiary, and quite frankly, violent rhetoric to play on voters' fears about immigrants.And I do want to be clear about what he's trying to do, because it's the same type of strategy we saw him use successfully in his 2016 campaign. He's using dehumanizing language to describe undocumented immigrants as violent criminals, even though available data does not support the idea that migrants are contributing to increases in crime. And he's doing this really to drive home his point that Biden isn't protecting Americans with the way that he is handling the southern border. Take a listen to what he said yesterday.

His campaign had labeled that first again event in Michigan as, quote, \"Biden's Border Bloodbath.\" Again, their words.And it's a play on the language that Trump received immense backlash for just a few weeks ago when he used the term bloodbath to describe the state of the auto industry and the country if Biden were to win in November. Now part of his strategy yesterday as well, which we have seen Trump deploy in the trail before, is to use specific stories of people who were killed by migrants who have entered the country illegally. Trump has really seized on these high profile crimes involving immigrants to try to make inroads in key battleground states. And I do think it's also important to point out here that this is the fear mongering, that we're seeing is working. Polling shows that immigration in the border is a top issue for voters in several states, including those like Michigan and Wisconsin that are hundreds of miles away from the southern border.",

What's new this year, as seen in the bloodbath messaging reboot, is the confidence that doing this will cost him nothing with non-White voters.\"That is so interesting. I want you to talk about that and also something we see often from Trump, which is taking a term that, Democrats, the Biden campaign used to say, look how look how horrible he is.

Chip Roy who didn't even want to vote for Trump in the primary talked about Biden's border bloodbath. And Republicans across the country, I point out in the piece that Kelly Ayotte running for governor of New Hampshire wasn't -- couldn't even bring herself to support Trump in 2016, is now running almost every day on the threat of quote, unquote \"migrant crime.\" And so the entire party moved his direction, and that was really what changed in 2020 because he improved in South Texas and South Florida, because we've seen -- go to Hialeah, Florida they've road named after Trump. Because he seemed to lose nothing with Latino voters by talking this way, it became safe for everyone in the party to talk about it politically from their view.",

They kind of glaze over the rhetoric. It is alarming to them, but they want to see a solution. Something that, former President Donald Trump said was every state is a border state. He's been saying that for a while. A lot of Republicans have been saying that for a while. But frankly, they see it in a way that they didn't before. People are seeing it in Denver, in New York City, in Washington, D.C., in Philadelphia. So you have these constituencies who are laying eyes on migrants in a way that they frankly didn't before. And so they see this as mismanaged. They see it as a problem. So while they take issue with the rhetoric, they ultimately want to see the White House provide some sort of solution.

It got double digits in both states -- very low double digits. But that understates how much opposition there is in the Democratic base.

I don't think there's any issue that Biden's running on right now or defending right now where he's this separated from his base -- not abortion, not the economy, not immigration, none of that. This is the biggest problem for him within the party, not just with voters in Dearborn or Arab Americans walking out of the White House, with most Democrats.
