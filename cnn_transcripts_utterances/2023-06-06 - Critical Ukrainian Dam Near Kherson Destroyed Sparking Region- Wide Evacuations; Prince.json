And Prince Harry is said to be the first British royal to testify in court in more than a century.

I may have one in private, but certainly publicly they should also state what that is and make sure the Ukrainians are on board with it. The desired state should be something like this, where the Russians are told to vacate the remaining parts of Ukraine that they occupy. That would be the ideal thing for Ukraine. And in this particular situation, I think what we're looking at is unfortunately, a degree of protracted effort on the part of the Ukrainians to achieve something that they can at least use at the bargaining table.

You get enormous train cars like this thrown overturned as if they were children's toys. Now, just days ago, this was the scene of one of the deadliest train disasters in modern Indian history. And already the railroad has been reopened and we can see what looks like a brand new modern train moving down the tracks here. That is even as scores of people are still looking for their missing loved ones from the accident that took place on Friday night. Now the initial accident, authorities say was caused by a switching malfunction. So a passenger train was moved onto a track where there was a parked freight train loaded with iron ore. And that crash sent some of the train cars into the other track where there was an approaching passenger train coming from the other side, so that mistake led to absolutely catastrophic results. As you can see, the railroad here has been reopened. We have another train moving through right now. And the railroad system India, it dates back in origins to when this country was a British colony. And it is essential to this country. More than 13 million people a day move around on trains in India. So that's part of why the authorities have worked so hard to reopen the rails after the train crash. I'm going to show you over here. This is an example of a railroad station in the Indian countryside. And it also happens to be just within sight if you see the lights down there of where the terrible train crash happened on Friday night. The very next day, India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, he was supposed to go inaugurate a brand new high speed train. Instead, he had to rush to the crash to survey the recovery efforts and to meet with some of the survivors. The Indian government has great ambitions to modernize this country. But as this terrible tragedy has highlighted, there's also a lot of work to be done to maintain aging and essential infrastructure. Ivan Watson, CNN In Odisha state in eastern India.

The Duke of Sussex has been selected as one of four representatives to testify in court out of a list of more than 100 claimants suing a British newspaper group for allegedly obtaining private information through unlawful means, mainly through phone hacking, voice mail interception, and the use of private investigators. Now, in an opening statement on Monday, the Duke of Sussex's legal representative, David Sherborne told the court that 147 articles published in the early 1990s to 2011 were submitted as part of the British royals claim which present, in his words, telltale find of unlawful information gathering. Information featured in these articles include private conversations between Prince Harry and his brother William, the Prince of Wales, as well as details surrounding his relationship with long term former girlfriend Chelsea Davey. MGN (ph) has however contested these claims, denying that senior editorial figures were aware of wrongdoing at the time, and maintaining there was simply no evidence the Duke of Sussex was hacked. But there remains a great deal of anticipation around Prince Harry's upcoming witness statement, which his lawyers say will describe very graphically the impact MGN's alleged unlawful activities have had on him in damaging his personal relationships to leading the prince to suffer from bouts of depression. Prince Harry has, of course, been a vocal advocate for reform across the media landscape, with a particular focus on Britain's tabloids, with repeated warnings from the prince of the impact the media's intrusion have had not only on himself, but also on his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and his late mother Princess Diana. While Prince Harry has spoken openly in the past from his memoir to his Netflix docuseries, the witness stand will offer no favors, and could well shine a harsher spotlight on the duke's personal life, as he faces cross-examination.

The reforms include setting up a disciplinary chamber for judges -- disciplinary chamber for judges -- and publishing information about them which violates their privacy, weakens the independence of the judiciary.Poland's justice minister called the court corrupt, and dismissed the E.U. ruling which is final and could lead to massive fines. This comes a day after some of Poland's largest anti-government demonstrations since the Cold War. Hundreds of thousands of people packed the streets of Warsaw on the 34th anniversary of the country's post-war democratic election in 1989. Protesters accuse the ruling party of nationalism, undermining democracy as well as endorsing homophobia. The eight main trade unions in France will stage 14th day of protests on Tuesday, a last ditch effort to pressure lawmakers to scrap the government's unpopular pension reform law. That, law championed by President Emmanuel Macron, raised the retirement age from 62 to 64. As many as 600,000 people are expected to turn out for this latest protests, just days before the National Assembly holds at debate on the new law. CNN's Melissa Bell spoke to one French journalist, who's covered these protests from the very beginning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It just seems, two decades of hell. ANNA-MARIA ARABIA, CEO, AUSTRALIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCE: It's unimaginable trauma and grief and in all of our scientific growth to support this case, it has been difficult to imagine what she has been through.

And so it began our investigation of the science, and the (INAUDIBLE) efforts to reach out to experts right around the world. To ask for their, help their specific expertise, to help understand what this genetic mutation meant. And over time it's become very clear that the (INAUDIBLE) mutation held by Kathleen and her daughters is rare and is a likely cause of death by a cardiac with means sudden stopping of the heart that can lead to death and in this case, is likely to have occurred for her two daughters. There was also an enormous body of evidence around the health or should I say your health of your two sons, one of her sons Patrick had epilepsy and indeed died after a seizure and had suffered some ill health for his life and Caleb died on the 14th, at 19 days. And he was unable to swallow and breathe at the same time. He had a respiratory illness, which was quite acute. And led to his death. So this collective body of scientific evidence, as well as scientific evidence to analyze diaries and journals that Kathleen told we could keep all trying together in the second inquiry that has led the commission of inquiry. The honorable Tom Bathurst (ph) to arrive at a very firm conclusion that there are natural causes for death for all of the Folbigg children. And that he strongly recommended that she be pardon. Or the death be a reasonable desk.
