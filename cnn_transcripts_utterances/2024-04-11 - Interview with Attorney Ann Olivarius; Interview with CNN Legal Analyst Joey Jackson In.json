Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. In his criminal trial and now in death, he takes up so much oxygen. O.J. Simpson has died from cancer at the age of 76. The former NFL star was the center of American attention in the mid-1990s, accused of brutally killing his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. The TV trial gripped the country and his eventual acquittal was a pivotal moment in the American cultural landscape. However, two years later, a jury in a civil trial found O.J. Simpson liable for their deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages. Simpson's trouble with the law did not end there. He was arrested in 2007 in Las Vegas and found guilty of 12 charges, including kidnapping and armed robbery. He was released from prison in 2017. Joining me now on this is the criminal defense attorney and legal analyst Joey Jackson and also with us, Ann Olivarius. She's an attorney who specializes in anti-discrimination cases, including sexual harassment and abuse. So, welcome to you both. I want to turn to you, Ann Olivarius, first. The victims here were two white people, a white woman, and you, in fact, tweeted today on the news of the death that, Nicole Simpson did not die at 76 years old in bed surrounded by children and grandchildren, as apparently O.J. did. What made you do that? What's your relationship to this moment, to this case?",

And so, I wasvery much caught up in that, and like many people, was hugely surprised at the verdict in that case. And so, I followed his life since. And I do a lot of work now on sexual assault and discrimination and, of course, domestic violence. And what we see, much like we saw with the Amber Heard trial in Britain when Amber Heard was first in a case against her ex- husband, Johnny Depp, she won that case, and there was a very esteemed judge, Nicol, who found that there were 13 acts of physical violence done to her by Johnny Depp. She goes to, you know, has to take up the same issue in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and of course, she loses the case there, and there it's a huge media fiasco with a judge who perhaps, one might say, is not in control of the courtroom and is a case where a celebrity can buy social media bots and where she's destroyed outside of the courtroom which invades the courtroom. O.J. Simpson, again, is a media -- you know, a celebrity himself. Here he is in trial. Judge Ito, many have criticized, as not being in control of that courtroom, of wanting the publicity very much. The trial goes on for nine months. It's wild. And, again, O.J. Simpson prevails, and one might think that against the evidence that was there, that was an outcome that was surprising.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it was a pivotal moment, and I think a very historical one. And certainly, what should never be lost is the factthat there are two victims and their families, I'm sure, are ailing to this day, and will always ail at the fact that they were dead, right? The issue is at whose hands. And I think it will be controversial until the end of time, whether or not O.J. Simpson is responsible. Many were shocked. If you go back and you evaluate what cameras caught where various groups and organizations who were watching the verdict, remember the world stopped to watch the verdict, you'll see various reactions. Some people in shock. Are you kidding? A jury got it completely wrong. Others in complete joy and jubilation over a jury that got it right and finally did justice for a member of the African- American community. So, it will be controversial forever, I do believe, and that's why we had the civil case. And in the civil case, what you saw was a family attempt to bring accountability. Now, civil cases are not criminal in nature. They determine whether or not there's liability, that is responsibility for the issue at hand, which is the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and, of course, Mr. Goldman, and then the issue would then be what monetary damage is. And as you asserted already, Christiane, it was a $33.5 billion verdict finding him responsible. But going back to the criminal verdict, I think you have to look at the context of the times. There was also something very pivotal that happened in America in 1992, and that was the beating of Rodney King. Rodney King was a black motorist who was pulled out of his car, and the videotape was seen everywhere, I would say internationally of the fierce beating he got and then the acquittal of the officers of the LAPD thereafter. And then you have the O.J. Simpson case where the defense in that case, the defense team made up of lawyers who are just historical, F. Lee Bailey, you have Johnnie Cochran, right, you have Barry Scheck, you have Alan Dershowitz, just attorneys who were just exceptional at their craft that really came together. And I think what they were able to do was to deflect the issue and not make it just about the killings, right, of two precious souls, but to make it about the LAPD and the racism and the historical alleged racism. You have Mark Fuhrman who was an investigator who they asserted and were able to prove use the N word. And so, I think that deflection really turned the tables from a case about just two people who died to an institutional system that had historically discriminated against African-Americans. O.J. Simpson being an African-American celebrity and there you had now a jury that made a determination. I think that was very broad. And that broad determination is, we're not going to Stanford anymore. And I think he was largely acquitted because of, really, a referendum on an LAPD, right, that had run amok as opposed to whether he committed those crimes. So, you have look at it in the context of those crimes, did they get it right, did they get it wrong? We could debate that day and night. Different people will disagree. But if you look at what was happening in America at that time, the jury was grappling with so much.",

But first, I want to goback to you, Ann Olivarius, because here was a woman, his his ex-wife, by this time who had on multiple occasions called the police, called hotlines, was desperate to be helped from what she alleged was a violent former husband. She basically said that, you know, she was afraid of him, he beat her. In the aftermath of the crime, calls to shelters and help lines, as you know, exploded. She was very afraid. At one point, she said, you know, he's going to kill me. The police came around here. She had a split lip and a black eye, and she alluded to pass calls to the police saying to the officers, you never do anything about him, you talk to him and then leave. He eventually pleaded no contest to battery charges, et cetera, spousal battery. Put that in the context of how women like Nicole Simpson were disbelieved in those days now all those years back in the '90s and before, all the way back before, you know, the MeToo Movement.",

O.J. Simpson was a celebrity, like so many celebrities who are generally given the benefit of the doubt. But Joey, I want to ask you this, because, you know, in the many years, even beyond, when he was found civil libel for their deaths, in 2014, even before the landmark documentary, a CNN/ORC poll found that 53 percent of black people surveyed said the murder charges against Simpson were either definitely true or probably true. He continued to maintain his innocence and he's never apologized or come close to it. Joey, what do you think happened in those intervening years? Explain the psychology, the beliefs, the evidence maybe, that got so many of the black community to shift to a majority who then believed that he was in fact probably guilty.",

And the concerns are that domestic violence is an issue. And, you know, there needs to be people who give voice to that. And certainly, people who are the victim of that need to be heard. I think the defense relating it to this particular case, Christiane, was very adept at really deflecting and again, changing the narrative from that, right, to the narrative of a referendum on LAPD. So, I just want to be clear that everything Ann says with respect to domestic violence and abuse and hearing women needs to be heard and is very valued. But I think as it related to this particular case, the defense really deflected masterfully from that issue and made it about something else.",

And so, I think that the African-American community in the O.J. case took this as an opportunity to sort of, you know, look for justice by them making it, right, the defense team a referendum on that. The other issue is that O.J. Simpson, you know, you can argue and debate whether he's really been a child of the African-American community or whether he just was when it was convenient as it related to this case. And I think as people have learned more and perhaps over the years, right, people's views always change about other matters, people become enlightened for a variety of different reasons.",

In 1989, America was shocked by the assault and rape of a female jogger here in Central Park. The police quickly arrested six teens and sent five of them to prison. They were labeled the Central Park Five and were vilified in the press. Donald Trump even called for the return of the death penalty in full-page ads across multiple newspapers. But the five teenagers were innocent. And yet, despite multiple glaring failings in the investigation, they spent years in jail. Eventually, in 2002, the real attacker confessed, and their convictions were vacated. And this year, one of the exonerated five, Yusef Salaam, became a member of the New York City Council. He was elected, and I sat down with him here in Manhattan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He threatens or utilizes the potential for violence, whether it's on his social media sites or in his speeches, the language is the language of incitement. And so, the scenario that I worry about isn't just sort of our election, but if Trump were to lose, we need to be ready that he needs to create a narrative about what that loss means. It was stolen, the election was rigged. And President Biden, not as the candidate, but as the president of the United States who needs to guarantee a peaceful election, needs to be more transparent on what the preparations are and take some of the advice of the January 6th Committee report to get ready for potentially the next insurrection.",

It is a place, it is a time, and it's a mission, at least for January 6th. Now, what we're seeing in terms of the election strategy, the campaign strategy and what he's doing on social media, let alone what he's saying in rallies that we tend to ignore in the mainstream press is very much the same kind of language. I want to be clear, most of Donald Trump supporters are not going to go to violence, but what Donald Trump certainly knows is that there are people who follow him who will be guided by that kind of language. And what he certainly ought to know at this stage is that there is lots of activity in social media taking his words, taking his language, and then essentially continuing to weaponize it. These are things that Donald Trump is aware of and does nothing to curb and in fact, further enhances. It's not -- look, this is really disconcerting. I get it. I get people's desire to think, no, this time it will be OK. I see no purpose in that at this stage. We should be guaranteed as citizens, whatever our ideological background, to a peaceful election period and transition to the next term, whether it is President Biden or Former President Donald Trump, and listen to what Donald Trump is telling us will happen if he loses.

D.C. is a complicated governance system, as we saw in January 6th between the National Guard and Capitol Police and Secret Service and local police. Let's get that organized now. And the reason why I urge that is, one, that no one's guessing at the moment something happened, as we saw in the January 6th Committee report, it was that inability to respond in many ways. Who could do what? What were their authorities that made it difficult? And I think, secondly, you know, that this organization will actually ensure that peaceful protest, even against, you know, the President Biden, is allowable. What we don't want is a situation when, you know, everyone goes to -- you know, to their separate sides and then you have a conflict. And I think President Biden needs to be transparent about it now.

We need to start shaming this violence and the threat of violence that has become, you know, part of our democratic process. Our norms are completely stretched right now and we're kind of not seeing it. And so, I think, you know, not only should President Biden say, here's how it's going to work peacefully if I don't win, but we need to get others to also embrace that word peaceful. We'll still disagree with each other, but the fact that we're having this conversation, right, that the risk of a not peaceful period leading up to the election and then certainly after shows how far, you know, we've stretched sort of our understanding of what democracy is as well as stretch the threat environment, which is increased by everybody's account.",

And the reason why is they have charismatic leaders who are now in jail for serious sedition crimes. They can't raise money. They can't recruit. So, that's good in the sense that you don't want organized paramilitary organizations going after democracy. That doesn't mean that their appeal is completely over. Look, ideologies don't end. They only get isolated or decrease. And so, what you are seeing, as you said, is sort of the to the ground, right, that there are people who are still, as we see, buying into this, who are still believing that violence is a natural extension of our democratic differences. And those are harder to find, because they're not online, they're not organizing, they're not meeting. And I think that, as FBI director Chris Wray said recently in testimony, that's sort of his -- you know, that's a fear that you know is out there, but they're really hard to find in every instance. But then there's another part of this post sort of January 6, 2021 narrative, which is the criminal prosecutions. So, criminal prosecutions have gone very, very far in showing that there are consequences for this kind of behavior. People know that they could go to jail, lose their jobs, be isolated from their families for even something that they thought was kind of a joke. And I think that's an important message to keep, you know, playing out. That's what the January 6th Committee tried to do.
