      "sentences": "Welcome to our ongoing coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. I'm Julia Chatterley in New York.And the war between Israel and Hamas is moving closer to a new and more dangerous phase. The Israeli military tells us they plan to ramp up airstrikes in Gaza, \"From today.\" And an Israeli spokesman told CNN earlier, a ground offensive is, \"Coming soon.\" Meanwhile, there are calls for further aid after 20 trucks finally managed to enter Gaza earlier, carrying precious medical supplies and canned food stuffs. Aid organizations are saying, \"Time is running out before deaths could skyrocket due to the lack of water, disease, and access to health care.\" In just the past day, 248 people may have been killed in Gaza, at least that's according to the Hamas -controlled government, which says more than 4,300 people have been killed since the attack in Israel on October 7th. We, of course, have no way of verifying that information. Meanwhile, Palestinian officials say, that the amount of aid crossing into Gaza earlier, is not nearly enough to address the humanitarian situation there. They say, it only represents three percent of what used to get into Gaza before this crisis. Salma Abdelaziz reports, and I want to warn you, some images may be disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling. Everything is running out, from surgical equipment, to medicine. And the tiniest lives, are left hanging in the balance. We need power. We need access to clean water, this doctor says. Without basic services, this will be a humanitarian catastrophe. Already, seven hospitals and 21 primary health care facilities here are out of service, according to Palestinian officials because of shortages. After intense diplomatic efforts, prayers of relief at the Rafah Border crossing, as a trickle of aid was allowed in from Egypt. But the 20-truck convoy is only a drop in the ocean of need here, equivalent you just three percent of what entered this enclave daily prior to the conflict. More than 200 additional trucks of assistance remain stalled on the Egyptian side, according to the U.N. And every hour, costs lives. And so far, no civilians can leave the enclave. 10-year-old Palestinian- American Aiden is among those trapped. AIDEN BSEISO, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN: And we have no place to go. All the streets are bombed, they are literally gone. How are we supposed to go out? How? It's all closed. ABDELAZIZ (voiceover): Even if people are allowed out, it will be a limited number, most likely only those with foreign passports. Sealing some 2 million others, half of them children, into this hellscape. But some refused to go even if they could, fearing Israel intends to bomb and besiege them out of their homes, never to return. Even as Mahmoud (ph) buries his children, he says, he will keep fighting just to exist here. We will still be patient, as long as we are live on this Earth, we will be patient, he says. We will never leave this land. After the October 7th terror attacks, when Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel in a brutal surprise incursion, Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas. But with hundreds of airstrikes pounding the densely populated enclave a day, innocent blood is being spilt. Innocent children were struck down while they were sleeping, this woman shouts. What did they do? Did they carry weapons? These are innocent children who know nothing. Tell us, when will this end. There are calls for a ceasefire to get civilians out of the war zone and allow more aid into Gaza. But the police fall on deaf ears, so far. Israel is preparing for the next phase of its operations, a potential ground incursion that can only bring more suffering. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, and we've been all along the sort of eastern edge of the border today as well, trying to compare and contrast with what we've seen over the past week or so. And the frenzied activity of troops rushing in, of thousands upon thousands of reservist cars outside of bases, of tank units at the side of the road repairing tank tracks. We're not -- didn't see that today.But the security is tighter, so we can't get to the roads that are close to Gaza. So, it would be expected that's where the units that we're going to go forward into Gaza for an incursion would be. So, we only have a limited picture, but we know that the IDF has said that they will pick up and will -- and are picking up airstrikes and artillery strikes into Gaza today. We're hearing that right now. You might see some flashes behind me. We're hearing the detonations of impacts. Compared to the previous 24 to 48 hours, where there was a relative lull in the buildup to the release of a couple of hostages. Today, there is much more activity during the daytime. We've seen strikes going into Gaza. You might just hear another detonation coming up behind me as -- there you go, that's Northern Gaza where you have villages, towns like Khan Yunis. You have Gaza City, it's literally seven and a half miles from here, and across to the coastline. So, all those areas, if there are explosions there, generally you can hear them here. And I think that is what with -- that's what we're hearing now, that's what we have been measuring it against of over the past couple of weeks. So, the IDF is saying, yes, it's going to step up those strikes to make it safer for its troops on the ground. It is not giving a specific timeline of when those troops are going to go in. And the level of artillery and missile strikes that we are hearing at the moment is not particularly high. It is higher than the past couple days, but it is not as high as we have heard. So, it's very hard to tell due to the fact we can't get close to the border, and you know, we can only gauge in relative terms, the amount of shelling, the amount of missiles we are hearing compared to previous days. So, it's very hard to tell to make an assessment about when that incursion might come. But it does seem that the Israeli military are getting closer to it. But when Hamas releases hostages, when there is huge pressure for humanitarian pause, 20 aid trucks went into Gaza today. All of those things complicate the political assessment, even though we are told that the greenlight has been given to the military to decide to go in when they feel that they're ready, it complicates that picture. That's potentially what we're not able to witness, but that is potentially what is playing out in the background at the moment.",

But as you quite rightly say, in many ways, there is a military war being fought. And there is also a P.R. battle, and we see that spilling all the around the world in terms of response. Do you think they're buying time to some degree, at least, to hope to get more hostages out perhaps? And also, to fulfill those hopes of more aid into Gaza too as complicated as that's been?",

We are talking somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000, many of those are reservists. Just to keep them poised for the last two weeks, talking to them about the prospect of this invasion as we saw the head of the military doing today. But also keeping them, in a sense, on edge, waiting for that moment when they are told that they are not going to now go in, that's another additional challenge.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we have been talking about that here among our team because we've all been out. We've all seen the troops. We were with troops at the very beginning of this week who are absolutely ready. You could see that they were ready for the mission ahead. These were troops, you know, who may be or sort of 30 years old, many years of experience, a lot of years of combat experiences, some of the best fighting troops that Israel probably has at the moment. They're -- they were ready.So, how do you keep them sharp and on that edge? How do you keep them supplied? And let's not forget, when you have so many reservists involved in the fight, that holds another areas of society. We heard from the economy minister earlier this week saying, yes, that's an issue that we have to deal with. That there is an impact on the economy and we do have to, sort of, backfill what the reservists do. But the most pressing issue, of course, for the IDF is to keep those troops primed, ready to go focused, with the food, with the fuel that they require but not to leave them out in the field so long that when they move off, you know, they are already tired. That is not what you want from a ground invasion force that needs to have their wits absolutely sharp. That needs to have high levels of energy because they could stay in sustained contact for day after day after day. And their preservation relies on their ability to make good, strong decisions and calculations in combat. And as we know from combat veterans, minutes in combat can feel like hours. So, anything that you subtract from that in advance by keeping troops in the field makes their lives more difficult and it makes it more dangerous. So, all of that has to become a calculation of how long can Israel leave them close to the line of contact, close to the line of departure, close to that invasion point or incursion point is unclear. But absolutely the military will not want to stretch it out too long.",

But can you just describe the conditions that she is living in? I believe there's 40 to 50 people, at this moment, in one home? You mentioned having to go and get more food.

I mean, there are 40 to 50 people in a single home, there are mattresses everywhere, there is no electricity.And so, sometimes they try to get generators to work, solar powered generators to work for a little bit of time. There is no cell connection. So, it's just concerning. When I get that call from the State Department to tell my mother to go to the Rafah Border, how am I going to reach her to tell her to get there? And then, when she gets there, she's going to need fuel, right? And someone to be able to drive her over to the border. And so, it's just terrifying. Just this morning, right, you know, they requested -- the State Department said go. And it's interesting, the messages we get from the State Department, right? It's sort of, you know, if you assess the situation, you know, if it's safe, then head to the Rafah Border. As if my mother has the machine learning model or algorithm that can tell her when the Israeli bombs and where they're going to fall. It's really striking. And one thing I'm just, you know, baffled about, and I feel really betrayed by my own government is the fact that, you know, all we're requesting is for equal protection. You know, my mother is a U.S. citizen. She's been a U.S. citizen for more than 25 years. The Israeli-Americans, they get -- you know, I see the messages, they get, you know, charter flights and cruise ships, food, and wi-fi. And then, we -- you know, the Palestinian-Americans, they get starvation and bombs raining down on them. So, all we are requesting is just, you know, for equal protection, right.

President Biden was -- I thought very artful and clear in his -- stating his -- he was very sincere in stating his compassion for both sides.But if on the Palestinian side, there can be a strength and resolve, the Palestinian authority has signed on to a two-state solution many years ago. Hamas has not. The -- in Israel, there has been a large debate about this. Most Israeli governments from the right have not signed on to that. It would take quite a sea of change to see if the Israeli side would sign on to a two-state solution. And then both sides work together to make that happen. But how we get from the current horrible situation to negotiations, I don't see how we do that without de-escalation and a ceasefire as first steps to the immediate thing and return of the hostages and humanitarian relief.

And certainly, they've dealt themselves out of any long-term solution to the question of Palestine. So, I think they are already thoroughly discredited, but they have the guns. They have the power to intimidate those 2 million people that are there. How that would be resolved, I don't know. I can't see how an Israeli invasion will do that, sadly. Honestly.",

Amit went towards the danger and gave her life to help others. CNN's Anderson Cooper reports of the photos and messages Amit sent her sisters. And a warning, the story contains disturbing images.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): When Hamas gunman arrived at the entrance of Be'eri kibbutz around 7:00 a.m., Sunday morning, they waited for a car to arrive and open the gate. Then they executed the people inside. A 22-year-old medic, Amit Man was already in the community clinic. She'd run there when rocket sirens first sounded at 6:30 a.m. She could have stayed in her apartment's saferoom but wanted to help in case anyone was wounded. For the next seven hours, Hamas gunmen roamed the grounds, burning homes, breaking into houses, hunting residents. Slaughtering more than 120 men, women and children. HAVIVA IZIKSON, AMIT MAN'S SISTER: She wrote us that there is terrorists in the kibbutz. They heard shooting. They heard Arabs talking. They were there and she let us know that.
