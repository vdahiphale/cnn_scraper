And now a new move that will help homeless veterans across the United States.Plus, she has blazed a trail for her entire career, and today, we're going one on one with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. What does she really think about the Harris-Walz ticket? Has she spoken to President Biden about his decision to drop out? What does she really think about his debate performance against Donald Trump? We're going to ask her all that in just moments. And leading this hour, Donald Trump's return to the public eye in the form of sprawling news conference just a few minutes ago at Mar-a- Lago, the former president attacking his new political opponent calling Kamala Harris incompetent and not smart. He tried to instill fear. He told lies. And in one of his most bizarre moments, he was asked by the \"New York Times\" Maggie Haberman if he thought there was a peaceful transfer of power. The last time he left office, Trump initially responded no, but then his answer turned into this. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: If you look at January 6, which a lot of people aren't talking about very much, I think those people were treated very harshly. It's very interesting. The biggest crowd I've ever spoken to, and I said peacefully and patriotically, which nobody wants to say, but I said peacefully and patriotically, the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to, and you've seen Maggie, I was in at the mall, I was at the Washington Monument, I was at the whole thing, I had crowds, I don't know who's ever had a bigger crowd than I have. If you look at Martin Luther King when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people, if not we had more. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump has largely been off the campaign trail this week, other than this event, and basically, really hasn't been out there as much since Kamala Harris became the top of the ticket. What do we know about his eagerness to get in front of a camera, his eagerness to do the kind of rallies in battlegrounds that we're used to?",

It was -- he is not comfortable being out of the spotlight here. And the fundamentals of the race have changed dramatically. His rival has changed dramatically.There has been just an unsettled nature of the Trump campaign. The likes of which I can't really recall seeing at any point of his candidacies, from 2016 to 2020, he's a bit off step. And I think him changing his tune on the debates is the best empirical example of that. It was just a week or so ago when he was saying, you know, not going to have debates, and then suddenly proposing three. So we now know that there will be one, at least, maybe more than that. But the fundamental fundamentals of the race have changed dramatically. Yes, immigration still a central concern, inflation a central concern. You'd hardly know it, though, based on the hour long, you know, wide ranging to be charitable news conference at Mar-a-Lago. So talking to Republican voters, I was in Michigan yesterday at that Harris rally, he diminished that crowd size, but I tell you, if I would have closed my eyes and just not listen to the actual messages, it was the size of an old Trump campaign rally.

Obviously these are accusations that have come up when he is ran in previous cycles for other parts, obviously, he ran for Congress and then for governor. And these are accusations that have kind of made their rounds as he's run for these different offices. So they tell me that they are aware of it and they're prepared to push back on. I think that's why you saw that very quick Democratic rollout of pushback from Pete Buttigieg.We know somebody that is actually a combat veteran, from other folks within the Democratic Party. The question is, though, is whether or not it's going to stick. Obviously, into 2004 with Kerry that was successful, regardless of the merit of it, that was successful.

There is also singing in the streets as Swifties come together to try to make sense of this era, Taylor Swift has attracted throngs of young fans to travel far and wide to be part of this European tour. Nick Paton Walsh reports now on how the suspects are part of a troubling trend revealing how ISIS, a terrorist group, is radicalizing teens to carry out their fiendish plots.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITOR (voice- over): Three nights of record breaking teen-ish revelry halted by unprecedented teen horror. Austrian police, Thursday, outlined how this 19-year-old man had planned a suicide attack with knives and a bomb on doting crowds in the periphery of Taylor Swift's three concerts in Vienna tonight, Friday and Saturday. Here, where he lived an hour south, police found 21,000 euros fake cash, chemical bomb precursors and detonators clearing nearly 60 homes in case of a blast. And troublingly, a police car blue light, perhaps meant to ease his vehicle into the crowd so he could attack. He quit his job two weeks ago, changing his appearance, saying he planned something big. Another teenager, 17, was detained Thursday just outside the stadium where police say he'd been hired to work. And a third teen, just 15 years old, was also questioned. Radicalized online by ISIS, the teenagers are Austrian born. (SINGING) WALSH (voice-over): It left Swift fans, 65,000 disappointed per night, about as distraught as they can get. Some in tears, but police very clear about how close they got. GERHARD KARNER, AUSTRIAN INTERIOR MINISTER (through translator): We also have to say, more specifically to the current events that major concerts are often a favorite target of Islamist attackers. WALSH (voice-over): Echoes of a horrific ISIS bombing in Manchester at an Ariana Grande concert in 2017 that killed 22 fans. After which Swift herself said, in 2019 I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. Police clear ISIS radicalized the teens online where they also got their bomb instructions. OMAR HAIJAWI-PIRCHNER, AUSTRIAN DIRECTOR OF SECURITY SERVICES: We can see that in Austria, we have very young guys that are radicalized due to the fact that they are using the online propaganda. WALSH (voice-over): The arrests add to a litany of teen ISIS plots tracked in a landmark study by researcher Peter Neumann. Nearly two thirds of ISIS related arrests in Europe in the past nine months have been of teenagers.",

Vance, who served in the Marines for four years, is accusing Walz of resigning from the National Guard to avoid a deployment of his unit to Iraq. But more evidence is emerging that Walz retired from the guard months before that deployment was ordered. He filed to run for Congress in February, 2005. In March, the Guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq. REP. TIM WALZ (D-MN): I left in -- in April of 2005. And this was what, you know, for me it was -- it was just short of 25 years, and -- and it was -- it was to run for this office. FOREMAN (voice-over): Another accusation from the Republican side. Walz falsely suggested he was in the thick of fighting overseas when talking about gun control. REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): He's never really been on any combat deployment.
