We begin on Capitol Hill with the Senate floor is for the moment, a courtroom, 100 senators, jurors now in the impeachment trial of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the first impeachment of a cabinet secretary in nearly 150 years. Two articles of impeachment passed via a razor thin -- take a moment here, here's Republican Senator Mitch McConnell speaking on the Senate floor. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Listen, this is what our rules require of us as well. But the Senate does not have the opportunity to perform this duty. The Senate will not hear the House managers present the details of their case against Secretary Mayorkas that he willingly neglected the duties of his office and that he lied to Congress about the extent of that failure. Likewise, we will not hear that secretary's representatives present the vigorous defense to which he is entitled. Our colleagues know that we are obligated to take these proceedings seriously. This is what our oath prescribes. It's what the history and precedent require. And I would urge each of our colleagues to consider that this is what the Framers actually envision. The power of impeachment is one of the most delicate balances our constitutional system strikes with a portion of the American people, sovereign electoral authority. It purchases a safeguard against malpractice and it gives the Senate the power and the duty to decide. This process must not be abused. It must not be short-circuited. History will not judge this moment well. Therefore, I move to table the point of order and asked for the yeas and nays. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.",

They do not believe there's a basis to impeach Mayorkas and we'll move relatively quickly to dismiss those articles of impeachment.Following all this is CNN's Melanie Zanona. Melanie, we should note this simple fact as we hear from Republicans saying it is a violation of the Constitution, not to at least have a trial. Forty-five Republicans voted to dismiss impeachment articles against Donald Trump for his actions on January 6 without a trial.

So what that means, Jim, is that Johnson is going to need Democrats get this over the finish line. So far, they have not explicitly said that they will do that. They wanted to see the bill text first. We should note, one of their key demands was that they wanted 9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza. That is in the package. So, potentially, we could see some Democrats step in here, not only just to save these foreign aid packages because but also to save Johnson's speakership. If he moves ahead with this plan as is expected, it's likely that we could see a motion to vacate the speakership at some point on the House floor.

Have a listen, I want to get your thoughts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Let's not kid ourselves about what's going on today.

LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. I think he does, Jim, because again, you know, Republicans in the House had a chance to take up this by bill that was arguably one of the most conservative immigration bills that the Congress has seen in decades. And it was one where Democrats were willing to essentially give Republicans almost everything. They weren't even seeking a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, which is often something that is a part of those negotiations in the past, whenever Congress was considering some type of border immigration bipartisan deal, and that wasn't even on the table this time around. And so, the White House is really view when this exactly the way Chuck Schumer is, which is that it is a political stunt and they feel as though it's something that the majority of the country isn't necessarily paying attention to. And they're hoping that they can continue to hammer Republicans on the fact that they taint that bipartisan deal.",

He's not the one who has made the border policies that Republicans object two so much. Some Republicans have even said getting rid of him wouldn't do anything to change those policies because the next homeland security secretary would likely implement Joe Biden's policies in the exact same way and they wouldn't be different policies. And the Republicans did have a chance to implement tougher policies on the border. And they decided not to take it. So it is a potentially risky vote for some of those Senate Democrats.

We do expect, given the Democratic majority, we do expect this motion to dismiss to passBARRON-LOPEZ: That's right. We do. I mean, you know, and we also as Melanie Zanona was saying right before you came to us, Jim, I mean, it'll be interesting to really see how senators like Murkowski ultimately heard on this, because Senate -- Senator Murkowski, Republican herself was saying in the lead to this that she didn't think that this was something that rose to the level of impeachment that just because you don't like the policies of an administration doesn't mean that you can impeach one of their secretaries. And so, you know, one thing that the White House is trying to highlight in this battle is not just the comments from Republicans like Senator Murkowski, but also from some constitutional scholars that have said that this isn't, you know, the accurate only used to impeachment proceeding.",

That's what the Constitution intended. It's fair argument one can make, but we should note that 45 Republicans voted to dismiss the January 6 impeachment charges against Trump before a trial, 45, five Republicans, I believe, went against their party on that.

And said at that time, you know, we're just going to start this back- and-forth of unending impeachments whenever -- you know, whichever party is in power.And that is, I think what we are seeing now that impeachment has just become this cudgel that the parties use against each other, whether it's the ongoing, ill-fated impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden, that the House continues to consider or this what really should be considered a historic impeachment of a cabinet secretary, but something that I think is being treated as a mostly frivolous and partisan exercise.",

They did get the White House to agree to as Laura said, a much tougher immigration bill than they had previously been willing to support. What they weren't willing to do was to take the win and actually get something done. And so, now, I think another question going forward on this issue is whether the White House is willing to go it alone and do some executive action.

You have the ongoing military operations in Gaza and you have ongoing concern in Israel about Hezbollah in the north, and you have some public support in Israel for doing that job, finishing the job there after operations wrapped up in Gaza.

But now they're stuck because they can't send them back if they haven't done anything thing and well, what is it they're going to do? Well, they have to find some way to hit Hezbollah and push them back. That will then allow these Jews to live -- go back and live the normal lives and have kids attend the school season and all the rest.So you're right. I mean, the Israelis are fighting on a number of fronts here. They don't really want to do it simultaneously. But then you also have internal tensions between Netanyahu and his right-wing government, who are very happy to see him use this opportunity to go after Iran in a big way. And resolve a problem that they've been sitting on for a very long time. And also by the way, suck the Americans into a war that will significantly raise oil prices and will make it more likely that Biden will be out. If you're Prime Minister Netanyahu and you've watched Chuck Schumer and President Biden and others saying, we think it's time for Netanyahu to go. Well, if you're Bibi, you think it's time for Biden to ago. And one way to make it more likely that Biden is out is if you find a way to get this conflict with Iran a little bit higher.

They've gone Democratic for the governor's mansion, for Senate seats of -- and you see these razor-thin margins in the House and Senate. So this really sets us up for a very interesting discussion as November approaches. But let's back up to today. We're seeing that this converse patient failed to make it to the full House floor because typically you would have to have this go through a committee hearing first. They've tried to bypass that, did not happen. Here is a little bit of what we saw on the floor today.

I want to make sure that the audience and people who are watching today understand that, yes, we can change rules at any point to be able to bring things like this up for a vote.

There are about 100 of them who gathered outside before this all happened, the abortion rights group gathered afterward.So in the morning, if you talk to the hundred people, they would all say their pro-life, but they may have different ideas of what that means as far as punishment, consequences, any exceptions. We talked to some people who were for this law dating back to the 1860s that offers no exceptions except before saving the life of the mother. Others believed that maybe some consideration should be there for a rape victim. And some others who did not feel that prison time is appropriate and, of course, this law does state that providers could be put in prison for two to five years for violating the law -- Jim.",
