He'll take the stage in front of current and former union workers. But that means he won't be on stage at tonight's Republican presidential debate as with the first GOP debate Trump is skipping the second showdown in California. This as the former president's business empire is under a major threat after a New York judge ruled Trump and his adult sons committed fraud. For years by overvaluing their properties to get favorable loans and insurance deals.We have reporters covering all of these stories CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes is in Michigan ahead of his speech tonight. We have CNN senior national correspondent Kyung Lah in Simi Valley; California, the site of the Republican debate and we have CNN national correspondent Brynn Gingras in New York covering the Trump org fraud case. Kristen gonna start with you here. What more can you tell us about this effort by Trump tonight to court blue-collar voters even though he's going to be at a non-union location.",

And it goes to show you just how important these working-class voters are going to be in a general election in 2024.Now, of course Trump is not the nominee, but he is the front-runner and this is really the clearest signal we've had from the Trump campaign that they are looking ahead to a general election. Now where he's going to be tonight As you mentioned, this is a non-union shop. It's called Drake Enterprises. It's in Macomb County and he is expected to get a warm welcome here. It's a county that he won both in 2016 and in 2020. But when we look at why exactly he chose to come here to a swing state to talk to working-class voters, that shows you what they are looking at trying to pick off certain groups of voters ahead of 2024. We know that this group of voters Michigan particularly carried Trump or at least helped carry Trump to the White House in 2016. They also helped carry Biden to the White House in 2020 and Trump believes that they can siphon off some of these voters. That they can drive a wedge between union leadership, which has essentially condemned Donald Trump. They have said that his administration was anti-worker, anti-union. It was pro-business. They can separate them from the rank-and-file and I did speak to a couple of workers who are coming tonight who told me that some of the reason they're coming to support Donald Trump has nothing to do with unions or working. It actually has to do with having conservative values and that's why they would be here tonight. But Brianna, we will keep an eye on this. We're going to be talking to the people here seeing who exactly shows up. Why exactly they're here, if they're going to come out and vote in 2024. It'll be interesting to see but again he's not going to get the same warm welcome, at least from union leaders that we saw President Biden get yesterday.",

Chris Christie former, New Jersey Governor has said to CNN that he fully intends to make tonight about Donald Trump telling CNN quote \"this is going to be about Trump\" and that he plans to try to force that contrast between Trump and his rivals. So, his presence if Chris Christie has anything to say about it is certainly going to be felt. Underscoring all of this was something that he tweeted today as well.It's a light-hearted tweet referencing the weekend viral moment with Taylor Swift when she showed up at a Kansas City football game. But it underscores his strategy tonight. He tweeted quote \"after tonight Trump will know we are never, ever getting back together\". I was gonna sing that but my producer Anamaya (ph) says I cannot. Let's give you a look at the stage tonight based on polling position at the center is Ron DeSantis. He is still in this tier at the very top. He's going to be flanked by Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. On the outside of them, Tim Scott, Chris Christie, and on the very edges, Mike Pence and Doug Burgum. [14:05:09] So, the overall dynamics of this race right now, Brianna, they have not changed. But those little movements, those breakout moments, that's what this room is going to be looking for, at least the candidates on the stage tonight.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, and it will kneecap his businesses here in New York if they actually go through it. There's an if there because, Brianna, there's still a lot of appeals in this process. But let's get to the core of what this New York judge decided, essentially saying that Trump, his two sons, and Trump Organization committed fraud for almost a decade, over-evaluating his properties to really amass his fortune that we all are very much familiar with because he talks about it all the time, right?Give you one tangible example of what was in this ruling. It talks about how Trump said his Trump Tower apartment here in New York City, it was three times bigger than it actually is in square footage, basically over-evaluating up to $207 million. And the judge, not mincing words, essentially saying a discrepancy of that by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of a decade can only be considered fraud. So what's the result of this? Well, a judge has handed down some hefty penalties, essentially canceling business certifications of Trump entities that are named as defendants in this civil suit that was brought by Letitia James, the AG in this state last year. It also is impacting Trump Org, two specific properties, one here in New York, 40 Wall Street, also a family estate in Silver Springs in Westchester County, New York, and an independent party is going to be appointed to dissolve these entities. Now, how that's going to look, it's going to take time to figure exactly that out. The judges have to decide that. But listen, this is just one part of a number of issues that Letitia James brought in her civil suit, and that is expected to get started next week. It's going to be dealing with financial issues. But listen, this ruling yesterday ahead of the start of that suit really clears the path for James to get what she wanted originally when she brought this, which was basically to make the Trumps, the sons and Trump himself, never do business again here in the state of New York. Also, they may be owing New York a lot, a lot of money based on this ruling yesterday. So, we're going to wait to find out. But again, there's a lot of appeals in play right now, Brianna, that we're keeping an eye out for.",

SANCHEZ: New today, the U.S. Army private who ran into one of the most repressive nations on earth on purpose is now back in U.S. custody. More than two months ago, Travis King raced across the DMZ, the demilitarized zone, while on a public tour of the joint security area that separates North and South Korea. Now, this picture is of the back of King's head, and it was taken shortly before he made a run for it. Of course, this release is a rare move considering North Korea's brutal record on human rights.

      "sentences": "Well, Boris, what they said just a couple of hours, really, before US officials confirmed that he was in US custody was that they were going to expel Travis King. This was all through state-run media. They said that he had confessed to illegally intruding into the country. Now, I should say this is all North Korea's words.We have not heard from or seen Travis King since mid-July when he ran across the border. But North Korea also claims that Travis King said that he wanted to go across the border because of what he thought was an unjust US society. I'll read you part of the state media quote here. He harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the US army and was disillusioned about the unequal US society. Now, again, this is Pyongyang's words, not Travis King's. I'm sure we will be hearing from him at some point in the future. But from North Korea's point of view, it was an interesting decision to expel him. In their words, as opposed to trying use him as any kind of bargaining chip. I mean, in the past, they have managed to secure some very high profile US visitors to Pyongyang to negotiate for the release of a US citizen. In fact, they've had former US presidents going to Pyongyang for that reason. Experts I've spoken to say that is significant because at this point, it shows they have no interest whatsoever in speaking to Washington. With the visit recently by Kim Jong-un to Russia to meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, he has made his diplomatic priorities very clear. Interesting as well that we hear from the US side that they don't believe this is any kind of significant breakthrough. So we are seeing something a little different to what we have seen in the past with US detainees being sent back. There was no high profile visit. The general assumption is he would have been questioned significantly, extensively while in North Korea for the North Korean officials to hear anything that he may have known, although there is an assumption that he may not have known anything of significance or concern. But of course, the North Koreans would have debriefed him extensively to find out anything. And potentially, they knew as much as they thought he knew and then they wanted him to go home.",

On the political front, he's facing near total isolation.At least 30, at this point, of his fellow Democrats in the Senate are now calling on him to resign. That is more than half of the caucus.

If you look at the timeline of the relationship between Bob Menendez and his wife, and then we look at some of the wrongdoings here, the alleged wrongdoings, February 2018, they start dating according to this indictment. Shortly thereafter, Nadine Menendez informs Will Hanna, who's also indicted here, that she's dating the senator. Just by the next month, they're arranging dinners and meetings without staff between the senator and Egyptian officials. What questions does that raise for you about the possible scenarios here of whether she is being exploited, she is being used to exploit him, she is exploiting him? I mean, what do you think?",

Because there is a concern here based off these factual allegations in the indictment. If she was being exploited, if she was ultimately using this as a means to advance her own interests at the expense of her husband, that's going to come up at some point. If you think about past corruption trials that have involved spouses, think back to Bob McDonald in Virginia a number of years back. His lawyers ultimately sort of threw his co-defendant wife sort of under the bus, basically pushing all the blame onto her.Now it didn't ultimately hurt him in the end because of the Supreme Court ruling that former President Donald Trump likes to talk about. But that is where this could very well go, depending on how this proceeds towards trial, that there may be a legal split between these two co-defendants, despite the fact that they're husband and wife.",

The next month, you have Hannah, who is paying, having his company pay $23,000 to bring her mortgage current. The company earlier in the year had obtained a monopoly on halal food exported from the U.S. to Egypt, which Nadine texted the senator about at the time, saying, quote, it might be a fantastic 2019 all the way around.

They came from modest, usually working class or middle class means.And so once they start facing this issue of potential financial issues of their own, they're at particular risk. Now, there are always those, you know, we've seen this throughout history. We're willing to sell the integrity of the office anyways. But for the remainder of public officials and their spouses, there needs to be a better system in place. There's got to be better guidance on what to do, recognizing the exposure these individuals have to not only individuals in the United States who want to exploit them, but foreign influences such as what we had here.",

There are going to be public officials who will be willing to sell the dignity of their office like that.But that does going back to what I was saying, that does go to this larger point.
