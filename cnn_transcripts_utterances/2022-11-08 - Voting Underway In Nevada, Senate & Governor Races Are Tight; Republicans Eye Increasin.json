So people are sort of primed for that language. To come back to your point earlier, I think it's interesting to watch a candidate like Bolduc in New Hampshire, who has kind of done the post-primary pivot, who made more of an effort to say let's not talk about 2020 so much, it's really about the economy. I think that speaks to the fact that Democrats were not able to change this into a race that was a referendum on Trump.
