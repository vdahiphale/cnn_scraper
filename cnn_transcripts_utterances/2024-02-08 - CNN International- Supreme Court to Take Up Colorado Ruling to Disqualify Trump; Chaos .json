It says no American who's engaged in an insurrection shall hold any public office. Colorado's decision referring to Trump's role in the January 6th insurrection three years ago.

Instead, he is vowing total victory. NETANYAHU (through translator): Surrendering to Hamas' delusional demands would not lead to freeing hostages. It would just invite another massacre. DIAMOND (voice-over): The latest Hamas position outlines three phases, each lasting 45 days. It's Beginning with the release of women, children, sick and elderly hostages, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, an intensification of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza's population centers, in line with a prior Israeli framework. But Hamas' proposal also calls for the release of all Palestinian prisoners detained since October 7th, a non-starter for Israel. Phase two would see the release of all male hostages and soldiers, as well as the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. Dead bodies from both sides would be returned in phase three.
