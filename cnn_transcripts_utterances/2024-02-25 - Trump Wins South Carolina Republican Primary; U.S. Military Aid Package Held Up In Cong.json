They had hope that a resounding win in South Carolina filed following three other resounding wins would help bring Republicans off the fence, would help bring in some of those holdout donors and would also potentially put pressure on Haley to drop out. But as that isn't the case, I am told that they're going to start having conversations about how to expand their campaign staff, particularly in these critical swing states. And we're talking about states like Michigan, Georgia, Arizona. I'm also told that there has been a number of efforts to try to get Donald Trump, who is still completely annoyed that Nikki Haley is staying in the race, to focus his ire on President Joe Biden.

According to exit polls in South Carolina, well over 85% of Donald Trump voters in South Carolina say they are part of the MAGA movements.Meanwhile, more than 85% of his voters are calling themselves very conservative. About 75% of Trump voters in the state are white evangelical or born-again Christians, a higher share of the electorate than in either Iowa or New Hampshire. And most South Carolina GOP primary voters like their chances in November, regardless of who's nominated.

That's a larger gap than she had in New Hampshire. And she did come into the state saying we have to do better. But she also never promised a victory for her supporters in South Carolina.

There was some effort to get people who didn't vote in the Democrat primary to vote in this primary and get those people to vote specifically for Nikki Haley, presumably more moderate voters, or even liberal voters who simply don't like Donald Trump.

Those targets included weaponry used by the Houthis, underground storage facility for that weaponry, radar sites, and more. The goal here, as it has been now for several months, is to try to degrade and disrupt the ability of the Houthis to attack commercial vessels. These attacks carried out by aircraft and perhaps other assets as well. In this statement we saw from the coalition that took part in this, that includes the U.S., the U.K., Canada, the Netherlands, Bahrain, and others, it specifically lists some of the ships that were hit recently, including the Rubymar. That's a ship associated with the U.K. that's now anchored in the Red Sea. It is apparently the first ship whose crew had to be rescued and abandoned ship. Because it was struck by a Houthi attack, it has now left an 18-mile oil slick as it poses an environmental hazard and sits there because U.S. officials say it's not safe enough to go rescue it because of the threat of more attacks from the Iran-backed rebel group. Part of the challenge here is that U.S. officials have acknowledged the ongoing strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, the attempts to degrade their weaponry and take some of that away, have been unsuccessful and haven't changed the Houthi's direction here. They continue to launch these attacks. And what makes it difficult is that the U.S. doesn't have a great sense of how much more weaponry and equipment the Houthis have. That's because Iran continues to try to resupply them. Still, the Biden administration has made clear, as has the Pentagon, that if the attacks on commercial vessels in one of the world's most critical waterways continue, so too will the U.S. strikes and the U.K., as we now here see this fourth round of coalition strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

The three-time all- star scoring 20 of his team high 30 points in the first half in New York. Former Knick Kristaps Porzingis terrorizing his old team scoring 22. It's a 116-102 win for Boston, extending their league best record in a 40 to 45 and 12. Now, Knicks, on the other hand, they've fallen to fourth in the East, and they've now lost six of their last eight games with injuries plaguing several of their top players in recent weeks. It was a magical finish to the Magic-Pistons game, tied with just seconds to go. Paolo Banchero hitting a circus shot to win the game with just eight-tenths of a second left on the clock. The 21-year-old was battling illness and struggled all night, but he came up clutch and was overcome with emotion afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
