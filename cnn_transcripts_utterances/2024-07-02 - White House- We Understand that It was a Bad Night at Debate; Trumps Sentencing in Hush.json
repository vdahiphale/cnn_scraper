That's what they're trying to figure out.

That they have a dependency on the top of the ticket and an urgency from their perspective to make sure Donald Trump doesn't get a second term in the White House.

That is to give him time to consider Trump's effort to try to overturn the conviction in light of yesterday's Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.Trump's team had asked for a delay of the sentencing and a briefing schedule so they could make these legal arguments about presidential immunity, questioning some of the evidence that had been entered into the case, either testimony about Oval Office meetings, things that could potentially be considered official acts and that could be excluded or should have been excluded under this new Supreme Court decision. Now, the prosecutors today said that they didn't oppose postponing the sentencing. The judge said that he would postpone it, now setting a date of September 18th instead of next Thursday. And he also agreed to a briefing schedule. Now, he said that he would issue his opinion on presidential immunity on September 6th. And then he said that the sentencing would take place on the 18th. He set that date for the imposition of the sentence, if such is still necessary or any other proceedings. So at this point now, we're looking at Donald Trump not facing a potential sentencing in this case until September. Of course, the issue before the judge will be presidential immunity, whether the Supreme Court's decision affects the conviction in this case in any way. Trump's team is asking for that to be overturned or a new trial. So depending on which way the judge rules, if he does find in favor of the prosecution, then Trump's sentencing will follow in September. Trump's lawyers, of course, are planning to appeal all of this to New York's highest court -- Pam, Brianna.",

He had sort of tried to raise it at the last minute before the trial started in New York, saying that some of the evidence in the case, you know, tweets he had done, press remarks he had made during his time as president that were related to this issue, the stories that came out, should be excluded under the concept of immunity.I don't think this ever goes anywhere. I don't see any reason to believe that even the furthest reach of the majority's opinion in the Trump ruling will require a new trial, would have excluded the evidence. But the judge wants to take it seriously. That's fine. It should. It's a legitimate constitutional concern. Certainly is worthy of a full briefing and consideration. But here's the one downside for Donald Trump. Now, if he gets sentenced, especially if he gets sentenced to jail time, that's coming down in September.

That gives the judge more than a month to craft a ruling and analyzing how he's going to address it. Obviously, if he's going to declare the trial vacated and order a new trial based off the immunity ruling, that throws out any sentencing.But assuming he rejects Trump's effort, that certainly gives him enough time to consider what the federal judge originally looked at this on when Donald Trump tried to have the case removed. The federal court certainly allows Judge Merchan to consider the extent to which effectively Donald Trump waived this issue at that federal removal action.

There is no part of Article 2 that deals with issuing press statements about a hush money payment or writing or signing checks while in the Oval Office tied to your private business as part of a hush money deal.That would be at best for Donald Trump, part of the outer reach of his executive authority, if not just strictly personal activities.
