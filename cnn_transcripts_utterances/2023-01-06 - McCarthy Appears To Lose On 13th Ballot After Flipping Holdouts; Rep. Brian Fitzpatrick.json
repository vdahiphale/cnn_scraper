There are individual members who are going to go off the reservation from time to time. But I'm telling you guys -- Karen, I think you raise a fair point about January 6th. It needed to be investigated but there's a range of stuff that needs to be investigated. The border, Afghanistan, as David said, inflation. There are COVID questions.

Big day for the McCarthy team. Fifteen flips so far I believe, is that right? Fifteen individuals who had not been voting for Kevin McCarthy now voting for Kevin McCarthy. You're still a few votes short. First, a matter of math. Does McCarthy need 216 votes or 217 votes to win? My understanding is with Democratic Congressman David Trone having come back to the House after his medical procedure this morning it might be 217? REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK (R-PA): Yes. So just view it as a fraction, so for every two numbers that come off the denominator, 435, one comes off the numerator of 218. If 434 voting, that's how many we have here, the number is still 218. If that goes down by one it goes to 217, drops another two, through present votes or absences, goes to 216. Keep in mind, we have two members on the Republican side that we're missing this morning on their way back now.",
