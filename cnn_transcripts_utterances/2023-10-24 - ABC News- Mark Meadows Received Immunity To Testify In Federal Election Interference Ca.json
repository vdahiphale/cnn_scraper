But I want to start, tonight, with some ominous breaking news, for Donald Trump. I'm not even talking about how a third former lawyer of his, just took a plea deal, in the State of Georgia, earlier today, which Jenna Ellis did do, in a courtroom, through tears. We'll get more on that in a second. But according to a new report, tonight, Special Counsel, Jack Smith, has secured what would be his most valuable witness yet, in the federal election interference case, against the former President. His final Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows. ABC News is reporting, tonight, that Meadows has been granted immunity and has met with Smith's team, at least three times, this year alone, including once, before a federal grand jury, while he had that immunity. According to ABC, Meadows allegedly told investigators, he did not believe the election was stolen, and that Trump was quote, being \"Dishonest,\" when he claimed victory, after the polls closed, in November of 2020. His attorney told CBS News that that story was, in his words, largely inaccurate. He did not say what he believed was inaccurate. But for more, on this breaking news, and what it could mean, I want to bring in CNN's Political Analyst, and the New York Times Senior Political Correspondent, Maggie Haberman; and also our CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig, who are both here with us. And I should note, Maggie, CNN has not confirmed this reporting yet. This is from ABC News. But if this is the case, if Mark Meadows did get this level of immunity, and he's there, testifying, how devastating do you think that would be for Donald Trump?",

And it tells you that he knows what he has to do, when he's in legal peril. I don't know what it means, because I don't totally understand the description of the type of conditions, he was testifying under. I don't know, whether immunity is being used colloquially, or whether there is something that is more tailored, such as in a proffer offer. I just don't know.

We're not going to use what you tell us here today against you.\" It's the feeling-out stage. The next level up is what we call immunity. That would be formal immunity, where you say, \"OK. We prosecutors are interested in what you have to say. We think it's truthful. We think it's important. You've taken the Fifth,\" because you don't want to testify. The way we overcome that is we say, as prosecutors, \"OK, we're going to go to a court order -- and get an order from a judge, giving you immunity,\" meaning, \"You will testify fully, and we will not use your testimony against you. And for all practical purposes, we will not prosecute you.\" And then, the top level is if you think the person has participated, in a crime, and has to be charged accordingly, then you enter into what we know is a full cooperation agreement, meaning, again -- we're going to use you, Kaitlan, sorry.

The terrorist in the audio claims to be calling from the phone of a woman that he had just murdered. This audio was played today, by Israel's Foreign Minister, at the United Nations. I should note, CNN cannot confirm the veracity of the audio. But it is part of this push, by Israeli officials, to remind the world, of the heinous acts, that happened that day.

There is another way around us.And it's interesting that you mentioned a segment that appeared right before mine, because I thought it was an interesting juxtaposition, of all the buildup, and all the violence that is in the pipeline, and then all the human beings, whose lives are being reduced to nothing, all while being vilified and dehumanized, for no other reason than simply existing. I was talking to a friend of mine, earlier. And I said to him, the only way we could make sense of this, the only way we could rationalize it, is by accepting the awful presumption that Palestinians are not human. This is where we're at. And we are appealing, for our humanity, and our very existence, beyond the politics, and beyond all the discussions and the debates that are taking place. This is very existential to us.

But they can't necessarily get it.Right now, House Republicans are huddled, again, behind closed doors, trying to sort this out. This comes after another episode of internal chaos. The third nominee, for Speaker, has failed. And so, Tom Emmer, dropped out of the race. And joining me now is CNN Capitol Hill Reporter, Melanie Zanona, who I'm imagining has crossed out a lot of names. I mean, Melanie, some of the names that I'm looking at now, it's like \"Wait, who, which one is this?\" I mean, they've like run through the entire roster of House Republicans, it feels like.",

It's outrageous. We're very upset. The calls we're getting, and everything else. They just feel like we can't manage. REP. MIKE GARCIA (R-CA): Just get it done. Like, honestly, at this point, it's been the same theme for a week. REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL): This is beyond frustrating. We need to get our act together, as we say, in the army, get our head out of our rear. My fear is if we keep doing this, somebody is going to end up siding with the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're going to do some more roll call votes, to figure out, behind closed doors, whether Mike Johnson has 217.
