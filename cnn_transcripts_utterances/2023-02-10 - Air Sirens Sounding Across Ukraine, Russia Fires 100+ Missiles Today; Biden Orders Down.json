We're going to show you new video of the moment Ukraine intercepts some of these lethal missiles that we've obtained today.Plus, President Biden orders another high-altitude object flying over the United States to be shot down. This one flying at 40,000 feet, about the size of a car, making it a threat to commercial aircraft. What was it, and was it from China? And as Senator Kyrsten Sinema accuses George Santos of another lie, we're going to look at what work, if any, the congressman has been doing on Capitol Hill. A story you'll see first here OUTFRONT. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, under attack. Putin tonight in the midst of an all- out air assault. Air raid sirens sounding across Ukraine, to the dark of night. Officials warning that there is now a threat of drone strikes in and around the capital of Kyiv. Now explosions also right now are being reported inside the Russian occupied city of Melitopol. According to Ukraine, the number of missiles just today, more than 100 from Russia. Ukraine now successfully able, they say, to take out about two-thirds of the missiles, the rockets, the drones, all of this incoming barrage. And we actually have some new video to show you of the interceptions. Take a look at this. (VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)",

As you can see here, this one is coming down. And you see that all the way down after that interception. Today has been one of the largest barrages from Russia. And given this incoming offensive going on that Zelenskyy says is already in progress, it may be just the tip of the iceberg because Russia is ramping up that offensive. It is coming at great cost to Ukrainians and to Russians, hundreds of Russians dying every day. There are estimates that it's in the high hundreds. But we know at least hundreds. A Russian war correspondent today writing what he's hearing from Russians on the front line. The quote here -- again, this is a Russian war correspondent, so state television. The quote is, the mobilized men from one region of Russian Federation, I don't want to name them, I'm ashamed of my almost countrymen, refused to go into battle. Right? So it's clear where he stands, but there is that admission that there are some Russians now refusing to fight. And it comes on the heels of new video of Russians being attacked by other Russians. I want to show it to you. This video is from the Russian regional government of Tuva because they're angry at what they say is happening to their fighters who are from the region north of Mongolia. You see what appears to be soldiers on the ground being attacked. They say they were shot at. We first told you about these men earlier this week because they claim the Russian military was shooting at them with machine guns, killing their own. So there are more and more stories like this. And the Russian state media are saying that there are people who are refusing to go fight.

This, according to Northern Command and NORAD was picked up just yesterday. President Joe Biden gave the order to shoot it down this morning. And at about 1The reason I'm so specific on the type of aircraft and the type of missile is because that is exactly what was used to shoot down the Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina. But it may be that that's where the similarities end in this case. This object, and it's only being called an object at this point by the Pentagon and the White House, was significantly smaller. They estimate about the size of a small car. It didn't appear to have any surveillance capabilities, according to a U.S. official. And it's unclear if it had any sort of propulsion or any sort of engine that made it go in this case. So we don't know much more about this object. And we don't exactly know where it came from, who launched it, who made it, or anything else really about it right now. We're waiting for more updates from NORAD in this case. It was shot down about ten miles off the coast of Alaska. The water there is frozen, it is within U.S. territorial air space and sovereign territory. But we don't yet know if they've been able to recover it to pick it up, to figure out what it is, or where it came from. So, at this point a lot more questions than we had at this point than we did with the Chinese balloon after that one was shot down. We will certainly keep you posted.",

We're going to be checking in with Oren over these next few hours.The incident comes as the Chinese try to beat the U.S. in a new battlefield called near space, the area within 60 miles above the earth's surface, and China wants to dominate it. And as we've seen from the spy balloon, maybe they are. Will Ripley is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): China's new superpower battlefield, 12 to 60 miles above the earth, too low for satellites, too high for most jets. The stratosphere, or, as China calls it, near space. In 2018, the Chinese military's official newspaper said near space has become a new battlefield in modern warfare. More than a decade ago, Felix Baumgartner's freefall jump from near space captivated the world and may have caught the attention of Chinese President Xi Jinping. As early as 2014, he ordered China's air force to speed up air and space integration and sharpen their offensive and defensive capabilities. He prioritized development of hypersonic weapons, solar-powered drones, and high-altitude balloons, all designed for near-space flight in the stratosphere's thin air. China's not alone. The U.S. and others are jumping into the near space race. Back in 2012, a CNN camera captured the view from 100,000 feet on a high-altitude weather balloon. China's suspected spy balloon, which the Pentagon claims was carrying high-resolution cameras and electronic monitoring equipment, could've captured crystal-clear images of highly sensitive areas and monitored military communications, in some ways, outperforming China's advanced spy satellites.",

And I think the other piece of the news that's very significant is that this is in the hands are the possession of an aide to Trump. And that's something that a lot of lawyers have been looking for. Whether or not there would be a third party, so the key legal term is dissemination, not just that he returned the documents but they were disseminated to a third party.

They are saying they were terrified when the earthquake happened, but they're just glad that they are safe. God bless the souls of all those who died, he says. No parent can shield their child from this reality, surrounded by death and destruction. There's no escaping this nightmare. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Iskenderun, Turkey. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Eva's reporting comes as Santos faces growing scrutiny after CNN learned he was charged with theft and deception in Pennsylvania by 2017. Eva mentioning the checks. There were about nine of them totaling $15,000. They were written in his name to dog breeders in Amish county. A lawyer friend of Santos tells CNN that he eventually got the case dismissed. OUTFRONT now, Harry Sandick, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York. And, Harry, of course, Santos is now facing multiple investigations, right? This isn't just people saying he's a liar. These are real investigations. He's got an FBI probe into allegations he stole $3,000 that was intended to save a veteran's dying service dog. What does this allegation mean for him? HARRY SANDICK, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  So, I think each of these gets put on the pile of allegations, gets higher and higher. And in federal court, there's a rule, and it's the same rule in certain state courts, that if you've committed other bad acts, those can be used against you in other cases. And so I think his primary concern is probably the investigation into campaign finance fraud. That's a federal investigation. It's in his home district, the eastern district of New York. But all of these other allegations that your reporter was just talking about with you are potentially admissible against him to prove his intent, to prove that he's not someone who acted by mistake but someone who has repeatedly acted with fraudulent intent.",
