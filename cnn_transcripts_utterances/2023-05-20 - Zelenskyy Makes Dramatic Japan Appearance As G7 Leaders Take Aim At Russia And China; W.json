The President said that he was not at all concerned about the state of negotiations, basically describing this sort of kind of stalling as you said there, Amara, as just a part of normal negotiations.Obviously on Friday, we saw kind of a whiplash movement at the capitol where we saw negotiators hit a snag, take a pause, leave the room kind of frustrated saying that no progress is being made. Ultimately, they got back in the room had a candid conversation, according to people inside of that room, but then left, as you said, with no indication that there was a deal or no indication of when they could meet again. Still, President Biden said that he wasn't concerned about this. But of course, we're hearing deep frustrations among people on both sides of the aisle here in Washington, including from person and owns White House Communications Director -- communications director Ben Lebow, who said this, in a statement really slamming Republicans, he said Republicans are taking the economy hostage and pushing us to the brink of default, which is -- which could cost millions of jobs and tipped the country into recession after two years of steady job and wage growth. There remains a path forward to arrive at a reasonable bipartisan agreement if Republicans come back to the table to negotiate in good faith. So there we go, kind of a demonstration of that frustration, saying that they believe that that path is still available. They said that repeatedly on Friday after those negotiations kind of stalled and broke down a bit. But again, they believe that Republicans have to come to the table on the Republican side, of course, there is a lot of frustration about the fact that they believe that the White House won't move off their talking points when it comes to spending caps and spending overall for fiscal year 2024. Now, of course, there are still a long, long way to go here. And the fact of the matter is, is that even though President Biden describes these kinds of stallings as the natural ebb and flow of these major type negotiations, the time just isn't there. Remember, June 1st is that possible X date where the country could default the first time ever in the nation, bringing about as the White House has said repeatedly, really catastrophic outcomes when it comes to the economy, people's jobs, people's money, and therefore they don't really have the time to come negotiate back and forth with these pauses and stops. Ultimately, both sides want to see a deal they say, and so it's going to take them coming back to the table to do so. But of course, when that happens is unknown at the moment, Victor and Amara.",

And it really points to the needle, though, that he's trying to thread. What the White House's strategy is going to be, Amara, is to try and make it so that a few Republican votes fall off of the House bill that was passed by McCarthy, and that they'll need Democratic votes in order to shore it up and get to a final deal. So it's a very particular very meticulous process of trying to find some places where, for example, the Republican budget calls for slashing support for renewable energy. While there are some Republicans were not going to go along with that, especially in the Midwestern states, where they're using, you know, biogas and other kind of, you know, ethanol, other kinds of renewable energy projects where they do want some of that federal money and they're not necessarily going to support the budget. So they're going to have to go sort of program by program, but big broad entitlement programs like Medicaid, food stamps, you know, work requirements, as you just described, that's just not going to happen.",

You can make a list as long as a phonebook soldiers, medical personnel, Ukrainian personnel, Ukrainian soldiers, we do not know how many people he put at risk. The government has said if you disclose this information, you put the United States at serious risk. And the defendants' response was I don't give a expletive. Now, Teixeira's family has also put out a statement saying that they are disappointed about the outcome, but they are going to continue their steadfast support of Jack Teixeira.

      "sentences": "Yes, Victor, good morning to you. I think it's troubling and very problematic for a number of reasons. The first reason is the obvious one, right? We're a country that values very much the First Amendment protections. What does that mean? The right to express yourself, the right to have access to information, the right to have a forum in which to have that access.So that's the first thing. And then you pivot to the other things, is that certainly, we can have the discussion, Victor, as to there being limitation with respect to the First Amendment. Can't yell fire in a movie theater, right? You can't defame someone. So there are limitations, then you get to the third issue as to whether or not this goes too far. You already indicated that there are about half the states that banned TikTok on government devices. You can argue that, that potentially, right, is legal and lawful. Why? Because it's narrowly tailored to an important government objective, the legal and privacy concerns as we look there with respect to the different bans in different parts of the country. The issue with this is, does it go too far? Last point to your question, you know, in the event that you have certain foreign interests that you want to protect states from, that's an important governmental objective. The issue here though, is whether or not there are specific identifiable things the Chinese government is doing that we could point to and say we're fighting against that, not just an abstract concept with respect to the Chinese government potentially spying upon people. I think that, that in and of itself is troubling.",

      "sentences": "So what ends up happening is that the government has to be careful with respect to what it is attempting to regulate, right? Let's start there. In the event that you're looking, and as a government, to try to ban speech, you have to ban speech and it has to be predicated upon some compelling and important governmental objective.Now, you can argue that certainly spying is an important governmental objective if you could touch and identify specifically, what the government is doing. In the event that you can't, you just cannot preempt speech and decide to ban it outright prior to actually people actually accessing the information or having the ability to express themselves. To the extent that you're trying to preempt the ability to access or otherwise express, that becomes troubling and problematic. You know, we saw that with the Pentagon papers and the release and attempt to not get that to be published, et cetera, back in an era of Nixon. So whenever you're dealing with something that relates to the First Amendment that you just have to be very careful, tilter it to an important and compelling government objective and make sure that there's identifiable specific targets and information that you do, and even when you do that it has to be limited. Last point, tottering back to what we discussed early and with regard to the government bans, right? Half the governments or half the states banning it on TikTok on government devices, security concerns, et cetera. But private devices, the argument is going to be that, that goes a bit too far.",

Now, Brown retired at the height of his playing days at 30 years old to concentrate on his acting and social activism. He appeared in more than 50 films, starring in the World War II action movie \"The Dirty Dozen\". Jim Brown, a leader, a legend, 87 years old. All right, to basketball we go.

Butler finishing with 27 points. Now Jayson Tatum had 34 points through the first three quarters, but then went over three, two turnovers in the fourth, Miami shocking that Boston crowd, winning again 111-105. It's taken two games to now lead in that series. Now Brittney Griner meanwhile playing in her first WNBA game in 579 days last night. She along with her Phoenix Mercury teammates getting a little pep talk by Vice President Harris before the game. The eight- time all star receiving a standing ovation from the crowd as she was introduced, then Griner right away making her first jumper. She played pretty good, 7 for 9 from the field, scored 18 points, her Mercury though would lose to the Sparks 94-71 in that one, guys. But pretty incredible --",
