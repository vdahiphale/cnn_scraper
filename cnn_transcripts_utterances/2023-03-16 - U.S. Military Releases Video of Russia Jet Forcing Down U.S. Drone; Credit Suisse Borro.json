As you can see, Poppy and Don are in New York.We're going to begin this hour with breaking news, because minutes ago we just got dramatic new video from the Pentagon, released by the military, where you can see a Russian fighter jet as it was approaching the back of the American drone that has now been down for about 4,000 to 5,000 feet in the Black Sea. In this video that has just been released moments ago, you can see where the Russian fighter jet is going up to this American drone. It is dumping fuel on it. That's what you're seeing on the video as it's approaching here. Then the jet goes away. It comes back and dumps more fuel. And then it hits the American drone. It clips the drone, one of the Russian fighter jets did. That is when you see the color bars there. Ultimately, of course, this is what led up to the downing of this drone that we have been following all week since this happened. This interaction that happened on Tuesday, we are told, lasted for over half an hour. Now, of course, that U.S. drone was forced to be downed in the Black Sea. General Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, says its about four to 5,000 feet beneath the water. The Russians are actively trying to retrieve it right now, amid questions about what they could glean from it, if they do. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is live at the Pentagon with more. Natasha, I mean, just watching this video is amazing, in and of itself. To see these two Russian fighter jets come up to this American drone, this Reaper drone, dump fuel on it, clip it that has led to this dramatic escalation.",

Let's remember what the Russians have been saying about this incident.The Russians have been insisting that that fighter jet, the Russian fighter jet did not ever make contact with that drone. Well, now we can see that the video really does belie that explanation. We're seeing that the fighter jet actually comes up extremely close to the drone. You're watching it right there. Starts releasing a lot of jet fuel, as U.S. officials had said it did. It hits that drone. That is when the camera footage goes out. And then when the camera footage reappears, you can see that the propeller of that drone is damaged. And that is exactly the sequence of events that U.S. officials had laid out, calling this behavior by the pilots extremely reckless and dangerous. I mean, this is just really remarkable. This is something that is so unusual to see. Because usually, when these fighter jets intercept these drones, they kind of just fly alongside them. And this fighter jet did do that. It flew beside this drone for about 30 to 40 minutes before actually speeding up right next to the drone, as you saw there, and starting to dump jet fuel on it. That is the moment when U.S. officials say they realized that something was really, really wrong here. As we have seen over the last couple days, U.S. officials have made really, really strict protests to the Russians about this incident, saying that it is completely unacceptable, that it could have endangered the pilots, of course, of that fighter jet, and of course, that it violates the U.S.'s right to conduct these kinds of surveillance missions over the Black Sea and over international waters and over international air space. But again, this just really -- it really belies the Russian explanation for what happened here. Again, they had insisted that the Russian fighter jet did not hit that drone. But you can see pretty clearly, right after that footage goes out, when the camera goes out, that the propeller is damaged. That really could have only been done by an impact from that plane, Kaitlan.",

And I think underscores the very palpable concern you heard from U.S. officials, that this is a different level of escalation. These intercepts, in and of themselves, are not rare. That is rare.

Yes, it looks like the way the Russian aircraft, the SU-27, is coming into the drone, it's very deliberately going after the drone. And when you see the video, and you see it come through the right here, you look at -- you look at the way it's appearing in the camera from the Reaper, from the MQ-9, and comes up really close. And then you see the propeller. It looks normal at this point in time. But when you look at the propeller afterwards, you will see the bent blade. And that is very clearly a deliberate act. The way this aircraft is coming into the drone, and you see that bent blade right there. You know, clearly something hit it and it had to be some kind of an impact. And I don't think, you know, while the fuel spill on top of the -- on top of the aircraft, on top of the MQ-9 would have been significant, I don't think it would have caused that damage without there actually being metal-on-metal contact.",

The bigger question is, does it make the -- if President Trump can focus on Trump and get 30 percent or 35 percent in the primary, does something like this drive the 5 to 6 percent he would need to really get things over the top away?
