The numbers show the crisis at the border is worse than it's ever been during the Biden administration. Here are the numbers. One of the highest spikes of border crossings during the Trump years was in 2019, about 975,000 or so, or you're seeing in 2019, 851,000 people. But after 2020, after Joe Biden took office, those numbers have doubled every year since. And, of course, we're in just the beginning of 2024, but very, very high numbers. Do you think that the administration should shoulder some of the blame?",

And that is, not the necessary resources to have enough border patrol agents or what we call Custom and Border Protection, who are the persons who process individuals, or the resources of courts and the mechanism of the asylum process. And so it has slowed down the drive of cartels to drive migrants toward the border with false information. We've never had the highest degree of misinformation and disinformation to suggest to individuals fleeing horrible abuse and persecution from their countries.We just heard of the high rates of gang violence in Ecuador and other places. That has driven people out of fear of their lives to the border. But yet we have not been able to get Republicans to sit down and address some of the laws that need to be put in place and the resources that need to be put in place for the Biden administration's -- how should I say it, apparatus to go forward. Secretary Mayorkas will do everything to abide by the existing laws. But the existing laws are not in place. We have not passed real immigration reform to address the question of the surge toward our southern border. And if we look at the world worldwide, over these last couple of years we've seen the same surge of migration in other parts of the world. It is a phenomenon that is happening, and each country must address it with the necessary resources. We have that ability, but we don't have the cooperation of Republicans who have stood in the way. Every step that we have tried to move forward, they've taken ten steps backwards. And they know that they're doing it only for revenge of what legitimately happened to President Trump for interfering with the 2020 election and for the January 6, 2021, insurrection that occurred.",

And those are likely Iranian-backed militia groups in Syria, near the Jordanian base where these service members' lives were lost. Our hearts go out to them. These were three reservists from Georgia. As you know, reservists and guards members get these assignments and they're pulled away from their jobs and pulled away from their families to go help defend our country. And we all need to keep their families in our prayers.But the most likely response would be directly against those who engaged in this drone attack. And the U.S. normally has pretty good intelligence about where these attacks are coming from. So, the president is going to calculate it. The secretary said we will - we will make sure that there's accountability but at a time and place and manner of our choosing. You don't want to tip anybody's hand or predict what's going to happen, but I think that's the most likely response.",

And that's -- that debate is what lets the American public see what's at stake and make their own decisions about whether it's worth it or not. I happen to believe that getting the U.S. involved in another war in the Middle East would be a very bad idea. I think if we would have learned anything from 2001 to 2021, it's that wars in the Middle East with the U.S. participation cause us a loss of blood and treasure without really gaining us anything. Not even gaining us friends. We're usually not appreciated for what we do, and we usually don't alter the equation for the good. So, you know, I have colleagues who are calling for the U.S. to engage in military action inside Iran against the Iranian government. If they feel that, they should put that on the floor and let's have a debate and vote about it. But we shouldn't stumble or slide our way into another war in the Middle East without congressional, robust debate and vote.",
