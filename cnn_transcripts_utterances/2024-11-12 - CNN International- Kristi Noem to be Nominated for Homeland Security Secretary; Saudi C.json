Sources tell CNN Donald Trump is likely to pick Marco Rubio to serve as his Secretary of State. Eight aid organizations say Israel has not met the criteria set by the U.S. for improving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. And Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman accuses Israel of carrying out collective genocide in the Enclave. Well, it's 09:00 a.m. in New York. The stock market there will open about 30 minutes from now. The futures markets indicating a pretty flat open back there at half past this hour. Well, one week after Election Day, Donald Trump busy filling out key positions in his second administration, and they all appear to have one thing in common. They are above and beyond everything else loyal to Donald Trump. Topping the list is Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Sources tell CNN he will be named Secretary of State. Trump and Rubio have had a complicated relationship, but Rubio has evolved into a staunch Trump supporter. There's a look at some of Trump's appointments or expected picks so far. They include Congressman Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as Homeland Security Secretary. For more, I want to bring in Senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak. Let's have a look at what we know today about who may make up this cabinet of people around Donald Trump. What do they tell us about what Trump is prioritize -- sorry, prioritizing, certainly in terms of foreign policy, Kevin?",

Today is the 30-day deadline for Israel to meet U.S. set criteria to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza or face a potential reduction in American military aid. Eight aid groups say Israel has not only failed to meet U.S. conditions. Its military has taken steps to make the situation worse, these agencies, say. And what could be seen as a face-saving measure, the IDF today announced the opening of a new humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza. Kylie Atwood joining me. Kylie, you've been doing much of the reporting on this for CNN, all of this happening just ahead of a meeting at the White House today between President Biden and Israel's President. What can we expect at this point? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen U.S. officials have said they're not going to get ahead of any action that they may or may not take when it comes to ramifications for Israel with regard to this letter. Now, just to remind folks, as you were saying, this is a letter that the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense sent to the Israeli counterparts 30 days ago. Today, saying that Israel had 30 days to live up to these criteria that the U.S. was laying out for them in terms of what they could do to actually improve the situation on the ground, humanitarian wise in Gaza, because clearly, there wasn't enough being done by their Israeli counterparts. And what we're learning this morning is that the pressure on the Biden Administration to actually take action and to potentially put ramifications into place for Israel are very real. These eight humanitarian and aid organizations are saying that Israel has just blatantly not lived up to the criteria that the U.S. laid out in that letter. I want to read to you a portion of this report that these humanitarian and aid organizations put out saying, quote, Israel not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in northern Gaza. They go on to say that there weren't adequate humanitarian pauses, that Israeli attacks on humanitarian sites continued in the last 30 days, that there were multiple humanitarian aid workers, about four of them at least, who died in the last 30 days because of Israeli attacks. So, they are putting pressure on the Biden Administration to actually take action, because they are saying that Israel hasn't lived up to these demands. Now, when it comes to what the Biden Administration has threatened, they could potentially do. They said that if Israel doesn't demonstrate a continued commitment to taking these actions, to making the situation on the ground in Gaza better. There could be, in the words of this letter, there may be implications when it comes to U.S. policy that relates to U.S. military sales to Israel, and so that's what we're watching for. Is the Biden Administration willing to potentially up end some of those military sales, military weapon flows from the U.S. to Israel, because Israel is not living up to the commitments that were laid out in this letter. We need to know exactly what the U.S. government's assessment is, and that's what we're waiting for at the end of today, maybe tomorrow, President Herzog, Israeli President is at the White House today. Yesterday, Ron Dermer, who is obviously Netanyahu's Top Adviser was at the State Department. So, this is an active discussion between the U.S. and Israel today on the day of the 30-day deadline.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think it's a very interesting perspective that we're getting here from Moscow.First of all, Volodymyr Zelenskyy also, once again, confirming that the Ukrainians say that it's around 50,000 Russian forces, including those North Koreans who are fighting on the south side of Russia, that are amassing there in the Kursk region to try and at some point, obviously, push the Ukrainians out of that area. And we do know also, from what we've seen in movements over the past couple of days that the Russians seem to be really concentrating those forces down there, getting ready for what could be quite a large push by the Russian military to then try and get those Ukrainian forces oust them, essentially from that area, Becky. It's something that the Russian President Vladimir Putin has said repeatedly that he wants to do, but he has also said in the past that he is in no rush to do that, because for the Russians, currently, they say that, once again, their operation in the east of Ukraine remains, really their main focal point. That does seem as though the Russians now more and more getting ready and seeming to be ready to launch that major push into the Kursk region to try and win that area back. It's unclear how much in the way the Ukrainians are going to be able to do to stop them. Certainly, we do know that the Ukrainians have formidable forces on their side of the front line there, that they are some of the most well trained, best forces that have been extremely successful in the past. But of course, 50,000 is definitely a very large force to contend with. And one of the interesting things that actually happened overnight is that North Korea ratified a mutual defense agreement with Russia, saying that if one of the two countries is attacked, that the other would spring to its side. So certainly, the cooperation that we're seeing between the Russians and the North Koreans, as far as military is concerned, and the military area definitely seems to be something that is moving forward. And certainly, it appears as though those North Korean troops that are now on the ground there in the Kursk Region, seem to be a sign of that military cooperation expanding between Russia and North Korea. It's also something that Vladimir Putin has said as well. And in general, right now, the Russians certainly believe that they are the ones who are on the offensive, who have the initiative, not just as far as Kursk could be concerned, but also, of course, in other places in the battlefield as well. And if we look at the broader picture, Becky, what we're hearing from Russians also is that many of them are quite optimistic about a Trump presidency, hoping that the war could come to an end and that it could come to an end on terms favorable for Russia, Becky.",

And certainly, behind closed doors, with visiting diplomats about the number, scale and scope of Palestinians, women and children figuring highly among them that Israel is killing in Gaza at the moment as they're targeting Hamas there. And I think this language here clearly the harshest so far. You have to sort of understand that this is -- and the Crown Prince will certainly understand that saying it now certainly gets President-elect Donald Trump's attention. But I think what the Saudis really seem to be expressing here is this frustration drawing a line, making it very clear where they stand on this issue, and not just the issue of what they describe as collective genocide. But on the issue that they see as a way to move forward in terms of a potential normalization of relations with Israel, which just isn't practical and realistic at the moment, they would say, because Israel's political leadership won't tolerate that, so that it's not possible. But they're also, again spelt out the terms there, sort of 1967 borders East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state. Things that they've said before the Crown Prince has put very clearly on the agenda again. And I think this also sort of bolsters his position and his standing in the region, because this is a collective position of almost 50 different leaders there in Riyadh.",

It is here both in the measurements of earth and sea surface temperatures. It is here in wickeder and wilder storms and unpredictable weathers and droughts and floods and fires around the world. We're seeing that, but getting every country, allies and enemies to agree. That's why the Paris accord was such a seminal moment in civilization and created real energy that you're seeing now in the low cost of wind and solar and battery storage that's happening. The question is, where we go from here, and whether this agreement can hold up, whether you can make good on the moral promise to lift up developing countries and prepare for the help them -- prepare with help from the richest countries.
