Election officials were working overtime right now to process hundreds of thousands of ballots, that could be critical and determining control of the United States Senate.Control of the House of Representatives also remains in limbo desire. The final outcome of the midterm election still undecided two days later. We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, with CNN's special coverage of \"Election Night in America Continued\". All eyes right now are on Nevada and Arizona, where the U.S. Senate contests remains undecided desire. Republicans hoping to oust two Democratic incumbents. The Democrats fighting back, and they're fighting back hurt. Every vote in those key contests will help determine the final balance of power in the Senate. Right now, Democrats hold 48 seats, Republicans have 49, two short of the 51 seats they need to retake Senate control. Turning to the state of play in the House of Representatives right now, Democrats have won 192 House seats. So far, Republicans have 209. That's nine seats short of 218 needed to reclaim the majority. Thirty- four House seats still haven't been decided. To White House Control, Republicans must win seven seats in competitive contests that are playing out right now. They are in a strong position to reach that goal, as they are currently leading in 11 races. Democrats meanwhile have a higher hurdle. They must win 21 competitive seats to hold on to the house. They are currently leading in 16 races. We're keeping a close watch on ballot processing at key locations, as we stand by for a new vote counts on these key races, and that includes the high stakes Arizona governor's race, where Democrat Katie Hobbs, is narrowly leading Republican Kari Lake, a die hard pro Trump election denier. Let's go to our correspondents right now in the key battleground and here in Washington, covering this truly historic midterm election. First, let's go to Kyung Lah. Kyung, give us an update on the vote counting their, and when we can expect some new numbers, some new results.",

The news conference from the board of supervisors as well as Maricopa County recorder Stephen Richer, basically laid out what things would look like in the next few days.Tonight, they anticipated that they would be releasing a few more. It's an approximate, right? This is -- this is -- they are going to release as many as they can, but approximately, 60,000 ballots tonight, data from 60,000 ballots plus. So, last night, it was 62,000. They anticipate it would be more tonight. Those ballots are from Friday night, Saturday and Monday. The so- called late early, mail-in ballots that may have been filled out but then were received before Election Day. So, not the ones that were drop off on Election Day, but ones that were received before Election Day. I will leave it to the partisans to decide who that will favor, but that is what we have been told by the board of supervisors and the county recorder. They also addressed exactly how many they could release in the days to come. It is going to be about the. Do the math yourself, this may take several days before they get the of the so-called late earlies, those ballots, whether they were before or on election day, because there are about 290,000 that were dropped off. So, that's what they had to go to. That's the target. It is a slow process. But it is slow, Wolf, because they're trying to do it accurately -- Wolf.",

It's not unexpected, even if these key races were not close in the state, that was the plan all along. [19Because of a Nevada law. If you sent out your mail-in ballot by Tuesday election day, it can arrive at the county election centers by Saturday. So they were always going to be counting until Saturday. We're in the Clark County election building. This is the largest county in the state, the most populated county in the state, it's also the most Democratic county in the state, so it's interesting and important vantage point. We were inside the building a short time ago to watch the tabulation. We're not allowed to take a live video because of security reasons. We're also not permitted to show the faces of the workers, a sad sign of the times, I suppose. But we're watching them tabulate, and here's what we know. There are at least 50,000 votes to be counted. They are all mail-in ballots that came from the postal service or from the drop boxes on election day, more than 300 drop boxes in this county. In addition to those 50,000, there's 5,500 provisional ballots that still need to be counted, 7,100 ballots that need to be cured. That means people sometimes don't sign a ballot. If they sign them, they're cured and they can be counted. So, there's the possibility of up to 62,000 ballots that will still be counted here in this county. We can tell you, mail-in used to be, you know, if you could not show up, maybe you send in your mail. Now it's the major way of voting in Clark County. And in the state, there's 1.8 million active registered voters. Each of them received a mail-in ballot, so a large number of people have been mailing in ballots. And yes, we do expect a major update in the totals within the next couple of hours -- Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Night three, election week in America, Gary and Kyung just leading out the new world we live, with so many mail-in ballots, especially the counts take longer, especially in states that have methodical way of doing it, both of those western states do.Where are we right now? This is why this is so important. We know, Wolf, that the Georgia Senate races going to a runoff. It's 50/50 when we woke up on election day. Right now, it's 49-48, right? So, the Republicans are leading there. That will give Republicans the 50, if they stay, right? Let's bring it up, let's bring it up and get their. There we go, a little slow today. Adam Laxalt is the Republican, he's ahead, 49.4 to 47.6. A remarkably close race in Nevada. This is what a significant, Gary, in Clark County, where the Democratic incumbent, Catherine Cortez Masto, is ahead in the county, narrowly ahead, five, six points there. But this is what's important, it's 74 percent of the population. That's where most of the outstanding ballots are. So, if Senator Masto is running a good lead there, running up -- in the continued ballots, she can catch up. Another significant since late last night, is that Washoe County, up here in the corner of the state, Reno, the rural areas above it, this is a swing county. Fifteen, a little more than 15 percent of the population. We'll see what percentage of the vote that translates into. Senator Masto was trailing in the swing county. She's now ahead. But, look, I say ahead, 48.8 to 48.6. That is the race we have in Nevada, incredibly close, why does those ballots are so important. Also important in the governor's race. The Republicans there have a bigger lead but critically important. And Kyung Lah watching a similar process play out in Arizona. Again, last night, Mark Kelly's lead was about 87, 000. It has grown to 98,255. So, Senator Kelly stretches his lead a bit, that's what you want, but you still have hundreds of thousands of votes outstanding there, Wolf. So, plenty of time to make it up. We're at 76 percent of the estimated vote. I just want to come out quickly this switch maps to understand the stakes here. You have to western Senate states uncounted, right? So, let's see where we are right now. Right now, we know that this is in December. This is where we stand. Let's just go with the state of play at the moment, right? Senator Kelly is leading there, then Republican challenger, Adam Laxalt is leading here. If everything state as it is, is zero guarantee of that with all these votes to count, but if everything stay as it is, 50 Republicans, 49 to Democrats, then that would control -- yet again, a Georgia runoff would determine control of the United States Senate, which is why the counts in both states are possible, because it is possible. If a Democrat comes back here, the Democrats already have a majority because of the vice president. Democrats only need 50, and that would be fight it out. But the flip side of that math is, if Republicans win the vote or out west, Republicans have the majority. So, these counts are critical. As we go forward, I want to go back to the map, this is where we are, at the scenario could play out in these two states or if they're split, then Georgia decides it all on December. BLITZER:  Good point. Arizona, critical, critical, critical right now. I want to bring in the Arizona assistant secretary of state, Allie Bones. Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us once again. How many -- first of all, how many outstanding votes are there in Arizona tonight, and what counties are you waiting on?",

Let's take a closer look right now. Lauren Boebert, she's slightly had a 50.2 percent to 48.8 percent, 98 percent of the estimated vote is in. She's got a lead of about 1,200 votes, at least right now. It's close over there. Let's check out another squeaker in California, where Republican John Duarte and Democrat Adam Gray are vying in the newly redrawn 13th district. You can see what is going on. Forty percent -- only 40 percent of the estimated vote is in. Duarte is ahead by 203 votes, 50.1 percent to 49.9 percent, a very close in that House contest right now. Also in California, Republican Ken Calvert is neck and neck right now with Democratic challenger, Will Rollins. Will Rollins with 49.8 percent, Ken Calvert, the Republican, with 50.2 percent, 41 percent, less than half -- only 41 percent of the estimated vote is in. Calvert is ahead by only 453 votes. Quite a few close races in the Golden State, as you can see. Democratic incumbent Katie Porter trying to beat back a challenge from Republican Scott Baugh. Take a look at this. Katie Porter 50.5 percent, Scott Baugh, 49.5 percent, 59 percent of the estimated vote, is now in. She's ahead right now by 1,552 votes. Let's take a look at the balance of power, where things stand right now in the battle for control of the House of Representatives. Remember, you need 218 for the majority in the House. Republicans right now have 209. They picked up 16 seats so far. Democrats have 192, they picked up four seats so far, 34 seats remain outstanding at this point right now. So here is the state of play in the house of representatives, where things stand. Democrats must win right now, 21 competitive seats, in order to maintain the majority. Republicans must win seven, seven competitive seats in order to gain a majority in the House of Representatives. Let's go over to John King at the magic wall. These races in the House of Representatives, they're very tight. It could be decided by a few hundred votes.",

Pennsylvania, you're going to see a trend here. Twenty-seven percent say, yes, they want to see Joe Biden run for president again, 69 percent say no.
