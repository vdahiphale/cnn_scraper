But you still have a prosecutor there were 46 percent of the gun arrests are dismissed with no penalty, no plea, no conviction.

How would they go into Taiwan? And clearly, they're going to have a superiority from the air and the sea. So those are the two assumptions that they'll make.

We would have to do that.So I'm not sure. The American president would have to decide at the time if we engage kinetically, because if we decide to use submarines, for example, and attack Chinese forces as they're coming into Taiwan, then what keeps China then from attacking us bases in the Pacific.

Number two, it could potentially become an armed operation where that would cause, again, a kinetic problem for the Chinese soldiers on the ground.But it also showed, the Discord leak showed that Taiwan lacks significant air defense capability at all. If there's one thing Ukraine has shown other countries is you better step up your air defense platforms, Patriot missiles and the like.

Reuters reported company's own shareholders have set their sights on Rupert Murdoch and Foxes board saying that they are poised to bring lawsuits against them for quote, \"Breaching their fiduciary oversight duties by failing to block the network's flawed reporting despite red flag warnings. It's red flag warnings.That is something that renowned Yale Professor, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld told CNN was likely to happen in email last month. And he wrote quote, \"Murdoch only controls 39 percent of the company. So, any of the 61 percent of shareholders can sue for misconduct, failure of management oversight, and conscious inadequate diligence. And Foxes legal troubles dun in there either. Voting technology company Smartmatic is suing Fox News in a defamation case worth $2.7 billion. That's over a billion more than what Dominion was initially seeking in damages. And the statement on Tuesday, Smartmatic's attorney saying this, \"Dominion's litigation exposed some of the misconduct and damage caused by foxes disinformation campaign. Smartmatic will expose the rest. Smartmatic remains committed to clearing its name, recouping the significant damage done to the company and holding Fox accountable for undermining democracy.\" According to The New York Times, Fox said this in response, \"We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial likely in 2025.\" Stay tuned.",
