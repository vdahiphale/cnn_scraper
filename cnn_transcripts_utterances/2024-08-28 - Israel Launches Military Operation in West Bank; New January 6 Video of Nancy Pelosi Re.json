      "sentences": "Good morning. You're live in the CNN NEWS CENTRAL. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this morning with special counsel Jack Smith not backing down and bringing a retooled January 6 case against former President Donald Trump in a new indictment. Federal prosecutors made some tweaks after the Supreme Court's controversial ruling giving former presidents -- Donald Trump immunity from prosecution for official actions he took while in office. But all four of the felony charges remain accusing Trump of attempting to defraud the government by obstructing the certification of the 2020 election and trying to strip voters of their rights, Trump calling Smith's action -- quote -- \"an act of desperation and ridiculous\" and he's demanding that the case be immediately dismissed. The new indictment underscores the immense personal significance of a Trump victory come this November. If he returns to the White House, he would have the authority to shut down this case and another federal case, the classified documents case against him. Let's bring in CNN's Alayna Treene. Alayna, what comes next with this indictment? And how is the Trump campaign responding?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, the Trump campaign is responding exactly the way that you would expect them to.Donald Trump had sent a series of posts on this last night, including into this morning, calling this a hoax, saying that this is election interference. He noted that early voting starts in just 10 days, I believe, on September 6. And so that's what they're saying about this, that Jack Smith and his team are using this as a way to interfere in the upcoming election, all the things we have heard him say repeatedly. Look, what comes next, I mean, I think there's a lot that still needs to be sorted out with this. And I think it's clear that Jack Smith's team is not backing down. Just because of that Supreme Court ruling does not mean that the indictment went away. They are arguing that many of those things that he did were not official acts, including having Mike Pence try pushing him to not certify those election results on January 6 of 2021. And so I think we're kind of back to where we were before with how the Trump campaign is responding. They're fund-raising off of this. I think you could have expected that, given that they have been successful in those efforts in the past. But this is going to continue to be a key line of attack for them. And it is something that we have seen has worked, at least with his base of voters. It's unclear how this will actually play with some of the more modern, independent-leaning voters that they're crucially targeting right now.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is -- it's still unclear exactly what had happened. I think what is clear is that both the cemetery, as well as Trump's campaign, say that there was some sort of incident that happened.And I'm told it was happening -- it was not during the wreath-laying ceremony, but when Donald Trump actually went to lay flowers at a burial site for some of the fallen soldiers who were killed during the Abbey Gate attack during the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Now, I'm going to read for you some of the back-and-forth from both sides. So Donald Trump's team has been circulating this letter that some members of those families have been sharing. It said -- quote -- \"We had given our approval for President Trump's official videographer and photographer to attend the event, ensuring these sacred moments of remembrance were respectfully captured and so we can cherish these memories forever.\" And, again, this is from some of the family members of some of those soldiers who were killed. Now, the cemetery -- and I think there's a difference here. Just because the families may have said that they had given their blessing does not mean that the cemetery did. And there is a federal law that prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within the Army national military cemeteries from engaging in some of this activity. According to a statement from the cemetery obtained by CNN, they wrote that it had \"reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants, which includes photographers, content creators or any other persons attending, for purposes or in direct support of a partisan political candidate's campaign.\" [11:05:12] OK, so I actually talked the -- I just got off the phone with a Trump adviser about some of this. I think there's a lot of he said/she said going on. It's very unclear. We do know that the Arlington National Cemetery has filed an incident report. We have to see how that will get resolved. But I mean, obviously, this is a very sensitive moment. It was a solemn moment. Did the Trump campaign perhaps overstep in what they were doing? I think we have to wait and see what happens when this report is filed.",

Joining me now, Republican strategist, Matt Gorman, CNN political commentator Jamal Simmons, and CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen. I should note Norm is outside counsel for the Democracy Defenders PAC. But, Norm, let's jump right into this. This is a superseding indictment. It replaces the old indictment. A different grand jury was used in this new indictment. What can you tell us?

And whatever you think of the Supreme Court's decision, which has been widely criticized for going too far and taking too long, there's now a distinction. Official conduct, Donald Trump can't be prosecuted. Unofficial conduct, personal conduct, campaign conduct, he can be. And what special counsel Jack Smith has done with this superseding indictment, a replacement indictment, is strip out anything that might be arguably official. For example, Donald Trump talks to his Department of Justice. Look, there's an argument. A president talking to DOJ, that's official. All of that is out of the original indictment. The -- out of 45 pages, there's now 36 left, so nine pages cut, 130 paragraphs of allegations, 106 left. But what remains is this scheme, tell lies to get fake electoral certificates and use those to pressure Mike Pence to recognize that the loser of the election was actually the winner. That guts of it is all political. It remains.",

And I got to tell you, when it comes down to it, I take John Kelly's word over this than Donald Trump from the incident at the previous cemetery, where Donald Trump was shown to say that he just didn't understand why people would make that kind of sacrifice. We heard him say himself that he thinks that the medal for the civilians is better than the medal for the troops.

But this explains why Donald Trump and his allies are in such a rage this morning. Jack Smith, with a new superseding indictment, less than 70 days away from the election, has reminded everybody Donald Trump is alleged to have engaged in very serious 2020 election interference. Will he do it again in 2024? He's been convicted of it, 34 counts of election interference and cover-up in Manhattan court in 2016, paying hush money to hide information from voters. And now Smith has reminded us this election is a referendum. Will Donald Trump be held accountable or not? So, very important move.",

And so what they're trying to do when they get down to Georgia, which is important, is they're trying to shave some of the margins in these rural counties that they're campaigning in, right? So 25 percent of these rural counties are African-American. So you think about Atlanta and Atlanta suburbs being the place where you campaign, but they're going to try to just tweak up those margins in some of those rural counties. So she's going to do an interview at the same time. And this interview with Governor Walz, which will happen in Georgia, which is an incredibly important state for them, will set some context. One of the things we have been talking about for the course of the last week is, you don't just do an interview just to do an interview when you're on a campaign. You do it because you have got something to say. You're trying to advance something that you want people to pay attention to. And I think they want people to pay attention to Georgia and to what they're trying to do in these rural counties, not just in Georgia, but in places like North Carolina, where 17 counties that Joe Biden won by more than 35 percent of the vote, they have got to get those margins up.",

Palestinian health officials say at least nine people have been killed. Video obtained by CNN shows bulldozers tearing up a road. You can see it right there.

And when you put all of that together with the fact that the IDF is mostly in Gaza or on the border with Lebanon, so you have less forces in the area, you see that this is another arena where the escalation is brewing.
