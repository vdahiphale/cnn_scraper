These are forced updates that come through over protocol configuration changes. There was no ability to stop this, this thing from actually happening. Our over reliance on third parties and how a lot of really large organizations are handling pretty much all of the data, all of our infrastructure, all of our critical infrastructure. I mean, I still know hospitals that are out energy companies that are still trying to recover. I mean, this is, you know, catastrophic in many ways. Our over reliance on these third parties are some of the biggest vulnerabilities that we have both from a cyber attack perspective, and the massive outage that we see today. And it could have been much, much worse. I mean, you know, think about it, if they couldn't recover, if it hit critical infrastructure, like our water treatment facilities, energy grid, things like that, it could have been even more catastrophic.

Now, the reward -- excuse me, the report reveals that life expectancy for American women is the lowest it has been in nearly two decades since 2006, and the increase in deaths is from preventable causes.The report reveals that states in the northeast score the highest, while the poorest performers were spread across the southern half of the country. Joining me now is Dr. Joseph Betancourt; President of the Commonwealth Fund. Dr. Betancourt, thank you so much for your time. I mean, it's stunning to hear these words that life expectancy for U.S. women is the lowest it has been in two decades. And that the health of women here in this country, one of the wealthiest in the world is in a perilous place, as your authors write. Why? What is the cause of this?",

And so, from an evidence-based standpoint, fundamentally, as you mentioned, the risen(ph) total death are the highest in the Mississippi Delta region, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee. And we didn't know that those four states did have abortion restrictions prior to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. They now have full abortion ban. So, many may say, well, why does that matter? We've also seen, concomitant with that, a bit of an exodus of maternal healthcare providers from those states, creating maternal health deserts and certainly without the care that women need, we see these poor outcomes in those states.",

You could look at our findings and identifiers where they can make a difference. And certainly, we talked about Medicaid expansion. We talked about investing in maternal health and addressing those big disparities, especially for women of color and those of low socio-economic status. You know, those issues are critical.
