President-elect Trump's embattled choice for attorney general has been on Capitol Hill trying assure of support among GOP senators. And now we're learning of another controversial Trump pick heading to the Hill tomorrow.Also breaking, the U.S. just reopened its embassy in the Ukrainian capital, where fears of a significant air attack by Russia briefly prompted it to close and drove scared residents in the Ukrainian capital to take cover in the subway. We'll have a live report from Kyiv. And the highly publicized Laken Riley murder case comes to a close with the Georgia student's convicted killer sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Stand by to hear the raw emotion as Riley's family and friends choke up and spoke out in the courtroom. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. This is CNN Breaking News. We begin with the breaking news up on Capitol Hill, the findings of a House Ethics Committee investigation of Matt Gaetz still under wraps. Republicans on the panel falling in line with the GOP leaders and voting to block the release of the potentially very damning report on president-elect's choice to become the next attorney general of the United States. Let's go to CNN's Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju. He's up on Capitol Hill. Manu, walk us through this very significant day in the Gaetz controversy.",

That prompted the top Democrat to come out and said -- pushed back against the chairman and said his contention that the two sides had agreed that the report should not be released was wrong, as Democrats pushed for it to be disclosed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. SUSAN WILD (D-PA): He has implied that there was an agreement of the committee not to disclose the report.

They were briefed on them. They said they were slightly optimistic that part of the goal here is that they believe that Gaetz is best one-on-one, that he can make the pitch for himself and that he can show why he is the right person for the job. Now, one of those sources did tell me they still don't believe that he actually has the votes to get confirmed, but they think this is a step in the right direction. So, clearly, they're going to continue to push him, but one other source noted to me, and this was part of a sentiment in Trump world that I heard over the last several days, there is a large concern over this ethics report. Nobody wants this ethics report released. They think it could undo any goodwill that he's built up since meeting with these senators, or even just in the last few weeks since he was nominated to be attorney general. There is a lot of fear as to what's in there. And just a reminder, nobody actually knows except for the people who have seen it.

There are lots of Republicans in the House who don't like Matt Gaetz, particularly since he ousted Kevin McCarthy, and there are a lot of McCarthy fans there.And, you know, I have to believe, at some point, the Senate is going to get hold of this report, or have these women come testify privately or the Senate Democrats have asked for the FBI to give them their information. I don't think that's going to happen. But I do think they're going to get more information about Matt Gaetz. And I will also point out he's got a lot of enemies. He has tweeted trash about a lot of senators, including Mitch McConnell, Thom Tillis, for example, and the list goes on.

But, you know, the other consideration, as we've all seen before, is, you know, you consider these nominations kind of in the whole fulsome. So, are we going to fight on this person? So, does that mean we're going to let this one go? And we know there's always kind of a little bit of a chess game around how the negotiations might go.

But bear in mind, a lot of the frontlines all over Ukraine are already heavily mined, anti-tank mines, anti-personnel mines as well.The rationale behind this, as put forward by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, was that the Russians change tactic and no longer use armored vehicles, but dismounting their assaults. That's been the case for a number of months. And I think this contribution of equipment is formed as part of a larger package. We also heard announced today as well $275 million worth separately. These are urgently needed HIMARS ammunition, mortar shells, 155 artillery rounds, things that Ukraine needs an urgent constant supply of. The overall picture after the weekend announcement about the ATACMS longer range missiles being given permission by Ukraine to fire them into Russia is one of a Biden administration pretty much rummaging through the remainder of its toolkit to see what it can give to Ukraine to improve its chances in the remaining 2.5 months that Biden has in power before he hands over to President-elect Donald Trump who has made it quite clear, quote, he wants to stop the killing that probably involves peace talks. And the feeling I've really got here talking to senior government officials, people on the street, is a fear that peace talks may well not be on their terms. A bid to try and say, well, you know, we have to project strength towards Russia, maybe Donald Trump can help us with that, but an anxiety, too, that potentially the clock is ticking on that solidarity of western support that has been so urgently needed by Ukraine in the 1,001 days of this war now.

I think for the cabinet areas where Mr. Trump, President Trump feels aggrieved, he wants super loyalists, and that's why you've got Pete Hegseth and Matt Gaetz, et cetera. Those are areas where he felt he was treated unfairly. Again, I'm not saying he was. I'm just telling you what he thinks. And then, you know, he'll probably pick somebody for treasury that's less telegenic and more professional in terms of the gravitas.But I think, ultimately, it's not just the looks and the telecommunication skills, if you will, or the television skills. It's about whether or not he can exert his influence on them in a way that makes him feel comfortable. He couldn't do that with Jeff Sessions as an example. His former first DNI person, Dan Coates, he couldn't do that with. And so these things are about loyalty to him. Looks do matter, presentation skills matter, but let's not overlook the loyalty factor, Wolf, which I think is very important here.",

The Democrats really need to study what Elon Musk did in Pennsylvania because they were heralding a great ground game. But Elon Musk really did outshine them in Pennsylvania.So, the question is, are those two big egos going to be able to cohabitate? And so I would just say to you, Wolf, that, you know, the definition of insanity is to repeat the same thing over and over again, expect a different outcome. So, you know, I think he'll cycle through the president, like many people do. I don't think those two eagles are going to sustain a four-year relationship in the president. That's just me personally. I mean, if I had a guess, I got Elon last thing, probably 33 Scaramuccis, which is, 330 days. I don't think he'll make a full year, but I think he'll make it longer than most people think because he's very, very rich and shooting up rockets and having the president next to him is worth it to Elon, and it also makes the president look good.",
