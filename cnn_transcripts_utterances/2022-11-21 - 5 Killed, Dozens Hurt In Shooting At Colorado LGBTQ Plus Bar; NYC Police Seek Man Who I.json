He doesn't have the job as House Speaker quite yet. But some are already wondering how long you'll be able to hold on to the gavel. And a shakeup at Disney, a former CEO is back after he really just left, big questions now about the company's future. This is what we're watching AT THIS HOUR.Thank you so much for being here everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan. Police in Colorado are crediting now the heroism of two nightclub patrons for bringing down the gunman, grabbing his gun, hitting him with it, and pinning him down until police arrived at the scene of the mass shooting at an LGBTQ plus bar. Sadly, at least five people were killed, 25 others hurt in this attack on the gay community in Colorado Springs. The club's owners describe the suspect as being heavily armed wearing a military style flak jacket when he entered the bar with quote unquote tremendous firepower is how they say it. This morning we are hearing more from the survivors and learning more about the victims. Rosa Flores is live in Colorado Springs with the very latest. She joins us now. Rosa, what are you hearing?",

He still has not been booked which also means charges have not been filed, but that the police are there with him AT THIS HOUR. Also just into CNN, two law enforcement sources telling my colleague Evan Perez, that according to the sources that Aldrich purchased both weapons that were recovered at the scene and describing those two weapons as an AR style rifle and handgun. And that the timing of the purchase of those weapons is unclear.But here's an important point. There was a case linked to Aldrich from 2021, in June of 2021, when his mother called the police about a bomb threat calling that his son was in the home with homemade bombs, ammunition and also hand guns. Well police responded to the scene. And later and CNN and our investigative team was able to obtain some video that shows Aldrich walking outside of that home barefoot with his hands up in the air. Well, according to these two law enforcement sources, that particular case would not have shown up in a background check because it was never adjudicated. The charges were never filed. And so Kate, one of the other big questions here is the motive. According to the district attorney, they are investigating this through the lens of a hate crime. And we're expecting to learn more in a press conference later today. We don't know the exact time of that press conference just yet. Kate?",
