They see it as an issue that really galvanizes voters and that they can get some momentum on, especially as they tried to make inroads with female voters.Now, this reproductive rights tour is going to kick off on Tuesday and it's notably going to start in Florida. Of course, that is a state that an abortion is on the ballot. Former president Donald Trump saying that he would vote no this week. So expect that to come up quite a bit over the course of the coming week. Now, this is going to be a tour that includes surrogates mostly. That includes elected officials, for example, on Tuesday, Senator Klobuchar will be in Florida to kick this off. And also the campaign says celebrities and others along the way. This is going to be 50 or at least 50 stops. Now, we don't have details on all of the stops just yet, but what this tells us is that they very much plan to keep this issue front and center. And we should note that it is an issue that the vice president has been the voice on for the Biden administration. Just at the beginning of the year. She had kicked off a reproductive rights tour. I was at that first stop and followed it thereafter. And it was during that tour that she coined the term Trump abortion ban. Now that has been used to describe by the campaign and Democrats, all of the abortion restrictions across the country, putting the onus really on former president Donald Trump for the overturning of Roe v. Wade. So this is going to be a theme over the course of the next two months. And certainly one that the campaign is leaning on with this reproductive rights tour kicking off next week.",

She has seen things that she didn't see as an attorney general and prosecutor, seeing things that she has not seen as even a United States senator for a couple of years.

He was the eighth Israeli hostage to have been rescued since October 7th alive in the past 10 months of this war. But there have been more than that who have been recovered, who have passed away either because they were killed on October 7th and their bodies were taken into Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups, or because they were killed during the course of this war in the past 10 months. But this will really underscore the need from -- for so many people for a ceasefire deal to get the remaining hostages home both those who are still alive. We believe there are dozens of those who are still alive, and the remains of those who have been killed. There are more than 100 hostages all told. Israel tends not to the differentiate between those who are alive and who are dead. In terms of the actual ceasefire negotiations right now, the talks are ongoing, but it does not appear that we're on the brink of anything imminent. In speaking with sources from the region, as well as here in the United States, they're trying to work out those final details, the choreography of how this would play out. But there are still some significant sticking points. And as this drags on, we see not only the desperation of the people in Gaza who really need a ceasefire, who really need aid to get into Gaza, but also the anger growing in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government who many accused -- who many say are focused more on the military operation and trying to go after Hamas than they are -- than they are to bring those Israeli hostages home -- Jessica.",

But it was video that has not been seen before and shows just how quickly they crossed the border and then moved into Russian territory. Those Ukraine bringing forces then coming under fire after a little bit of time, but still managing to further advance into Russian territory.

The Ukrainians in the past couple of days saying they've gotten between one to three kilometers further and deeper into Russian territory. This, as the Russians are scrambling to try and put together a force to counter all this and to hold the E.U. units up. So far, the Russians not really managing to do that.

Colonel, thanks so much as always for being here with us. Let's talk more about what Fred was just describing to us. He mentioned that the Ukrainian defense minister was at the Pentagon yesterday, asking the U.S. to lift these restrictions against using long-range weapons inside of Russia. Where do you think that's ultimately going to land? Is this going to potentially be one of those things the U.S. starts off saying no to, but comes around on, or do you think this will be a firm no? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jessica, I think it's going to be one of those things that, in part, the U.S. will come around on. And as Fred was pointing out in his report, there are a lot of aspects to this war that are basically fought from a distance. And what the Russians are doing is they're using what are called standoff ranges. So they are not as close to the Ukrainian border or the Ukrainian front line as Ukrainians would need them to be in order to push them out of the sky in the case of the airplanes. So what the Ukrainians want to do is they want to be able to hit air bases where these planes are being staged out of. And if the Ukrainians get the go ahead, the greenlight to do that, that will make a major change to the war effort. And it could signal a big change for Ukraine's fortunes. Right now, we're dealing with a war of attrition. That could change that. That could potentially, potentially move things forward. But I think what the United States is still concerned about is the possibility of reaching some kind of Russian red line, which would then precipitate the use of weapons like, in the ultimate case, nuclear weapons. I don't think that's likely. But I do think that the Russians are certainly going to threaten that kind of usage. And the United States, of course, wants to avoid that escalation.",

And then they still go through a large training process once they're assigned to their units. And the same is true, really, of any pilot in any nation. The Ukrainians are trying to fly these airplanes with a minimum amount of training. And a lot of the training that they get is really the bare basics.

As of Sunday, in fact, it'll be entering, what, it's 11th month of fighting since the Hamas-led terrorist attacks of October 7th. So there are a lot of challenges, not least, the security situation. Then you've got to deal with damage to roads and infrastructure and the like as well. And then also, of course, so many people in Gaza, most of the population, in fact, has been displaced multiple times. So it could be challenging for them to get to where they need to be vaccinated, to be fully aware of what they need to do or where they need to be at particular times. And I suppose, even though Hamas has said that it will observe these three -- three-day pauses in fighting, and Israel has said that it will do so as well, it's always the danger, the concern that perhaps Hamas will use this for cover, or perhaps to launch attacks. And likewise that Israel may see assets on the ground, whether it's militants or military equipment used by Hamas, which it feels that it must take out in order to avoid the risk of danger to its own forces or to Israelis. But there is hope that this will proceed smoothly. But of course, even if all of those challenges can be overcome, they then have to do this again in four-weeks-time because it's a two-dose vaccination. So the first doses will be given in the central part of the Gaza Strip the first three days of September in the southern part and the northern part. Then they'll have to do it again in four-weeks-time. That said, if this does proceed according to plan over the next 12 days, there will be hope that, look, they've managed to do it once and everything went smoothly.

What is at the center of this dispute is that you have Gallant and the defense establishment saying, look, Israel can withdraw from the so- called Philadelphi Corridor. This 14-kilometer border strip of land between southern Gaza and Egypt, if it means getting a ceasefire deal with Hamas, and getting some of the hostages home in exchange. Prime Minister Netanyahu is adamant that Israel will not withdraw from control of the Philadelphi Corridor. And so you have these quite astounding exchanges of words. Gallant saying to his prime minister, \"You've got two choices effectively, either to stay in the Philadelphi or to bring back hostages. You decide to stay in Philadelphi. Does that make sense to you? There are people alive here.\" And the point being that Hamas will not accept a ceasefire deal if Israel stays in control of the Philadelphi Corridor. In fact, even Herzi Halevi, the head of the chief -- the chief of staff, saying that Israel could quite conceivably relinquish control of the Philadelphi Corridor in order to get a six-week temporary ceasefire in the beginning of this three-phase ceasefire talks that we've been talking about for so long.
