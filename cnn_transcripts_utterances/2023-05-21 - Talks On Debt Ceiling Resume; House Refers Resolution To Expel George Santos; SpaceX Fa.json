On board is a Former Space Station Commander, Peggy Whitson, who has spent more time in space than any other American, along with a pilot and two mission specialists from Saudi Arabia. We'll bring you that launch live in about half an hour.And just one hour from now, negotiations will resume over the looming debt crisis. These talks will be staff level, but they will set the stage for a high-stakes meeting tomorrow. President Biden will sit down with Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The two men spoke by phone earlier today as the President flew home from the G7 Summit in Japan. Here's what McCarthy had to say about that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: I believe it was a productive phone call. And so, at the end of the phone call, what we agreed to do is we're gonna have Congressman Garret Graves and Patrick McHenry get back together with -- he's gonna ask his team get back together. So, we can walk them through, literally, what we've been talking about. I think some of the challenges here, they might not completely understand how we're coming about this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's bring in Congressman Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania. He's a Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee and is a Member of the Ways and Means Committee.Congressman, you've got some potentially sleepless nights and not very restful days in the days to come here as this thing ticks down. I have to ask you, did you see the President's comments about using the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which says the validity of the nation's debt shall not be questioned as a mechanism to avoid a debt default? He seemed to indicate that maybe time has run out on that sort of thing. Should he try to exercise that option, in your view, if the nation is on the verge of a potentially devastating default? BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA), U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Well, thank you. It's good to be with you. And what I've said for months, really, going back to January when Secretary Yellen first sent a letter that made clear we're now in the extraordinary measures period with respect to the debt ceiling, that I wouldn't necessarily rule out the 14th Amendment. The challenge is while that would be inevitably litigated in court, the markets would probably be experiencing some degree of turmoil. Would it be accepted as valid by those who buy our bonds and are responsible for why we have such low interest rates comparatively around the world because we are such a safe haven? Would we, in a sense, end up losing that? Maybe we wouldn't -- it wouldn't be as bad as full-blown default, but there would still be some damage if at the last second that was the only option that remains to the President.",

They recognize that we as a country can't keep doing this every year or every two years. This is the most serious situation that we face in terms of the debt ceiling since 2011.

It was actually the second time that he had been left behind in a prisoner swap between the Russians and the U.S.Trevor Reed was also brought home in a prisoner swap last year. And he had urged to the Biden administration to make him a priority. When I spoke to him today, he seemed much more uplifted and confident that he had been made a priority, that the Biden administration was working to get him home, but he wished that that would happen more quickly. And he was still a bit concerned that he could be left behind again, particularly now that Russia has arrested another American Wall Street Journal Reporter, Evan Gershkovich. I want you to take a listen to what he told me about this.

Whelan told me he thinks this might be because the Russians are using this as propaganda to show that the Americans are, quote, begging for one of their own.

So, having the President come out at the dinner and then also that U.N. appearance by his sister, I think it's significant that they actually showed it in prison, even if they're trying to say, well, the Americans are begging, but that is a very interesting moment.And I think, you know, Paul is in prison, so his information is very limited. But I think a lot of people's information right now is limited, because the real work has to be done behind the scenes. And that serious proposal that Antony Blinken is talking about, we don't know exactly what that could be. It obviously could be a trade. But one of the problems here is that number one, you know, Paul Whelan has been accused and actually found guilty in the Russian system, which he denies, for espionage. That is a very serious charge, the most serious you can get. And so who are they trading him for? I mean, there aren't a lot of people being held in the United States. There are other people that the Russian want that are in other countries so, that would make it even more, you know, difficult to do a deal where you would try to convince other countries to let the person go -- the Russian go and go back to Russia.

And that's to the Russians' advantage. You know, they're in no hurry to free Evan Gershkovich. They want to get as much out of this as they can.And it also makes the situation, let's face it, politically for Biden, difficult. And that's another thing that President Putin obviously would probably like. So, the -- it is being dragged out. There is no question, and there's really no guarantee in any case with Gershkovich or with Paul Whelan of how this ultimately will end because as you know, the war in Ukraine and the situation between the United States and Russia every day is changing and in most cases getting worse.",

And so, Republicans have decided that they negotiate a debt ceiling when it's a Democratic President, but not when it's a Republican President. What they want, their ever-changing list of demands is, you know, at best, schizophrenic, right? They want work requirements for SNAP, but they also want to make the tax cuts permanent. So, I don't think it's fair to say the Republicans want to lower the deficit as much as they just want to make trouble. I'm also not completely convinced that McCarthy will have the votes for any deal he makes with Democrats, because remember some of these members of Congress are extreme MAGA and really are just want to sort of destroy the federal government and not work in it. So, I think ultimately, they would not mind a kind of, you know, meltdown. I do think there are other options. Look, the 14th Amendment is scary because it would then very likely kick up to the Supreme Court. And it's hard for me to imagine that the Supreme Court is so interested in making sure things go okay for the Biden administration.

So, we couldn't quite make out exactly where that stage one rocket booster landed, but there was no mistaking it had touched down because of the sonic boom.But as you guys have been talking, having seeing this four-member crew earlier this afternoon when they first arrived here at the Kennedy Space Center. They arrived by helicopter. And they spent about 10 to 15 minutes with their families and we could overhear some of their conversations. And these four crew members were all incredibly excited at getting to work. At one point, the mission pilot, John Shoffner, you could hear him telling his family, let's go. We're excited. Let's do this. From there, they got into several cars and then made the drive out, about three miles out to where the SpaceX rocket was located. And as you can see by these live pictures right now, they are -- it appears to be in space right now considering that it seems that they are in their space capsule. They're dealing with no gravity.
