Plus, Russia has not one but two dictators, in the country, tonight, as Kim Jong Un's train has finally rolled in, as Putin himself is weighing in, on Donald Trump's criminal charges. Also, an escaped killer is not only desperate and extremely dangerous. He is now armed, nearly two weeks after his Pennsylvania prison break. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Under pressure, from the extreme voices, in his party, and at risk, of losing his job, House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, caved to the demands, from the far-right, today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Today, I am directing our House committee, to open a formal impeachment inquiry, into President Joe Biden. We will go wherever the evidence takes us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

McCarthy launched the inquiry, today, unilaterally, without having the full House vote on it.Now, that's a major about-face, from just 11 days ago, when he said, and I'm quoting the House Speaker, now, \"The American people deserve to be heard... That's why, if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People's House, and not through a declaration by one person.\" His decision not to hold that vote appeared to be an acknowledgment, from McCarthy. He didn't say this. But what it seemed to be clear is that he does not yet have the votes, to actually pass that if it were held for a House vote. If you remember, back in 2019, McCarthy criticized his predecessor, then-House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, for doing the exact same thing, against then-former President Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Congressman, thank you, for joining me, tonight. How are Democrats preparing to handle this inquiry? REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): Well, the same way, we've been handling the same inquiry, for the last eight or nine months, which is to continue to point out the facts, and the truth, and that there is no evidence, to link President Biden, to anything, related to his son. They have had eight or nine months, to collect evidence. They have collected more than 12,000 bank records, 2,000 Suspicious Activity Reports, witness testimony. The Biden administration has been very cooperative. And remember, Donald Trump famously said he would defy all subpoenas, and he turned over zero documents, from his administration, to the 2019 impeachment inquiry. And so, now, we're just going to continue with the same thing, because as Speaker McCarthy said, in 2019, his declaration, of an impeachment inquiry, does not change any authority that these committees have. So, their authority, today, to issue congressional subpoenas, and get materials, is the same as it was yesterday.",

This gives North Korea, going forward, the potential to play Russia off, to get oil and gas, directly from Russia, to get high technology, in exchange for these weapons.
