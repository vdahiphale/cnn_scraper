And we know that the GOP wants to put -- some of the GOP want to put some spending restrictions on any kind of rise in the -- in the debt limit. But if you don't raise the debt ceiling, eventually, you have to decide which bills to pay. Right? You could default on your debt. That is something that has never happened and can never happen. The reason why the U.S. is the gold standard in the global financial system is because we always pay our bills on time. Or you start to delay payments to federal workers. You delay Social Security and veteran benefits. Can you imagine in the position where you are giving an IOU to a member of the military, who's defending this country, because you haven't raised the debt limit and you can't actually pay your bills?

A hazmat suit, a hacksaw, and a gruesome list on online searches on how to get rid of a body.Prosecutors say this is all proof that Brian Walshe murdered his wife, Ana, the missing Massachusetts mother who vanished more than two weeks ago. Notably, investigators have not found a body, but they decided to file a murder charge anyway, based on all the evidence that they have been able to uncover. As they read that list of what he had Googled, Brian Walshe shook his head in court yesterday, as the prosecutor went through what he was searching for, allegedly, on his young son's iPad. It was almost too difficult to listen to. Among the searches, quote, \"Can you be charged with murder without a body?\" Jason Carroll is live in Quincy, Massachusetts. He's been covering this story for us. Jason, you know, obviously, we don't believe that prosecutors have been able to locate a body, but they have been able to find DNA evidence and tools that they say he allegedly used to dismember this body. What else did we learn from prosecutors yesterday? JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right. Well, key to their case, Kaitlan, some of it you mentioned there, will be those alleged Internet searches from Walshe. Searches that included information not only about DNA and divorce but also about decomposing bodies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
