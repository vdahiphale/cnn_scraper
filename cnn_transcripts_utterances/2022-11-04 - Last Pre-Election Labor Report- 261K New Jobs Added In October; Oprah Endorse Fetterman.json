The elections now just four days out as candidates from both parties make their final pitch to voters.Also tonight, the U.S. economy, the top issue for most Americans, is getting one more gut check before the midterms. The Labor Department reporting 261,000 jobs added during the month of October. And we're also watching former President Trump who is -- who now says he's very, very, very probably going to run for the White House in 2024. And there are new indications the announcement could come soon after the midterm elections. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Brianna Keilar. And you're in the Situation Room. Our top story tonight, the midterm campaigns hitting their final stretch. CNN is on the trail covering all the key races across the United States with just four more days until polls close. We're also getting one final look at the health of the U.S. economy before the elections, American employers adding 261,000 new jobs last month. Let's get right to our Senior White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly. Phil, the U.S. labor market still going strong, but this is tricky for the White House as Election Day closes in.",

Unemployment rates still sitting at five decade lows.But here's kind of the paradox. Right now when you talked to White House officials, they acknowledged they did not want a gangbusters report today, 261,000 jobs, a healthy sign that any idea of a recession is likely not the case at this moment but any higher would have made real concerns that that inflation problem was only going to be persistent even longer. However, the fact that it remains pervasive at this moment is a problem as the President alluded to today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just about two hours left to go, of course, people can also vote on Tuesday, Election Day. But this has been remarkable to watch. The sheer number of people participating in this process, more than 2 million Georgians voting early the last two weeks.

So it's not entirely just like a clear runaway victory that Democrats can tout, though, obviously, it's a robust job market.The issue is, Brianna, one day one data point, this final jobs report to combat the inflation pain that people are feeling in their daily lives, that seems to be a pretty tall order.

It turns out that people are sitting on white hot stoves of just pain economically. And Democrats have a lot to say about that.I do think that jobs numbers are good. If they were bad, we'd be saying, well, it's even worse. So I think, you know, having good jobs numbers is there. Ten million jobs in the past two years, that's incredible jobs record. But also, you have a president that has tried to deliver on other ways to address cost of living, whether you're talking about prescription drug prices, the Inflation Reduction Act was going to put a lot more infrastructure in place.

So that's no surprise at all. And then of course, we're seeing former president Trump going just outside of Pittsburgh, about an hour outside of Pittsburgh, again, like a signature area for him where he really runs up the score with the base.For Republicans and for Mehmet Oz, it is, as I was talking about just a little bit earlier in the show, just such a fine line of how much you turn up the base with Donald Trump and how he's also trying to attract these Independent swing voters who in the last election really swung toward Democrats and Biden. Are they there again in 2022? We just don't know. We're going to have to wait until Tuesday to find out. But both of these campaigns really hoping, at this point, that they can really turn out the basis and then they both want to go after these Independent voters.
