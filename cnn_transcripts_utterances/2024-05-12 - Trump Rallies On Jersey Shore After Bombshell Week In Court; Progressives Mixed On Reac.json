INSIDE POLITICS, the best reporting from inside the corridors of power, starts now. (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. It was a week of intense personal and even graphic testimony in his New York hush money case. And now, Donald Trump is back in campaign, lashing out at the prosecutor and judge Saturday in a beachside New Jersey rally. He hit the trail for the first time since adult film star Stormy Daniels testified in court about her alleged sexual encounter with the former president, which he denies. And as soon as tomorrow, the former president may come face-to-face with the prosecutions star witness, his ex-lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen. Now, in n the last few weeks as this trial has unfolded, Trump has held very few campaign events even on his days off from the courthouse. Meanwhile, President Biden has been trying to shore up his support and rebuilt his fraying coalition as he crisscrosses key battleground states. And speaking to donors at a Washington state fundraiser, you just yesterday, Biden called Trump, quote, clearly unhinged and said, quote, something snapped in him after he lost in 2020. Now, CNN's Alayna Treene is live in Atlantic City just of the Jersey Shore for where Trump held his rally yesterday afternoon. So what did Trump after say about all of his court challenges and that came in the past week?",

Of course, he's not allowed to do that. He's not allowed to go after witnesses, but his lawyers had actually tried to alter that that gag order last week because they argued that it's not fair that someone the witnesses are able to attack Donald Trump and that he can't defend himself.But instead of doing that, he talked about the cases more generally, he also baselessly claimed that President Joe Biden and Democrats were the ones behind his charges. Of course, something we know is not true. Take listen to how we put it in Wildwood yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks for joining us. So just to remind viewers about just the intense week that happened in court last week, Stormy Daniels testified about her alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, described it in detail. She talked about the hush money that came after the access Hollywood tape, of course, was least that was right before the 2016 campaign. She's excused by Trump's attorneys for lying, for profit. Look, Trump is clearly distracted by all this. So as you can see from attacking Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor, calling him, quote Fat Alvin in this, but also not hitting the campaign trail. Biden has been crisscrossing the country. This is a rare rally for Donald Trump in a blue state, is clearly having an impact in him in this key moment in the campaign.",

That's the upside, I guess of being the criminal defendant is that we're watching everything he does, including whether he is or is not snoozing in the courtroom. He comes out at the end of the day. He makes remarks when he's leaving court. So, you know, there is in a weird way.

The Georgia election subversion case, it says August 5th, but it's unclear if that actually is going to happen before November. It's tied up and other court issues and as well as the presidential election interference case, a federal case that's paused over the Supreme Court decision about whether he has immunity as he claims that he does. But has he been successful in convincing the American public that -- you know, that he says he's unfairly being prosecuted. Look at the way that this \"PBS NewsHour\" poll breaks this down.

There are classic Democratic issues that they beat Mitt Romney with that they think Donald Trump is vulnerable on, and they talk about them. Joe Biden talks about them, and they cant they can't get covered.I'm not saying that they helpless person in the media. Trump has also in public talking more about these trials.

We just don't -- I mean conviction might amplify him. It also might cause deep questions among those independent voters. The poll that you showed is really interesting there because there are independents who are watching this. I was in Wisconsin this week talking to voters and people are not paying attention to the blow by blow of the trial, but people who want to move on beyond the chaos, it's not good for them. Donald Trump's supporters think he is under attack here, and I think this is all ridiculous. So we'll have to see what the followed is of this. But I think interestingly, this week because we head into Michael Cohen. How does this affect Donald Trump personally? It's getting to him. There's no doubt. And for all the idea of campaigning will find out if campaigning actually matters. But fundraising does matter. Donald Trump is way behind on that.

That is, until the former Republican governor Larry Hogan, threw his hat in the ring meaning Maryland is now essential to the battle for the Senate majority as Democrats face a daunting map in their quest to hang on to power.Now the Democratic primary has been smashing records for spending, and that's because Congressman David Trone is pouring his personal fortune into what has become an increasingly vicious race against Prince Georges county executive, Angela Alsobrooks for the party's nomination. It's become personal with racial issues and Trone's wealth, central to the attacks. So ahead of this Tuesday's primary, I asked the two sitting Maryland Democratic senators about the personal attacks being leveled between the two Democrats. SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Angela Alsobrooks is the stronger candidate. She's the best candidate. I'm proud to have endorsed her. She's the best candidates. She'll run against Larry Hogan in the general election and it's -- it's unfortunate that Trone campaign decided to go negative. SEN. BEN CARDIN (D-MD): We have two really good people running. I'm very anxious to get the primary over with so we can concentrate on the general. This happens during campaigns. I would prefer to see it run with each candidate promoting themselves.

I asked him as part of your message here that the DSCC can spend in Montana and Ohio and that other Democrats are so worried about, he said yes.And when Hogan got in the race that did transform things because Maryland's never elected a non-white, sorry, its elected a white female senator, it's most elected white men, it's never elected a black woman to the Senate. And a lot of democrats publicly started saying, I'd love to make history, but I'm very nervous. Maybe this wealthy candidate can take the seat off the board and the reaction you saw from the senators is that Alsobrooks is turned that into my opponent is going needlessly negative.
