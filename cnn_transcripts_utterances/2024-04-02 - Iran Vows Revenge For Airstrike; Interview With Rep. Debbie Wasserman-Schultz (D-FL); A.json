I will speak to the director of the World Food Program, Ambassador Cindy McCain. We will discuss that and more. That's just ahead. Meantime, regional tensions are on the brink of unraveling even further after an Iranian consulate building in Damascus was hit. And, later, Florida's Supreme Court opens the door for a six-week abortion ban to take effect, but gives voters the final word on abortion rights for women in November. We will explain. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. We begin with two major developing stories out of the Middle East. In Gaza, outrage after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in an Israeli airstrike, Israel taking responsibility for the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying it was not intentional. And just a short time ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke about the incident. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  And as we have throughout this conflict, we have impressed upon the Israelis the absolute imperative of doing more to protect innocent civilian lives, be they Palestinian children, women and men, or be they aid workers, as well as to get more humanitarian assistance to more people more effectively.

But bear in mind that Israel -- Israeli officials and the IDF, in particular, have been claiming over the course of the last few months to be working very closely with aid organizations to try and get some of that much-needed release to the more than two million Gazans that are currently, according to the U.N., in need of aid and at danger of hunger. Now, this is what Benjamin Netanyahu had to say a short while ago: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Unfortunately, in the last day, there was a tragic incident where our forces unintentionally struck innocent people in the Gaza Strip. It happens in war, and we are thoroughly investigating it. We are in contact with the governments, and we will do everything to prevent such occurrences in the future. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so you have been hearing the outrage not just from the countries that they came from, but all the many United Nations relief agencies that have been trying so desperately to get aid in and urging that more is done by Israel to get aid in through land. Because remember that the reason that World Central Kitchen was able to make such a difference and play such a crucial role until it announced the suspension of its activities as a result of this strike was that it's been able to get around the blockade by opening up that maritime route with shipments of aid coming from Cyprus to that makeshift jetty that's been made off the coast of Northern Gaza, Wolf.",

It could be quite painful, not just for the Israelis, but possibly for the U.S. as well. And you're absolutely right. The supreme leader has come out and spoken about retaliation. The foreign minister has said that the Iranians also hold the United States accountable as well. And, of course, what we know, what you, of course, know very well from traveling so much in that region, what the Iranians have is militias on the ground. One of the things that the Revolutionary Guard has actually said to me is, they say, look, the United States needs to understand that next to every American military base in the region, there is a militia that is loyal to Iran on the ground there. Of course, we know that one of the things that the Israelis have said is, on the very morning before that strike took place, they say that the Iranians launched a drone to attack an Israeli military base in the port town of Eilat on the Red Sea. So, for a limited response, the Iranians certainly have means at their disposal. Whether or not they would be up at this point in time for some sort of major, larger response, for a wider conflict, that certainly would be a lot more difficult, especially since we have seen some of the instability inside Iran as well with some of the protests that have been taking place over the past two years, Wolf.",

How they will react -- they need to react, in their own minds, I think, because these are the leaders of sort of their Praetorian Guard who've been killed. How they react, to be -- TBD. Might well involve Hezbollah, because, obviously, Hezbollah has the most capacity. So I expect they will -- there will be some form of retaliation.",

COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Absolutely, Wolf. And that's one of the key things. And you mentioned the Houthis. They are going to be a critical component to this. They can cut off a lot of the world's commerce if the Iranians try to use them for something. And we also, of course, have those militias that Fred mentioned in various places within the areas that the United States has bases.

They want to kind of keep turning up the heat a little bit. I mean, the -- what's difficult about all this, Wolf, is, no one really knows what the real red lines are, right?

And, of course, the Iranians are smarting because many of their nuclear scientists have been killed by the Israeli intelligence services over the course of the last few years. So, there are different aspects to this where, at some point, as Peter said, there's going to be some area where we reach this point of no return.

All the oil refineries, all the pipelines, all the things that are part of that Russian structure for their oil business, those are all legitimate targets in the Ukrainian view.

This is on him, and he certainly can't be trusted to be given another four years, where he could make life even worse, potentially ban in vitro fertilization, which is clearly the next step in the abortion -- in the reproductive -- anti-reproductive freedom extremists that put us in this situation in the first place, like Donald Trump did.",

And that's going -- and that's going to cut across the breadth of voters, whether they're Democrats, Republicans, or independents, who want to make sure that we can keep the government out of our most personal health care decisions. And, as a result, that's why, in addition to already being in play because of the extreme policies and danger that Donald Trump represents if he gets another term, ensuring that we can have a pro- reproductive freedom president of the United States in place in the White House, as Joe Biden has been, is going to be something that Florida voters will go to the polls and choose to do. [11:25:04] In addition, Wolf, we have one of the most unpopular U.S. senators in Rick Scott, who is virulently, vehemently anti-reproductive freedom, and we have a great candidate, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who will certainly be drawing that contrast, which will help as well.",
