ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): For example, one lawyer told the witness, the witness could, in certain circumstances, tell the Committee that she didn't recall facts, when she actually did recall them. (END VIDEO CLIP) COATES: Who is that lawyer? Committee members also referred House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, and three other GOP members, Jim Jordan, Scott Perry and Andy Biggs of the House Ethics Committee, for failing to comply with Committee subpoenas. Now, as to the former President, he erupted on social media, spreading falsehoods, about his response, on January 6, and referring to the FBI as quote, the \"Democratic Bureau of Investigation,\" forgetting perhaps that he himself appointed the Bureau's Director, Christopher Wray. And, by and large, Republicans have made deflection, the name of the game. With some exceptions, they have tried to shift attention away, from the Committee's focus, on the former President. To hear them say it, the Committee has given short shrift to questions about security, at the Capitol, and Intelligence, leading up to January 6. Now, the truth is though the Committee's report apparently will cover that ground. And Congress, as an entire institution, has already done some of that hard and clearly necessary work. Joining us now, in fact, to talk about that, retired Army Lieutenant General Russel Honore, who oversaw the security review, for Congress, in the wake of the Insurrection. General, thank you for being here, tonight. And just given how deeply you were involved, in investigating the security breaches, at the Capitol, on that fateful day? I wonder what your reaction is to this final hearing of the January 6 committee. LT. GEN. RUSSEL HONORE (RET.), OVERSAW SECURITY REVIEW FOR CONGRESS FOLLOWING THE JANUARY 6 RIOT, U.S. ARMY: Well, I think it's pretty revealing. It played back for many Americans who, and the world, who had a chance, to be watching, from the President's speech, to the media, tracking the crowd, through the Capitol, to the crowd, the mob going into the Capitol, all live on television. So, we saw this Insurrection happen, live, on television, and even videos of the President, watching it, as it was happening. So, it was very surreal, today, and it brings forth information that capitalized almost two years of investigation. But Laura, I'm waiting to see, what will be in the written report, about the recommendations, we made, on security, in the Capitol.",

The only thing that was approved was the overtime, and to pay to Guard, the National Guard, who did a great job of coming in, and securing up to the Inauguration. That was a lot of resources, as well as overtime, for all the federal agencies. But substantive hardening of the Capitol was not in that budget. There was some telephones bought, so every officer now has a telephone, and some improvements in communications, and some positions, to increase a few Intelligence people. But the substantive recommendations, we made, Laura, were not implemented, because they were not funded, in the Senate, such as fencing, improving the dogs that are available in - sniffing dogs, in the Capitol.",

He said it's because he wanted to focus on political violence, on the left, and cities, around the country, after Black Lives Matter. There was not necessarily a serious discussion, about the scope, and how to approach this investigation. And I think what we have now, is at least something that is a good historical record, and accounting, of what happened that day. So, we're not in the scenario of being asked to believe our lying eyes, right, that this was a bunch of people a riot that got out of hand. There were people, who were armed. There were people there, who had made tactical plans, for what they were going to do. And more importantly, it was part of this kind of multi-prong effort that was going on, at Justice Department, that was going on at the state level, and that was going on, on social media.
