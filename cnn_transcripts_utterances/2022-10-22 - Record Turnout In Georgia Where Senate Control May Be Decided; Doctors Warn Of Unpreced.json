Because of the changes in the Election Law, because now that they've lowered the number of absentee drop boxes, because they've now taken the outside boxes and placed them inside, and only during daily operational hours, from nine to five, it has limited the amount of people that could vote early, and it is filling the lines up now.

That means children who are coming into the hospital are having to stay in beds that are typically used for triage just because they can't get into the hospital because they are at full capacity. They have turned play rooms into hospital beds. They are taking drastic measures to deal with the surge that they're seeing. We also got reports from this hospital that October is the first time since June that the number of RSV cases has outnumbered COVID cases among children. So extremely alarming, extremely overwhelming for these doctors, nurses, and hospital staff. Now to prepare for really another surge possibly of the flu on top of RSV, what this hospital has done is coordinated with the Governor of the State, the Department of Public Health, even the National Guard to kind of possibly set up a field hospital in this area where I'm standing right now if it comes to that, that they just need help and room for an influx of patients. They haven't pulled the trigger on that just yet, but that is certainly possible in the near future. And again, the CDC saying this is a surge that they are seeing all across the country. Any doctor will say, make sure you get your kids vaccinated with the flu vaccine to help prevent sort of the raze in the flu, because RSV numbers are so bad as well.

However, the power generating company here say that the effect of the barrage on Saturday was worse even than two weeks ago, Monday when Russia first began targeting the electrical grid.What Russia has done is targeted some of the weak places in the air defense network, the capital Kyiv, Lviv, the big city in the West, Odesa in the south, most of the missiles fired there taken down. But five cities in the East hit, a number of hidden cities in the center of Ukraine hit as well. In Rivne for example, in the West of the country there, the hospital without electricity, water, being bused into that hospital. Also in Rivne, the air defense system, the announcement system taken down, electricity off there. So the police have to drive around announcing that on loudspeakers when there is an air warning there. It's getting into the way that the country runs, 1.5 million electrical subscribers without electricity, 11 regions across the country having to institute blackouts, and in one case in the center of the country, the power grid taken out there is what feeds the mine, the mine can't work. They can't mine the coal, therefore they don't have the coal for their power generating stations. They believe that Russia is working with its engineers specifically to target the weak points in the electrical grid system here. The generators, the switching transformers, rather, and the parts of the equipment that are outside of the buildings, the easier targets to cripple electricity here.

Now, the Russians are also likely hoping that this will try in some way to force the Ukrainians to surrender or at least enter talks. This is actually quite similar to how the Russians supported the Syrian dictator Assad throughout their involvement in the Syrian Civil War. They would do this often to rebel held territory, and while it's very unlikely to force the Ukrainian government to surrender or even really erode the will of Ukrainian population, it will make things more difficult for the government in Kyiv, to quite simply provision and take care of its citizens, particularly with how much of the buildings and shelter in Ukraine have already been damaged by the war.",

Now, we unfortunately cannot completely rule out the Russians using tactical nuclear weapons, that would likely be a weapon of truly last resort to halt Ukrainian counter offensives and would likely lead to a very immediate U.S. and NATO conventional response against Russian forces in Ukraine. So Putin would have to gamble that - to put it bluntly - likely losing his remaining forces in Ukraine would be worth the effect of trying to halt the Ukrainian military through the use of tactical nuclear weapons.
