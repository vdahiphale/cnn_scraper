Five Americans wrongfully detained in Iran are expected to be released today after years of complicated negotiations between Washington and Tehran. News of the release coming from Iran's Foreign Ministry. Our other top stories this morning. Donald Trump telling NBC it was, quote, \"my decision\" to push the false claim that he won the 2020 election and to try and overturn the election results. A key premise of special counsel Jack Smith's case is that Trump knew the election claims he was making were false but pushed them anyway. One of Trump's co-defendants in Georgia has a critical hearing later this morning. Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark is trying to get his case moved to federal court. He argues that he acted on behalf of the federal government and should be tried before a federal judge. And Kevin McCarthy still in his own party's crosshairs this week as he fights to keep the government open and keep his job as speaker. McCarthy was on Fox over the weekend trying to rally Republicans to avoid a shutdown. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  I want to make sure we don't shut down. I don't that is a win for the American public and I definitely believe it will make our hand weaker if we shut down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jackie, thrilled to have you here this morning. Thank you so much for getting up with us. McCarthy is having to put out fires in all directions and obviously, the most -- the one that's burning the hottest right now is government funding. Step one, they have to get something passed through the House, but then it's going to have to go to the Senate. And the Senate has very little interest in this deal that the hardliners seem to have cracked over the weekend with potentially, the Freedom Caucus. We're still kind of getting the details of it. What is _- what is the end game here? I mean, this is -- I think what we were pre-staging when he had the speaker fight on the floor back in January but, hey, here it is. It caught with him. JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE (via Webex by Cisco):  And we all knew this was going to happen. And now, you saw him being a little more aggressive last week -- at the end of last week when he was essentially saying to Gaetz, OK, fine, just do it. But -- and so far, the deals that he has struck, both with the White House when -- the last time this happened, and these little ones that are being crafted around the edges -- you mentioned the struck by some members of the Main Street conference or caucus and the hardliners. That also kind of seems DOA at this point but we'll have to see how they work out. I know that they are going to have a -- they'll be talking about this today and tomorrow and potentially, vote on Thursday. McCarthy has said he's going to put it on the floor whether or not it's going to fail. None of these are really recipes for success for him. And I think this ends with the government is going to have to be funded and they're going to have to pass something that's going to pass the Senate. And what they're working on right now might get past their conference -- maybe -- fingers crossed if you're Kevin McCarthy. But even then that's not assured. And will this make the hardliners angry enough to trigger that motion to vacate? You know, Kasie, we're all just watching to see when and if that happens.",

Now, the release of the prisoners that you've been talking about all morning certainly comes at a good time for Iran timing-wise. But, of course, Iran still has major differences with the International Atomic Energy Agency -- inspectors being barred, operations shut down. It's gone on for years. President Biden, yes, will be at the U.N. tomorrow meeting with different countries and, as you mentioned, a meeting on Thursday with President Zelenskyy. The mood of this U.N. General Assembly with the awful name of UNGA, standing for the U.N. General Assembly in its 75th year, is really the world has so many problems.
