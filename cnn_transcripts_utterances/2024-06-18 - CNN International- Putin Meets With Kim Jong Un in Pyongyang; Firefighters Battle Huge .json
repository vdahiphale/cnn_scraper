Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected in the North Korean capital soon for a much anticipated meeting with Kim Jong Un. We are live in Seoul with the very latest. Plus, action on immigration, U.S. President Joe Biden set to unveil a new executive order, what it will mean for the hundreds of thousands living in the U.S. illegally. And facing the flames, emergency crews battle California's massive Post Fire. We'll have a live report.All right, very soon, Vladimir Putin will be setting foot in North Korea for the first time in more than 20 years. His two-day visit is the first by a world leader to North Korea since the COVID pandemic ended. The trip is aimed at bringing the two close allies even closer. Both leaders are largely pariahs on the international stage, but they share an animosity for the West and each has something the other wants. Now, analysts say Putin is seeking continued support for his war in Ukraine, while Kim Jong Un has its own objectives. CNN's Matthew Chance takes a look at what each leader wants out of the relationship. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is why for Moscow, North Korea has become so crucial, vast supplies of artillery shells helping Russian forces sustain a massive bombardment on the Ukrainian frontlines. Russia and North Korea deny arms shipments, but U.S. officials assess millions of rounds have already been delivered. Now, the Kremlin says President Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un toward a space center in eastern Russia last year will cement ties even further in a two-day visit to Pyongyang, fueling concerns this is fast becoming one of the world's most dangerous relationships. But Moscow as played down fears it could swap sensitive nuclear missile technology sanctioned by the U.N. for basic North Korean ammo. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has its own nuclear umbrella Putin told Russian state television earlier this year. They haven't even asked us for anything he insisted. But both countries stand to benefit. The Kremlin says it is working with Pyongyang on a new strategic partnership treaty to include security cooperation as well as bolstering trade in food and fuel supplies. Both states opposed to U.S. power looks set to join forces, undermining U.S. allies in Europe and the Far East. It's been more than two decades since Putin last visited Pyongyang, back when Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father ruled the country. The newly elected Russian president was trying to revive Moscow's waning influence with an isolated and sanctioned regime. But now, Russia is isolated and sanctioned by the West too, finally giving Moscow and Pyongyang a common cause. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And therefore, proliferation is not something Russian government is going to be happy about.And ballistic missiles technology, I am a bit skeptical too, because once it is given to North Korea, North Koreans are not under Russian control. They are not -- they have never been under anybody's control, by their own and God knows whom they will give this technology to, and how will they use it. The easiest way, we have seen it in the past in the 1980s when they essentially stole Soviet (ph) technology. Yes, their spies were efficient in stealing technology from a country which was opaque, as their ally (ph). They stole technology. They may begin to make cheap copies as they took a part of the Russian share of the weapons market, so there are many other reasons related to South Korea, probably we have no time to talk about it.

But this is an all too familiar scene that we are seeing from these hospitals in Nuseirat of survivors, the wounded, and also the bodies of those killed are coming in. And Nuseirat, obviously, has certainly been under intense fighting in recent days and weeks, just a week last Saturday, this is the area where those four Israeli hostages were rescued from, where Gaza hospital officials say that at least 270 were killed.

There was also a suspicion of attacking policemen and disruption, but it shows that the anger is spilling over onto the streets. There are many who do not believe that Netanyahu is the man who should be in the prime minister's position at this point. And there are many that are pushing for a ceasefire-hostage deal to be signed. Perception among these protesters certainly that the Israeli prime minister is not fully signed up to that deal. In fact, we haven't heard him publicly say that he wants to go ahead with that deal. But these are protests that are seemingly building and the anti-Netanyahu camp certainly seems quite significant.

You're talking over 80 percent of the U.S. population is looking at temperatures at least 90 degrees or higher at some point this week. We've also had records being broken in the last few days. This is just a look at yesterday, looking at these. Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all looking at those temperatures in the 90s, and at least several degrees above what their previous record had been. More records are expected for today, the bulk of them are going to be in the Northeast and the Midwest. But there is over 150 of them and some of them stretch down into the southeast and even in some western states as well. So, a lot of folks really going to be feeling the heat today and for much of the rest of the week.Now, when you also factor in the humidity that combined temperature and humidity creates what we call the heat index, the feels like temperature. So Cincinnati today going to feel like it is 101, Syracuse going to feel like it is 103, even Boston topping out at what's going to feel like 96 today. So again, very, very high. Another concern in the northeast is the prolonged nature of this heat wave. Take a look at Pittsburgh, their average normally this time of year only 80 degrees. Every single one of the next seven days will be above that. But if you look at the next five to six days, you are talking 10 to 15 degrees above that normal temperature. Now, something else we are keeping an eye out, that's the flood potential along the Gulf Coast and that's all thanks to this particular system right here. Potential tropical cyclone one, this could become tropical storm Alberto later on today or even tomorrow morning. Regardless of whether it gets the name or when it gets a name, it is going to bring a huge surge of moisture into areas of Mexico and especially into Texas and Louisiana. Look at all of this rain expected south of Houston, all the way down through Brownsville. You're talking widespread rainfall totals of four to eight inches, especially those coastal regions. But some spots not out of the question that they could pick up as much as a foot of rain before this system finally exits. So because of that, you have a moderate risk. That's a Level 3 out of 4 for excessive rainfall, both today and on Wednesday for much of Texas. But notice too, it also kind of stretches into that that marginal risk into Louisiana. So, it is not just going to be for Texas. Another concern with this particular system is also the storm surge. It is expected to strengthen once it moves out over open water and by strengthening, it is going to have a lot of energy to push all of that water inland. So, you can see here just around the Houston and Galveston area, we are looking at some storm surge right around that two- to four-foot range.",

There are more and more minds, North Korea experts, Amara, who are saying we don't think it is going to go that far, but there are still a whole multitude of things that each country wants from one another. Starting with North Korea, they need more help with their satellite and ballistic missile programs, assistance with food, energy. They want the \"prestige\" of having their leader Kim Jong Un standing on the stage for all the world to see with a leader like Vladimir Putin. But, what does Russia want? It wants more ammo for its prosecution of the war against Ukraine. And along those lines, Amara, very interestingly, we heard publicly from Putin last week, when he thanked South Korea for not sending lethal weapons to the battlefield to help out Ukraine. Because of that, there are more North Korea watchers who think, you know what, Russia may not go so far as to rock the boat on the Korean Peninsula because they are grateful for the South not sending lethal munitions to Ukraine.

Later today, the U.S. president plans to announce a change in the rules for undocumented immigrants who are spouses of U.S. citizens. Under the new rules, they will be allowed to apply for legal status without leaving the country. You would offer a path to citizenship for about 0.5 million people.Now, Donald Trump will spend the day campaigning in an important swing state and trying to make up for insulting its biggest city. Trump's rally today is in Racine, Wisconsin, which is just outside Milwaukee. Trump reportedly called Milwaukee a horrible city last week during a meeting with Republican lawmakers. He has tried to clarify that he was just talking about crime in the city. But of course, there is that little question that Trump has some work to do to repair his image in Wisconsin. Joining us now to discuss all of this is CNN Politics Senior Writer Stephen Collinson. Stephen, good to see you. [08:45:00] Let's first talk about this executive order that the president will unveil later today on immigration. Tell me about the why because we just saw a few weeks ago, this executive order that was cracking down on the border and asylum requests. And now, he is going to the other side of that, seemingly appeasing those progressives who were not happy about that other executive order.",

So I think that is one reason why the president is doing it. But clearly, you cannot look at this through anything but a political lens in an election year less than five months before Americans go to the polls.As you say, last week, when -- last month, when the present introduce those tightened asylum regulations that make it much harder for people coming through the border, he really did dismay a lot of progressive Democrats who he needs to show up to the polls in November. And he now is trying I think to redress the balance of that a little bit. This particular measure I think is going to be quite popular in states like Nevada and Arizona, out west where the president is behind Trump in many recent opinion polls. And he really needs to kind of make up the difference. So clearly, this is a political act. Republicans are sure to come out and say that he is basically giving people amnesty. That is going to encourage more people to come to the border. But he is on a balancing act between appeasing centrist voters who are worried about the border crisis and people in his own coalition who traditionally like a little bit more of a liberal policy towards these issues.",

So we have seen in recent weeks, the former President Trump try to cut into President Biden's margin among Black voters in big cities, which is a traditional Democratic stronghold. Polls show that Trump is polling about 20 percent of Black voters, which may not sound very much. But considering he only got about 8 percent in the last election, this suggests that the president has a few problems with his coalition.I don't think we would expect to see that reflected necessarily, those polls, in an election. But this is going to be such a close election that even if you points in states like Philadelphia, Wisconsin where Trump is today, or Michigan, the key states that will divide -- decide the election, a few thousand votes either way can make a big difference. In terms of the age issue, what you're seeing now is the Trump campaign and conservative media trying to make a great play out of videos at a Democratic fundraiser which appeared to show former President Barak Obama lead Trump off -- lead Biden offstage. Democrats in the warehouse say these videos are doctored, they are not true, but what I think it tells you is that the Trump campaign believes that the issue of President Biden's age, which -- he is 81 and many voters question whether he is fit for a second term, is a big one in this election.",

I think there is a couple of reasons for this. One is that the older voters now are not really the sort of post (inaudible) the World War II generation. They are baby boomers, and they are perhaps a little bit more in tune with Democratic values.Health care for the elderly is a massive issue in this election, as it is in all elections. And those voters, particularly attuned into the Biden message on this issue, and the fact that Republicans have repeatedly tried to overturn Obamacare, the federal health care law, which is not specifically for the elderly, but has given the impression that Republicans are less trustworthy on issues of health care. So I think that is one reason why these demographics are shifting. And in states like Florida and elsewhere, this could be interesting. As I was saying in reference to Michigan and Pennsylvania, these are going to be very tightly close -- tightly fought elections, a few thousand votes either way can make a big difference.",

So, that is a contrast a lot of voters are going to see in this debate.I think one interesting thing is that campaigns normally raise expectations for their opponent, Donald Trump has done exactly the opposite. He's basically given the impression that it will be a miracle if Biden can stand up for the two hours of this debate. That could sort of rebound against the former president. We saw Republicans take a similar stance ahead of the State of the Union address earlier this year when Biden put on a very robust performance and surprised many people and for a time, quelled questions about his age. So, if he is able to put in an energetic performance in this debate, former President Trump may regret some of his expectations game before the debate. President Biden is expected go up to the Camp David presidential retreat this week to practice. Trump doesn't really practice with debates. He plays Donald Trump on TV pretty much every day. He's got a big rally on Saturday night in Philadelphia, which will be according to his campaign, one of the preparations that he is taking for the debate. He thinks is pretty fast on his feet. We'll have to see whether he is taking things a little bit too easy. Don't forget, he skipped all the Republican primary debates this year. So he could be a little bit out of practice as well as the president.",
