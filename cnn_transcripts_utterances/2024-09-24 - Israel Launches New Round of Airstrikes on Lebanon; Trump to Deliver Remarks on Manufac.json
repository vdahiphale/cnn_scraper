Over 500 people have been killed in the strikes so far, in what's being described as the deadliest day in Lebanon in nearly two decades.Hezbollah firing back overnight, launching more than 100 rockets from Southern Lebanon into Northern Israel. So far, no one has been injured from those rockets. All of this coming as President Biden prepares to address world leaders on the global stage at the United Nations just hours from now.

For the Israeli government, it does seem that all options are on the table when it comes to a ground incursion. What they're talking about, they say, is whatever it takes to allow those 60,000-plus Israelis to get back to their homes close to the northern border. And the way that has been spelled out is Hezbollah has to pull back from the border region. So, strikes that Israel has had today into Lebanon. There's been two waves of them, airstrikes deep and into the north of Lebanon in the Bekaa Valley again, as yesterday, and closer to the border towns very much along the border, not only airstrikes as well, artillery and tank fire going across the border.But when it comes to actually putting troops over, it's not clear that that's going to happen the incoming over, well, approximately 100 incoming missiles from Lebanon into Israel today, some of those landing as far as sort of 30 miles inside Israel, some closer to the border, fires sparked in some areas on one man when a missile hit a road, got moderate shrapnel injuries and was evacuated to hospital here, according to medical authorities. But, by and large, there is no significant toll on the Israeli civilian population. Across the border in Lebanon, as you say, 558 now people killed since yesterday. And we understand that more than 90 are women and 50 of them are children. The tension remains extremely high. There are regular now sirens sounding in the north of Israel along the border and towns even deeper into the country.",

They're speaking today. But then later in the week on Thursday, we're expecting to hear from the Palestinian president as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And so the focus is really on what they plan to say about the situation as it stands on Thursday and what they see as any potential for a ceasefire that the U.S. administration has been working so hard behind the scenes to try to get in place. But it just underscores how much has changed since President Biden addressed this assembly this time last year. Then the focus was really on rallying world leaders around coming to Ukraine's defenses and trying to shore up support here at home for a massive funding package for Ukraine's defense. And while President Zelenskyy is expected to address the U.N. Security Council today and the assembly later in the week, U.S. officials say this, they say the world has changed and it's gotten more difficult in many ways, but they say that is the reason why President Biden is continuing to place a focus on the partnerships that he's fortified in the last four years and those partnerships are, they say, more important than ever.",

And so we're expecting to hear him hit on some of these very familiar themes, but also use it more as a capstone address to foment his legacy on foreign policy, to talk about what he's done over the last four years on climate policy. He's taking a meeting later in the day with a coalition of countries trying to fight fentanyl trafficking, all issues that he's worked on in the last four years as he tries to cement his place in history on the world stage.

I predict within 12 months it'll be down 50 percent. And if they get in, your energy costs are going through the roof, okay? They're going to go through the roof.

It's some of that fear mongering we hear from him repeatedly, just like last week when he was speaking to Jewish supporters in Washington, D.C. And he warned that if they do not vote for him, that Israel would not be a country anymore, that it would cease to exist. So, this is the same type of rhetoric we can expect.But I think looking ahead to Georgia, one of the reasons Donald Trump is talking about the economy is because we actually just saw that polling from The New York Times/Siena College poll that showed Donald Trump has a slight edge over Harris in Georgia. They, of course, want to keep that. But one of the key reasons in that polling that people voted for him was because they said that they believe that he could handle the economy better. So, of course, that is a key message, really the key message that Donald Trump wants to convey to voters as we look ahead to this final sprint. John?",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's hard to believe, Kate, that there's the potential for two major land-falling hurricanes in North America within a 72-hour period. We had hurricane, major Hurricane John, make landfall late last night. That surprised everyone, defied a lot of odds, made landfall along the southern coastline of Mexico.But what we're focusing here that's threatening, at least in the near term for the United States, is what is known as Potential Tropical Cyclone 9. Actually being influenced by some of the sheer or the upper level winds on the west side from Hurricane John that made landfall in Southern Mexico. Regardless, it's kind of keeping it disorganized in the western Caribbean. But believe me, it will strengthen, and that's associated and lined up with all the forecast. New this morning at 5:00 A.M. Hurricane watches issued for the big bend, including Tampa Bay. And then further than that, there's also storm surge watches for much of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula. In fact, 10 to 15 foot storm surge possible across the Big Bend, the catcher's mid of Florida by the peak of this storm with the potential of four to eight feet for Tampa Bay, lesser amounts as you head a little bit further south. Why are we getting impacts from this storm well away from the center? Well, we anticipate it to grow in size. So, the wind field and the storm surge component will expand as the storm approaches late Thursday into the day on Friday. It is forecast explicitly to become a major hurricane as it approaches the Big Bend late Thursday evening. That's why we have this category 3 just before landfall. And you can see the storm system traversing warm waters and really taking off, picking up in forward speed. So, as it enters Florida, it will quickly reach Georgia as a tropical storm and will bring the winds along with it, along with the heavy rainfall and the potential for flash flooding. And remember, a saturated ground in Georgia, lots of pine trees in the Florida panhandle, this will take down trees. This will also cause power outages. Rainfall totals from this storm could exceed half a foot. That's why we're anticipating this localized flashflood threat for the day on Thursday. That'll continue into Friday, right along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains. So, lots to talk about these storms really interconnected, Kate, from John to PTC9, which will soon be Hurricane Helene. Back to you.",
