It's a real contrast to former President Donald Trump, sometimes who has a very dark tone in his messaging and focusing on grievances. Senator Scott really forward- looking, arguing that America is a land of opportunity, not oppression. Sort of a version from what we heard of from Nikki Haley when she argued that America is not a racist country. He also suggests he has no appetite to take on his fellow conservatives. That he doesn't want to make this race about Trump or other Republicans also vying for the presidency. He says that the field of play is focusing on President Biden's failures. He spoke to Fox News earlier this morning. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): The field of play is focusing on President Biden's failures. What Americans want to see is the contrast between the radical left and the blueprint to ruin America and why our policies actually work. As opposed to trying to have a conversation about how to beat a Republican. I think we're better off having a conversation about beating Joe Biden. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're going to save consumers money. You know, these vehicles don't require as much maintenance. Obviously, the gas prices are a little steeper and electric vehicles will be cheaper over their lifespan.But we're also protecting communities and this planet. Listen, 10 billion tons of C02 avoided. That's almost like having no emissions from the transportation sector for a four year period. And the last point I'll make is, we're shoring up our energy security. If this proposal becomes final, we will see our dependence on foreign oil imports, you know, decreased by over 20 billion barrels. And so this is a really exciting proposal that codifies the president's vision for an electric future, a lower carbon future, but a future that wins the day in manufacturing and jobs as well.",

This has been part of his vision from day one.If you take a look at the bipartisan infrastructure law, billions of dollars invested and charging stations all across this country to reduce that range anxiety, billions of dollars in the Chips and Science Act to bring battery manufacturing and manufacturing back to the United States. And then with the Inflation Reduction Act, a $7,500 credit, a tax credit, for those who want to purchase these vehicles. So, in addition to that $7,000 -- $7,500 tax credit, folks who purchase electric vehicles will see a cost savings over the lifespan of the vehicle because they're not having to buy gas, because they're not having to pay for maintenance.

Some of us, I myself and my family, we keep our vehicles for 10 plus years, and buying a car is extremely expensive, especially now. More expensive now than we've seen in a very long time.

And so that's a really important, I think, improvement here. When you dig inside of these numbers, you can also see that gas prices, energy prices, down year over year. That's really important. You can see that overall month to month only up 0.1 percent. That's hardly at all. So that's the kind of number we want to see. In some of these sectors where a year ago, John, they were just going up, up, up, up, now, year over year, energy prices down. This is -- food prices moderating. And what I'm still concerned about here, though, is this number, this shelter number. Shelter here still, quote/unquote, sticky inflation, harder to turn around. You can't switch your cuts of meat like you can for grocery store prices like you can - you can't just change where you live every month to try to find someplace cheaper.

They said what they'd do is they wouldn't answer (INAUDIBLE) if they don't respond within seven days to this electronic notification, they're going to face all sorts of sanctions. They're going to have their driving license potentially suspended. They won't be able to buy and sell stuff.And they're going to be crucially banned from foreign travel. Now, that's important because you may remember back in September, when the Russian president announced what he called a partial mobilization of 300,000 people to fight in the -- in the conflict in Ukraine, we saw a max -- mass exodus of Russian men from the country. Estimates somewhere between 300,000 to 700,000 men. Sort of making a run for the border to try and -- to try and get out to avoid being sent to that bloody meat grinder conflict in Ukraine. This law will effectively stop Russian men from leaving the country once they've been issued this electronic notification. And so it's raising all sorts of concerns that if the Russian government wants to quickly bring more people into the -- into the military and avoid the chaos of last year, it's now got the legal means of doing so.
