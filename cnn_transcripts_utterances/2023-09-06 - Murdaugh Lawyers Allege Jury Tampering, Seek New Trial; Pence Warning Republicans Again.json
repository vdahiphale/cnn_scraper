In order for it to reach hurricane status, it needs to be 74 mile per hour or stronger sustained winds.So, what do we got in the future? Leeward Islands and Woodward Islands, Windward Islands, this is not a problem. But Leeward Islands, we need to keep a very close eye on this storm. The official track from the National Hurricane Center shows an intensifying hurricane becoming a major hurricane by this weekend. And then, notice this, what we call the path or cone of uncertainty, it's not including the Leeward Islands. But remember, the actual deviation of this if it was to, let's say, travel a little further to the southwest. The typical average error at day four and day five is roughly 150 to 200 miles. So, if that center of the storm creeps a little further to the south and west, the Windward Islands or Leeward Islands will be impacted by this. It will traverse very warm water with very low shear, that means it's favorable for a strengthening, rapidly intensifying hurricane. Explicit language from the National Hurricane Center, all of our computer models in tight consensus that's what it will do. But the big question on everyone's mind, not only will it have impacts into Puerto Rico, the Leeward Islands well, yes, indirectly at the moment, but will it impact the East Coast of the U.S. And that's all to do with the steering level, currents, high pressure to the north, and the potential of a trough off the East Coast for the middle half of next week.
