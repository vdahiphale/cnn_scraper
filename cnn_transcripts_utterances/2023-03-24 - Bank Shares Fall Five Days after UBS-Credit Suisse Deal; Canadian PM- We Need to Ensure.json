TGIF truly, TGI Fast and Furious week on \"FirstMove\", in many respects T is for TikTok rocked the CEO of the popular apps socked during a bipartisan battering on Capitol Hill. His privacy promises were mocked, and lawmakers made it clear they want it blocked. What's next for the app and its 150 million American users that are coming up? G, in the meantime, full global banks fresh worry in their ranks it's Deutsche Bank. Now under the spotlight, the cost of buying insurance against a Deutsche Bank default jumped to four year highs earlier today. Other European banks under pressure as well, we'll discuss. I, in the meantime for insurance, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen clarifying that comment about possible broader backing for big depositors in the U.S she's now promising to do more if necessary. To me it sounds like repetition, I'd argue her position didn't change them and it hasn't changed. Now a tempest in a treasury teapot perhaps in the meantime, F is for Fed Funds fate Jay Powell warning that tighter credit conditions may limit lending and negate the need for more rate hikes. We heard this on Wednesday too. An unprecedented degree of uncertainty for the U.S. Central Bank, as it continues the inflation fight. TGIF for fatigue may be what stock market investors are feeling today. We have a sea of red as you can see, across U.S. futures and across the European markets, they're the underperformers. Here's a look at some more banking blues, Deutsche Bank leading the declines currently down as you can see just over 9 percent. Commerzbank falling around 8 percent UBS under pressure too along with some of the French banks amid all this; we're seeing a flight to safety globally into government bonds. U.S. benchmark 10-year treasury yields now down at 3.31 percent, as you can see there, that's a 7-month low. The question is what's driving this? Anna Stewart joins us now. Rather you answer this question then me. Anna, great to have you with us, though I do notice actually the stock price there of Deutsche Bank is off the lows that we saw earlier on in the session.

There's also of course,expected I think 81 bonds have been lower across the board for European banks since Credit Suisse and the fallout and everything that happened there. Why Deutsche Bank? You know, this was a troubled bank; it was actually called the riskiest bank by the IMF in 2016, which I'm sure you'll remember. I'm trying to think back to all the stories we did, then, you know, there was the rate fixing scandal with LIBOR. There was money laundering, investigations, anti-bribery, scandals, green washing, it was unprofitable for a fair few years. But the difference between this bank and Credit Suisse is it did undergo a massive, restructure, and pretty successfully, it is now profitable. It meets all the capital liquidity requirements you would expect of a large European bank. The only thing I can think right now, and it's this is really a guessing game is that of all of the links, we're looking at weak links in Europe, Credit Suisse was the weakest and it did buckle under the broader sentiment of banking sector. Perhaps this is just still perceived to be one of those weak links and perhaps this is just buckling a little on a Friday?",

And we don't know what the group involved they are going to make of it. And what they're going to decide to do about it, irrespective of how much control and how much dependency they have on the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is what the United States was saying that they do. Those explosions we could see there look like they could be sort of secondary detonations that ammunition dump. And typically those have been the targets of previous retaliatory strikes. But I think one of the comments that John Kirby made earlier, and this gets to what you were saying just an hour ago, that the strikes came very quickly. He said we're monitoring the situation very closely. And it does seem as if the United States has a packet of target lists, a packet of targets that it's ready to target at a moment's notice. We don't quite know the lead time between the initial strike and U.S. response. But it does seem that there was an absolute readiness.

This is an extremely important topic. AI can help here, that's the great news. Many people don't know that actually, cancer detection is really hard. And in Europe, for instance, 2 doctors look at every single case in the U.S. that currently is one single doctor for every single case. The AI, how it can help is really by seeing completely different information on inaccessible to the human eye and human visual cortex and generally how humans process information. It can be consistent it can be brought to rural areas where it would be hard to bring specialists.

A doctor sees a couple of 1000 cases in a year and they have to in order to keep their certification. Our AI can look at and is getting trained on a couple of million cases. So it sees much more variety and it sees much more information than a doctor can see in a lifetime. And actually, what AI, modern AI is really good at is finding at what is the relevant information in the data, in the images, in the follow up information from historical patient records. And that is how the AI trains. It looks at what's in the images, what happens with the patient, it correlates those. Usually and then not necessarily human understandable way, but that's actually the power, if can think very differently from humans.

For AI, it has to generalize from what it has seen during training to completely unseen new patients, completely unseen new cases. That's the fundamental way that we are assessing AI, does it work? The question is does it generalize, so it has to work across different patients, different demographics, different ethnicities, different hardware, and that is the fundamentally hard thing, both to train it to work and to assess it to work. And how we know from our side is we tested it on hundreds of thousands of cases. And in European also tested in real life use where we have seen that the doctors using the AI were able to detect 13 percent more cancers than without it.

The first overseas visit, since the death of the King, since his accession to the throne, would have been to France. But that's no longer going to be the case because there would have been this very large, we're in anticipation of a very large series of demonstrations, right bang in the middle of their trip. They were due to come on Sunday leave on Wednesday for Germany. The demonstrations are scheduled for Tuesday, yesterday, more than a million people took to the streets in France amid demonstrations that turned violent in Bordeaux, where King Charles was due to visit with Camilla. In fact they burned the doors and the front of the facade of the City Hall, which was where they were due to being having lunch. So it would have been very much in their face. Very embarrassing, potentially for the Macron Administration, possibly even for the French people to have this sort of performance going on when there's 10,000 tonnes of rubbish accumulated on the streets of the French Capital as a result of the strikes in protest against these pension reforms Julia. So that has been put off into the summer. But we understand from Buckingham Palace that so far at any rate, they will be continuing with their trip to Germany, which will be the first overseas trip by the new King as I say, Julia?",

So that 30 plus percent of the people working for total, that French oil company, for example, were out on strike, that means that the rest were not. And the reason for that austerity, the credit crunch on people's pockets, is of course, being felt most keenly, among the least well paid. And it's the least well paid, who they argue, will be suffering the most as a result of these pension reforms. They don't get paid to go on strike. And so it's costly. It's also potentially embarrassing for the Union if they were to call a general strike, and they're not to be fulsome response to it. So they're relying on the street protests, these set peace demonstrations. There is anger on the streets. There are these spontaneous demonstrations but they're not huge four or five 6000 people maximum here in Paris over the last week in the spontaneous demonstration. So the unions are hoping to can maintain this pressure, but ultimately, unless the Constitutional Council throws the legislation out as unconstitutional, and note, there are no signs that they will, this legislation is a done deal, and Macron simply has to wait out this disruption. But his problem is that this disruption at the moment is got the broad support of the majority of French. A lot of opinion polls showing 60 to 70 percent support for these demonstrations. How long that support will last will depend on really how deep down they feel these pension reforms are? But ultimately Macron is insisting they are economically necessary. The pension deficit by 2027 will be 12.5 billion Euros. And he's saying that is unacceptable. He's unwilling. He's not - he is reluctant to impose these new changes on the French pension system. But he says they've got to go through and they in all probability they simply will, Julia.",
