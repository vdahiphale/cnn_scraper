But the thing is, the district attorneys office has to present a case, and they've done so in front of a grand jury based on the evidence they have. Why? I think this is amped up. And also, you know, sort of political as was just discussed is because they went into a grand jury, they certainly have enough evidence from what they've signaled to the public about having matching DNA or, excuse me, forensic evidence on -- on the water bottle allegedly found at the scene, on the kind bar wrapper found at the scene.Then law enforcement and the das office has signaled that they did a test firing of the 3D gun that was confiscated, allegedly from Luigi Mangione, and the firing of those bullets matched the casings at the scene. This case is so unusual. The behavior of law enforcement is so unusual, and the district attorney's office and the mayor's office of the city of New York that they are signaling this information about the strength of their case. It's not normal. It's not the way things are done. And to go into the grand jury and charge this as an act of terrorism, where the only way that we know that the insurance industry was allegedly targeted, or that the victim, Brian Thompson, was allegedly targeted because of his role at, at an insurance company is because law enforcement told us that through the media. Luigi Mangione allegedly did not publish his alleged manifesto. That's what the law enforcement is calling it. So far, we don't know that there's some kind of hit list here where he was going to allegedly take out more people. This might have been the -- a single act by someone who is mentally unstable, allegedly. Again, he's charged and innocent until a jury proves it.

And what John is not saying, but also I'm sure recognizing is that you also have a mayor who's there trying to distract from the fact that he's been indicted by the Southern District, which now has Mangione's case.All of this is a distraction. Joel Seidmann, I've known him. I served with him for seven years in his bureau. He's an incredibly bright. He's a prosecutor's prosecutor. He knows that evidence inside and out. And he pointed out something, as we were listening to before about the quantity of evidence. This is not a quantity of evidence issue. And frankly, it's not a quality of evidence issue. It's whether just because you can doesn't mean you should. And what I mean by that is you can go into a grand jury and charge anything you want within reason, and a grand jury will likely indict within reason. But this is not the appropriate case. Meaning this first degree felony, this first degree murder, just as it's not appropriate for the federal government to be involved, whether that means there was pressure by the insurance agency, whether they're sending a message. All this may be true, but that does not change the elements of the crime. And I will say the good thing about Joel, and which will be difficult to overcome, is he's not going to pay any attention to what's happening outside the courtroom from inside baseball perspective. He's going to do his homework and make sure it's presented properly. Karen has a big uphill battle. Not for all of the charges, because I really believe ultimately, DNA aside, video aside, he may have committed the acts, but did he commit the crime? Is there an insanity defense? Is that going to be something successful? And I would say one less thing, one other thing here. You know, the federal government, the southern district is claiming or potentially pursuing this, this felony complaint to an indictment, to a possible trial. Will they seek the death penalty? Well, their current president, who the current runs the show here now, at least through the rest of the year, just granted clemency to, I believe, 37 or 40 people on death row. What's going on here? This is really a power grab on the outside for a case that deserves attention, but no more than a domestic violence homicide and murder either. So let's be clear what were looking at.",

The committee highlights that she was going into her senior year of high school, and that she did receive $400 in cash. So that's one thing that they have documented with this witness testimony, but they've also documented a lot of the other pieces of these allegations against Matt Gaetz.They have things like text messages, text messages where Gaetz is asking an unnamed woman for what appears to be drugs, calling them cartridges, vitamins, complement of party favors. There's another text messages text message where he says he needs cartridges. And so, the -- the House Ethics Committee in this report brings together all of these allegations. We have so long been hearing about Matt Gaetz, saying, we believe that these allegations show that when he was a sitting member of Congress, he was engaging in prostitution. He was statutorily raping this 17- year-old in the state of Florida. And also that he was using illicit drugs. And then they go as far to put the environment of these parties together. And right. While all the women that the committee interviewed stated that their sexual activity with Representative Gaetz was consensual, at least one woman felt that the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have impaired their ability to really know what was going on, or fully consent. Indeed, nearly every woman that the committee spoke with could not remember the details of at least one or more of the events they attended with Representative Gaetz, and attributed that to drug or alcohol consumption. And a reminder, this isn't just a random member of Congress.

Kedric Payne, former deputy chief counsel at the office of congressional ethics, and Tom Dupree, former principal deputy assistant attorney general in the George W. Bush administration. Tom, I want to start with you. The ethics report, it not only outlines the substantial evidence of state law violations, as you heard, Katelyn, kind of roll through, including statutory rape, prostitution also raises the question of potential charges at the state level in Florida. Do you see a scenario where state prosecutors pursue charges based on this report? Well, I think the state prosecutors have to take a look at this report. TOM DUPREE, FORMER PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, GW BUSH ADMIN.:  Look, I mean, this report is exceedingly serious. It recites a litany of vice, including conduct that could potentially be criminally charged. I think the state prosecutors would have to wrestle with a few things. One is they would have to make sure there's not a statute of limitations issue, because some of this conduct occurred allegedly 7 or 8 years ago. The other thing they'd have to do is just make the decision whether or not they could prove their case against Gaetz beyond a reasonable doubt. The House committee isn't bound by any sort of standards of proof. They can put their accusations in the report. But for a prosecutor, you have to make sure you have the evidence. You have to think about what witnesses am I going to put on? How will I build a case? How will I ultimately persuade a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard known to American criminal law that they could convict Matt Gaetz for this conduct?",

But I think were in a different world here because Gaetz not only was the nominee for attorney general, but he said that he intends to remain involved in politics in Florida in the future.

I don't know if you recall the reporting a couple of years ago that suggested that there was a secret slush fund of funds in Congress that they would sort of issue out to a slew of potential victims of alleged sexual abuse or harassment by members of congress. And that reporting kind of went nowhere. And so I'm sort of the mindset, I think what is alleged here is, is troubling. But I would also like to see how often are members of Congress paying out individuals that they have alleged to have harassed or sexually assaulted in some type of potentially illegal way. And so I don't think the mail should stop here, if you will. I think we should go forward. Open up the door, let us see what these guys are doing and let us see how they're paying off individuals with taxpayer dollars. I think it's a big problem.",

So, look, I think obviously in the Donald Trump era, I guess you can never say never say never about somebody's political futures. We've seen a lot of people who in previous times would have been down for the count, have comebacks, including, many would say, Trump himself. I think it is very hard to see a world where Matt Gaetz, who as we know from reporting from his colleagues on the Hill, has openly bragged about some of the behavior that he's now trying to suggest, you know, is -- doesn't comport with what the report found.

And we saw that \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting that recently came out several days ago, that pretty much indicated that its been the presidents aides and advisers that are kind of running the White House. That's very concerning. Now, as it pertains to Mr. Musk, there have been other incrediblywealthy individuals in the past in our country's history who have played major roles in helping keep the country alive and moving forward. I remember about 100 years ago, give or take, you had a super wealthy individual. I think it was Rockefeller, if I recall correctly, who helped save the country from going bankrupt. I could be wrong with the name here. My point is, though, that we have seen highly successful people in this country who have been some of the wealthiest people in our country's history that have done significant things to help move the needle forward in terms of governance. For the average American person, I don't think Mr. Musk is any different. He shouldn't be treated any differently. And I welcome some of his suggestions based off of his expertise, expertise and his obvious success. But look at the amazing things this guy is doing that no one else has done in terms of changing the way we travel, changing our ability to get to space in a more effective and cost effective ways. Those things shouldn't be discounted. If he can get a rocket to the moon and maybe even to Mars, why not take his advice in terms of cutting some of the government waste and making sure that we actually have a budget, which we haven't had in a very long time?",

Its kind of a it has an America First sort of beating your chest sense of America has a right to take and do whatever it wants. I can see the messaging value behind saying Panama is charging these exorbitant fees, and were going to do everything we can to prevent that from happening.I think there are a couple of issues with this from a substantive perspective. One, there's not a lot of mechanisms available here to achieve what Trump claims he's trying to achieve. I don't imagine he wants to send, you know, American boots on the ground to Panama to forcibly take the canal. I can't imagine that's something he's interested in doing. You know, so is this a realistic, thing that he's putting out there? Not really. And then secondly, there's a China component to this. I mean, the Panama Canal is a neutral zone. That was part of the reasoning behind the signing over of the canal to Panama. And the treaty that did so was to ensure that it would remain a neutral zone. And there's concern and debate about the increasing influence of China in the region. So there's also, you know, there's reasons to think about how provocative behavior in that area could potentially move the Panamanians toward China, which is presumably not an outcome Donald Trump wants to see. So there are real policy impacts behind what he's saying here. You know, to me, this feels a lot more like a big messaging moment and a very kind of classically Trumpian one than a real policy priority for his team moving forward.

She alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment and sexual harassment by Justin Baldoni and another male producer on the film. She says that there were unwanted sexual comments made that some kisses within the film were prolonged when they weren't scripted to be, and she says that Justin Baldoni and this other male producer, who is named in this complaint, came into her trailer numerous times when she was undressed or breast feeding her newborn. Now, aside from those accusations of sexual harassment, what's making this really a talking point in a really interesting case is that Blake Lively says that she was now subjected to retaliation. She says that Justin's team coordinated a sophisticated smear campaign behind the scenes. Now, Justin's team is denying this. They say in part, it is shameful that miss lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations as yet another desperate attempt to fix her negative reputation.
