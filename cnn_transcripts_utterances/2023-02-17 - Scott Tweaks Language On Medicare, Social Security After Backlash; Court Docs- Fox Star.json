The President used Scott's Rescue America plan as a hammer to hit Republicans on Social Security and Medicare. The original language said this, quote, \"All federal legislation sunsets in five years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again.\"But today, the Florida Republican senator has some edits to that plan. The new language reads, quote, \"All federal legislation sunsets in five years, with specific exceptions of Social Security, Medicare, national security, veterans' benefits, and other essential services. If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again. Note to President Biden, Senator Schumer, and Senator McConnell, as you know, this was never intended to apply to Social Security, Medicare, or the U.S. Navy.\" Our panel is back. That's a lot.

But according to newly released court filings, they knew that those claims were, in their own words, ludicrous and totally off the rails. And they even mocked Trump's adviser and attorney Sidney Powell, who was pushing the false claims.Shortly after the 2020 election, Tucker Carlson texts Laura Ingraham and says, \"Sidney Powell is lying by the way. I caught her. It's insane.\" Ingraham then responded to him, \"Sidney is a complete nut. No one will work with her. Ditto with Rudy.\" And in the deposition, Sean Hannity testified that the whole narrative that Sidney was pushing, \"I did not believe it for one second.\" Those texts and testimony are part of a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems, suing Fox News for $1.6 billion for defamation. My panel is back with me to discuss. This, if you were paying attention at the time, is not entirely surprising, because you could see when the shift happened for Fox. There was some skepticism at first, and then they started to worry that their viewers were going away. I want to bring up one other part of the messages from this lawsuit. This is a message from Tucker Carlson about one of Fox's White House correspondents, Jacqui Heinrich, who had basically, factually, accurately, fact checked President Trump. And here's what Tucker says. He says, \"Please get her fired. Seriously, what the f? I'm actually shocked. It needs to stop immediately, like tonight. It's measurably hurting the company.

They are defending more than 20 seats, including three in states that Donald Trump easily won in 2020. Two of them, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and Montana's Jon Tester haven't decided if they're going to run again, and it could put the Democrats currently -- current one seat majority in even more jeopardy.They talked about all of that with Manu Raju, who's also here with us. So Manu, they're facing obviously some really tough decisions. They are plan A, B and C for the Democrats. RAJU: Yes, it's a really difficult bat for them. Look, the Democrats are defending 23 seats, Republicans just 11. There are very few, if any, pick up opportunities for the Democrats. On the Republican side, you know, they're in a 51-49 minority right now. But if Joe Manchin decides to step aside and retire, that seat is probably gone. There's probably virtually no way Democrats can hold that seat. Jon Tester, if he steps aside in Montana, also very possible that that seat can flip. And Ohio Sherrod Brown told me that he is planning on running, but that is still going to be a difficult race. It's unclear what Bob Casey will do in Pennsylvania. He just had treatment for prostate cancer. There's some expectation that he will run, but if he doesn't, that would be a problem as well. Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, is moving behind the scenes to try to prevent any retirements. When there's a retirement, that could create a problem for their party. But there are also other wild cards that will be interesting to see what happens here. In Arizona, what does Kyrsten Sinema do? She's an independent now, and she's debating whether to run for re-election. But there's a Democratic candidate in that race right now, and there's also potential of a hard right Republican candidate. We talked about Kari Lake in the last segment. She's considering running.
