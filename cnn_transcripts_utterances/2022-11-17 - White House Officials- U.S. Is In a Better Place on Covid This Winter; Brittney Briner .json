      "sentences": "Less than 5 percent of Americans live in an area considered to have a high community spread of COVID right now. That's down from more than a quarter of the population in February. Still, forecasts predict that new COVID cases will likely increase over the coming weeks while other viruses like RSV and the flu also continue to spread.Let's bring in White House COVID-19 response coordinator, Dr. Ashish Jha. Dr. Jha, great to see you. Let's talk about COVID and what you expect to happen this winter. Obviously, we're all getting ready to celebrate Thanksgiving with our family and then Hanukkah, and then Christmas. And so, if you look back at what happened last year, exactly a year ago, things were down. COVID cases were down, and then you see a huge spike if we put up this graphic in December and January, and then it levels off again, you know, in March and April. Are you expecting to see that again this year? DR. ASHISH JHA, WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 RESPONSE COORDINATOR: Yes, Alisyn, thanks for having me back. What I would say is we know that the virus circulates more efficiently when the weather is colder. People are spending more time indoors. And as you said, each of the last two winters we have seen an increase in COVID cases and I think it stands to reason that we're going to see that again. I'm hoping we're not going to see anything like the spike we saw in January. But we may very well still see a lot more infections in the weeks and months ahead. The good news though is that we can gather safely. We can do all these things if people go ahead and get that updated bivalent vaccine that's available. Get treated if you have a breakthrough infection. We're just in a very different place. People can do those things, but you got to be careful and you got to be able to make that sure your vaccines and your immunity is up to date for the holiday season ahead.",

So, you know, not everybody's gotten their -- been inoculated for all of that. So, how do you think coupled with RSV and the flu it looks this winter? JHAflu vaccine and a COVID vaccine. That's going to keep people out of the hospital. So, if people get up to date on those two vaccines, it's going to make an enormous difference. That said, RSV is still out there, primarily impacting the youngest kids and the elderly. What we know is RSV spreads a lot through surfaces so washing hands, keeping surfaces clean that can make a difference. I really do think we're at a point, Alisyn, where if people sort of take basic precautions, get up to date, we can manage all of these respiratory viruses and make sure that our health care system doesn't get overwhelmed.",

I think there is a good reason to be optimistic this is going to get addressed quickly.But in terms of how many people rely on Adderall. I mean, obviously, kids in school rely on it in function and even people -- adults in workplaces rely on it to function. I mean, what are they supposed to do for the next month or two?",

First of all, as a person who's practiced medicine for 20 years, we have seen this on and off where important medicines, especially if they don't have a lot of manufacturers will have these kinds of troubles. The FDA works very closely with them.[15:35:00] If you are somebody who is really reliant on Adderall, needs it, speaking to your doctor, there are other formulations. There are other medicines. There are other ways of dealing with whatever the underlying health issue is that Adderall is addressing. None of these things are perfect, right. None of them are perfect. But what we need to do is continue to work as the FDA is doing, to get these medicines back online and get them out to Americans as quickly as possible. And to make sure that we're doing it safely.

Good news is most of the time there's another alternative antibiotic that people can take. But FDA is really on top of this working with the manufacturers, making sure that these medicines come back online.One of the key things that I would sort of say to my family and friends is that doing everything you can to stay healthy. Being up to date on your vaccines, taking good care of yourself, reducing the need for medicines like amoxicillin, avoiding infections, that's going to be a really important part of getting through this time period while these medicines get back onto the marketplace.",

And they said she's doing as well as can be expected, adapting, trying to stay strong in her new environment. And we really don't know much about the specifics of what her new environment is.But penal colonies in Russia are known for very harshly treating the prisoners there. They can face torture, according to the State Department report on human rights. They can face torture sometimes that leads to death. They can face hard work in those camps, and there are instances where the authorities are getting certain prisoners to go after and to bully other prisoners. It is not a great environment. So, we don't know the specifics here, but what we do know is that the stories, the reports from people who have been in Russian penal colonies are not great. And of course, that is of high concern to Brittney Griner and all of those who are close with her here in the United States. Now the State Department was not informed by Russia officially that she has actually moved to this penal colony. A State Department spokesperson said that is something that they strongly protest. And this also comes as just last week, President Biden said that he was hopeful that after the midterm elections maybe Russia would be more willing to have serious dialogue with the United States over a prisoner swap to get out Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan who is another American wrongfully detained in the country. But so far, we haven't heard any positive progress on that front -- guys.",

Then that certainly is going to lead so some public safety concerns. And that's why starting tonight we are just expecting here some of the snowfall accumulation. At least the rate to be anywhere from potentially up to 4 inches an hour. And when you're going to continue to see this lake-effect snow for next possibly 48 hours, then the result could be perhaps one of the snowiest three-day periods that Buffalo has seen. The record back in December of 2001 with about 4 1/2 feet. So, that iswhy officials here on the ground saying that a little bit of the sun that we're seeing right now, that could be a bit deceiving that later tonight is when we'll begin to see that lake-effect snow.

There will be lightning just like we get in a very strong thunderstorm when the rains are very, very heavy. But basically, the winds are going to steer where this snow is going to go because lake-effect snow is caused by the warmer water temperature, and the difference between the colder air above it. So, when those cold winds flow over the lake, it generates all these clouds and then the snow falls on the east side of the lake when the wind is from that direction. So, we're going to see the snow continue to fall. The winds are basically going to eventually steer it into Buffalo by the time we get into tonight and that's when it's really going to intensify.We're going to look at anywhere from say like Polo was saying, 3 to 4 inches an hour. We could see 2 to 4 feet of snow around Buffalo and the latest National Weather Service discussion came out saying we could see up to 5 feet. So, this could definitely be historic.
