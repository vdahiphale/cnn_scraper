Cassandra Welchin, executive director of the state's Black Women's Roundtable, tells MichelMartin how she's trying to increase turnout and counter suppression. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The presidential cavalcades are hitting Nevada and Arizona as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump target key swing states just days before Tuesday's election. Some good news came today for Democrats and the White House. New economic data showing inflation has cooled again and prices are climbing at a slower rate compared to last year. So, far across the United States, tens of millions of Americans have already cast their vote. And yes, you've probably heard this before, a lot, but the election remains on a knife edge. So, what votes are still winnable and where are they? Joining me now with the very latest is Jeff Zeleny. He's on the ground in Hartford, Wisconsin. Jeff, welcome. So, answer that question first. Are there undecided still out there? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Christiane, believe it or not, after millions and millions of dollars of television ads and campaign visits, there are some undecided voters that we do still find in our conversations. But they may be undecided for a couple different reasons. Some are undecided whether they will vote at all. They're fed up or not satisfied with either candidates. Some are, though, here in the suburbs, or in an exurban suburb of Milwaukee, where some independents and even some moderate Republicans are still trying to decide if Vice President Kamala Harris is suitable to them. They've decided against Donald Trump, but they are still trying to see some more from her. But look, by and large, I think most have decided, but there is still that sliver, and in these races where there's no clear leader, remarkably, in any of the seven battleground states, those few voters actually can matter.",

And Trump himself I think is trying to reach out, it sounds like it anyway, to women. And I wonder what you make of what he said -- just the latest thing he said. He declares he will quote, \"protect women whether the women like it or not.\" And this comes a day after Nikki Haley, who, you know, ran against him and now is a supporter, said that his campaign is making women uncomfortable. What are you hearing from women about that, and what does that mean? Have you tried to -- have you figured out whether they like it or not?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, the ones who are in the rally -- actually, Donald Trump said that right here in Wisconsin. His base supporters, of course,like most everything he says. But the challenge, of course, is he needs more than his base to win. He needs to reach out to some of those people who are not at his rallies, who are not hanging on every word, and that is what is really sort of causing many moderate Republicans we're talking to, Nikki Haley, of course, to cringe at the type of language he is using when talking about women. One thing is clear. The gender gap in this presidential race is likely to be the highest that we have seen. Vice President Harris has strong support from women. Donald Trump, of course, has stronger support from men. But, you know, for men, abortion rights also an issue, but hearing the former president talk about women in that way, it's not something his advisers often like to hear, but of course he does it all the same. So, I think that that language, it's not helpful to the people who have not yet decided. And outside of his rally crowds, it's likely not helpful at all.",

Thousands of Lebanese people have been killed since Hezbollah and Israel began trading fire last year, and more than a million have been displaced.

We had an economic collapse that led people to lose their life savings to banks. We had a port explosion that literally shattered most of our capital, and a political stalemate that's been suffocating the country for years and in which I have to say, Hezbollah was playing a huge role. And this is only our recent history. Starting 1975, we had a horrific civil war, a series of assassinations and explosions, several confrontations between Israel and Hezbollah. And I can tell you many of us Lebanese are thinking now, you've got to be kidding me. We thought we had reached the bottom of the pit already, but the pit seems to be bottomless. I mean, why can't we just live instead of surviving? I'm sure -- I mean, Sisyphus at this point would say, enough is enough. I'm not climbing up that mountain with the rock on my shoulders again.",

I mean, I really -- I mean, we cannot afford the luxury of optimism, and maybe thisis where -- what I'm saying is coming from. But at the same time, I refuse to believe that there was no political alternative to this disaster that we are going through. I mean, Netanyahu keeps saying he wants to get rid of Iran's tentacles in the region, whether it's Hamas or Hezbollah or the Houthis. But why doesn't he cut the head of the octopus directly instead? I'm sure he knows that if he only cuts the tentacles, new tentacles will grow again later. So, why does he spend days and weeks consulting on how to hit Iran? But when it comes to hit Lebanon, he's hitting savagely and without hesitation. As for Khamenei, he has the nerve and the insolence to keep telling the Lebanese to resist, to go on fighting the big, you know, Satan, that is Israel and the U.S. So, basically, he's telling us to keep dying for him and for Iran. Why doesn't he fight them directly instead? These are the questions that I'm hearing around me. Why doesn't he fight them for real instead of doing his laughable staged hits just to save face? Why doesn't he send his men to die? Why doesn't he tell his women and children that it's OK to lose everything for the sake of the great cause? I think they're all liars.

We are now paying the price of what this corrupt political elite has been doing for years. So, this -- all this talk about reshaping the Middle East and making Netanyahu sound like the liberator of the Lebanese, it makes me even more angry and frustrated. He is not a liberator. He is a criminal. I repeat, there should have been and there could have been a political solution to this problem, to the problem in the region, but nobody wanted this. And let's not forget that war is also a lucrative business. It's very cynical. Politics are very cynical and many people are making money out of this. They are getting financial gains, power gains.

And one thing that I say is, you know, policy is the work of our democracy, but the vote is the heart of our democracy. And so, for me, I wanted to make sure that liberation really stood tall with voting. And so, we took that opportunity and began to say, how can we increase the voting population of black women, particularly infrequent black women? And with that information, we develop an intentional voter engagement training plan that was rooted in culture, rooted strategically, and with the intensity of a boot camp, because we understand that our voting rights are under attack.

And so, our young people are showing up, you know, to the polls and having these conversations.

Now, when we talk about these issues that we are seeing in community, many of them understand that and see that. But when we go over to, you know, less friendly legislators who really want to be more restrictive, one of the things that we hear is that we want to prevent fraud from occurring. And we know that in Mississippi, that's very few and in between. There's not a lot of data that support there is fraud. And so, there's a lot of disinformation that's occurring. And so, we just continue to educate, this is what we're seeing in communities and we continue to stand together as a coalition to make sure that our community is brought to the policy table so that they can get access to the right to vote. Because what this really is about, Michel, at the end of the day, too, is how people who we elect in office really has an impact on what happens to people's kitchen tables, making sure their wages are increased. Mississippi hasn't had a wage increased, right? It's still $7.25 cents.",

And so, racism runs through this, through and through, like you can't deny that. You know, this is why I think the John Lewis Voting Rights Act is so important. That was once upon a time before it was struck down, where we had preclearance. Before any rules or policies or anything was changed, you know, a state or jurisdiction had to get preclearance from the Department of Justice or higher court in D.C. to ensure that there wasn't, you know, voter suppression. Well, that went away. And so, we don't have that kind of protection now. And so, we have to continue to push hard and do the groundwork to ensure that everyone understand where their polling location is, check their voter status and then let's help try to get people out to the polls while also working, at the same time, to push for early voting, online voter registration, those kinds of things.",
