      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. At this hour, President Biden heading back to the White House to face more questions over still more classified documents found at his home. Plus, it is raining again. Right now in California, the relentless storms are causing widespread destruction. We're going to take you there.We're also going to speak to lieutenant governor about the situation. And the search for survivors amid the rubble of a bombed out apartment complex in Ukraine now one of the deadliest strikes on civilians there since the start of the war. This is what we're watching At This Hour. Thank you for being everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan. We're keeping an eye on the White House this hour because President Biden is returning to the Oval Office to get back to work. And he finds himself under fire once again over his handling of classified documents and the conflicting explanations that have been coming out from his team. Over the weekend, the White House revealed five additional pages of classified material were found at Biden's home in Delaware leading the chair of the House Oversight Committee to now request that the White House turn over evidence about that material and more as part of the Congressional investigation. The Republican chairman is now preparing. The White House has not formally responded to Chairman Comer's demands yet, but the administration says that they are cooperating with government authorities that we now know, is investigating. Let's start right there. MJ Lee at the White House, she's joining us right now. So MJ, what are you hearing At This Hour?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, the White House is fully playing defense right now, after we learned over the weekend, about five additional pages of classified documents that were found at President Biden's Wilmington home on Thursday, which we're told were immediately turned over to the DOJ as a part of this ongoing investigation.And we actually just got a response from the White House Counsel's Office to calls from some Republican lawmakers like Chairman Comer, asking for more information related to these classified documents, including potentially visitor's logs to his Wilmington home, the White House Counsel's office saying there are no visitors logs. They said in a statement, his personal residence is personal. We are also told by the Secret Service that they also do not maintain any visitor's logs to his Wilmington home. Now this comes after the weekend where we saw the President's personal lawyer Bob Bauer putting out a very lengthy statement, trying to explain the different processes that the White House has followed throughout this whole saga. And trying to sort of balance he said, the need for transparency but also not interfering with an ongoing DOJ review. As a part of that statement, Bauer said that personal lawyers to the President do not have active security clearances. And he says that in this statement, whenever a document bearing classified markings was identified, the search was suspended. The potentially classified material was left in place as found. The government was then promptly notified. And it is for this reason that the President's personal attorneys do not know the precise number of pages in the discovered material, nor have they reviewed the content of the documents consistent with standard procedures and requirements. Now, I should note that over the weekend, the White House Counsel's Office also said, because a special counsel has now been appointed to investigate this matter, they are going to now refer all questions on these issues to the special Counsel's Office. So Kate, we certainly expect that to be the ongoing response and it's sort of the excuse that we get from the White House going forward.",

I'll read just part of the statement one more time that MJ read in terms of what we heard over the weekend, when more documents were discovered.The President's personal attorneys have attempted to balance the importance of public transparency where appropriate with the established norms and limitations necessary to protect the investigations integrity, this coming from Bob Bauer, what do you make of that?",

The Justice Department doesn't have any position on whether a person who's subject to an investigation talks or not. As a prosecutor, you would never tell the Biden team or anyone you're investigating, hey, you can't talk publicly about that.You actually understand as a prosecutor, that it's completely up to that person. Now, on the other hand, it's completely reasonable. And I think smart from a legal perspective for Bob Bauer, for the lawyers for Joe Biden to say, we're not going to comment on this. This is an ongoing criminal investigation. There will be things that come out in the normal course of the sort of public proceedings here, but the best move just strictly, legally, is to stay quiet. Now, of course, this isn't your typical case. This is the sitting president. So there's a political balance that has to be struck as well.",

So Paula, on this point of how MJ was saying that they're referring all questions now to the Special Counsel's Office, obviously, because the Special Counsel is now investigating, we have seen the White House Press Secretary fielding continued questions about what was known and when, how transparent they have been and are being.I had former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on with me last week, and he actually raised what a distraction this can become for the White House raised at the White House, what a problem that he sees a White House running point on this as a real issue. He also offered a solution. Let me play this for you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALBERTO GONZALES, FORMER U.S. ATTY. GENERAL UNDER PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH: I think if I were advising the President, I would try to move this out of the White House. Have the lawyers be the ones that speak for in connection with the investigation to the public, have a private spokesperson so that the White House Press Secretary hasn't -- doesn't have to deal with it again, because there's so much need attention of the White House and the White House staff, the President.

They're the ones that came out and released these statements will from the White House and from the President's personal attorney, disclosing the fact that in fact, what they thought was just one single page was actually six pages comprising of multiple documents.But they also effectively said don't get used to it. We're not going to come out and update you on every development. We want to defer to the ongoing Justice Department special counsel investigation, but it's impossible to completely divorce these questions from the White House itself. Now, I agree it would probably be best if the press secretary wasn't, I wouldn't use the word fielding, I would use the word deflecting these questions from the podium. But you have the president himself answering questions. You know, he gave an answer last week, a little flippant about why these classified documents were in the same garage as his sports car. He also offered some information about where these documents were found. It was described as an adjacent room, he identified the room incorrectly, they had to walk that back. So it is absolutely accurate that they probably need to come up with a more accurate, more controlled communication statement or plan. It does appear that they are moving in that direction. But the biggest thing is they got to get the president on message and speaking correctly, if he speaks at all about this.",

DOJ cannot answer and should not answer questions about specific ongoing investigation, because if they do that, that's going to set a very dangerous precedent.So if they tried to get Merrick Garland to testify about the specifics of either case, I think Merrick Garland needs to say absolutely not.

But what has happened is they don't have that spending restraint or that tax cutting restraint. And in fact, you have a debt ceiling that goes up and up and up $31 trillion is what it is right now.
