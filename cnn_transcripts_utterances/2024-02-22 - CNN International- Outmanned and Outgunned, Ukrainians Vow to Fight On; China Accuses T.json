If you're just joining us, here are some of our top stories today.We are learning new details about the dual U.S.-Russian citizen detained in Russia on treason charges. Russia's federal security services accuse Ksenia Karelina of collecting money to buy medicine, equipment, weapons and ammunition for Ukraine. Her employer in Los Angeles says she donated $51 to a Ukrainian charity in the U.S. Now to the growing international fallout over the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The U.K. is slapping sanctions on six individuals from the IK-3 penal colony prison, banning them from traveling to the U.K. and freezing their assets. Later this week, the U.S. will unveil a new raft of sanctions against Russia intended to hold President Vladimir Putin accountable for his invasion of Ukraine and the death of Navalny. Those sanctions will come just before the second anniversary of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Two years into the war, Ukrainian troops are outgunned and they're outnumbered. But as Christiane Amanpour reports, they're not giving up the fight despite the heavy price that they've already paid. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voice-over): Snow falls softly on new recruits for the Ukrainian Army 3rd Assault Brigade. Drill sergeants push them through their paces with urgent basic training for the trenches, urban warfare and assault maneuvers. Every woman and man counts now for a battle that seems to have returned to the dire days at the start. 28-year-old Serhii came back from Lithuania to serve two weeks ago despite his health.",

On a brief hiatus in the rear, they've had to buy their own mortar, small caliber just for self-defense. Problem is, no ammunition. Anastasia practices perfecting her balance, her endurance, regaining the strength to shoulder her weapons. And she wants to go back to the front. I think anything is possible, she says. But whatever happens, we all need to fight this together, because the enemy is advancing.

Russian media and bloggers are reporting that Andrei Morozov's death was a suicide. He had supported Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and fought alongside Russian troops in the 2022 offensive. But on Tuesday, Morozov said he had been forced to delete a post from his Telegram channel without naming who gave the order.Meanwhile, Russia's foreign minister is in Rio de Janeiro for the G20 Foreign Minister Summit. Sergey Lavrov didn't speak with his American counterpart during the photo session. It's not clear if he and the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will talk at any point during the summit. They did meet briefly on the sidelines of last year's event, meeting -- well, the meetings do get away in just a few hours. Search and rescue operations are underway after a cargo ship slammed into a bridge in southern China. At least two people were killed as the collision snapped the bridge in half. According to state media, two vehicles on the bridge fell into the water while three others landed on the ship. Three people are still missing. We're now hearing differing accounts about what may have happened when a Chinese boat capsized last week, leaving two Chinese fishermen dead. CNN's Marc Stewart is following both sides of the story from Beijing. Very sensitive issues in these areas, as always. And, of course, two people have died. But the accusations are really flying on this. Just explain the idea of this cover-up.",

It's a measure that's reminiscent of the Trump era and one that is sure to face fierce pushback from immigrant advocates and Democrats.Now, sources tell CNN that the White House is considering invoking an authority in immigration law and applying it to those who cross the border between ports of entry, therefore those who are crossing illegally. Now, an administration official says that multiple options are being evaluated and no decision has been made. A White House spokesperson saying in a statement, quote: No executive action, no matter how aggressive, can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources Congress can provide and that Republicans rejected. We continue to call on Speaker Johnson and House Republicans to pass the bipartisan deal to secure the border. The White House there referring to that compromise that was struck in the Senate that included some of the toughest measures on border security in recent memory but was later tanked by Republicans. Now, President Biden said during those negotiations that he would welcome the authority to shut down the border. While it's unclear what exactly this executive action would look like, it appears to be an extension of some of those negotiations. Now, it's also important to note that this is a measure that is similar to that of the Trump administration. Former President Donald Trump also tried to shut down the border with a similar authority, but that was challenged in the courts. This executive action, should the White House move forward with it, will also likely be challenged in court. Priscilla Alvarez, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
