But will that be enough to power President Biden to reelection a year from now?Plus, it's debate night in America. Five Republican candidates will take the stage in Miami tonight. Absent once again, the far and away frontrunner. So is tonight's based off really just a race for second. And new reporting on the Democratic divide over Israel. Here what some Jewish Democrats are saying about members of their own party who voted against the resolution supporting Israel's war against Hamas. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We started of course, with last night's election results. President Biden summed it up like this. He said, \"across the country tonight Democrats won and MAGA lost, voters vote, polls don't. Now let's go win next year.\" CNN political director David Chalian has more from what happened last night at the magic wall. David, what did we see? And what does it mean?",

      "sentences": "Well, as you said, Dana, abortion rates, proving it is still very politically potent. In a post roe America, we saw that Ohio ballot measure where it was on the ballot, passed pretty resoundingly. And take a look at what happened in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Democrats not only held on to their control of the state Senate, but they flipped control of the House of Delegates.As Glenn Youngkin was trying to seek unified Republican control, he got the exact opposite of that. And the battle over abortion rights and the battle for America's suburbs were playing big into that. As for that Ohio ballot measure, we had an exit poll in Ohio. And I want you to take a look here. This is among independent voters and how they split on this. 64 percent of independent voters in Ohio yesterday, voted in favor of issue one, enshrining abortion rights into the constitution 36 percent of independent saying -- said no. White college educated women 65 percent voted yes to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution 35 percent voted no. And Dana, just to show you in our brand-new CNN poll. Looking ahead to 2024, we asked people across the country this is among registered voters. What's your most important issue in voting for president next year in 2024. 33 percent save the economy, 12 percent voting and election integrity, 12 percent immigration, 10 percent gun policy, abortions at 7 percent. Now that doesn't mean it's not politically potent. We see it doing wonders for Democrats at the ballot box. It just means when we asked voters what their most important issue is, it is still resoundingly the economy. And then one other note from our poll that is just stunning to see. 25 percent of Americans that is it. One quarter of them in this poll say that Joe Biden has the stamina and sharpness to serve, 74 percent say he does not. Dana?",

Taken together the results in Kentucky, Virginia, and Ohio spelled out a good night for Democrats. But the question is, does that translate that strong voter turnout to 2024 when President Biden is on the ticket?Now, of course, abortion is still a key motivator. It's something that campaign officials have come back to, it reinforces that that is a motivator, bringing voters out to the polls, and President Biden released a statement last night on that Ohio measure saying, \"tonight, Americans are once again voted to protect their fundamental freedoms and democracy won.\" Saying that the Republican agenda is out of set. The president also making a series of calls last night to the winners. And clearly, there is fresh confidence in the campaign and at the White House after seeing the result yesterday and after a series of polls that spelled out a troubling sign ahead for the year to come in November. Now, of course, the president is still fanning out across the country. He'll be in Illinois tomorrow to talk about the economy to keep selling that agenda.",

But again, then 22 people went back to this MAGA, kind of MAGA extremism, and combined with some of the, you know, more extremist on abortion.And then also, you know, now I think with this speaker of the House kind of Mike Murphy who already reminds you of the pastor from Footloose. So, you know, we have this picture of men from -- in the Republican Party who are making these decisions, largely for women, and there's not a conversation. They're just coming in and saying this is what we're going to do. And they're scaring people. They're scaring people in Ohio. They scare people, you know, in the seven states that have had abortion referendums, now, four of them have been red states. So, the men in the Republican Party aren't listening. They're already doubling down saying, we just didn't have good messaging. We need to do more on turnout. They aren't listening, maybe they need to step back and talk to people compromise on these issues, maybe do things to help women and do more of these -- and have women involved in the conversation is one of the big things they haven't been doing.",

They're focused on some projects that she oversaw while she was still there. It's interesting Dana, one line of questioning was really focused on securing financing for his Doral Resorts and Spa down in Florida. And in one exchange, she was interacting with a representative from Deutsche Bank, and they were offering some favorable terms for a loan, for a high net worth individual, but it would require her father to maintain a net worth of $3 billion, and Ivanka suggested lowering that to $2 billion. They eventually settled on 2.5. But that exchange is significant because of course, at the heart of this case, is the allegation. The former president was not being accurate or honest about his true net worth. So the fact that Ivanka was pushing to lower that threshold is notable. Now, they also asked her about an apartment that she had in one of her father's buildings. It had a purchase option of $8.5 million. But on her father's financial statements, it was valued at $20.8 million dollars. She tried to distance herself from that valuation. So far, though, these questions they've been very technical, they've been focused on the substance of the case, no real chaos or contentious exchanges. This is expected to go for a little bit longer. And while there are no cameras in the courtroom, we have our colleagues in there giving us these live updates. So, we know how much information they're getting from her.",
