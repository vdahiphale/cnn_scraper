Now, another way, and I think a more cynical way to look at those meetings is that it's entirely rational for companies to pay money to curry favor with politicians. It happens on the left, on the right, and you're seeing it with tech here. That is partly why people are turned off by politics. And a lot of the people - the very people who were animated to vote for Donald Trump were turned off by this we scratch their backs they scratch ours idea, that you can just pay money or write a check and get to sit down with the president, whoever it may be.So, I'm curious as to how over the years, the next four years, how those voters see and respond to things like.",

At least in part, that's because Mr. Trump has bent the Republican Party to his will. In recent days, the president-elect has posted on his website Truth Social an AI- generated image mocking Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, for his weight, an article in support of people arrested in connection with January 6th.
