The Ukrainian leader was greeted by cheers and a standing ovation from lawmakers and a remarkable moment coming 300 days after Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of his country. Mr. Zelenskyy's visit to Washington lasted just hours but marked his first trip outside Ukraine since the war began. He went before Congress to express his gratitude for the critical U.S. support but to ask for more assistance.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Our two nations are allies in this battle, and next year will be a turning point, I know it, the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values.

Both a one-on-one meeting and a bilateral meeting between the two national security teams. So, there were no clear moves towards some type of peace pathway. That is simply not on the table so long as Vladimir Putin and the Russian military continue the pathway they've pursued. But they all seem to agree that next year, starting in just a couple of days, is a turning point, a critical year and a moment where the Ukrainian forces plan to make some type of breakthrough.How they're going to do that though remains somewhat unclear. You talk to U.S. officials, they see this now more as a stalemate when it comes to the battle space than any type of progression forward on one side or the other. And that underscores another critical component, Zelenskyy making clear they would be asking for more assistance pretty much daily from here on out. Underscoring that while the U.S. by far have given the most money, weapons, economic support up to this point, much more will be needed in the months and perhaps longer ahead.

Talking about two things really. One of the original justifications for the war, which is that Russia believes that it's sort of under siege by NATO, an expansionist NATO that it believes is fighting not just Ukraine but the West as well. And secondly, some big announcements on the expansion of the Russian military. He basically said money is no object. They're going to increase the size from a million to a million and a half. It's going to be a new military district in the northwest of the country on the border with Finland -- which is of course one of the areas where NATO is set to expand.

And I'm sure many of you still have travel plans but you need to check your flight status and you need to just be very careful as you're getting from point A to point B. In fact, travel not advised for many of these states as this arctic blast starts to push further south.You see that arctic air coming in through the northern plains all the way down into Texas. This front stretching through the Ohio Valley today and into tomorrow. Then right on up into the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. We've already had record temperature drops. Cheyenne, Wyoming went from 43 degrees to 10 degrees within just a 10 minute period of time. That's a 43 degree drop folks in roughly 10 minutes. Also, wind chills, you factor in the wind while the cold temperature is already there, you factor in winds of 35 to 45 miles per hour, you get wind chills, look at this, near Essex, Montana, of 70 below. That's enough to cause frostbite within minutes. So again, if you don't have to go outside, don't. Jackson, Mississippi, 84 hours expected with temperatures below freezing. When that's the case, we're also dealing with your pipes starting to freeze. So, now we're talking about having your house set at a specific temperature, roughly around 65. And make sure you have the faucets dripping. That water needs to continually move so that it doesn't freeze. Wind chills, we talked about this with the exposure to it and frostbite, 5 to 10 minutes with wind chills of 35 to 45 below. And that's the case over the next two days' time. Minneapolis, Chicago, roughly about 30 to 35 below. That's what it's going to feel like. I mean, we've had wind gusts reaching 74 miles per hour in parts of the northern plains. That's hurricane force, category 1 force. And this is going to be a continuous thing. So, hence why we have wind chills warnings in place from the Pacific Northwest, down through the plains, on into the South and up through the Ohio Valley in watches that now go into effect across the South all the way into the Southeast. These are hard freeze warnings and watches where our temperatures are expected to be right at 28 degrees for several periods of time. Blizzard warnings also in effect across the plains and into the Great Lakes now. It doesn't take a lot of snow, folks, to get all of this blizzard activity. It's 35 mile per hour winds for three hours' time dropping visibility down to 1/4 of a mile. So, you don't notice a lot of snow here. That's going to pick up through the day and right up into the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley where we could pick up almost two feet of snow when it's all said and done. FOSTER: Britley, thank you. We'll have to keep across it. The arctic front will cripple travel on some of the busiest travel days of the year of course.

We're expecting that to be eight chapters, hundreds of pages. Everyone is still waiting. In the meantime, though, on Wednesday evening the committee did release 34 transcripts. These are largely transcripts of people who didn't answer investigator's questions. In most cases they invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.But they include a big name, Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, the former trump lawyer, John Eastman, who we know is under DOJ scrutiny. And one of Donald Trump's long-time allies, Roger Stone. And they give you a look into how these folks kind of tried to stymie Congressional investigators. You know, in a two-part interview Jeffrey Clark, that former DOJ official, was sort of combative. I mean, at one point his attorneys presented a 12-page list of objections to why they didn't think he shouldn't be there. In his second deposition he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 120 times. The other thing that sticks out though is in the questioning. The investigators made clear in their questions for a number of these folks, they've been able to obtain emails or text messages. But even these witnesses who did not want to provide anything with the committee are listed. So, it gives you some insight into just how much Congressional investigators were able to obtain. They got emails, they got text messages even from witnesses who did not believe that they wanted to hand anything over to the committee because of their Fifth Amendment rights.
