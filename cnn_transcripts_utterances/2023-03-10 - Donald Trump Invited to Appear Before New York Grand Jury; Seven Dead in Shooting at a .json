That payment was made just days before the 2016 Presidential Election. Well, now, \"The New York Times\" reports that Trump has been offered a chance to testify next week before the grand jury that has been hearing evidence in that case.CNN's Evan Perez tells us what it might mean for the former president. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we know that they met with the Trump team recently. And, the Times says that the signal at least that was sent was an indictment may be imminent. We know that a number of witnesses or (inaudible) reported a number of witnesses have gone before this grand jury. And it appears, you know, that they have run out of witnesses. I mean, they -- very few other people that could bring before the grand jury. So, a decision appears to be in the offing. And all signals are that they are ready to bring a case against the former president. This centers around this $130,000 hush money payment that was made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 Election. And you know, the key witness that they would be a relying on for this case, under New York State Law, is Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen is, of course, the former fixer, of the former president, who in 2018 admitted to lying to Congress and was convicted. So, the idea that you're gonna bring a case with Michael Cohen as your star witness really does raise some tough questions for the Manhattan D.A. We do know, obviously, according to Cohen, that the hush money would be reimbursed to him. And so, there is a trail of money, right? There is money that prosecutors would be able to show. And perhaps you can get witnesses who can say, while trump never pays anything unless, you know, he knows what it is for, right? He is known to be very tight-fisted with his money. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They have issued their highest alert level for flash flooding in and around the Monterey County. And to put that into context, this is the first time that they have done that since 2010.Still overnight the moderate risk of flash flooding for the San Francisco bay region. And a look for the day on Friday, that high risk level extends further south including San Luis Obispo as well as the central Sierra Nevada mountain range. Let's explain why this is important. Remember all the various atmospheric river events that we covered so far this winter? Dumping copious amounts of snowfall, burying homes and vehicles quite literally, right? Well guess what, this particular storm is going to be significantly milder than the previous atmospheric river events because we're tapping into that deep tropical moisture just south of Hawaii. In fact, you can pretty much track that cloud cover train all the way from Hawaii into the state of California. Now, the various computer models that meteorologists look to show and indicate that the freezing level is actually gonna be about 1,000 feet higher than what we previously anticipated yesterday. That means that more rain will fall out of the system on top of that deep snow pack that we saw just a moment ago. There will still be snow, several feet of it across the Sierra Nevada mountain range, but more rain anticipated across the central valley all the way to the coastline. This is going to allow for rapid snow melt, the potential for flash flooding, landslides, and mudslides. National Weather Service picking up on that, heavy rainfall and our flood watch continues. Here is the first atmospheric river event blasting through the day on Friday, moves inward along with the moisture plume. And then look what's waiting and it's weighing, so another rain and snow event anticipated by the end of the weekend into parts of next week. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A 23-year-old Palestinian man was fatally shot by police after he opened fire on pedestrians, wounding three Israelis. Hamas claimed responsibility.At the same time, there is growing unrest among Israelis over a radical proposal to weaken the nation's judiciary. This is the 10th week of large street protests.

Protesters in Georgia aren't going away quietly even as the ruling party has withdrawn the controversial foreign agent's bill. Some are calling for early elections, while others want government reforms that will help move Georgia towards membership in the European Union. Meanwhile, the interior ministry says it has released all the demonstrators detained this week. And Georgia's president congratulated protesters on what she called an important victory. Here she is.
