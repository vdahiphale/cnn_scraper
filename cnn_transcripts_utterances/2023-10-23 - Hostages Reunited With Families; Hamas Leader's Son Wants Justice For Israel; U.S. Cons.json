      "sentences": "They were met by paramedics and taken away in ambulances, they become the third and fourth hostages released by Hamas after two Americans were released on Friday.Israel has also told the U.S. that they believe some of the American hostages still held by Hamas are alive, but the fate of many other hostages remains unknown. Hamas kidnapped 222 innocent people during its deadly heinous invasion on October 7th, 222 it is believed. And negotiating the release of these remaining hostages is one of the big reasons the U.S. wants Israel to delay its ground incursion into Gaza. The Israeli defense minister saying an operation by air, ground and sea will be coming, quote, \"soon.\" The IDF today said Israeli soldiers are taking part in training exercises to improve their capabilities for future ground operations. The other reason the U.S. wants Israel to delay any ground offensive is to make sure that more humanitarian aid can get into Gaza to help the innocents, the innocent Palestinians. As of now, 54 aid trucks have entered Gaza, but relief groups warn much, much more help is necessary. To put this into context, the area normally gets about 455 aid trucks every day since October 7th. Gaza is more than 7,000 truckloads short of normal standards. But a senior Israeli official told CNN there will be no ceasefire. The IDF says it hit more than 320 targets overnight. Those strikes killed at least 436 people, including 182 children. That is according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which we should note is controlled by Hamas. So, take that claim for what it's worth. Let's get right to CNN's Nic Robertson in Sderot, which is outside of Gaza, and CNN's Alex Marquardt in Washington, D.C. Nic, we are now seeing this new video of these latest two release hostages. Walk us through this video. What exactly are we seeing?",

Yocheved Lifshitz, 85 years old.The statement says, while I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those some 200 innocents who remain hostage in Gaza. So her father along with her mother were both hostages. Her mother has now been released. As Nic noted, we are still waiting to hear when the two women will be handed over to Israeli authorities. We can imagine that they will then be taken into military custody perhaps for more medical checkups. This is the same format, essentially, the broad strokes, at least, that we saw with Judith and Natalie Raanan on Friday when they were released by Hamas. Jake, this begs all kinds of questions about what happens next. There are certainly going to be some questions for the prime minister's office because he had dismissed as false propaganda a Hamas statement over the weekend that they were ready to release two more of their hostages. And of course, this is going to put a lot more pressure on Israel to delay that ground incursion so that there can be more time for more of these hostages to come out and more aid to go in to Gaza, Jake.",

They know the terrain, but this is also Hamas's own turf, so they will have laid plenty of booby traps.There are differences between Fallujah, significant differences between Fallujah and Gaza. I've been in the Gaza as well. The roads there are so narrow, it's very densely populated. There are a lot of big tall buildings. Fallujah as I remember with the marines on the streets there, we were running down streets but they were wider, they were more like boulevards, there were bigger villas, there was less, if you will, of urban infrastructure and less places for, you know, terrorists to hide out and ambush the troops as they were going in. And that was a very dangerous environment and several times we got pulled into firefights. I remember being in the middle of a firefight when we were supposed to be dropped off from a Bradley fighting vehicle, it got diverted, pulled into a firefight. So, there are all sorts of things that are going to happen on the ground that are not part of the original plan. But the other thing, I think that's a significant difference, other than really this is a well-dug in and well-prepared force. Hamas have been in Gaza for years, decades. Al-Qaeda in Falluja really, although some of them were indigenous, they'd only really been stood up as a fighting force for about a year and it was easy for them to fall back out of the town environment the urban fight and into the farm, into the farm lands and escape the fight. Here the enemy is going to be contained and constrained in an area of essentially where they can pick and direct the fight. It's going to be tough.",

Nine candidates, nine, nine, nine, they've all announced they're running.

The House can't do anything in the aftermath of the ouster of Speaker McCarthy and also any other -- any -- in these two candidates who were trying to replace him whose nominations were sunk amid opposition.Jake, tonight, there'll be a candidate forum where these members will make their pitch to the conference. Then tomorrow morning will be a leadership election where they'll nominate their candidate. But the nomination doesn't mean that they're going to get the 217 votes to be elected speaker. So that is going to be the big test for whoever wins the nomination. Jake?",
