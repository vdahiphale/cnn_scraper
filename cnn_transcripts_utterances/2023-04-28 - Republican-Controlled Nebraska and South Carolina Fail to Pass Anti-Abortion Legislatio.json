You know, Kaitlan, thanks for having me. It really was. But you know, kudos for all of them to stand up, especially the women in South Carolina. I mean, I love the statement that I just heard from the South Carolina representative. She's absolutely right. This has always been about control. It has always been about somebody forcing their views on the women in this country. So, I'm -- it's happy to see folks standing up for their rights like that and across the gate (ph).
