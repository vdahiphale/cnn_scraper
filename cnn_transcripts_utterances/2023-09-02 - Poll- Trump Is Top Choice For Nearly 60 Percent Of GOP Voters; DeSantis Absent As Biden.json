Four indictments in and roughly four months until Republicans first nominating contest, Donald Trump continues to dominate his rivals in the GOP primary. A new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll finds Trump's support among Republican voters growing to a whopping 59 percent. The former president expanding his lead over his next closest competitor, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, to a commanding 46 points. Joining us now to talk about this, \"Vanity Fair\" special correspondent, Molly Jong-Fast and CNN political commentator Ana Navarro. Guys, great to see you. Thanks so much for doing this. Ana, let me start with you at this point. Is it all but inevitable that Trump will be the Republican nominee next year?",

Part of me wants to be surprised, but I'm not surprised that he has this hold on the Republican Party and that the indictments that his legal problems, that all of the things happening around him mean nothing, because the loyalists have complete an absolute allegiance to this man.But also, listen, it's two things right? One is the allegiance that the Republican base has for Donald Trump, and two is that there seems to be no good alternative, no viable alternative. Ron DeSantis was supposed to be the great non-Trump hope, and he has been a dud. He is a terrible candidate, he is terrible on the stump. He has got the likeability of broccoli, and I apologize to those who like broccoli. He is not the alternative. He's not what -- he turned out to be a paper tiger who looked a lot better on paper than he actually does on the stump.",

The poll shows 77 percent of Americans across the political spectrum also think the president is too old to serve a second term, even though he's just a few years older than Donald Trump.What do you think about all of that? That is a very tight race, and four indictments in, it doesn't seem to be making any kind of a dent? MOLLY JONG-FAST, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, \"VANITY FAIR\": Well, I would say that Donald Trump's base is very hardened, and they are very bought in. It was his base to lose and DeSantis, Trump without the charisma, was not able to capture it. I don't know about this general election polling, I still think we're like 400-plus days away from the election, and I think that it's very early days to start worrying about that, especially if you look at every poll since Donald Trump, even with the poll with Donald Trump winning has been not accurate. I mean, we have been in a period of really bad polling, so maybe this is accurate, but I certainly wouldn't take it as the gospel and we're more than a year away.",

I thought that it made DeSantis look really petty that he refused to meet with the guy who is, you know, you may not have voted for him, but he is the president and he is an intricate part of the federal government and Florida needs federal government money. And so I think that it's just really another case of DeSantis, putting his personal politics above the benefit of the people of Florida who he is supposed to govern, and what I think is really interesting is just a few days ago, DeSantis refused money that was Florida money -- it was money from the federal government, part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was supposed to go to Florida, and he refused it because he didn't want it because it was stuff for, you know, electric cars and that kind of environmentally friendly -- more friendly stuff.

You have Republicans like Brian Kemp and Brad Raffensperger that are capital C, conservatives, very rule of law, very good for conservative policy in the state. But because they do not subscribe to everything that Donald Trump has said, they have been ostracized by some key parts of the primary electorate, and with Georgia's purple politics, it is just enough where now you have two Democratic US senators, and could see Joe Biden win the state again, because of those indictments.

I was in that courtroom, and I mean, to the earlier point, it's very difficult to convey an eight-hour court hearing when there's no cameras, there's no recording, and just pages and pages of furious notes, but I would agree with Sam's assessment that the prosecution, the Fulton County District Attorney's office did a much better job showing why it should stay in their court instead of moving to federal court.",

Yesterday, the Hawaii Tourism Authority approved more than $2 million to help rebuild the island's struggling tourism industry. The agency says West Maui accounts for 15 percent of Hawaii's total tourism revenue and is losing roughly $9 million per day as a result of the drop in travel following the fires.Joining me now is the president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii, Sherry Menor-McNamara. Sherry, thanks so much for being here. Let me ask you, are you hopeful that this funding will help revive the state's economy? SHERRY MENOR-MCNAMARA, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAWAII: Well, it's definitely in the right direction. We just encourage visitors to come to Maui. I know initially they were discouraged, but right now it's just West Maui that we discourage visitors to go to, but the rest of Maui is open. And for Maui, it's critically important because Maui's economy accounts for 38 percent of visitor spending as well as the Maui jobs, 40 percent that relies on visitor spending. So you can imagine that the impact of not having visitors come to Hawaii is definitely having a rippling effect on Maui, as well as across the islands.",

But if you were to take a trip to any of the islands, if you were to take a trip to Maui, you're not going to be affected or impacted in any way as a tourist, correct? I mean, if you go, it's still the beautiful Hawaiian Islands as always.MENOR-MCNAMARA: Absolutely, and Maui has been a popular destination for so many - we've always had so many returning visitors because of the soul of the island just penetrates across the state. And we just wanted to mahalo thank everyone around the world for showing their aloha spirit to us in the time of need to help those who have been impacted. I went to Lahaina and visited some of the businesses there, many of them have lost their livelihoods. They lost their businesses as well as their homes, but they have the spirit to rebuild. And so in order to rebuild, though, we need to revive the local economy and have our visitors return. There's so many beautiful parts of Maui from Hana down to Wailea, Kahului, Wailuku and other parts. Just West Maui right now is temporarily closed until October - mid- October, just so we can ensure that those who have been impacted can be taken care of. But again, go to the other parts of Maui, you'll see the aloha spirit that has been shining through for so many years.",

Before we show it, we want to give you a warning that it contains profanity, but it is important to show you this.The Daily Tar Heel showed the jarring messages exchanged between students and loved ones on Monday as authorities search for the shooter who killed one of the school's professors. The front page visualized the now all too often tense, terrifying moments so many Americans have come to experience during an active shooter situation. Joining us now to talk about this is The Daily Tar Heel's Print Managing Editor, Caitlyn Yaede. Caitlyn, thank you so much for being with us. We really appreciate it. We're very grateful to have you here and hats off to the entire staff there on the newspaper for what you've been able to pull off this past week. I can't imagine what this has been like for you and your fellow students at UNC. We saw some of the video that some students were putting out on social media, because we rarely see the desperation of what students go through during something like this. We're looking at the video of the students jumping out of windows as police were searching for the campus shooter. What were you thinking when all of this was going on? What was going through your mind?",

I was about a half mile away at our campus student newspaper offices when we got the text alerts from the university and sirens began going off. My first thought was just there's no way. I think myself and a lot of people who grew up and went to school at the same time I did are very, very familiar with the concept of a lockdown or no one being able to leave a school or some kind of security threat happening or at least preparing for one. And so the fact that we had one on Monday and it was the real deal was just hard to believe, startling, scary.

Just last week at this time, we were covering a mass shooting down in Jacksonville. This keeps happening over and over again. And I have to think as parents are going back, sending their kids back to school, as students are going back to school, this is on the minds of a lot of students around the country. And I guess, can you talk about it, can you explain what this has done, do you think, to your campus and to a whole generation of students?

I'm saddened that so many people have to be moved by it, that so many people have reached out and said that they've sent or received messages like that.
