      "sentences": "Well, Becky, my understanding is that the Israeli prime minister has given his team slightly more wiggleroom, a slightly more expanded mandate to engage in negotiations and try to reach a deal. But my sources also still have doubts about whether or not it is enough to bridge the gaps that still remain between Israel and Hamas. And I think one key thing to understand, as we look to try and understand and analyze the outcome of these negotiations today, is ultimately what is the basis for these talks. What is the basis for the meetings that are happening today? Because we know that Hamas has said they want to see a deal based on the framework that was agreed to by Israel and Hamas on or around July 2nd. Since then, what has happened is the Israeli prime minister has made a series of additional demands that were not included in that framework agreement. Including, for example, demanding that Israeli troops retain control of that Philadelphi corridor, the border between Egypt and Gaza, and also some kind of mechanism to enforce and prevent armed men from going from southern Gaza to northern Gaza during this ceasefire. We know that there have been a lot of discussions on both of those points over the course of the last few weeks to try and address some of the Israeli concerns without totally giving into them because Hamas would not agree to those terms. And so the question is today, where is Israel going to stand on those two points? And what are the mediators willing to give them and not give them there as they try and craft what has been described to us as a bridging proposal to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas? And ultimately what's going to happen today, while Hamas isn't participating in these talks, they have said that they will engage with the negotiators after. And frankly, that's different rhetoric but it's not all that different from how these talks have happened at other crucial moments. This is pretty much what we have called before proximity talks, meaning Israel is meeting with the heads of intelligence from these various countries in a room. And then the mediators are going to another room, where Hamas is in that same hotel building  sometimes and then delivering their message. And then it goes back-and-forth. And so it does seem that at some point today, after the Israelis meet with the heads of the intelligence for the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, that message will then be transmitted to Hamas. And then it's going to be a question of do we have even the basis for moving forward? Or is it clear that these two sides remain in very, very different positions?",

The question over the IDF presence within Gaza, that, with their withdrawal, the question of whether Gazans can return to the north in an unrestricted way. Which Palestinian prisoners are going to be allowed to come out of those Israeli prisons? How many of the initial 33 hostages are in fact alive? There are a lot of major elements in this ceasefire that really need to be figured out today. So in speaking with sources today, of course, they hope they can make movement and progress on those fronts.

But a lot of what yesterday's goal was for Donald Trump was to draw a contrast with Kamala Harris. And he did do that. You know, there's been a lot of talk of needing him to stay on policy. He definitely veered off script many times during that speech in North Carolina last night. But he did have some parts where he weaved in the messaging that I know his campaign was urging him to discuss. Part of that is they've been following what the Harris campaign is doing very closely. They knew that she was going to be talking about health care today and her economic message in North Carolina tomorrow. And so that's what Donald Trump focused on. And he really tried to gear some of those attacks toward that messaging, including he claimed that she wants to get rid of private health insurance, that she wants to give taxpayer funded health insurance to every person in America, including illegal immigrants. He claimed that, on the economy, that she's trying to copy what Donald Trump is doing with her announcing recently that she also supports getting rid of taxes on tips. That was really the contrast that his team had wanted him to paint yesterday. And he did do some of it but I have to say, Becky, despite all of the pressure he is getting from people within his own campaign and also within his own party, both privately and publicly, about urging him to stay on message, he went off script repeatedly. He attacked Harris, he attacked her laugh, he belittled her. He said -- he went after her running mate, Tim Walz. So I'm curious to see what will happen today at this press conference. I know that, at the top of the press conference today, he is supposed to talk about the economy again, more largely. But we know how Donald Trump does when he takes questions from the press and he often doesn't stay on message, either. So I would stay tuned for that.",

They are in Western Russia and going deeper into Western Russia. It was quite interesting to hear the president and the general -- chief of the general staff, Syrskyi, saying that the Ukrainians are now 35 kilometers inside Russian territory. And that number that you just mentioned, 1,150 square kilometers of territory, now the Ukrainians say apparently under their control. One of the things that we've seen from the Ukrainians is they have put out some pictures of alleged prisoners of war that they've taken. In fact, they said that yesterday, as they were sweeping that area, they gathered the largest number of prisoners of war in one go, which is over 100. The Ukrainians, of course, say what they would like to do is exchange those prisoners of war that they've now taken for Ukrainians that are still in Russian custody. So by all means, even with these narratives and counter narratives that we are seeing, it certainly doesn't seem as though the Ukrainians are on the brink of being pushed out or even starting to get pushed out by the Russians. In fact, they are apparently still operating freely, at least in some of those areas. One of the other things that we picked up on, Becky, which we thought was quite interesting, is that the Ukrainians now say they want to put in place a military administrator for those areas in Russia that they've taken under their control to help the civilian population that has remained in those areas. Those certainly don't appear to be the words of a military and of a country that's looking to leave that area anytime soon. Another thing that we've also checked on as well, the Ukrainians yesterday saying that they conducted the largest amount of drone strikes on Russian air bases. There's now satellite images that have come out that show an air base in Voronezh in Russia with apparently substantial damage to several hangars. Becky.",

And basically see the reverse and the nightmare of what every Afghan woman once had before, which was the return of Taliban and their restrictive rules and not allowing women to have their basic rights and the fundamental rights. And at the core of that is really the education which you truly mentioned. But beyond education today, you've seen Afghan women are banned from going independently outside. Their restriction in terms of work outside of their home. And at the same time, the financial constraints that they are feeling as well as the country face.

So Vangelis has also stored some of his most prized possession, some of the work he does for fun in this container. There's a secret lock inside. You can't open it. The metal is completely melted. And if you look inside, completely dark and the smell of smoke so evident. He just doesn't know the status of his work right now and he needs to bring someone in to cut this open. Many like Vangelis were not ensured. They now depend fully on the government assistance plan. Residents can get up to 10,000 euros in aid. Vangelis estimates 60,000 euros worth of damage but that's not really what hurts.",
