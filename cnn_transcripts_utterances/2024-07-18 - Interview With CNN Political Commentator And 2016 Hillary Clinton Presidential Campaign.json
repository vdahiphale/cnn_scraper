Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. As the Republican National Convention wraps up its final day, it's feeling like a grand old party in more ways than one, a jubilant mood spreading throughout the RNC as a newly unified GOP rallies behind Candidate Trump just after he survived an assassination attempt. It's very different within the Democratic Party where president Biden is facing growing pressure to drop out of the race as concerns around his health and age persist. Party grandees like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, all warning Biden the polls do not look good. We're now all too aware that a lot can happen in a week. So, what could happen between now and November? I spoke to former Communications Director for Trump's 2020 campaign, Marc Lotter, and Karen Finney, who is a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. They joined me from the Milwaukee Convention Center.",

And when it comes to -- you know, obviously, whether it's Joe Biden or someone else on the top of the ticket, you know, I think one of the things that we're keeping a very close eye on is that the Democrats, you know, like to say that they are the defenders of democracy. And yet, there really would not be anything more undemocratic than saying, we're going to ditch the will of our voters because it's politically inconvenient right now. And so, whether it's Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, we're also focused on the policy side of it. None of those candidates are going to change the direction of our country. They're going to stick with the same policies, whether it's on immigration, whether it's on taxation, energy prices.

So, in terms of the issue landscape, things have really not changed as much in terms of the policies that we're talking about. So, for example, if you live in a state where you're afraid of losing your right to access IVF or contraception or abortion, that has not changed. And that is a fundamental difference between what Democrats are fighting for and what Republicans are fighting for. So, I think the issue is here, whether it's climate change, whether it is, you know, we don't believe in trickledown economics, whether it is, you know, helping college kids pay for their student loans, there's a whole range of issues where we have just very different ideas. And I always like to remind people, you know, those folks who are knocking on doors and having conversations with voters, those have not stopped. And so, the issue conversation continues and will continue.

And Senator Vance is absolutely against abortion, he calls it murder, argued against the need for rape and incest exceptions, promoted the ban at 15 weeks, and questioned the prevalence of divorce. Suggested women should stay in violent marriages even. I'm going to play this and talk to you about the issue of winning women. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), U.S. REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace, which is this idea that like, well, OK, these marriages were fundamentally -- you know, they were maybe even violent, but certainly they were unhappy. And so, getting rid of them and making it easier for people to shift spouses, like they changed their underwear, that's going to make people happier in the long-term. And maybe it worked out for the moms and dads, though I'm skeptical, but it really didn't work out for the kids of those marriages. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, there's also no way that a nationalabortion ban is ever going to get passed by Congress. There just aren't the votes on either side to get their abortion wishes passed into law. And so, that's why it's going to the people's elected representatives and the states. And the states, through their representatives, can make the decisions in terms of what they think. President has also been very clear he supports IVF and the exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. But I think, you know, while the Democrats all want to focus only on just this one issue, I think what you're going to see the president, Senator Vance, and Republicans also talk about is a lot of mothers, a lot of families out there struggling to pay for groceries, struggling to pay for gas. They're worried that their young daughters or themselves might be the victims of crime based on all of the 12 million illegal immigrants that have been let into this country under Joe Biden. So, there are a lot of issues that I think that are at play. Yes, there are single issue voters on the issue of abortion, both on the right and the left. But I think most people or probably it's one of their issues, may not be their only issue. And right now, they're worried about putting food on the table.",

      "sentences": "It absolutely is still an issue. And I'll tell you why, because for women in this country and for particularly young voters, we see this. It'snot just about access to a procedure, it is fundamentally about bodily autonomy. You know, I like to say, Christiane, we are fundamentally not a democracy if women don't have the same rights as men. And if we don't have the right to make those critical decisions about our bodies and our health care, then we're not equal. And unfortunately, what we've seen -- you know, I'm a little -- I cringe a little bit at the state's rights sort of argument because it has such an ugly history in our country, but think about what's been happening in the states for women. We're seeing women and doctors criminalized. We're seeing women lose their lives because of cruel and extreme practices. And one of the things about Project 2025 that I think people are so anxious about is that so many of the things that are in that policy handbook, if you will, are already being attempted to be implemented in the states, like cutting off access to various forms of contraception. So, again, there's a real concern that some of these policies, again, it's not just about the procedure itself, it's about what it says about value to women. I'll give you another example, equal pay for women. You know, the criticism that we're hearing from some conservative circles about the women Secret Service members who were part of the president -- former president's detail, some are saying, well, you know, that's DEI and they shouldn't have women, they're not strong enough, you know? So, again, it's also how you talk about women, how you respect women. And I just want to point out something on immigration. We've had 12 million people here illegally for decades, and what we're talking about is, again, two very different approaches to securing the border, which President Biden has, and those crossings have gone way down. But also, how do we have a humane policy in terms of how do we have people return to their countries where that's appropriate? Not as we saw during the Republican Convention this week with signs to just throw people out. You know, this rounding people up and mass deportations. I don't think people really think about what that would really look like in terms of having deportation centers, separating children and families, not to mention the economic impact that that would have on the American economy if all those workers who are working for substandard wages, by the way, would be all of a sudden gone.",

We do think they should be held accountable for their actions, just as everyone should. That being said, you know, I've traveled around the country -- around the world, actually, in the last several months. I was just in Israel about three weeks ago, and there is a lot of fear. We heard some of this coming out of the NATO conference. World leaders are very anxious about the idea of Donald Trump returning to the presidency. They're anxious about what it means in terms of America's role in the world, the nature of the relationships, the fact that he has praised dictators like Putin and what that means in terms of a realignment of forces. And so, I think they're very real questions about what a Trump presidency would mean for American foreign policy based on Joe Biden's. And the other thing, Christiane, I just want to mention. You know, we talk about Project 2025, but we don't just have that blueprint to look at. We have the record of Donald Trump from his four years in office, and we know how he treated NATO, and we know how he treated our allies, and we know why they have real concerns.",

We've got to figure out a way to get the killing to stop, which is what the president has been very clear about. And the fact that he -- you know, he holds so much leverage, the president of the United States holds so much leverage in terms of forcing, whether it's Ukraine and/or Russia to come to the table and let's figure out a way to stop the violence, stop the death on this issue is something that I think the world should be cheering.

And that's not why I sing, or even would work so hard to be able to sing, because my whole career, including the beginning, I had doctors and people tell me, well, you'll probably never sing again. And maybe you should go to the softer music because you're too small, you're a woman, you're white. These things not going to work for you. And so, I just had to learn as much as I could. And I wanted to make music that was inclusive. I wanted to make collaborations with the people that I loved. And when I was in situations where it was a compromise, it also gave me an opportunity to learn about how I could make that my own too.",

And it unsettles precedent in the process, of course, because, thus far, all of the courts who have considered the issue have concluded that special counsels are lawful, and that includes the United States Supreme Court because in United States v. Nixon, the court heard a case that involved a Watergate special counsel and the court described how that special counsel had been appointed pursuant to various federal laws that Judge Cannon all of a sudden declared don't actually allow for special counsels at all.",

I think he has a very strong case. Again, every court, every judge that has considered the issue up until now has sided with the lawfulness of special counsels. And so, I think he is more likely to focus on the particular issue in this appeal rather than to point out Judge Cannon's long history in this case of trying to give a leg up to Donald Trump.",

That's very rare and an extraordinarily high bar. Is it possible in this case? Do I think it would be warranted? Yes. Am I expecting the conservative 11th Circuit to actually do that? Not really. But I also think that Judge Cannon's behavior in this case should matter to two other audiences as well. You know, you mentioned, of course, that federal judges have life tenure. But they can also be impeached and investigated. You know, Congress can hold hearings. And there is a world in which, you know, a Democratic Senate or Democratic House actually looked into this matter and concluded that Judge Cannon has showed such this and bias and disregard for the law, that impeachment or something else might be worth considering. And the third audience, I would say, is the public at large. You know, we are at an incredibly important moment for the future of our institutions and American democracy. And I think it's very important for people to understand the stakes of the upcoming presidential election, as far as who will be sitting on the federal courts, you know, one of the three major institutions within the federal government.",

And that's because the U.S. Supreme Court has already said that some of the bases for those prosecutions cannot actually be used to prosecute the former president. They also added that some of the other allegations in the various indictments, such as the president's attempts to pressure the vice president to throw out lawfully cast votes, that those acts are entitled to a presumption of immunity and that the government would bear a difficult burden in order to justify being able to prosecute the former president on those grounds as well. And so, the expansive immunity that the court announced, as well as its application of that immunity to the particular election interference cases I think suggest that that ruling will have the most effect on the election interference cases, which, in many respects, are the most serious. In addition to the immunity ruling, five of the justices who were in the majority adopted an evidentiary privilege, basically saying prosecutors cannot introduce any evidence of any official acts that are themselves entitled to immunity. They cannot probe those official acts with other evidence. They cannot inquire into the motives the president had in performing those official acts, and that will eliminate some possible evidence that prosecutors in all of these cases might have used against the former president.",

But that's in part because of who Donald Trump appointed to both the U.S. Supreme Court and the lower federal courts. Judge Cannon and her conduct of this trial has done everything to delay the proceeding, from outright dismissing the case, which just happened, to effectively dragging it out over time. You know, remember, she tried to interfere in the special counsel's investigation by suggesting that Donald Trump had some interest in limiting the special counsel's ability to go through the evidence seized from Mar-a- Lago, and all of that delayed the prosecution and proceedings in what -- in many respects is the most straightforward open and shut case, obstruction of justice and wrongful retention of documents. I mean, there's literally video and audio evidence of them moving around the documents at Mar-a-Lago and the president on audio tape saying he didn't just declassify the documents when he was president. And so, all of that came to a halt because Judge Cannon, Donald Trump's appointee, decided she was going to drag her heels and drag this case out until after the election. And there are judges like that who are lying in wait in both the federal trial courts, like Judge Cannon, as well as on the Courts of Appeals around the country because Republicans prioritized the appointment of judges who were young, who were ideological, and who would advance the interests of the Republican Party.",

I think there are pretty targeted proposals that could limit, for example, the Supreme Court's ability to strike down the Voting Rights Act or to strike down federal laws that authorize the appointment of special counsels to investigate wrongdoing in the executive branch. There are already a bunch of federal laws that restrict court's power to kind of interpret and implement them. So, I think Congress would be well within its power to enact various statutes that limit court's authority to eliminate those laws. And then, I would add to that, court expansion on all levels. I think this Supreme Court, as it exists is, a threat to American democracy and I think is likely to invalidate any kind of proposed reforms to the Supreme Court.
