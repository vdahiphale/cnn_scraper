Thank you so much for joining us for our special breaking news coverage of the crisis in Russia.Also joining us, CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour in London. Let's begin with this breaking news. The head of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, says he is calling off his troops from their march on Moscow, potentially ending what appeared to be a possible coup attempt. Officials in Belarus claim their president Alexander Lukashenko had reached a deal with the Wagner boss to halt his troops. Prigozhin says his private army had seized control of Russian military facilities in two critical cities, Rostov-on-Don, that's about 700 miles south of Moscow, and the city of Voronezh, about the halfway point on the road to Moscow. President Putin called the actions by Prigozhin a betrayal and a stab in the back to the Russian people, and warned those who follow Prigozhin will pay a price. Christiane, both confusing, complex, all of this is just -- just a toss up in the air. Amazing.",

In other words, you just don't know until you know.So it looks like Prigozhin was trying to send a message to the Ministry of Defense and to the head of the Russian armed forces. Those people have been his targets since the beginning of this war, and he's complained bitterly that they have completely messed up and literally botched the invasion and the war in Ukraine, and that he has presented himself and his independent paramilitary force as the Russian saviors, if you like. And pretty much they are the own ones who have scored any, even though they might be minute, actual battlefield victories. And so it appears that he has now been pressured by Putin, who got Alexander Lukashenko, his big ally in Belarus, to engineer some kind of about-face. And according to Prigozhin, that is what has happened. We're waiting to be able to broadcast his latest audio to explain to everybody exactly what he thinks he's doing next. And we've got full coverage on this breaking story. We have CNN chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh, national security reporter Natasha Bertrand, and the former CIA chief of Russia operations and CNN national security analyst Steve Hall. So Nick, we were on together as this breaking news came of this latest intervention by Prigozhin and his latest telegram audio message, having taken a very significant military headquarters in the last 24 hours. Do we think now that the Prigozhin threat is over?",

And of course, this further -- these further developments causing even greater whiplash. But we are told that U.S. intelligence actually did see signs that Prigozhin was perhaps preparing some kind of significant challenge to Russia's military leadership. And actually intelligence officials briefed congressional leadership earlier this week on the potential that Prigozhin could make some kind of a dramatic move. Now it wasn't clear when that would happen or what the ultimate aim of that would actually be. Would he try to march toward Moscow, would he try to pose a challenge to the Russian president directly, or would this simply be a confrontation with Russian military leadership. They didn't know, but what they did see were signs that Prigozhin was massing military equipment in concerning areas, that he was perhaps building up his forces near Russia. And so all of this contributed to a picture that was still a bit hazy around the edges, but that U.S. officials did see was cause for concern, Christiane.",

And Putin will not forget that. But also, of course, we have to remember when the FSB got involved publicly on this, in other words the FSB was -- I think the Kremlin announced formally that the FSB is investigating this as criminal activity, that's Putin. Putin is closest to the FSB. The FSB, of course, is the closest thing we have to the KGB successor organization where Putin used to work.So when I saw that the FSB was being directly involved now and there was a criminal investigation ongoing, that means Putin is taking very, very, very close interest in this. That's not going to go away. I suppose it could. They could simply say we decided not to prosecute him, or there was no evidence of criminal activity. I doubt it. It's pressure being put on Prigozhin by the Kremlin trying to remind him. But at this point, again, Prigozhin, even though his army might not be big enough to make it to Moscow or have a significant impact there just on the battlefield, he's a guy with a private army. He can't just be written off anymore really by anybody in the Kremlin.",

We don't know whether Prigozhin said, look, unless the following things happen, I'm going to make your life even that much harder, both on the battlefield with Ukraine and inside of Russia.Either way, it's bad, bad, and bad for Putin. There is very little upside, if any, that I can see from this whole event. He's going to emerge from this significantly weakened, which I think is going to strengthen those senior advisers around him and make them think twice, I think, about what the future is, at least with Putin in charge.",

And so, but also for the Putin entourage -- and we've seen it -- that is not a mystery that things are going badly. That is not a mystery that he's not as strong as he appears to be or says that he is.It is more important that he's there because none of them, or so it appears, have enough power to take over and undermine the rest. So if somebody goes up, somebody goes down, and those who go down cannot afford to go down. So that has been going on. And I think that's kind of Prigozhin and his -- and I'm sure that people behind him close to Putin who were able to take advantage of. But it doesn't seem for now that it -- or it could appear for now that Putin is still more viable for them in charge rather than Prigozhin with his military army that is completely, completely, completely can get off the rails and is completely unpredictable. And so that's also something that can, rather than weakening Putin's hand, which is already very weak, for a bit can strengthen until other parties around Putin can get strong enough, or Prigozhin doesn't get another lease on life, which I believe if he's not completely taken down, he probably will reappear again.",

And suddenly he's being ignored or he is not being paid attention enough. And in some ways -- we've discussed it with many people including a very excellent Russian analyst who used to be in Moscow, and she and I agreed that probably Prigozhin was screaming more out of weakness because he's not paid attention to, he's not given enough due. And I think that's why he basically challenged Putin a month ago in an interview, and then Putin didn't pay attention. And so Prigozhin is now doing this.So in many ways, I think neither Putin nor Prigozhin are strong enough, getting strong out of this particular situation, which to some degree in a weird way balance it out, because Prigozhin now cannot really be just the one force. And that's the message of him stepping back is that he's not the one force that is fighting in war in Ukraine. Whether it goes badly or not, it's another question.

A short time ago the leader of the Russian private military group Wagner announced that he is turning his forces around from that march toward Moscow.

Wagner forces had been on the move inside Russia, even claiming to capture key military facilities in two Russian cities. But it appears that advance is over, at least for now.This is still a very rapidly developing situation on the ground.

He was the final arbiter of all disputes amongst Russian elites.But now he's been presented with a much more open challenge, and one that's really been building over months. It's interesting to kind of look at Prigozhin's language. He's largely taken aim at the military leadership, Russia's uniformed military, specifically Sergei Shoigu, the minister of defense, and Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, without ever crossing the line into sort of openly criticizing Putin. It's important to point out that he's not a critic of the war in Ukraine. He thinks it needs to be waged differently, more brutally perhaps. But that is really kind of no longer the equation here that we're dealing with, because he's crossed the line into basically raising that flag of insurrection, Fredricka.",

There was a lot of munitions that were used, a lot of artillery shells that were being used, one of the things that Yevgeny Prigozhin kept saying is, look, I'm the one who can achieve progress. The defense ministry can't achieve progress. But I need the munitions to do that. And he always felt that he wasn't getting those munitions. And he felt that there was a campaign behind that, that Sergei Shoigu wanted him to fail.So this feud has been playing out very publicly for a very long time. It has now apparently come to a head, especially since the battle of Bakhmut was over. Of course, there were certain catalysts for that as well. For instance, the defense minister Sergei Shoigu signing a decree a couple weeks ago that all the private military companies in Russia had to sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry. Yevgeny Prigozhin said he was absolutely not going to do that, accused Sergei Shoigu of trying to get rid of Wagner, trying to take control of Wagner. So this big feud has been going on for a very long time. It certainly seems to have come to a head today. And I think what your guests, what our guests were saying is absolutely correct, really unclear whether or not this is it or whether this will go to another round, Christiane.",
