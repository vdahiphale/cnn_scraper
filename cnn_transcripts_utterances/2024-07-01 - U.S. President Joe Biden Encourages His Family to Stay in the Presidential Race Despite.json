I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead, political turbulence on both sides of the Atlantic. We are learning what U.S. President Joe Biden's family is telling him after his disastrous presidential debate performance. Meanwhile, his opponent Donald Trump expects to learn in the hours ahead whether he can claim immunity on his alleged efforts to undermine the results of the 2020 presidential election. And we're live in Paris following a crushing blow to Emmanuel Macron's centrist party, the far-right coming out on top in the first round of parliamentary elections in France. Good to have you with us. And we begin with the fallout of U.S. President Joe Biden's dismal debate performance last week. Mr. Biden's family is encouraging him to stay in the race despite growing calls for him to step aside. That's from two of his advisers who say the family also talked about whether top Biden aides should be fired. They spent time together on Sunday at Camp David and discussed how they could support the president. President Biden's advisers say he's closely watching polling data, which is not looking good. Some Democratic leaders say conversations are happening about the future of the party behind closed doors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-ML): Obviously, there was a big problem with Joe Biden's debate performance. And there's also just a tremendous reservoir of affection and love for Joe Biden in our party. And so this makes it a difficult situation for everybody. But there are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A lot of people saw them doing well, but I speak to someone from the left, a senator from the left earlier, and she said it was still a shock when you saw those results come through. So according to the interior ministry, National Rally won 35 percent of the vote, with the left- wing New Popular Front coalition coming in second with 28 percent.Macron's centrist alliance came in third with about 20 percent. The results prompting protests in Paris amongst those who obviously aren't against the, obviously aren't with the far right, crowds hitting the streets to voice their opposition to the far right. CNN senior international correspondent Jim Bitterman has more on the night from here in Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Jubilant cheers fill the headquarters of France's far right National Rally as projections show the party dominated in the country's first round of parliamentary election. Seen as a fringe movement, the National Rally could be positioned to assume power and become the first far-right party to enter French government since the Second World War. The controversial doyenne of the party, Marine Le Pen, asserted that the second round of voting to be held next week will secure their position. MARIE LE PEN, NATIONAL RALLY PARLIAMENTARY LEADER (through translator): Democracy has spoken and the French people have placed the National Rally and its allies in first place. Nothing has been won and the second round will be decisive. BITTERMAN (voice-over): Complete results of the election are not finalized and much political maneuvering is expected before the second round of voting is held next week, which could determine whether a seismic shift is underway in French politics. National Rally's leader and Le Pen's protege, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, could be positioned to become France's next prime minister. A child of Italian immigrants, Bardella has maintained the party's nationalist politics and hardline anti-immigration stance. Across the country and its overseas territories, voters turned out in huge numbers to participate in the high stakes election. Uncertainty has loomed ever since President Emmanuel Macron suddenly dissolved Parliament and called for snap elections earlier this month, sending shockwaves across the country. Now his gamble appears to have backfired as his alliance of centrist parties faltered in the vote, finishing a third according to projections. In a statement, the president called for the formation of a broad alliance to block the National Rally from coming to power. Faced with the National Rally, the time has come for a broad, clearly democratic and republican rally for the second round. The coalition of left-wing parties also had a strong showing, coming in a close second projection show. However, no party achieved an outright majority, possibly leading Parliament into political deadlock. For now, the preliminary results of the election are being received with intensity, drawing some protesters out to demonstrate in Paris. As the country with a painful history with fascism and far-right movements, deals with an uncertain future. Jim Bitterman, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, Le Pen's party, Jordan Bardella, stands against that. They said they wouldn't want to send these long-range missiles, which can deliver a bigger punch to Putin. They wouldn't be advocating French troops being sent to Ukraine. So you can already see a difference in position there. Perhaps, you know, it's not a position that weakens NATO immediately. But you can certainly see the way that France has positioned itself, being challenged at home and being changed overseas. And then, of course, there's the immigration policies of the party in terms of how that would impact in Europe and a growing right-wing trend within the European parties. This weekend, we've seen Viktor Orban of his Fidesz party in Hungary, which actually took a beating, a right-wing party that took a beating in European polls recently, aligning with other right-wing parties.

But the Centre for Emergency, they have indeed done several tests and Barbados' water and electricity is not off. It's still very much on. As I speak to you, we are speaking on uplink, so therefore you can tell that the power is still very much going pretty well. So at this stage, there's no real cause for emergency. In St Vincent and Grenadines, they've also been bolted up. We've bolted up here, of course, as you would imagine. The Prime Minister, the Honorable Ralph Gonzales in St Vincent spoke quite earlier about how things have been going there. The Honorable Mia Motley here in Barbados, she's been definitely prepared in case that there is anything major. So I speak with confidence that if something was to hit and happen, that the plan and the emergency evacuation is well underway. We have been hit before. This is now almost three years that Hurricane Elsa would have touched down in Barbados. That would have been July 2nd in 2021. That would have been the last major hurricane that would have touched in Barbados. And the plans then were pretty well for evacuation and they remain intact if that was to be the cause. But as I said, the system, while we're feeling much more wind, there is a lot of dust and a bit more rain. The system is not touching down as much.

We now bring you the story of one of those girls. COREN (voice-over): Huddled on the floor over school books, 16-year- old Azo meticulously copies the English sentences. Her neat cursive writing, a display of devotion to furthering her education. Learning new words makes me happy, she explains. But this scene was unthinkable just eight months ago when we first met Azo in the same room on the outskirts of Karachi in Pakistan. Don't worry, you'll be fine, says her brother, kissing her hand. We are with you always. Azo was bedridden, her skeletal frame wasting away. Every breath she took and movement she made causing unbearable pain. Azo is from neighboring Afghanistan and it's there in her home in July of last year she tried to kill herself. This is the first time the teenager, whose identity is hidden due to security concerns, is able to speak to us about what led her to that point. On that day I felt like everything was over. I glanced at pictures of my classmates and felt a deep sense of longing. I was overwhelmed by hopelessness and that's why I drank battery acid, convinced it would end my life. Azo, seen here in pink in happier times, is one of countless Afghan girls who have attempted suicide, an alarming trend spreading across the country since the Taliban returned to power almost three years ago. A ban on secondary education for girls, one of the most damaging of dozens of edicts enforced by the Taliban, contributing to what human rights activists describe as the most serious women's rights crisis in the world. A call backed up by U.N. officials. RICHARD BENNETT, U.N. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN AFGHANISTAN: The Taliban's institutionalized system of gender oppression, established and enforced through its violations of women and girls' fundamental rights, is widespread and systematic, amounting to crimes against humanity.
