And I want to talk more about this case with Cantu's attorney. Gena Bunn joins us now.Thank you very much for taking time for us this morning. We just saw your client there talking to our Ed Lavandera about this case. And I'm just wondering when you hear the jury foreman in that case, we just heard sound from him a few moments ago, talking about his own reservations. What -- what's your response to that and does your client know about this? What is his response to all of this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, he does know about this. You know, that's been one of the disturbing things about this case. And I think, the jury foreman's statement at this point just real -- encapsulates it. When Ivan stood trial back in 2001, he had a lawyer who had decided he was guilty for whatever reason, you know, based on what the state had given him and didn't do anything to help him. Didn't investigate the case. No independent investigation.And there were some other problems with the -- fundamental problems with the case. There was suppression of evidence by the police. Then after the trial, there was state habeas council who didn't have the bandwidth to handle a case like this, frankly. And at that point, the case just kind of got set in amber in a way that was totally distorted and wrong. And so, what that juror heard, you know, probably what -- and I think Ivan has even said this, that if he was on the jury with what his attorneys did and with what the state put forward, he probably would have found him guilty too. But now, by the time so much of this has come to light, there are just too many procedural barriers to get -- to really get Ivan's claims in front of the courts. And so, that's what we have been battling.",
