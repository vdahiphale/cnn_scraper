He wanted negotiations to be forwarded for Palestinian statehood, for the two-state solution, and that is something that eluded him during his presidency. It is something that has eluded all leaders up until the current day as well.We also saw that once President Carter left office, he then, in the years later, became more critical of Israel. It is something he was obviously able to vocalize more freely once he was no longer president. But he did write a book in 2006 called Palestine, Peace, Not Apartheid, a very provocative title which he acknowledged was provocative. He said he wanted to open the conversation, to start the conversation, and in the book said that the U.S. needed to be more unbiased when it was looking at the treatment of Palestinians by Israeli leaders in the occupied territories, and obviously using the word apartheid, a very provocative word referring back to South Africa's former repressive system of apartheid, and it did create a backlash among Israel's allies. But he was unrepentant. He said it was important to have these difficult conversations -- Max.",

      "sentences": "Jimmy Carter was the 39th president of the United States. He was in office from 1977 to 1981. As president, Carter spearheaded the Camp David Accords. Those agreements established the framework for the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.After his presidency, he and his wife founded the Carter Center. Its mission is to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering. Carter was honored with the first United Nations Human Rights Prize in 1998 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He didn't shy away from controversy. Starting in 2008, Carter met with senior Hamas officials, and in 2012, the former president wrote in a \"New York Times\" opinion piece that the U.S. was no longer a champion of human rights in light of drone strikes and recent legislative action. When you consider Jimmy Carter's greatest accomplishments, the Camp David Accords are likely to top that list, but as Will Ripley now explains, that's not necessarily how Carter himself saw things. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A smile and a handshake between two very different men who saw a common future. U.S. President Jimmy Carter and China's communist leader, Deng Xiaoping both knew the fate of the world would one day hinge on relations between the U.S. and China. It was 1979. Washington established diplomatic ties with Communist Beijing. For a president who got a deal done between Egypt and Israel and struck a nuclear accord with the Soviet Union, Carter believed ending hostility with Beijing was among his greatest achievements.",

And that really is what put Taiwan in this very compromised position internationally.RIPLEY (voice-over): The U.S. maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan, regularly selling weapons to its military. China experiencing huge economic growth due in large part to its relationship with the U.S. Now China is the world's second largest economy, but prosperity did not trigger political reform. Chinese leader Xi Jinping could potentially stay in power for life with a military more powerful than ever. Bilateral relations dropping to the lowest level in years. Carter always maintained people to people ties will prevail.",

It has been a trending topic on social media, including the social media platform Weibo. I want to share with you some of the responses that we have been tracking throughout the day since his death.Among the responses, someone said: Good old Carter, a U.S. president who truly deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Among all the living former U.S. presidents, he is relatively friendly to China, was another response. Someone also noting this is the last foreigner to appear in history textbooks. As we talked about earlier, the relationship between the U.S. and China has also been complicated by this new position that the United States, at least since the 1970s, took toward Taiwan. At this point, no response that we have seen officially from the government in Taipei. Also interesting to point out that the relatively new Japanese prime minister, he also issued a statement today really lauding the former president for his work as a diplomat, not only during his time in the White House, but also in his post-presidency era. As we just saw, Max, the former president spent a lot of time in China once he left the White House.",

And, you know, Max, it is harrowing to be this close, only a few meters away from the wreckage.And we're going to show you the tableau and zoom in to different parts of what we're seeing. First and foremost, the nexus point of this disaster zone is certainly the tail, the section where the two survivors were rescued. Both of them are in Seoul hospitals right now, and they're certainly part of the key to determining what exactly happened. We've been here for hours, Max, and I can tell you there are still scores of people here, but there are hundreds, Max, hundreds of members of the military, people in forensic white coats analyzing parts of the debris, searching for human remains for the myriad family members that are just about a kilometer away from where we're standing, huddled together, hushed silent prayers emanating from the corridors of this airport. To pray for answers and certainly finding remnants and remains of their family members. We also want to point out to the left of our frame of view, you can see the yellow crane towering. Well, the tail is about 15 meters tall, so 20 or so meters tall right there. It's been working more than 24 hours so far. There's still no time frame on when exactly this wreckage is going to be moved. The airport is closed until Wednesday and you can see Charlie Miller, our photojournalist behind the camera. Let's try to tilt down again to the wreckage that's just beyond the yellow caution tape. Max, it's so arresting to see pieces of the plane, and I wish it were still daytime because what we were able to see a couple hours ago, besides what you're looking at right now, recognizable pieces of the plane in terms of tray tables, Max, seats that are now mangled metal, those magazines that you see in terms of, you know, things that you can buy, SkyMall type magazines, safety instructional cards. And what really got me was seeing the yellow safety vest inflated, but meters and meters away, thrown like a football field distance away from that tail section. So still so much going on here in terms of figuring out what happened, as you mentioned, confirmed that the pilot called out a distress call saying that there was a bird strike. But unclear, Max, at this hour, how a bird strike might have led to the cascading chain of events of the landing gear not deploying and leading to this catastrophe -- Max.",

So they were so connected and I think their personal example and the way they loved so much the work and the connections to the families who are purchasing the homes inspired so many. And then the sustained commitment was so extraordinary.So, you know, in 1984, Habitat was a tiny organization. And when President and Mrs. Carter rode that bus up to New York City and slept in a church basement to rehab a tenement building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, that's when the world found out about Habitat. And that started a 35 year run of every year going somewhere in the world to build homes alongside families in need. President Carter told me frequently that working with Habitat for Humanity was the best way he knew to put his Christian faith into action in a very tangible and practical way. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
