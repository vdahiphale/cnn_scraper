We can't get inside Alvin Bragg's head, but the fact that I can see both sides of it, I think is a problem in itself. So on the one hand, I know Alvin Bragg personally, I've worked with him at the Southern District of New York for several years.I know him to be nothing but a straightforward, honest, ethical prosecutor. On the other hand, if you look at the circumstances here, we have to acknowledge the U.S. Justice Department, the same office, Alvin and I worked at, the Southern District of New York passed on charging Donald Trump in January 2021. They could have they looked at the case decided not to. Alvin Bragg's predecessor, as D.A. Cy Vance had this case in front of him for over a year and did not charge it. And I think the big question that Bragg ultimately has to answer through his evidence, through his indictment, maybe through his public statement is why now, why six and a half years after the fact on charges that will be either misdemeanors or the lowest level felony. And I think that gives rise to legitimate questions like the ones you're raising.",

We don't know the evidence, we don't know -- we know that a lot of individuals, including people from the Trump campaign, have gone and visited the grand jury. There's a lot we don't know here. And so I would encourage everyone to take a step back, let's read the documents.And remember that if we go down this road, it might be unique for us, but other major democracies, including France, and Israel and others have charged former heads of state with crimes. And they were all right. We will be all right as well, if we are going to go down this uncharted path.",

Michael Cohen has been quite outspoken about exactly what he's testified about. We know that the heart of these charges, which there has been an indictment will focus on those hush money payments.And, you know, I'm aware of the analysis that Anthony cites it was put out by the Manhattan D.A.'s office, I think in anticipation of just this type of question. But that analysis, while it's useful to know those numbers, does not even begin to answer the core question. First of all, they give us the numerator, but not the denominator. They tell us how many cases they charge, but they don't tell us how many cases they passed on. Also, the analysis completely overlooks the fact that prosecutors have to use their discretion, they have to evaluate each case on its own merits. And if you look at that analysis, first of all, Michael, there's the legal problem that you and the Washington Post in the New York Times point out about state prosecutors charging a violation of federal election law, I think they're going to have a real legal problem there, too. But there's also the problem that if you look at those cases that were charged, the fact patterns are very different. All of those cases, virtually all of those cases involve somebody falsifying business records, then taking those records outside of their organization, using those business records to steal money from a bank, from a lender, from an investor, from a customer. Here, we don't know that the Trump org ever took those documents outside of their organization. Seems like they were just in house at Trump org. And then the campaign finance issue is completely different from a financial type that that usually animates these cases.",

The letter also calls for more regulation of AI systems, including oversight and tracking watermarks to help distinguish between real and artificial images funding for AI safety research, and resources for economic and political disruptions caused by AI. My next guest is a signer of that letter, Stuart Russell literally wrote the book on AI. He's the co-author of \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.\" That's a textbook used in 1,500 universities in 135 countries. He's also a professor of Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley, and a leading AI researcher. Dr. Russell, thank you so much for being here.

But whose internal operations we have absolutely no idea about. And just to emphasize that, I asked Microsoft, does the system now have internal goals of its own, that it's pursuing, and they said, we haven't the faintest idea.

So there are many, many cases like this, where there's irresponsible uses. And I would say that the systems that exist now, probably don't, as they currently exist, present a direct threat to our control.
