All right, welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans.Just hours from now, President Biden will speak to the nation about his administration's plan to deal with the failure of two, two banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Two big commercial banks with more than $200 billion in total deposits. SVB, a major funder of tech startups. Federal officials are desperate to prevent contagion leading to runs on other banks. So far, they have promised everyone with deposits in those two banks insured and uninsured will be able to get the money out, and with the word, bailout, now a political third rail in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, officials are also promising taxpayers will be on the hook for none of it, although investors and bondholders will be wiped out. CNN's Jasmine Wright live for us in Washington. What a weekend, clearly, a very busy weekend at the White House, at the Treasury, at the Fed. What's the plan and what's been the reaction, Jasmine?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christine. Well, the White House has been watching this very closely, acknowledging the concerns people have that this could lead to a financial crisis like 2008. So, at the president's direction, his economic team has worked really hand-in-hand with financial regulators, behind-the-scenes efforts, furious behind-the-scene efforts to lead to these dramatic measures that you just described.Now, when you talk to the White House officials, they say two things, first, they say this is not 2008, that the economy is in a much better place, and that guardrails have been put in place to avoid, to help or to respond to issues like this. And, two, they say that this is not a bailout, but instead a way that they can protect those who have deposits and those who need to make payroll. And so, the president, I think that's one of the reasons why we'll hear him speak this morning, really trying to take his message directly to the American people, but also to those abroad, and really clean up any misconceptions that people may have about the administration's efforts. He also is promising accountability. I want to read you a part of his very strong statement that he released last night. The president said the American people and American businesses can have confidence that their bank deposits will be there when they need them. \"I am firmly committed to holding those responsible for this mess, fully accountable and to continuing our efforts to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks so that we are not in this position again.\" Now, that last part strengthening regulations is important because President Biden thinks that divided Congress here. So, the likelihood that he can get some type of regulations passed is pretty low. But he and his administration have kept Congress really abreast over their actions, of course, this weekend, doing multiple briefings with divided members of Congress, trying to keep them hand- in-hand, as this administration looks to respond to this very serious issue.

But to be fair, it was all part of their usual script, especially for the annual political theater that was the gathering of the country's rubber-stamp. And now, that event is more choreographed than the Oscars. But this year, there have been some interesting developments including the appointment of General Li Shangfu as the new defense minister.Li actually has been sanctioned by the U.S. government, by the Trump administration since 2018 for his role in the Chinese procurement of Russian weaponry. So installing him in this position would make it very challenging for the two sides to resume military-to-military dialogue. That was suspended last year after the Nancy Pelosi visit to Taiwan. So, this is worrisome because many have said this kind of mail-to-mail communication is increasingly critical at a time when trust was so low, any little incident could balloon into a major crisis as we have seen recently. But perhaps, most extraordinarily we have seen during this year's session was from Xi Jinping himself. Last week, he said the U.S.-led West has been out to contain and suppress China in a comprehensive way, and of course, vowing to   fight back. And that kind of language, naming the U.S. in this kind of direct attacks, we had not heard from a top Chinese leader in years.

It seems, Christine, that the Ukrainian resolve, despite the fact that we saw debate around the merits of hanging on, given the losses that, that resolve has now strengthened, one, because as President Zelenskyy put it in an interview with CNN last week, if Russia does capture Bakhmut, that will give them an open road to other cities in the east.
