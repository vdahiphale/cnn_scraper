Having said that, it does enable the opportunity to really get back to a negotiation which will bring back those 101. As long as Yahya Sinwar was that military terror leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, there was no way to go. He was not willing in any way to negotiate over the 101. Now there is that opportunity. ZAKARIAgovernment was that Hamas had broadly agreed to some terms for a ceasefire and a release of hostages.

They're the ones who built over years a subterranean, underground system, not for the people of the Gaza Strip to protect those Hamas terror fighters, and in that sense, what they built was defenses just for Hamas.And I don't know of another way because you asked, did we need? Why did Hamas do this attack? Why are they holding the hostages? Why have they not let them go? Why have they allowed it to continue? I would ask Hamas, not Yahya Sinwar, who is dead, and in that sense, I will not miss him, and whoever comes in his stead, I'm going to ask them, why are they using all of the Gaza Strip as their protection? Why are they not letting the hostages out? Why are they acting as if all of this is not their own fault?",

And my heart goes out to what has happened to any innocent civilian, any uninvolved civilian anywhere within this war as it's going on.What I want to approach in that sense are two different aspects. There's the military aspect, Hamas built under this Yahya Sinwar, and this is something that was done over many years, not in the last year, not in the year that Netanyahu came into power. Over many years, they built an enormous, and I'm using this term not lightly, terror army. What do you do with the terror army? I don't have a good answer for that and I don't think that anybody right now knows what to do with it. What Israel has done is trying systematically to destroy the terror army capability to prevent an October 7th attack. People are like, what, they did October 7th, you need to prevent they're doing it again. I want a different education so that it doesn't seem OK for anybody to support what Hamas says, the destruction of Israel that they write into their charter, that Jews are pigs. That's the good part. They write worse things. I'd like them not to support Hezbollah. Not to see those flags flying on U.S. campuses, let alone anywhere else in the world. I want a better future for the Palestinians. But what do you do against the terror army? You can't allow them to define what's going to be the next step. That would be a horrible message, not just for Israel, but for the entire world.",

Netanyahu has changed their rules of the came all the way up to executing the top negotiators Ismail Haniyeh a few weeks ago in order to make sure that no ceasefire negotiation would be achieved.I think we have to be very clear. This is not about a ceasefire for Netanyahu. This is not about the return of the captives. We know it. The American administration knows it. The families of the Israeli hostages know it. This is about Israel specifically the Netanyahu government completing its genocide in the Gaza Strip and expanding that war regionally in order to reshape the Middle East. They say it openly and I think it's about time we start listening to what the Israeli leaders are saying. Even today after Sinwar is executed, we have Netanyahu saying this will be -- this is a blow, but this is not the end of the game. We will keep going. For the Israeli government there is no stopping them until they have completely eliminated the question of Palestine, weather in this round or the next, and this is the only motive that's driving Netanyahu at the moment.",

And we can put an economic system together that I actually think, again, flips the script on China and leaves them isolated because their tactics have a weakness inherent in it.

You've got to make the most of it.That means we have to build up our security pieces on the defense side. We have to continue to work to bring other countries closer to the United States from a political diplomatic side. And then we have to have an economic component where the three of them work interlocking all in the same strategy where China, once isolated, backs off. As you saw, eight years ago, just take this as playbook, not only Australia on economic coercion, wolf warrior was seen as their diplomatic effort. It now cost them. They realize they've got isolated, so they've abandoned it as a strategy. Periodically it pops up, et cetera. If you integrate the three components that makeup a foreign policy or national security, security meaning on the defense side, the diplomatic efforts and political efforts and the economic into a multilateral alliance building effort China then realizes the maneuverability in the room is limited.
