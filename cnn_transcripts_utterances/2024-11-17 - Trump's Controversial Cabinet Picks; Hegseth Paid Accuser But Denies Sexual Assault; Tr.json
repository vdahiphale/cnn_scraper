Hegseth's attorney says the incident was a consensual sexual encounter. Hegseth hasn't been charged in any criminal case or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit in connection with the incident.As for Trump himself, he spent Saturday night in New York. In an ultimate fighting event. He was with several allies and newly selected administration picks, including his former -- rather his choice for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And his choice for director of intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, as well as Elon Musk, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and Kid Rock. Earlier in the day, Trump selected the head of a fracking company to be his secretary of energy. He's a man who's expressed doubt that climate change is linked to extreme weather.

That will be chaired as well by Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, who is also named by Trump as his secretary of the interior. Even as Trump builds out his incoming administration, he continues to face questions about some of his picks that he has already made, including Matt Gaetz as attorney general. Gaetz is a figure who has many enemies on Capitol Hill for starting intraparty fights over the years. He is also the subject of multiple investigations into alleged sexual misconduct. And Trump remains steadfast in his determination to get Gaetz across the finish line, despite concerns that he cannot get the 51 votes in the U.S. Senate to be confirmed.

He can afford to lose a third vote. If the vote is 50/50 in the Senate, then J. D. Vance, as the president of the Senate, casts the casting vote.I think there are other senators who are not died in the wall Trump supporters, but have -- as I was sort of saying before, they're going to be much more reticent and directly challenging Trump, at least publicly. But I think one thing that's interesting, if I may say, is that if we look at the leadership election for the Republican leader, the stated preferences of the senators were somewhat different from the revealed preferences. And then, what I mean by that is that John Thune, who's a more moderate figure than Rick Scott won the election in a secret ballot. And of course, these nominations, these confirmation votes are not a secret vote. And I do think that if they were secret -- if it was a secret ballot, Trump would probably lose a lot more of these confirmation votes than he will when it's on the record ballot, because the Republican grassroots, voters who voted in the primaries, will be able to follow along and put pressure on their senators.",

And so, we're seeing a continuation and an intensification of that. In the last administration, there was some internal pushback from career civil servants, and there are accounts of the Trump -- first Trump presidency where career civil servants did, in some cases, seemed to soft pedal some of the moves that were coming out from Trump and his closest advisers. This time, the Trump administration is going to be, I think, much more determined to root out internal dissidents as they would see it, and what that probably means is removing some of the employment protections that some civil servants have or at least threatening that as a way of ensuring compliance with the mission of the of the agency heads.",

And for that reason, this has been something that the Biden administration has talked about, something that it was brought up in conversation with China.So, there was agreement to form a process in place when it comes to the most sensitive of issues concerning A.I., such as the use of a nuclear weapon, that any of the human checks would never be skirted and that there would be human intervention. With all of that said, on such a heavy topic, the point of this meeting wasn't so much about agreements and treaties or deliverables, but this was also a chance -- in fact, the prime goal of China at least, a chance to send a signal to the incoming Trump administration that it very much favors this idea of open communication and stability. In fact, we were looking at some of the reporting earlier today from Chinese state media, and among the few, phrases that President Xi was conveying to President Biden was win-win cooperation, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence. What is interesting is that when President-Elect Trump was elected Beijing, President Xi, gave a congratulatory message and these exact phrases were used in that. So, Beijing realizes with this incoming Trump administration is going to be very important to play it diplomatically safe. In fact, a lot of talk about managing differences and striving for a smooth transition of China. President Xi and President Trump certainly are familiar with each other. It was back in 2017 that then-President Trump hosted President Xi at Mar-a-Lago. It was a photo-op in the making. And there were some -- definitely some high moments. I mean, I think everyone goes back to that moment when the two leaders shared chocolate cake. Their wives were there. But things did change. First of all, a lot of these trade and tariff issues became very complicated, very thorny. And then, of course, we saw President-Elect Trump, when he was president, at least the first time around, criticized China about its COVID response. So, this is what Beijing is going to have to balance going in. And that's why it has been making this very considerate effort, using the best of diplomatic speak, to try to have an open arms, open line feeling for this incoming Trump White House. But there are going to be some very difficult times ahead most likely. First of all, if we look at the cabinet, if Marco Rubio is indeed confirmed as secretary of state, he is a well-known China hawk as well as many others in the Trump circle, and they will be confronting very difficult issues such as trade. Max, one thing that makes the China-U.S. relationship very difficult is that China very much believes in this idea of tit for tat, you hurt me, we will do something to hurt you back. So, all of that looms over these very sensitive issues, Max, including that of trade and tariffs.",

And the thought was at that time that that was stabilizing the relationship.In fact, on both sides, it's not as stable as it looks. Obviously, the entree of President Trump brings upon the possibility not only of tariffs, but of a much broader change in other policies that the U.S. has pursued, including military to military communication, including a fairly lengthy dialogue on the future of the South China Sea and on Taiwan, on which President Trump's views are still not well known. But the biggest difference is that when Trump left power four years ago, the relationship that exists now between Russia and China was really nascent. It had not turned into much. Now, we have China supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing it with technology. And the question is going to be, is President Trump going to view it as his strategy to get in the way of that superpower partnership? And we don't know. It was -- never came up in the course of the campaign. It's probably the biggest single change in geopolitics since Trump left office. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sources tell CNN that officials, political officials in Beirut are still considering this proposal and that we may expect to see an official response as early as Monday night, though, of course, with these sorts of things and with past previous attempts to secure a ceasefire that may not necessarily pan out as is hoped.But of course, there is some optimism that this might be able to bring some calm to Lebanon after what has been weeks of near nonstop bombardment, including in the country's airstrikes where we continue to see airstrikes now. This current proposal on the table would stipulate a 60-day pause in fighting in the hope that this would then lead to a lasting ceasefire proposal. And what is crucial here is that officials and sources tell CNN that this current ceasefire proposal stands within the parameters of the U.N. 1701 Resolution, which brought an end to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war. Crucially, that resolution says that the armed forces or armed presence in Southern Lebanon be beneath the Litani River should only be the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeeping forces. Crucially, that would mean no presence by Hezbollah militants in this particular area of Southern Lebanon. Of course, Israeli government has continuously pushed for Hezbollah forces to be pushed out of Southern Lebanon. So, this would be a crucial step in terms of trying to secure some sort of peace between Hezbollah and Israel, but of course, it would be a significant concession on the part of Hezbollah. It remains to be seen whether or not they agree to this current proposal on the table, but there is certainly mounting pressure as we continue to see the Israeli forces expanding their incursion in Southern Lebanon. Of course, as you mentioned, the continuous airstrikes that are now targeting parts of Beirut.",

And they don't see a distinction here, if there is indeed a distinction here.The Israeli strikes are not simply striking Hezbollah, they're striking Lebanon, they're striking civilian areas.

Now, it's time for former New York mayor and Trump associate Rudy Giuliani to pay up and begin handing over luxury assets to the two Georgia election workers that he defamed. Some of those items include a Mercedes convertible, a diamond ring, and his Manhattan apartment. There's also a sizable luxury watch collection. The former New York mayor has owed nearly $150 million for almost a year now. CNN Correspondent Gloria Pazmino is following the story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. There's a long list of items that former mayor Rudy Giuliani is supposed to hand over to Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman. They are the two women who sued him for defamation, and a judge found that he had defamed them after he, without evidence, accused them of having tried to steal the 2020 election and of rigging the votes in Georgia. Now, some of the items that Giuliani has to turn over include his $6 million apartment, a watch, a collection, a diamond ring, furniture, a television, and a 1980 Mercedes Benz convertible. Now, this past Friday was a critical deadline for Giuliani, who has tried to delay having to turn over some of these items while he tries to argue that he should be allowed to keep some of them. But we got video from Friday showing one of his assistants preparing to ship the luxury watch collection via FedEx to both Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman. Now, this is a remarkable fall from grace for the former mayor of New York City, a man who was once referred to as America's mayor. And it's been a long running saga after he accused Moss and Freeman of having something to do with rigging the election, which of course we know did not happen. Now, in the last several months, Giuliani has tried to delay this judgment, at first by arguing that he was bankrupt, that proceeding was thrown out of court after he failed to comply with basic requirements of the court. And now, by saying that he wants to be able to hold on to some of the items. There are some things in the list of things that Giuliani has to turn over that the judge will still get to decide on. But for now, the process has started. Now, we're talking about $148 million judgment against Giuliani. So, the reality is that it's unlikely he'll ever be able to fully pay what he owes to Moss and Freeman. But for now, by turning over his watch collection, as well as his apartment, some of the sports memorabilia, as well as the car, it seems that process has finally gotten started.

Parts of South Jersey, including Atlantic City, feeling extreme drought conditions. All of Delaware again, feeling some severe impacts.New York City has only gotten an inch and three quarters of rain since the beginning of September. Philadelphia is barely over an inch in that time. That means that our deficit for fall is well over eight inches in these locations. We desperately need the rain. That's what keeps igniting these fire weather conditions and those will continue as we go through the weekend. Now, we do find that these fire weather days are increasing in Northern New Jersey. We find 10 more hot, dry, and windy days in New Jersey since the 1970s. We will find some rain as we go into the work week. That will put down maybe an inch or two in a lot of these locations in the northeast. It's not much, but it at least helps alleviate that fire weather for the coming days in the work week. Now, this rain is going to come as this storm ignites in the Central Plains, that will start with the showers and storms on Sunday. See this red area, that's where we could find some strong and severe storms with maybe some isolated cases of damaging winds, large hail, maybe a brief tornado. That front continues to flourish as we go into Monday. Again, that could bring some damaging winds, large hail, maybe brief tornadoes as we go into Monday. This area continuing to move east, going into the Central Plains. Heavy rain is also a concern across parts of Northern Texas and Oklahoma where some four to six inch rain totals are possible.
