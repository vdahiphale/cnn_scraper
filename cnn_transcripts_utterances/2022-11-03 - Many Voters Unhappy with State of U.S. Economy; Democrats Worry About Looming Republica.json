Now why were they so focused on Justice Thomas? Well, he's the justice who is responsible for any emergency action out of the state of Georgia and the surrounding region. But this does raise some questions because of course his wife Ginni Thomas , she has come up multiple times in this Congressional investigation into January 6. Not only did she attend the January 6th \"Stop the Steal\" rally but investigators have uncovered text messages that she was sending then White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows pushing these false claims of election fraud. Now former Trump attorney John Eastman, he has been fighting in court to try to keep these emails from the committee. But a federal judge ordered that they should be turned over because they are potentially evidence of a crime. In these emails the judge argues there specifically there is possible evidence of trying to metal with a congressional and official proceeding. Also, in these emails, you see these attorneys, they are concerned that they or their clients could potentially be prosecuted. Because the former president, he has signed a verification in one of these legal cases supporting verifying these false claims of election fraud and they argue in late December. By that point he had been informed that this was in fact, not true. And they were concerned that once again, he signed one of these verifications and submitted it to the court that they believe the U.S. attorney or a local prosecutor could eventually go after their client or even after the lawyers. And that is, of course, exactly what happened. There are now multiple investigations into this conduct. And again, we're getting to seeing those emails because a judge has ruled -- a federal judge has ruled that they are potentially evidence of fraud. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, we're going to have some sort of roller coaster here in the coming days. And that is in the form of a cold front that Bianca mentioned just a moment ago. Temperatures in Minneapolis yesterday were warmer than Las Vegas, Nevada. In Green Bay, Wisconsin, they actually tied their warmest November temperature ever, 75 degrees.Well, it's all going to come crashing down thanks to this cold front you see basically bisecting the middle parts of the U.S. right now. And that collision of air masses is unfortunately going to be the recipe for the chances of severe weather. Today, we're focusing our attention on the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle. But as the week progresses towards Friday, we're going to see the chance of severe weather actually increase especially into the afternoon and evening hours. So here it is today, slight risk, that's a level 2 out of 5 from the Storm Prediction Center. Texas, that includes Amarillo, just west of Oklahoma City as well as Wichita. But look at Friday, that's an enhancement that shading of orange. And that includes the Dallas Fort Worth region. We're talking about millions of Americans under an enhanced risk of severe weather. That's a level 3 out of 5, according to the Storm Prediction Center. And it's, again, all thanks to this cold front. Which, by the way, is producing a significant amount of snowfall across the inner mountain west. We're not going to measure this in inches, it will be in feet on those higher elevations. But as that cold front moves east it starts to trigger off the thunderstorms. Again, Texas Panhandle today, then further eastward towards Dallas and just outside of Houston. That cold front will cool temperatures for places like green Bay and Minneapolis. No more record high temperatures for you. And then we focus our attention on the next weather maker approaching the Pacific Northwest. We already have winter weather alerts for millions of Americans and there's the potential for snowfall piling up in feet across some of these ski resorts looking to cash in on an early-season -- Bianca, Max, back to you.",
