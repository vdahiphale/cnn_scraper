      "sentences": "Well, certainly with the departure of Benny Gantz eight days ago that the end of this war cabinet seemed inevitable, because he took with him Gadi Eisenkot, who was also an ally of Gantz, who was part of that war cabinet as an observer, but an effective participant as well. So, he essentially stopped existing once Gantz left. And now, the question of discussing and deciding matters relating to the war in Gaza has gone to a wider security cabinet, which, of course, includes the likes of Bezalel Smotrich, the Finance Minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the National Security Minister, both of whom are ultra-right-wing extremists in the government. And that's going to pose a problem in terms of just deciding what to do in Gaza.But, what Netanyahu clearly didn't want to do is have, as part of that war cabinet, those two ministers who certainly, for the United States, would simply not be acceptable. But, they're still in the government. They're still very much involved in many of the decisions that are being taken. And those two ministers are essentially opposed to any humanitarian aid to Gaza, any ceasefire whatsoever until Hamas is completely destroyed. So, Benjamin Netanyahu is now in a government that's lost two perhaps cooler heads, and he is now sitting in this security cabinet with some of the most extreme elements in Israeli society at the moment.

I'm now joined by Gideon Levy, a columnist with the Israeli daily Haaretz. He accuses his country of waging war in Gaza quote \"without a conscience.\" Gideon, good to have you. Welcome today. Let me just start first with your reaction to the disbanding of the war cabinet. What impact will that or won't that have, from your perspective? GIDEON LEVY, COLUMNIST, HAARETZ: Unfortunately or fortunately, it will not have any impact. It's more of a symbolic game, mainly to please the Americans and to show them that Netanyahu is tough enough and he does not add Bezalel Smotrich and Ben-Gvir into his war cabinet. But, the meanings are very little. In your conversation with Ben, you just mentioned that the leaving of Bezalel Smotrich and Benny Gantz and Eisenkot, who were the moderates in the war -- in this cabinet will now change its nature. So, I would like to claim, Rahel, that in this framework, their influence was zero. What moderation was there with 37,000 Palestinians killed was the destruction, the starvation and all the atrocities in Gaza? How worse could it have been without the two? So, we are a little bit plagued with ourselves. This government is led by Netanyahu and he is the main decision maker, in many ways, the only decision maker. He is being taken hostage by his own will, by the right wingers, and he follows the lines with the war cabinet or without it, and this will continue.",

By the end of the day, also Ben-Gvir does not get direct decisions on war and peace, but he has an enormous influence. But, Netanyahu is the one, as I said, who decides. Inside the cabinet, you see, there are no normal decision-making processes in this cabinet. Everyone looks at its own political basis and is concerned about his own reelected in the next primaries, and it's not a serious government or a serious organ that you can analyze how will, from now on, decision making will go on.It will continue to be based on domestic politics. Like, always in Israel, it will continue to be by pleasing the right wingers both in the government and in the public opinion and to avoid any kind of chance of ending this war.",

There was also an agreement at a summit in Switzerland over the weekend to forge a path to peace in Ukraine. But, some key powers didn't sign the joint statement, and Russia and China did not attend. Meanwhile, heavy fighting is reported along Ukraine's eastern border with Russia, as Ukrainian troops counter recent advances by Kremlin forces.Let's get to CNN's Clare Sebastian, who is tracking all of this from London.

I think what's happening in Vovchansk right now, up there in the north, where we saw that Russia in recent weeks has essentially opened a new front coming across the border, again, is really, I think, in the Ukrainian view, symptomatic of an overall strategy here, which is to launch multiple attacks in multiple different locations along these frontlines, try to dilute and exhaust Ukraine's defense, to try to target strategic locations in Vovchansk itself, is only about 70 kilometers from Ukraine's second city Kharkiv, and to do all this as quickly as possible now before more Western weapons come into play.Now, Ukraine has had more success recently in trying to stabilize that area of the frontline up in the north as more Western weapons have come into play gradually, and of course, as we saw that lifting by the United States of the restriction on using Western weapons or American weapons to hit across the border with Russia, it was a very limited loosening of those restrictions. But still, it is seeming to have some impact. The fighting is very intense. Ukraine saying that in the past day, Russia has launched some five attacks in that area around Kharkiv too was still ongoing as of Monday morning, but Ukraine claiming it is holding on to its positions, while Russia, on the flip side, saying that it believes that that part of the frontline is going its way.

So, that will certainly come up.He also wants to secure an annual financial commitment, which many in Europe have interpreted as a way of sort of Trump proofing aid for Ukraine, making sure that it's in place ahead of November election. So, there is certainly an urgency there. And then, of course, we did see comments to a British newspaper over the weekend from Stoltenberg saying that the NATO alliance needs to essentially bring some of its nuclear weapons out of storage to show the world its nuclear arsenal. The U.S. is one of only three NATO countries with nuclear weapons, will certainly be crucial if he attempts to move forward with that. Russia has said that it would see that as an escalation.

This comes after a series of meetings on Capitol Hill last week where Donald Trump met with both the Republican conference in the House and the Republican conference in the United States Senate in two separate gatherings, an opportunity once again to sort of pitch what his campaign theory of the case is and to try to get Republicans united behind him ahead of the election.Look, a lot of what former President Donald Trump would be able to do in a second term will hinge on whether or not Republicans continue to control the House of Representatives and whether or not they're able to take back the United States Senate. And the reality is that it's a very steep hill to climb to keep the House right now, given what we are seeing in polls across the country, and given the fact that there has been so much Republican disarray because of that narrow majority in the House of Representatives. Now, this is also an opportunity for the Speaker to send a signal to some of his conservatives like Marjorie Taylor Greene that he is united solidly with former President Trump, that Trump has his back. That comes in handy, because as you remember, just a couple of weeks ago, Marjorie Taylor Greene tried to oust the Speaker. Now, the votes weren't there, but there were a considerable number of members who voted with her. So, that gives you a sense that even if Republicans keep the House, Mike Johnson is also thinking about his future and trying to cement his legacy as a Speaker, also trying to keep his job if the House remains in Republican control.

I think it is super smart for the campaign to be doing this. I think it's really aggressive in a good way, in an important way. Americans do need to understand who Donald Trump is today, a 34 times convicted felon who has been found liable for sexual assault and for fraud. Is this the kind of person that Americans at the end of the day are going to want to pull the lever for? We don't think so. And so, that's why I think it's really important. And the other thing, Rahel, is you've heard about this as well, and I want the international audience to understand what's going on politically and why things are so close when you have this kind of person versus a decent, accomplished President like President Biden is, and why things are so close. Americans went through trauma during the first four years of Donald Trump, and the psyche and the body is designed to forget trauma, and four years have passed. And so, it's easy to forget. It's easy to be focused on what's going on today. It's easy to kind of go into an amnesia, if you will. And this ad is designed to shake people out of that kind of amnesia so that they understand exactly what's at stake and what the contrast is between these two men, and that there is absolutely no measure of equal, right? The other side, Trump's supporters left to say, Oh, well, but Joe Biden this and But Joe Biden that. No, there is no but, right? Donald Trump is a 34 times convicted felon, and that is who people would be pushing -- pulling the lever for. And we believe at the end of the day, the vast majority of Americans will not do that.",

The campaign said that this event brought in $30 million. That is the largest Democratic fundraiser in history. The Biden campaign has really tried tapping in to the celebrity star power around this event with George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Jimmy Kimmel, and others being there to entertain the crowd, serving as a draw for people to donate to this event.

This is something that our colleague Dr. Sanjay Gupta has spent a lot of time focusing on, including in his podcast \"Chasing Life\", where he interviewed the Surgeon General about this, and Dr. Murthy gave three tips for families. One is, of course, start the conversation with your kids. You have to be communicating with them about these potential risks and about their use of these things. Number two, is to establish tech-free zones, perhaps around dinnertime and bedtime, social occasions, time for kids to exercise and get outside, make sure that they are spending time away from their phones and social media in order to get sleep and other important things.And third is to band together with other families, because kids might feel like, oh, it's only us who are putting in these rules. But, if you actually come together with other parents, create sort of shared rules and guidelines around this, it could help everybody do better here. And one thing he suggests is to avoid social media use until after middle school, really kids before 13, he says, shouldn't be on these apps.",

But, of course, firefighters are hopeful that maybe by the end of the week they can get better control of this fire. But, it is going to be a difficult fire season. So, I think it's important to say that all of California needs to prepare for a fire season that is going to likely be one with massive fires or a lot of fires in the state of California and the surrounding states just because of what we mentioned, a lot of rain, then very high temperatures, and it's that back and forth when it comes to climate change that fuels these fires.

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, I mean, basically, what this is showing is over 80 percent of the U.S. population is expecting temperatures above 90 degrees at some point this week. Now, you do have some areas where it's going to be a bit more extreme than others, and that's where we are forecasting most of these records to be broken. You're talking almost 200 potential record highs that could be broken at some point this week. Now, the bulk of them, yes, are going to be located in the northeast in the Midwest.But, also, you notice we have a few dots in the Southeast. We'll also have a few dots out in the West. So, it's not just one particular area. The concern for the Northeast and the Midwest is really more of the prolonged nature. For some of these areas, you're looking at multiple days of above average temperatures. For example, Cleveland, looking at least a five-day stretch of temperatures 90 degrees or higher. Some of these areas in the Northeast could break multiple days of records back to back. The other concern, especially in the Northeast, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, all of these areas don't even peak until we get to Wednesday and Thursday of this week, and then temperatures will be 15, even 20 degrees above average. So, it's that prolonged nature too. Another thing we're keeping an eye out is this. This particular system right here has a 70 percent chance of developing into a tropical system in just the next 48 hours. Now, regardless of whether or not this actually gets to be a named tropical storm, it's going to push a lot of tropical moisture up into a lot of these Gulf Coast states. So, you're talking Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and especially Texas, looking at a tremendous amount of rain in a short period of time. Look at some of these numbers, west of Houston, all the way down towards Corpus Christi, the red color and the pink color, you're talking six, eight, 10 inches of rain. Some spots could pick up as much as a foot of rain over the next several days. And Rahel, you probably remember, just last month, Houston went through devastating floods. Now, a month later, we're adding even more rain on top of it.",

Known as \"The Scientist\" for his precise and sometimes centric approach to the game, DeChambeau applied his calculus to win by one shot after an early challenge from a surging Rory McIlroy. McIlroy led at one point, but then faltered in the homestretch. DeChambeau held his nerve with a crucial sand save at 18, made par and that won over for the round, secured his second championship in five years.And after that victory, our Patrick Snell caught up with a thankful and thoughtful Bryson DeChambeau.
