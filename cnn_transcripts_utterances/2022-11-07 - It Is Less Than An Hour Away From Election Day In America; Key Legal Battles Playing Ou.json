All of those are things that he is doing to bring down the cost that people face.And then if you reverse that, Republicans are saying that on day one, they are going to repeal all those things that reduces household costs. So, they're going to bring up costs. Let me just say one thing about President Biden, which I think is very serious. Political pundits and politicians only concern themselves with the next election. Statesmen concern themselves with the next generation. If we look at what happened to Speaker Pelosi's husband, Paul, we would be irresponsible to not talk about the danger that we face in protecting this democracy.

There are civil rights at issue here. Of course, people are going to bring lawsuits. The issue now is that they happening before election day, and that is a very big deal. So, let's look at some of the states. Pennsylvania is really one to watch right now. In Pennsylvania, what you have, in order to cast an absentee ballot, voters have to sign an envelope and put their ballot in it. Now, look, thousands of people got this wrong in the state of Pennsylvania. It is minor error relatively. But at the end of the day, that might have invalidated their ballots. There is litigation right now over what to do with them. Now, they won't be counted on election day, but will they be treated as valid? So, that will be one to watch. And look, you have a very, very close Senate races for governor and senator. At the end of the day, those votes may not be counted. That could be the difference in Pennsylvania. So, moving further west, which takes you to Michigan, there was a suit there where the Republican secretary of state nominee in Michigan sued and invalidate thousands of ballots in Detroit. Now, a judge that looked at that one really shredded the lawsuit, saying it wasn't based in really much, if any, evidence, and raised the question of why this candidate was targeting Detroit. Look, Michigan has 10 million people in it. Why are you focusing your election challenge on just the one highly democratic city in the state of Michigan?  So, there were questions about the partisan makeup or the partisan backdrop of the lawsuit there. So, that one is not likely to succeed, but it is out there and a big one. Moving to Wisconsin, further west, I think we are moving from east to west here, but in Wisconsin, also a big battleground state, what happened there? There is this question of curing a ballot, right? When someone makes a mistake on their ballot, what do you do with it? Wisconsin allowed election workers to cure or fix in effect signature information on ballots, and that created a series of lawsuits. Republicans ultimately won that one. Finally, Arizona, another battle. These all seem to be happening in battleground states, Laura.",

Rain showers, snow showers across higher elevations. Reno certainly gets in on the wet weather as well. And really, the best piece of advice, when you look at the forecast over this region in the coming 24 or so hours, get out to the polls early because the weather really kind of goes down here rather quickly into the afternoon. Places such as Reno, you are already going to be running into snow showers. Seventy to 80% chance, we will begin to see snow accumulated into the afternoon hours. In places like Las Vegas, notice the increase in probability of rainfall by we say 3, 5, even 7:00 p.m. going up to 50, 70 plus percent chance the rain is going to be in place, gusty winds are going to be in place as well. And studies have looked at how weather plays a role into voter turnout. It typically favors the Republican-leaning voters. In fact, they come out in more likelihood numbers in previous studies than Democratic-leaning that are typically impacted and reduced in turnout there when it comes to wet weather. But here it comes across the Western United States. Again, the activity shifts a little further towards the south and east. Even Southern California gets in on some of these rain showers. Parts of areas around say Northern Arizona, notice what happens. Again, 3, 5, 7 p.m., the winds pick up here in intensity and the temps go downhill very quickly with this incoming front. Eastern U.S., generally quiet conditions. There is a tropical system offshore. It will be well offshore for any significant impacts. But places like Atlanta, temps well above average, which studies have looked the temps above average on election day, that does increase voter turnout, but it also has also been seen to be more likely to keep the incumbent power in play there and keep it more likely to continue forward there. So, the temps remain above average across the southern U.S. parts of the eastern U.S. Cool air is going to eventually arrive. And again, the subtropical feature that is offshore, guys, is going to remain well offshore. No impacts there for our friends in Florida.",
