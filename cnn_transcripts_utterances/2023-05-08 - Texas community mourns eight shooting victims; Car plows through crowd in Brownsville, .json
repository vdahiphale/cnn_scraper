Authorities are still piecing together details about the shooting andare trying to determine if the gunman had ties to right-wing extremism. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in Texas with more on the investigation. ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): The parking lot of the outlet mall here in Allen, Texas, where a gunman killed eight people, Saturday afternoon is still cordoned off. Hundreds of cars still in the parking lot as investigators continue to work through the scene. We have learned from various witnesses who were there at the time of the shooting that the gunman, from the moment he started firing to the moment where he was shot and killed by an Allen police officer, that the gunman had moved several hundred yards around a building inside that parking lot area. Several witnesses described the gunman moving deliberately and shooting at victims as he was continuing to move through the parking lot. We have now identified, according to a senior law enforcement source, the suspect as 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia. He lives in Dallas. We were in the neighborhood where his parents lived, and we were told that up until several months ago, he was living there. We tried to speak with Garcia's family but they refused to answer the door when we knocked on it, but we did speak with about a half dozen neighbors who described Garcia as someone who kept to himself.

A lot of times he would walk up and down the block, you know, and always with those Converse, you know, he liked those, I guess those were his favorite man with those Converse, so I think, you know, he would just like to walk up and down the block with his little hoodie on and just, you know, just didn't really say anything.(END VIDEO CLIP) LAVANDERA (on-camera): A senior law enforcement official also says that they have discovered that Mauricio Garcia has connections to right-wing extremism. On his body, they found an insignia with the letters that say RWDS, which stands for Right-Wing Death Squad. That senior law enforcement official also says that there has been a long list of social media posts with White Supremacists and Right-Wing Extremism themes as well. Exactly how all of that plays into the motivation for carrying out this attack here at this outlet mall in Allen, that part is not exactly clear, but that is some of the initial details that we are hearing from investigators. This, as we have now gone more than 24 hours since this shooting happened, that officials and law enforcement officers have not briefed reporters on the latest on this investigation.

Republican members of Congress cannot continue to meet this epidemic with a shrug. Tweeted thoughts and prayers are not enough. Once again, I ask Congress to send me a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, enacting universal background checks requiring safe storage, ending immunity for gun manufacturers. I will sign it immediately. We need nothing less to keep our streets safe. And President Biden in this statement also says that he believes the country has made some progress in addressing this issue, pointing to his signing of that bipartisan Safer Communities Act that sought to incentivize more red flag laws in the country and address mental health resources. But he also makes clear that he believes that despite the nearly two dozen executive actions he has signed on this issue, he believes he's now reached the limit of his executive authorities and he says that the burden now rests with Congress.

Falling debris caused damage in two districts in the capital and five people were injured. And you can see the damage left behind. And to the south, Ukraine says Russia fired eight missiles at the port city of Odessa. So far there are no reports of casualties.Meantime, on the front lines in the East, top commanders say Russian forces are increasing their attacks on Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military remains determined to keep Russia from capturing the city by Tuesday, when Moscow holds its World War II Victory Day parade. Ukraine says Russia is doing everything possible to take Bakhmut, including sending in more forces. Meantime, preparations are underway in Moscow for Russia's annual Victory Day parade to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany. Tuesday's event is typically used by President Vladimir Putin to show off his country's military might. But this year, events are reportedly being scaled back and security heightened just days after Russia alleged a drone attack on the Kremlin. In comments made just a short time ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy compared Vladimir Putin's Russia to Hitler's Nazi Germany. He said he is submitting a bill to his parliament to change Ukraine's official Victory Day celebration to May 8th. And CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments for us. She joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Clare. So, what more can you tell us about Russia's Victory Day preparations? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Yeah, Rosemary, very significant to hear that some regions are scaling back their efforts to celebrate Victory Day. This is a huge holiday in Russia. Russia lost, of course, an order of magnitude, more people, but soldiers and civilians, tens of millions in the Second World War. It's a huge part of their national identity. And we're hearing quite a few regions saying that they are scaling back their celebrations. Most of them, it should be noted, near the Russian border with Ukraine. Some citing security concerns. One saying that they don't have military equipment or military units. Various things there to prompt them to scale back, but very significant. And, you know, this used to be a day that Russia marked in conjunction with the West. This was a shared victory. You know, in the past, we've seen Western dignitaries attend the celebrations. In 2010, we even saw Western troops march alongside Russian troops in Red Square. So, this is a big turnaround. Now, we see no Western dignitaries there scaling back the celebrations. And as you noted, President Zelenskyy even distancing Ukraine from celebrating Victory Day on May the 9th, saying they were going forward from this year, celebrate it on May the 8th and May 9th going forward, he said will be a day of Europe and Ukraine to commemorate their alliance and the support of Europe in this war against Russia. So, that is an important development and it really just shows the landscape around Victory Day has changed in Russia.",

And that the city will be paying for the cost of sending them there and whatever they might need while they're in Rockland County. But this just gives you an idea of the many difficulties and obstacles that the City of New York is facing as it prepares for arrivals to start increasing significantly after Title 42 expires. Now, I've been speaking with sources inside the Adams administration all week who tell me that they're looking at this as an all-hands-on-deck moment. They are estimating that we might see up to 800 arrivals per day here in the city following the expiration of Title 42. And the city has a unique challenge when it comes to shelter because they are legally obligated to provide shelter to anyone who might need it. And now, the city is at a place where they are simply running out of space. They have been looking at a range of different ideas including everything from putting up tents in Central Park, to leasing out college dorms, using unused airplane hangars at J.F. Kennedy Airport. All of this, part of a long list of possible ideas that the city has been looking at as sheltering options as migrants begin to arrive here over the next couple of days. I should say that already more than 60,000 migrants have come through New York City and over 35,000 of them are currently in the care of the city. Mayor Eric Adams has made a big show asking the federal government for funding. And the federal government has only responded by giving just a fraction of the funding that the city has requested so far. So Mayor Eric Adams is certainly under pressure, not just to provide for those who will be arriving, but also to find the money and the funds to meet the need that will likely be here over the next several months as migrants continue to arrive.
