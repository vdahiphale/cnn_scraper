And a turbulent time for OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT welcomes back its Former CEO. And welcome once again to \"Connect the World\". And we begin with a glimmer of hope from a breakthrough deal in the Israel Hamas war. And now we're hearing that a truce is due to begin Thursday morning. This comes after both sides agreed to release of at least 80, sorry 50 hostages held in Gaza by Hamas, along with that pause in fighting. The move is bringing hope to families waiting for the return of their loved ones. In exchange Hamas says 150 Palestinian prisoners will be freed from Israeli jails. Israel's leader says he talked to the IDF about the deal, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I would like to make it clear here again, the war continues. The war will continue until we achieve all of our goals to eliminate Hamas, to return all our hostages, to ensure that the day after Hamas, Gaza will no longer be a threat to Israel. There will be no element in it that supports terrorism. That educates its children to terror, and will threaten the state of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

MJ, good to have you with us. President Biden, for his part choosing also to hone in and focus on the release of American hostages in particular, which I think you would expect. But everybody is acknowledging that this is an enormous breakthrough.

To get us to this point, what we've learned is that essentially shortly after October 7th, a top secret channel of communication was established by a small group of White House officials and Israeli and Qatari officials, in order to negotiate with Hamas about the hostage situation. And you'll remember that last month, we saw the release of two American women, American citizens. This is Judith and Natalie Raanan. And when that was executed successfully, that basically signaled to U.S. officials that they did feel like they had an effective way of negotiating with Hamas as painful and sort of slow moving and touching go, that process was at times and that's when they set out to try to get a larger group of hostages out. But as our reporting has shown the challenges of doing this has been just incredibly immense. We have in our reporting, that for a while Hamas actually refused to offer any identifying information about the hostages that they claim to have their gender, their age, their nationalities and then, so much so that this ended up being a major sticking point. And at one point U.S. and Israeli officials were discussing even whether Israel should delay its ground invasion because they thought a deal was so close. But they ended up not doing that because they didn't buy the fact that Hamas even had these hostages, given that they weren't offering any kind of proof. So these details just offer a little glimpse into how tenuous these negotiations were. And why officials all along said, they basically weren't even willing to get their hopes up because they did believe that things could break down at any point during these negotiations.",

Now new radar satellitedata shows that up to half of the buildings in Northern Gaza have been damaged since the start of the Israel Hamas war on October 7th that roughly accounts for as many as 23,000 buildings researchers obtained satellite radar imagery using a method similar to echolocation to map out the region across all of Gaza they say at least 20 percent of buildings have been damaged since the start of the war. And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is welcoming the agreement which he calls a humanitarian truce. And he's also calling for a broad ceasefire. As we mentioned, the deal also includes the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Israel has published the names of 300 prisoners who could potentially be freed, most are teenage boys. Let's get more from Nana Bashir in Jerusalem. Nada, I've had a look at this list. Some of these individuals are in some way affiliated with known terrorist groups like Hamas, but I have to say many aren't. Can you give us a sense of why some of these individuals were detained just to give us a sense of who indeed might be being released?",

It certainly didn't have any support or backup, given almost the entire workforce of OpenAI backed him. So unfortunately I don't think it really does help at all. Perhaps on the safety debate though, it's just reinforced the idea that Sam Altman needs to be very focused on this.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE AND DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Pentagon is getting in deeper with Elon Musk. Giving Musk's private space company SpaceX a contract for up to $1.2 billion to send secretive spy satellites into space. But that's not all. The Pentagon is also investing up to $70 million in Star Shield a more secure version of SpaceX's massive constellation of Starlink satellites, which are vital to the Ukraine military success against Russia on the battlefield. BRIG.GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: I can confirm that we do contract for Starlink for services and support to Ukraine, with the ultimate objective to be ensuring that Ukraine has the satellite communication infrastructure that it needs. FISHER (voice-over): And NASA couldn't send another astronaut to the moon without Elon Musk's company. Musk starship is the most powerful rocket ever built and it launched on its second test flight on Saturday. NASA will spend about $4 billion on it, because it will be the lunar lander of the Space Agency's flagship Artemis program. It's likely America's only chance to beat China to the moon in this second space race. NASA is also reliant on SpaceX to launch astronauts to the International Space Station.

But the IDF says it's continuing to target Hamas infrastructure until then. Meanwhile, Israel has published the names of 300 Palestinian prisoners who are eligible for release in exchange for hostages held by Hamas. Legal petitions against the release of specific prisoners can be filed to Israel Supreme Court, up to 24 hours from the lists release. In the meantime, Pope Francis met with Palestinian relatives of those held in Israeli prisons, as well as meeting separately with Israeli relatives of hostages still held by Hamas. After, he said he heard how both sides are suffering, staying, \"We have gone beyond wars. This is not war. This is terrorism\".

And the reason this is interesting is, because they're not a party to this truce agreement and this pause in the fighting. So we'll see. And it'll be very interesting to see if after 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, when the pause and fighting goes into effect, the Houthis in Yemen abide by that? Or do they continue to fire missiles at southern Israel? What about on the northern border, where we have seen a tremendous amount of continued fighting between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel, they're also not a party to this agreement. So it'll be very interesting to follow the other fronts of Israel and see whether the pause in Gaza for four days affects the northern border, the southern border, and even frankly, Syria.
