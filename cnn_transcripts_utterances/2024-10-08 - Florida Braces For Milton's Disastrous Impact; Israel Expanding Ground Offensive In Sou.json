That's about 250 kilometers an hour. Right now, most of Florida, some 20 million people are under hurricane and storm warnings, just weeks after being slammed by Hurricane Helene. Milton, as you can see from the international space station here, is expected to make landfall tomorrow. Right now, grocery stores are empty, gas stations are running out of fuel, highways at jam as people try to evacuate. And parts of the Tampa Bay area will lose access to running water later today.

The most to the point blunt messaging I have ever heard from the leader of this community in terms of evacuation.She's talking about evacuation zone eight, where I'm at right now, Davis Islands, its neighborhood here in Tampa. And what they're looking at here is a one-two punch, right? They had Helene come in two weeks ago. And this is the debris from that. It looks like a war zone. Take a look over there. Just says streets lined up with peoples homes, their furniture. These homes have been gutted and now they've got to worry about Milton. So, with Helene, that actually hit the landfall was further up north into the Big Bend area. But with Milton, they're worried that this is the storm that they have been dreading for decades. It would be the first storm to hit the Tampa Bay area directly. So what am I seeing today? Preparations, a race against time so many neighbors doing this trying to get rid of this debris that's just so dangerous. Installation, okay, but then you have pieces of wood, concrete, short pokey things that in hurricane force winds, these are going to be flying projectiles, so dangerous. They need to get the stuff out of the neighborhoods which is why the Governor Ron DeSantis has put out an executive order opening up all landfills in impacted areas. And today, we saw dump trucks, heavy machinery just adding to this mountain of debris over at the Florida fairgrounds, something. I have never seen an all of the hurricanes that I've covered here in the Tampa Bay area. I did also speak with a neighbor here in Davis Island, which is eerily quiet, so many of her neighbors had already evacuated. She was about to evacuate. This is what she told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When it comes to the track, that trajectory, any little wobble could change that storm surge forecast for better or for worse. So that's something that we need to watch, but we are confident it is going into the west coast of Florida.There's a front in the way to the north where that's going to stop it from going anywhere else, 155-mile-per hour winds right now in this center, you have a clear crystal clear, perfect circle, donut eye. This is a textbook as it gets for what a satellite image looks like. We are teetering on a category five right now. You need 157 mile-per- hour winds to hit that definition. So we're only two miles per hour away. You were kind of splitting hairs at this point when it comes to the street. It is incredibly strong. As it gets towards Florida, there's some dry air and some wind energy upstairs in the atmosphere that try to eat away at the intensity. But as that happens, were going to find this storm gets wider, fatter, could double in size, and that will send those wind impacts stretching farther miles, right? More people impacted. That's where the hurricane warnings now stretch from coast to coast, from Tampa, all the way through a window to the east coast. We could still be looking at hurricane force winds, category two, possibly cutting through Orlando as we go through the overnight. I mean, look at these wins in the purple here, 110 plus miles per hour from Tampa, down towards Sarasota, hurricane-force winds stretching to the other side of the state. Here's what I was talking about. The expanding of the wind field to even as the intensity shaved a little bit as a result of that, it gets wider. That impacts more people. That is what gives you the more widespread power outages. And when you have the tropical storm force winds and it taking in the entire peninsula and you can see the hurricane force winds going from coast to coast. That is what's going to pull in the storm surge. The storm surge is the push of the ocean from the intense winds in the center of the storm, ten to 15 feet from Tampa down toward Sarasota. This will be unprecedented for them. They broke records in Helene and we are expecting it to be double in Milton, down to six to ten feet from Fort Myers and Naples.

There are no schools. There are -- there are makeshift schools in displacement camps. There is very little jobs. What food is available on the market, it's at a very, very high price and is very -- is pre-packaged. It's a very small range of food. To reach all the people, all the civilians who are currently need support and assistance in Gaza, it's incredibly challenging. In the south, it is -- we are able to move from different areas, but some areas of Gaza have been so damaged by the hostilities that the roads are impassable. The rubble piles over it, as well as other risks like explosive remnants of war, which our ammunition that have not yet detonated or exploited.

And they claim that TikTok has failed to do enough to address TikTok challenges.These viral video trends were teens tried to replicate videos created by others and can sometimes engage in dangerous behavior like riding on the outside of a subway train. This is a stunt known as subway surfing. And the complaint alleges that a New York teen was killed doing this earlier this year, and that his mom actually found videos on his TikTok feed promoted bring this kind of behavior. And, of course, you're right that TikTok, this is not the first time that TikTok has faced these kinds of claims. We've seen other state actions related to children's safety and a U.S. DOJ lawsuit recently over children's privacy violations that they claim TikTok has engaged in, Lynda.",
