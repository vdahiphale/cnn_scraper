Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, Alsu Krumasheva, tonight, their destination is American soil. And the simple thing that you and I take for granted every day, every single second of our existence, they are about to walk free. Already, the how this happened and the why it happened now and the price it took to make it happen is causing campaign complications for Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Over many years, President Biden and I and our team have engaged in complex, diplomatic negotiations to bring these wrongfully detained Americans home. We never stopped fighting for their release. And today, in spite of all of their suffering, it gives me great comfort to know that their horrible ordeal is finally over. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has been involved in many a prisoner swap most recently, and most maybe high-profile in recent years, Trevor Reed, who was released in 2022. It's great to have you here, Jonathan.Okay, the politics of a prisoner swap, I mean, this is historic and unprecedented in all the things in any year. The fact that is happening in 2024, it's like one of those things that yet again was not on my bingo card and it just landed on it. But what are the politics of prisoner swap in the middle of an election year? You add it up and it becomes what kind of a suit? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think if you had a normal nominee, and I just mean conventional nominee, there wouldn't be politics around a prisoner swap. This was an incredible day for these people. It was a great day. Very sad for some others who were left behind, but it was a great day. And Donald Trump had to inject himself and his politics and his ego into, saying I would have gotten a better deal, as if you were talking about one of his buildings and not people. So, I think there shouldn't be election politics around what happened today and I don't know that there would be unless Donald Trump decided to make this about him and not that.",
