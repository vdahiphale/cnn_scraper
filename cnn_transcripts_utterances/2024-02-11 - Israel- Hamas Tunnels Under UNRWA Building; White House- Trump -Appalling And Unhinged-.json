But Israeli forces are already striking in Gaza's southern city. Medical officials in the Hamas-run enclave tell Palestinian news agency WAFA that airstrikes and shelling killed 25 people on Saturday, many of them women and children.Elsewhere in Rafah, Israel says an airstrike killed two senior Hamas military leaders on Saturday, and Palestinian police say Israeli airstrikes killed at least five of their officers. It's not clear if the incidents are related. It is also not clear when or if IDF ground operations will happen in Rafah, but there has been swift reaction to the possibility. Saudi Arabia warning Israel of the, quote, very serious repercussions of storming and targeting Rafah. The United Arab Emirate says serious humanitarian repercussions may result from the operation. And a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department says the U.S. would not support an Israeli military operation in Rafah, quote, without serious planning. Meanwhile, Israel's foreign minister says the head of the U.N. relief agency should resign. That coming after Israel's claims that its troops found Hamas tunnel under the headquarters of the U.N. relief agency in Gaza. The Israeli military released this video, claiming to show the tunnel, including what Israel says was an electrical connection to UNRWA's headquarters. The head of the U.N. agencies as it left the building on October 12th after Israel ordered evacuations, and had no knowledge of what might have happened their since, nor of the tunnel's existence. Journalist Elliott Gotkine live in London with more on all of this. Elliott, let's start with Rafah and what we know about Israel's planning, and how strong the likelihood of it happening soon.

So, in about a month's time.It's unclear exactly when or how it plans to go in, we know that Prime Minister Netanyahu has directed the military to come up with a plan for the evacuation of Rafah, but we also know that it contains about half the population of the Gaza Strip, many of whom have been displaced from other parts of the Gaza Strip. It's now four times bigger population-wise than it was, many people there feel literally and geographically that they have nowhere else to go. So, there's a big concern. We've mentioned some of those concerns within the region and internationally from the Saudis, from the Emiratis, from the United States, United Kingdom also saying that it's greatly concerned. The EU's foreign policy chief warning of unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe if a ground operation takes place. Israel's point, Israel's perspective is that you cannot have four battalions belonging to Hamas still present and still surviving this war if Israel is to be in a position to say that it's job done, that Israel has indeed -- that Hamas has indeed been dismantled, and that things can begin to move on there. But, of course, it's not just the concerns about the civilian population, it's not just concerns about Israeli troops, there's also concerns about the possibility of the Palestinians being displaced over the other side of the border into Egypt. Now, there's a very big and impenetrable fence going along the border between Israel and Egypt, it would seem to be very hard to imagine Palestinians streaming across the border but certainly that is a concern and the Egyptians are adamant that it won't happen, as are other regional players as well. So, quite when this operation happens or how Israel expects to be able to evacuate more than a million Palestinians are questions that we simply don't know the answer to just yet, Michael.",

But this also comes at the worst possible time for UNRWA, not only is it trying to satisfy the humanitarian needs of all of those displaced Palestinians, many of whom are in a desperate situation, but, of course, this also comes in the wake of those allegations by Israel but at least a dozen members of UNRWA were actively involved in the Hamas led terrorist attacks of October 7th. And as a result of that, many countries have suspended its funding to UNRWA. Israel will hold this up as another piece of evidence to show that UNRWA is not fit for purpose and ought to be disbanded. UNRWA will say that it didn't have any knowledge of this, and it is the only game in town when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians and trying to satisfy their humanitarian needs -- Michael.",

They're afraid of Joe Biden.Now, this memo also goes on to make noticeable mentions of people like General Mark Milley, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarty, who have called the president alert and engaged. But of course, this comes on the heels of the special counsel report that also mentioned the president's age and apparent memory lapses. Now, this had aides to the president fuming over the course of the week who pushed back and said the president is sharp and tireless. We also saw that anger spill into public view from the president himself who took particular issue with the special counsel suggesting that he had forgotten the day his son died. Now, all of this is part of what is going to be a defining theme for the presidential election year, that being the president's age and fitness for office. Senior campaign officials say that the president is best when he is out on the campaign trail engaging with voters, and we have seen an uptick in traditional retail politics stops for him to do exactly that. And that is ultimately them, the voters, who are going to pass judgment on whether the president is fit to serve a second term. But, of course, polls show that there is still some concern here about how old he is, but again, campaign officials and White House officials well aware of that see it as something that they can navigate in her mind the American people who he is and what he is like when he engages on the campaign trail.

You say problematic, the reason why it's problematic is that you have these independents, they have to now within three days, either become part of another party because they are independent, they cannot really form a coalition until they are part of any kind of party, so they have to find a party that's willing to absorb them, which the other two prominent parties are not because of their history with the PTI.There also is going to be a lot of back channel wheeling and dealing. So, we have to see how many of these independents actually stay loyal to Imran Khan. Whether there is also a crackdown on these independents themselves, will they join other parties? Will they bolster seats of the other two parties? Will there be a repetition of the government that we just saw before the election which was a coalition of the PMLN and the PPP? So, again, how will this outrage the people who have voted for Imran Khan? Imran Khan's multiple convictions against him, he's got many bails that have been granted but those, again, fresh cases have been applied against him. So, for now, he's very much still behind bars, and is unable to -- and is barred from contesting, barred from being part of the electoral process generally. The courts are going to become important because there are various petitions that have been filed by other independent candidates who claim that their seats were taken away from them and we're just going to have to wait and see how this plays out in the coming days -- Michael.",

Scientists are calling it excellent and ominous detective work. A new study published this week saying analysis of a 2,000 foot-long ice core reveals the West Antarctic ice sheet seems to have shrunk suddenly and dramatically in the past. The study indicates if the melting happens again, the ice contains enough water that sea levels could rise by 16 feet, or five meters, which could cause devastating flooding, of course, in coastal areas around the world. According to the study's authors, this is the first direct evidence of such a rapid loss of ice anywhere on the continent. They say the rapid melting could also happen to other ice sheets. Now, Eric Wolff is a climatologist and glaciologist at the University of Cambridge. He joins me now. And thanks for getting up early to do so.

That was theoretical, it's in climate models, and it suggests bad consequences, but we've never actually observed it.So, what we did was to go back into the past by using this ice core and look at what happened when the ice sheet retreated from being much larger than today in the last Ice Age to its present position. And we found that it retreated very fast indeed, about 8,000 years ago, the surface of the ice sheet around our site dropped by 400 meters. So, that's 1,200 feet, about, same as the Empire State Building, in 200 years. So, the concern -- so from our point of view, it's very nice that we've seen that the processes that we think are happening really did happen, but from the world's point of view, that's not such good news because it suggests if further warming starts a further retreat, then it will happen very fast.",

If warm water gets in underneath it, then it can make it retreat very fast.The truth is that we don't know exactly where that tipping point towards that happening is.

WOLFFice sheet is once they start to happen, they continue for a very long time, and it's hard to stop them. The good thing is that they are slow, so if we achieved 1.5 degrees of global warming and 2 degrees of global warming and then managed to get it back by sucking carbon out of the atmosphere, the ice sheet would probably be working on a long enough time scale that they could live with that and they wouldn't react to the warm temperatures they've only seen briefly.",

I had to ask but there will be people out there who think that way.The ice core data of course comes at a time when we just learned from Copernicus, the European Union's climate and weather monitoring service, that the past year was 1.5 degrees hotter, 1.52, I think it was, on average than temperatures before industrialization. We just had the hottest January on record, 1.66 degrees warmer than the average January. How does that add to the risk to the ice sheet, and the more broadly, how concerning is the convergence of a lot of things that we're learning and seeing right now? Even ocean currents?",

One year being higher than 1.5 degrees doesn't mean that we breached the Paris agreement, and we still do have time to do something about it, and at least keep, I'd be very surprised if we kept below 1.5. But we have the opportunity to keep a low two degrees above preindustrial levels.
