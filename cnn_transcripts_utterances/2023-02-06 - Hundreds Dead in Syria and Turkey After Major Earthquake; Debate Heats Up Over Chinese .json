And you can see from that, just all delicate the situation is well, considering how much rubble these, you know, extremely heavy slabs of concrete there, you don't want to move anything. Obviously heavy machinery is helpful but it's also delicate because you don't want to move things around to too much.Also, Gaziantep at the moment -- obviously very close to the epicenter -- this is where officially we're seeing the highest death toll, 80 is the official number. Obviously, this likely to go up. There's also been reportedly heavy damage to the Gaziantep castle, a UNESCO World Heritage site that is well over a thousand years old. And also, you know, once you get closer out to the epicenter, obviously electricity is gone in many places. The gas has been shut off. Mobile connectivity is not great. And on top of all that, we're also seeing video where there's large cracks in the concrete on the highway as well.

Of course, the rescue teams must run as it is today if those people under the rubble stay more than one day, more than four days, the most three days, you know, there is no possibility to rescue them after.This is one of the main priorities. And I am sure the United States and other government declared that they are ready to help and even teams from Germany and Netherlands, as you said, they're arrived at the field. Even the parts that are not affected around this earthquake area, they move their rescue teams to the field. And as I said, the first priorities is to rescue those people. Also, the second is to endure people. You know, some of the hospitals, big hospitals are destroyed totally, so, we need temporary mobile hospitals in the field. Maybe tent hospitals or other type of mobile hospitals. We need medical assistance to help those injured and to save them. The priority, as I told you, is to shelter them somewhere. We cannot keep them forever. You know, the schools are closed now for at least one week. And also, the state departments are prepared to be closed by tomorrow. There are departments are direct to the earthquake, but despite that, we cannot keep them in those buildings. And those buildings are not enough to shelter them. So, we need to start with some kind of small parts around the city to keep them arriving at least for the winter and later on for more shelters.",

Just a short while ago, China, for the first, acknowledged a second balloon spotted in the skies over Latin America also belongs to China. And they're very much sticking to the same story line, claiming that balloon was also a civilian vessel used for flight testing and it drifted off course due to weather. And the foreign ministry spokeswoman said China has explained thesituation to relevant governments and saying this balloon posed no threat to those countries. And according to her, those governments, quote-unquote, expressed their understanding. That obviously was not the reaction they got from Washington which is why they continue to accuse the U.S. by overreacting. And many analyst obviously find that very ironic, given Beijing's unusual obsession with sovereignty and national security. And that's also why in addition to the defense ministry's threat that you mentioned, that big threat, that military spokeswoman repeated many of the government's condemnation and accusations saying, shooting the balloon down and quote-unquote hyping up the incident was very unresponsive and unacceptable. But despite this rhetoric, so far few people think there would be immediate aggressive Chinese military reactions against the U.S. And part of that sentiment being reflected on the strictly control social media heel where the reactions to the news have now reached a fever pitch which is something we have previously seen whenever the two governments had serious run-in. So, there was hope, according to analysts, despite the public posturing from Beijing, they may still want to turn this page over quickly to bring this back -- this relationship back on track. Which of course, was the intention of that highly anticipated trip by Blinken to Beijing. And that has since been cut off. But as you mentioned, Bianca, a lot of unanswered questions including why China and its top leader Xi Jinping decided to do this ahead of that very much sensitive trip -- Bianca and Max.",

Where we saw the EU put an embargo on C1 crude oil, along with this G7 price cut mechanism, now we're seeing the same thing on oil products, like diesel, gasoline, fuel oil, things like that. They've actually done two price caps, one for products that usually sell more expensive than crude oil and one for less expensive than crude oil.But initially, the biggest impact is going to come from that embargo. Because I think I can show you the map of some of the biggest diesel exporters. This is one of the biggest oil products. And Russia is one of the biggest exporters. But where you see -- what's interesting here is that crude oil, Russia is able to funnel a lot of those barrels that would have gone to Europe, to India and China. India and China though are big exporters of oil products. So it's a lot less clear where those displaced Russian barrels are going to go. Is going to have to offer heavy discounts to do that. Meanwhile, Europe is going to have to find new suppliers and it's going to have to pay more to outbid the competition.
