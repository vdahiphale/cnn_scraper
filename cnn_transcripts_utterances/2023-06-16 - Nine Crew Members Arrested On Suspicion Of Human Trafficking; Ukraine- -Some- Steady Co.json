You mentioned, Christine, that figure of 40 children believed by the United Nations to have been on board. What the survivors say is that they believe the figure may have been higher.And what is terrible when you think about it is to imagine this boat, which Greek authorities sank, had been in distress for several hours, hence the questions about what more could have been done -- but did, once it started to sink, go down within 10 to 15 minutes. It was in the hold that the women and children were traveling, and they say -- the survivors say there may have been up to 100 of those children -- so pretty horrific scenes. You can imagine the scramble as they understood that they were going down. Of the survivors, as you mentioned, nine have now been arrested on suspicion of people trafficking, but the real question is much broader than that, of course, Christine. It is for Europeans, it is for Greek authorities, it is for Italians those very Coast Guards who had been alerted several hours before the boat went down that it was in distress. With NGOs, the patrol here in the Mediterranean, worrying that this could only get worse. This has become the most deadly migrant crossing in the world. Since 2014, the United Nations reckons that 20,000 people have lost their lives or disappeared in the Mediterranean. Those are of the recorded cases -- the recorded cases by the United Nations. Of course, the fear of those who work for the NGOs that patrol the waters is that it could actually be much higher. There are the small boats that you never hear about --",

The Ukrainian military saying that it has had some partial success, particularly along two parts of the front lines.The north -- Bakhmut, of course, a city that's been a flashpoint for many months now where they say that in about the last 10 days, Ukrainian forces have been able to gain -- to push three kilometers into those Russian front lines, and then further to the south along Zaporizhzhia -- to the south of Zaporizhzhia. There they say that they have been able to liberate -- the Ukrainian military has been able to liberate about 39 square miles -- 100 square kilometers of territory. But you have to remember Russia has been preparing for this counteroffensive as well, fortifying its positions all along that hundreds of miles of battlefield that you see. And if you take a look at the math, probably -- perhaps one of the most fortified areas is that very critical area to the south of Zaporizhzhia. You can understand why that's so important for Moscow to hold onto. It's part of that land bridge that connects Crimea to the rest of that battlefield. That land bridge means supply routes. It means access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It is absolutely critical for the Kremlin to continue to hold onto the territory. But for Ukraine, the goal here is to pierce through those defensive positions and cut that land bridge off. But don't expect this to happen anytime soon. Again, Russia has been preparing. Ukraine is going to take this slowly and try to find weaknesses and capitalize on them.",

This is Xi's very first meeting with a Western business figure in recent years.And according to state media, Xi called Gates the first, quote, \"American friend\" he has seen this year. He also said that the foundation of China-U.S. relations is, quote, \"in the people.\" Now, Bill Gates is in China to discuss global health issues with the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. And according to the state-run broadcaster CCTV, this is what the Chinese leader told Bill Gates earlier today. Let's bring it up for you. He said, \"In today's world situation, we can carry out all kinds of activities that will benefit our two countries, our two peoples, and humanity as a whole. Let's all be facilitators in this regard.\" Now, on Thursday, the foundation renewed its ties with the Beijing government and Tsinghua University to develop treatments for infectious diseases all around the world. But it was on Wednesday when Bill Gates announced on Twitter that he had touched down in Beijing for the first time in five years. Let's bring up his tweet for you. He said this. Quote, \"Solving problems like climate change, health inequity, food insecurity requires innovation. From developing malaria drugs to investing in climate adaptation. China has a lot of experience in that.\" He goes on to say \"We need to unlock that kind of progress for more people around the world.\" Just a reminder it was a couple of years ago in 2020 -- that was when Gates stepped down from the Microsoft board to focus on global philanthropy. But, yes, he joins that parade -- that long list of Western private- sector leaders who have visited China ever since it reopened earlier this year -- from Elon Musk of Tesla, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan; Tim Cook of Apple -- the list goes on. And while Beijing has been rolling out this red carpet for Western business figures, tensions are high between the U.S. and China. And we have America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken -- he's going to be visiting this weekend in order to reset relations. But Christine, look, Xi Jinping, today -- he met with Bill Gates. We still don't know whether Blinken will have a meeting with Xi Jinping. Back to you.",

Nice to see you, too.This has been a really fun look at such an exclusive golf course and a lot of experts actually thought that the layout at the Los Angeles Country Club was going to be a challenge for the world's best golfers. Nobody expected the show that Rickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele would put on. Fowler grew up about two hours away from this course. He fired off 10 birdies and two bogies to finish with an 8-under 62. That is the lowest single-round score ever recorded in a U.S. Open. Xander Schauffele, meanwhile, also not far from home. He's from San Diego. He was feeling it, too, yesterday. He had eight birdies and no bogies to make Rickie's 8-under. Both of these guys considered two of the best to never win a Major. Now they are hoping to carry this momentum into today's second round. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICKIE FOWLER, 5-TIME PGA TOUR WINNER:  It's definitely been long and tough -- a lot longer being in that situation than you'd ever want to. And -- but it makes it so worth it having gone through that and being back where we are now. XANDER SCHAUFFELE,7-TIME PGA TOUR WINNER:  It's not really what you expect playing in the U.S. Open, but monkey see-monkey do. I was just chasing Rickie up the leaderboard, so I'm glad he was just in front of me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, last year was the worst year for stocks since 2008. The S&amp;P 500 fell 18 percent -- a tough year. And you can see it in that nest egg. That nest egg well below the nearly $142,000 in 2021. An annual Vanguard report shows the numbers are even worse when you look at the median balance. That reduces the effective outliers. The median balance was just over $27,000 last year. You've got to keep saving. All right. Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets finished higher. China is expected to unveil fresh stimulus to kickstart its slowing economy. European markets also slightly higher here as traders digest a rate hike by the European central bank. On Wall Street, stock index futures this morning moving up here. It was a higher day -- a relatively strong day in markets yesterday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at their highest in 14 months. The Dow ended the day up more than 400 points. Mortgage rates ticked down for the second week in a row, folks. A 30- year fixed now at 6.69 percent. On inflation watch, gas prices fell another penny overnight to $3.58 a gallon there. All right, a pivotal week in the economy this week. Inflation is cooling but still too high. The Fed pauses but says don't get used to it. Oh, and the stock market enters an official new bull market. Let's bring in John Leer, chief economist at the Morning Consult. This riddle that is the American economy gives us something new to scratch our heads over every single day. Talk to me a little bit about the Fed move this week. You said it was a little bit of a headscratcher, right? The Fed is still concerned about core inflation and says it's going to keep hiking, but stopped for now? JOHN LEER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MORNING CONSULT (via Webex by Cisco): Yes. I'm a little concerned that the Fed I think is trying to have their cake and eat it, too. That they sort of want -- you know, they acknowledge that economic activity is going to be fairly robust through the end of this year. That inflation is going to run persistently elevated through the end of this year. And yet, they are pausing and they're going to wait to see how some of the interest rate hikes that they made earlier in the year are going to play out. My concern is that it's basically what we're seeing I think right now in financial markets, which is that there's this risk that they're going to lose credibility and that folks are going to sort of assume that the Fed would prefer to see this sort of immaculate disinflation rather than driving inflation lower and potentially causing some level of economic harm.",
