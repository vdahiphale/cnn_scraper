A federal law enforcement official tells CNN that the suspect is dead. And we've also learned that the FBI is looking into any possible associates of the suspect and into possible connections he had in Texas, because that is where the truck -- the license plate for the truck is from.One official tells CNN that investigators believe the suspect got out of the truck shooting and was likely killed by police during an exchange of gunfire. Joining us now, our CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst Andrew McCabe. We've learned a lot of new information from these last two interviews I did. One with an eyewitness and one from the local -- the congressman for that area who had just been briefed. I want to start with what he said. The congressman who's been briefed by DHS officials, law enforcement officials said that this was someone who was local. So, someone who lived there in the area, New Orleans. That he was driving a truck with Texas license plates, that it appears early on that he was acting alone and that he was shot and killed by police. Andrew, what do you make of these early details coming in about the suspect?",

He said he walked up and, you know, everyone was out partying on the street. He was a designated driver that night and then he went into a bar and these women came running in and said there was a truck that was going 60 miles per hour down the street. He went on the balcony and he said people were just flattened. I don't even want to go into detail. It's so disturbing.But he also said that the barriers were very flimsy. They weren't the same barriers there at the entrance of the street as elsewhere in the area, and it's just so disturbing given his account, because, you know, you have to wonder if this truck would have been able to get through if other barriers had been there.",

We are in ongoing discussions with authorities on the local state and federal levels and will communicate further details as they become available. So, that's what the committee is saying.Andy, to you, I want to get your reaction to, you know, the Sugar Bowl later today, what do you think should happen? And what that eyewitness told me about what he saw and the -- from his perspective, the lack of security.",

They can go back to see what that area looked like and to try to confirm whether or not those vehicle blockades were up or not at the time the attack took place. It might actually shed some light on why the attack took place at 3If what Juliette says is true or what we're talking about now, if we're in the post event period at 3:15 a.m. and the bollards came down at that point, that may be why the attack took place then instead of, you know, closer to midnight when there would have been a bigger crowd. But that's all those sorts of things they'll be able to confirm after the fact. A lot of them with the help of video. As far as the Bowl Game Tonight goes, I think what you're going to see, I believe the game will go forward. I have every expectation it will, especially now that they've said they have no indication of other people being involved or an ongoing threat. Now, that could change as the day goes on, if they find that there's an ongoing conspiracy that they're worried about, maybe they have a different position with the game. But you're going to see the -- I would expect the game goes forward and you're going to see like the most intense security you've ever seen in New Orleans.",

And it matters, you can't deny it matters in terms of who the perpetrator is, his ties to foreign or domestic groups, was this idea politically, ideologically based, which one interpreting the FBI statement might -- you know, it's reasonable to believe it was or -- and what was that political ideology? We just have to be honest here because the consequences of who this individual is do change the dynamics in this country. We know that now, and we have to understand who this person is.I think it's -- second is how -- you know, the confidence level that there's no other threat. I'm with Andy on terms of you assess a risk, you increase and fortify for the event tonight. But New Orleans knows how to do this and that the city needs to, you know, both recognize a tragedy and also be ready for the next thing. It's just the nature of the kinds of threats we face today. And then third, just what both of us are talking about is, we've got to learn from this. There was a massive vulnerability that a purposeful criminal was able to get around. Was that vulnerability created because there was a drawdown at 3:00 a.m. and should we -- should cities reconsider that, or was it a vulnerability that always existed? This is not to blame New Orleans. It is every city has to learn from this. You know, we're just like, you know, less than 10 days from what happened in Germany, you know, if vehicles are going to be used, vehicle prohibitions may need to be extended, including as immediately as tonight.",

Three games on the slate. Three college football playoff games. The first game of the day is the Peach Bowl. It's here in Atlanta between Arizona State and Texas.And Atlanta police, after what happened, they put out a statement saying, we acknowledge the concerns raised following the events earlier this morning in New Orleans. In advance of the Peach Bowl, the Atlanta Police Department had already implemented increased security measures, including the deployment of additional officers in the light of today's development and as an added precaution, specialized units and additional personnel will be further deployed to downtown and midtown areas to ensure continued safety and security of residents and visitors. So, Pam, you see it right there from the Peach -- or the Atlanta police, they will be beefing up security around the Peach Bowl. And you know, it's worth noting, the Super Bowl this year, it is in New Orleans, Pam. So, as you can imagine, the security around the Super Bowl and Bourbon Street and the whole French Quarter is definitely going to be upped after what happened.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think something that has to be asked in this next press conference, if possible. The Department of Public Works in New Orleans, in November, started a program to replace those bollards on Bourbon Street, the metal barriers that would stop a vehicle from coming through.This program started in November. It was supposed to be done sometime in early February. And among the things that they mention in their explanation of the project, as it went all the way down Bourbon Street, was that while the bollards were out, there would be some vehicular access to Bourbon Street and it indicates the notion that there would just be some sort of temporary barriers in place, not the big, powerful barriers. Now, we'll need to get some details about whether that's exactly where they were, but their information from the city indicates that is precisely where they were in this process. So, the barricades may not have been there. And as you were talking with Andy McCabe a minute ago, one of the other questions does have to do with the hour. If you live in New Orleans for a long time and you run -- wander the quarter at all sorts of weird hours, there is a point at which there is a transition happening in the quarter all the time because there are so many hotels and restaurants and bars all along Bourbon that have to have service trucks that get to them. So, there is a point at which you do start seeing an opening for some sort of vehicular traffic to prepare for the next day. But right now, the question that I most want to hear an answer to is, what was going on with this bollard program had they in fact been removed from this end, because it certainly looks from the city's plans as if they would have been?",

But, Pam, you and I both know that one of the problems that cities, states, federal governments often have is making sure that every department is fully aware of what other departments are doing. If you live in any place that's had a traffic problem, you find yourself saying, why did they start this construction project while that one was also going on? Well, one might be local, one might be state, and they just didn't know.So, we have to get those answers, did the police know that these bollards were missing there and was there thought about whether this was an issue?
