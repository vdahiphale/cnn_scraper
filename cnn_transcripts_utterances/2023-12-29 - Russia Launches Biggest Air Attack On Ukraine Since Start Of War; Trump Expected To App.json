Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Kaitlan Collins, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin this hour with Russia's massive new air assault on Ukraine, a sign of the wintertime campaign that Ukrainian officials had been warning about and dreading. President Biden calling it a stark reminder that President Vladimir Putin remains committed to obliterating Ukraine. CNN's Nic Robertson has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLAMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): From Ukraine center, Dnipro, to all points, Kyiv in the north, Odesa in the south, Kharkiv in the northeast, and to Lviv in the far west. Russia launched its biggest air attack since their ground invasion 22 months ago. Forty-four of 158 Russian missiles evading Ukraine's Western supported air defenses, killing and wounding civilians. This man narrowly surviving pulled from the rubble in Kharkiv. Schools, shopping malls, private homes and high rises, even a maternity hospital hit. In the capital, this resident awoken by missiles at 7:30 a.m. It was a horrible sound. It was so frightening. The missile was flying and everything was buzzing, worrying, she says. I didn't know what to do. President Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of throwing nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal against Ukraine. Ukraine's Air Force describe a complex attack of interlocking waves of drones, bombers, fighter jets, cruise hypersonic and other missiles intended to distract and stretch air defenses.",

And for some time, we couldn't access the inside of the warehouse because firefighters were still trying to stabilize, so nothing could actually fall that we now have permission to enter. And as you can see, you know, there is the structure is completely destroyed, the roof of the warehouse is totally destroyed.And we are actually walking most of the time on shattered glasses on fragments of the warehouse, but also of the equipment that was inside.

Thank you for that report.I want more on the reaction to what we're seeing play out here in Ukraine with our military and diplomatic experts. And Ambassador Bill Taylor, let me start with you because you heard something that Nic Robertson mentioned there, which was Ukraine in recent days sinking Russia's tank transport ship, just another blow to the Black Sea fleet of Russia's. I mean, what do you make of whether or not this is retribution for that? Or is just this really part of that campaign that Ukrainian officials had been worried about that would happen come wintertime? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Kaitlin, I think this is the campaign that the Ukrainian officials have been worried about. This is what happened last winter, you reported it, and many have observed that the Russians attacked during the winter when it's very cold, very cold there, as Nic knows. And when he -- when it's very cold, to attack the civilians, the civilian targets, electricity generation and distribution, which affects the water going up into the apartment buildings, it's crucial and it's cruel, Kaitlin. So this is what they've been anticipating. They're better prepared this year for this. But the Ukrainians know that this is a big assault that's coming from the Russia.",

What does that tell you about the tactics that Russia is using here to not only try to overwhelm but also to potentially confuse the defenses that Ukrainian has -- that Ukraine has? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Kaitlan that -- yes, exactly that Ukraine is really, like Ambassador Taylor said, anticipated some of this. But what was really interesting about this attack, on one hand, it's kind of like throwing the kitchen sink at the problem. The Russians are throwing everything into it, as you mentioned. But what was really interesting about this was the fact that it was so integrated. All these different diverse weapons platforms, coming together in a very concerted effort going through all of the targets that they had in all parts of Ukraine, from the west, to the north, to the east, and even to the south central part of the country. So, what you're seeing is a highly integrated efforts, or at least an attempt at a highly integrated effort by the Russians to exert maximum pressure. Now they're going after the civilian infrastructure. They're not going after as many of the military targets, although there were some in this batch of targets, but the main gig is the civilian population. And it's a question of going after Ukrainian morale.",

But with the way it's playing out right now, it could end up benefiting him because his team is collapsing all of this under the rubric of witch hunt.

But this clearly it is a mode of attack for the other challengers.As for Chris Christie, look, the cornerstone of his campaign has been to take down Donald Trump and he has been very forceful in his attacks on Donald Trump. Every time he opens his mouth on the trail, on the debate stage, no one can be attacked Donald Trump enough for Chris Christie. But for him to go after Nikki Haley saying that she has basically given Donald Trump a pass, I have to push back a little bit on that because she has been critical of Donald Trump for what he's done with regard to the debt, adding to the debt. She has pushed back for saying that he is not the president, shouldn't be the president moving forward and really attacked the chaos and division of his candidacy in his presidency.

The Republican governor there in that state, Mike DeWine, he broke the Republican legislature in his state and vetoed a bill that would have banned minors in the state from receiving gender affirming care and prohibited gender athletes, transgender athletes from taking part in female sports. CNN's Miguel Marquez is covering his story. Miguel, what was the justification that Governor DeWine, a Republican governor offered for vetoing this bill from his Republican state legislature?",

The wounded, rushed to whatever hospitals are still able to treat patients. Day after day, the death toll climbs. There is no respite from Israel's widening offensive. By daybreak smoke rises above southern Gaza. Many of those who fled here for protection now watch as their loved ones are buried. Grief here is never ending.

With no safe place to turn, people continue to stream into Rafah despite the bombardments now gripping the border city. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on camera): Well, Kaitlan, the situation in Gaza seems to only grow more desperate by the day and getting aid into Gaza is still proving to be a challenge. Just today, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said its aid convoy was fired by Israeli troops after passing a checkpoint into southern Gaza. And while no one was injured, the U.N. agency has said that aid workers should never be a target. Now Israel says it is looking into the incident but this has once again brought into question the security guarantees, aid agencies have repeatedly sought from Israel in order to provide the vital aid to millions of civilians in Gaza.
