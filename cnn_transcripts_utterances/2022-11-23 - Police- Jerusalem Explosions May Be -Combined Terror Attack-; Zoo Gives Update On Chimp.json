They were filled with screws and nails and ball bearings to cause the maximum amount of jury and impact. We were at the scene earlier today. And I can tell you the blast radius for the first one, it stretched across the sidewalk and across at least three lanes of traffic. That goes to show the impact of this blast. As you noted, a 15-year-old Canadian-Israeli was killed. More than 14 injured, including two U.S. citizens. Now, so far, no militant group has claimed responsibility. Israeli police are still searching, they say, for the suspects, and haven't pointed the finger at any sort of militant group yet who they say may be behind this, other than saying it was a well-organized and sophisticated operation. The Israeli prime minister, Yair Lapid, vowing to catch those who are behind it. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YAIR LAPID, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: (through translation): I want to say to the citizens of Israel, we will find them. They can run, they can hide, it won't help them. The security forces will reach them. If they resist, they will be eliminated. If not, we will punish them to the fullest extent of the law. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And for so many around Thanksgiving, they're just wondering how they're going to be able to make ends meet and put enough food on the table. One of the strategies I've heard in recent months from people about how they can actually save money is by changing how much food they buy and where they get it. And something I'm hearing again, in this parking lot, some people are willing to eat those inflated Thanksgiving costs. Others just can't put enough food on the table. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
