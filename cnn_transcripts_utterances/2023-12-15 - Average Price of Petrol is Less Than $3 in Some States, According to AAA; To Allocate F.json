You know, you speak about that national data, the GDP, maybe the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, just 66 percent.How about those stocks that you mentioned? Just 42 percent of Americans look to stock market indexes when judging how folks think the economy is going. And this, I think, is the key nugget here. Think your income is keeping up with inflation, just 24 percent of Americans say, yes. The vast majority, 76 percent, said no in a recent since CBS News poll.",

Take a look here, the change in disposable income from a present -- from the first year of a president's term to now in a term. Look at Biden, negative growth. Negative. We've actually seen incomes come down relative to inflation, minus 2.7 percent. The average president since JFK look at that, a big jump of 4.5 percent in their income. Now, obviously, there was a lot going on in that first year, right? We were pumping money into the economy, the government was. But how about in the last few months, take a look at the last six months, the change in disposable income. Just we see growth, but it's very small growth, just 0.2 percent. The average six months since 1960, look at that, much higher, five times as high.So, even now, even as incomes are going up a little bit, they're still not getting anywhere near the type of growth we generally get.",

Since the first year of Biden's first term, look at this, down one percent. Since last quarter, no growth at all, zero percent.Now, this is metric that really hasn't moved and has had struggling moving over the last few decades. But the fact is when you combine that with incomes, not growing at the rate we're generally used, I think that's a big part of the reason why Americans are not feeling the growth that I think a lot of economists would think they should.",

And there's the huge question of whether or not the House of Representatives would even come back if the Senate actually got to an agreement. Here's what one of the lead Senate negotiators, Kyrsten Sinema, told me yesterday about Mike Johnson and whether or not he's made any assurances. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (I-AZ):  James, myself, and others have all been communicating with Speaker Johnson. I've got a great relationship with him, like him a whole lot.

I think it's -- I think they really have to thread the needle here. Now, they're talking this morning, we heard that Homeland Secretary Mayorkas and some White House officials are meeting with senators today. The senators involved in the talks since -- the leadership and some of the senators on both sides of the aisle. They've started -- they've had some meetings today already. But I don't know if they can get there. They're -- like, every time if they give to something to the Republicans, the -- you know, progressives get upset. If they give -- you know, if they lean too more -- too far for toward the progressives, you know, the Republicans would get upset. I think it's a very, very difficult thing they're trying to do.

Trump, if he is the nominee and he looks like he's going to be right now, he's going to have an opinion on this. You know, there's -- this will be directly involved in Republican presidential politics. There's no one -- I'll say -- I'll caution this, there's no way that Senate Republicans are going to walk out on a ledge, on a deal that they know -- that they don't know where speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans are going to be or Trump.

So, where was she and what was she doing?KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is actually an uncharacteristically personal speech from the former first lady. We never see her. And I've been covering Donald Trump now in this entire campaign. She's only been out once with him and it was when he made his announcement. She's often behind closed doors. And she talked about her immigration process and her path to becoming a naturalized citizen. Take a listen to some of what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELANIA TRUMP, FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY:  Throughout our lives, we cross thresholds. And although obstacles often stand in the way of our goals, we persevere, as we understand that conquering them will provide great access to personal development, fulfillment and eventually self-actualization. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOLMES:  There was also something else she said that I found to be remarkable, and this was it. She said, my personal experience of traversing the challenges of the immigration process opened my eyes to the harsh realities people face, including you for trying to become a U.S. citizen. And then of course, there are the nuances of understanding United States immigration laws. The reason why this is so remarkable is because it comes at a time that former President Trump is pledging, that if reelected, he would make that process even harder. And you could actually hear her walk through all of the hoops that she had to jump through and how she was lucky in certain circumstances to become a naturalized citizen. So, it almost appears in juxtaposition to what her husband has been saying out on the campaign trail. I will note again, as you mentioned, the National Archives does have significance here as well. Part of the reason that Donald Trump has been indicted stemmed from the National Archives who asked the Department of Justice to open investigation into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents after he left office. That subsequently led to an indictment of Donald Trump. We expect that trial to likely be in May. But again, this was a pretty unique experience here and listening to her when you see him on the campaign trail, that was striking.",
