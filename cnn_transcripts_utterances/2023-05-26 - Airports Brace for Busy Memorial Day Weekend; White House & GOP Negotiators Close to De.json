But we are getting some contours of some agreements that they are starting to eye. Sources have told us they've been working towards the potential of raising the debt ceiling for two years and pairing that with spending caps for the same length of time. Now, those caps would not impact -- impact programs related to defense and veterans. But the two sides still caution that they are -- they are still working through some of these final details. There's no guarantee they will get to that final agreement just yet. There are also some still major sticking points when it comes to the issue of work requirements. For some safety net programs like Medicare and Food Stamps. Now, the House has left for the weekend, though those members are on notice that they could return within 24 hours if there is some type of agreement. But this is really just heading into a very serious crunch time for both the White House and Republican lawmakers. The president and Republicans have said that they don't want to see a default in this country. But they are racing against that clock. We are now six days away from June 1. And also, what is clear here that you heard from those lawmakers, is that it's also going to be incredibly difficult, potentially, to corral these members together, trying to get enough support to get something over the finish line.

This \"Washington Post\" reporting is saying that two of Donald Trump's employees were moving boxes, that showed that they were being moved into a storage area on June 3. So his lawyer had searched that area at some point in time before June 3rd. There were boxes -- documents moved in. We also are understanding that at some point in time, boxes were moved out of that storage area. And so, when you put this all together, the time line is a little fuzzy on exactly what happened up to June 3rd. But it indicates that there may be not just one instance of obstruction that the Justice Department is looking into. And that they're collecting evidence about a lot of things, a lot of movement of boxes at Mar-a-Lago while there was a subpoena saying, get all of the classified documents under control and get them back to the federal government, to the grand jury in an investigation.

Kennedy Jr. Just 8 percent are behind author Marianne Williamson. Biden is facing headwinds, though, from the overall public. His favorability rating has now dropped from 42 percent in December to just 35 percent. And when asked specifically about a second term, only a third of Americans feel a 2024 win for Biden will be a win for the country. Joining us now, CNN political commentator Ashley Allison. She's a former White House senior policy adviser and was national coalitions director for Biden-Harris in 2020. And Chapin Fay, Republican strategist and managing director at Actum. And good morning. Nice to see both of you this morning. So when we look at this new polling, Ashley, these are the vast majority of the Democratic-aligned voters. They're throwing their support behind Biden. But what stood out to me are independent-leaning Democrats, Democrats and younger voters. They're really not as enthusiastic. There were questions about messaging. There were questions about what is or is not being sold. How significant do you think that hill is for Biden to climb?",
