And what's frightening about this is that they just don't know how they're doing it and it's deeply embedded. They don't even know which accounts within the telecom systems some are doing the spying or how they're doing it. So they're warning people who've been hacked, but what they hadn't managed to do is go into the system and clean it out. So whatever system the Chinese are using, if indeed they are the Chinese embassy, for example, in Washington denying this it's completely new, but it's very old system, isn't it really to just try to listen to phone calls?
