Explosions were heard reverberating across the enclave through the night. The IDF says it struck 150 underground targets overnight. It is said to be the most intense Israeli bombardment since the war started. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON (through translator): In addition to offensive operations we have carried out over the past few days, the IDF ground forces are expanding their operation this evening.

Tank fire heard as well. And things got a bit quiet for a while, but we hear now that things are ramping up again. From inside of Gaza, we're hearing that these are the most intense strikes since October 7th. And, of course, you mentioned the communications blackout, we also heard the Palestinian authority telecommunications minister saying that the two international connection points with Gaza have been struck by Israel, making it more difficult to get information in and out of the Gaza Strip. In reality, we heard from our sources on the ground that this is what is happening, this is affecting hospitals, that because they cannot respond to strikes, people are either bringing bodies, as well as the injured by using bicycles, car, even walking. Then ambulances are deployed. So, this is the impact of the communications blackout. When you cannot get assistance to people who need it most. Now, the IDF is also alleging that Hamas is easing hospitals and I quote, to wage war. It is now adding the added fear of hospitals being targeted, and the biggest hospital al-Shifa, the largest in Gaza spoke to the DG of Gaza health ministry. I want you to take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There was a lot of hope, momentum. The IDF has responded in saying that we should ignore those rumors, saying it's -- calling it psychological terror, by using the potential release of hostages. But what we hear and the Qataris have been mediating a lot of these discussions to get hostages to get them released. We've only had four hostages released in just a week. The question is, can this continue -- can a mediation continue? When you've got the Israeli ground operations intensifying, and what then potentially what that would look. Look, the U.N. passed a resolution that was led by the Jordanians about sustained, an immediate humanitarian truth, which, of course, includes the release of hostages. Important to note, Israel as well as the U.S. voted against this resolution. You have 120 countries voted for this resolution, it just brings into question what the state, and the calculus will be going forward, and the potential of release of more hostages as we see a communications blackout, an incredible pressure coming through for the people within Gaza.",

Multiple humanitarian groups say they cannot get in touch with their teams on the ground. Some Palestinians who managed to maintain connection, reached by CNN so they have split their family so that at least some members would survive in case of an Israeli strike.

Now, look, this is the end of what has been a very tense chapter for many in this community, wondering where this person may be, especially given the violent nature of what he was accused and what police believe he did. Now, to give people an idea of where this body was found we are outside the bar and grill, which was the second location of the mass shootings that happened on Wednesday night. This body was found just about ten minutes away from here in the town over from Lewiston, which is where we are, in Lisbon, Maine. And it was found near it recycling plant where, as we understand from law enforcement sources, a plant where he was fired from recently. And so, at this point, this now begins the next phase of the investigation for officers to figure out, okay, what led up to the actions that they say he carried out over the course of Wednesday night and why did this happen? So, that is one aspect of the investigation that continues. However, the main priority that everybody has been looking for of trying to locate this person is now over, it is a sigh of relief for many in this community, it's a sigh of relief for many of the leaders in this community as they laid out in their latest press conference. We also learned that they found the body at to 7:45 p.m. Eastern Time Friday night. It wasn't until hours later that they announced, what they said they were doing in the meantime was they were notifying the families of victims. They also said they notified the family of the suspect as well, the family, they said, had on the whole been cooperative throughout this entire process. And, while there are still more investigative work ahead, there is a lot more grieving ahead for many of the families here affected. At least 18 killed in total, but so many more lives shattered based on the lives that they touched and, as one resident told us, they are not just numbers, they are people.

Instead, they will offer advice and have offered counsel on their best practices -- for the U.S.'s best practices from decades of war, including a recommendation that instead of conducting a large scale ground incursion, Israel goes with precision guided munitions as well as smaller special operations forces raids. Is that advice the Israelis have heeded? That's answer that will be very clear in the hours and the days ahead. Meanwhile, the U.S., a bit concerned there is whether the conflict in Gaza, now that would you appear to be seeing what appears to be a larger scale ground incursion, if that spreads to the rest of the region. We have already seen some spillover, even if the U.S. does not see a connection between Gaza and Iraq and Syria. Other groups do, and that is a key concern here. Take a look at this map. You'll get a sense of the attacks on U.S. forces over the course of the past 11 or 12 days. Four different sites in Iraq, four different sites in Syria, many of those have had more than one attack including the Al Asad Airbase in Iraq, which has had at least seven attacks there. The U.S. carried out strikes in eastern Syria against groups that says are affiliated with Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and affiliated groups there. The U.S. said those strikes did not result in casualties, but distort ammo for storage facility as well as a weapon storage facility. The U.S. was clear in carrying out the strikes that there were narrowly aimed at, essential, protecting U.S. forces and the U.S. does not want the conflict to escalate beyond Gaza or be connected in any way to what the U.S. is doing in Iraq and Syria against ISIS there. It's a very fine line the U.S. is trying to walk, will they be successful? That is what everyone is looking at with all eyes on Gaza right now. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.

Thanks so much for being here with us again. So, this -- you know, what we are seeing from Israel right now, do you think this signals the start of the main invasion?",

You clear the fences before you send in ground forces, because the last thing you want to do will be sending ground forces into fully prepared positions. If you can wear down those positions as much as possible, prior to sending in ground forces, then there is less likely to be friendly casualties in the process.",

And, to basically position themselves so that if the Israelis move and, they can exploit the tunnels to attack the Israelis from the rear. It actually makes sense for the IDF to attack those tunnels and destroy those tunnels, ideally with Hamas inside them. So that they cannot use those tunnels, it makes then more difficult for Hamas to defend and against an incoming Israeli incursion on the ground.",

And, there may be possibilities that intelligence operations can locate some of the hostages and special forces go in and rescue them. But I think that once the ground invasion begins, the chances of rescuing those hostages dropped dramatically. Hamas want to use them as human shields, secondly they wanted to use them as bargaining chips to try and delay the Israeli offensive.I think that the Israelis, and the Americans have woken up to this cynical tactic by Hamas. They are drip feeding hostages out, over a period of days and weeks, to try and delay the offensive. That gives Hamas more time to prepare defenses. So, I think the Israelis are going to go in, irrespective of the situation with the hostages. We will do our best to get the mail, but there is no guarantee, sadly.",

But this is the worst I've seen in the whole world. And I think the consequences of this war will continue to affect the people in Gaza, and beyond, for the next generations. It's not only the physical wounds and the death and the injuries among the families, but also the mental health wounds that will last forever among the children who are witnessing bombing, who lost many of their family members. Dr. Kassam Sofiya (ph) is our lead pediatrician, his last message was 36 hours ago. He told me if I stayed alive, I would like to talk more about my last patient. Her name is Dima. She's a child. She's only ten years old. She lost all of her family members, her two parents and six brothers and sisters. And she had a fracture in her skull, and a fracture in her limbs, and injuries in her liver and spleen. And they don't have enough supplies to treat her. And he was very sorry and he told me the saddest thing that he has in his life, that he witnessed many children that he saw in the neighborhoods that now are dead and mutilated. And this is something that should not happen in the 21st century. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
