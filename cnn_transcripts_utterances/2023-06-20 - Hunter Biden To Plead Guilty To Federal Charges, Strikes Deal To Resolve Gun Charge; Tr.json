Meanwhile, the vessel running out of breathable air. And France now sending an underwater robot for the deep sea mission. Plus, a Utah woman accused killing her husband poisoning him with a deadly dose of fentanyl then writing a children's book about dealing with the grief. Now wait until you hear how she's trying to get the courts to obtain money from his business. And leading this hour, the plea deal and the President's son, new federal court filing show Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors and that he struck a deal with federal prosecutors to resolve a felony gun charge. So, what about all those allegations of money laundering and foreign lobbying? The Justice Department insists its investigation is ongoing. Our coverage this hour starts with CNN Senior Justice Correspondent, Evan Perez, and CNN Chief Legal Analyst Laura Coates. Evan, Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two tax misdemeanors. And he struck a deal to resolve this felony gun charge. Walk us through what this all means.",

Now, the gun charge is something that is still outstanding. The -- his -- the plan is, according to the -- to what was filed in court, is for Hunter Biden to enter a program. And if he abides by all of the conditions, it will be sponged (ph), it will be wiped away at the end of about 24 months or so. So, all of this is subject to approval from a judge, of course, which is going to happen in the next a couple of weeks or so.The bottom line, though, for the -- all of the other claims that you mentioned, those were part of this investigation. And in the end, prosecutors decided that these were the crimes that they believe that they could try to pursue and they ended up with this plea agreement with Hunter Biden.",

Never owning a gun, never having one in your possession. Oftentimes probation cases include an employment requirement as well. Sometimes fines are associated, but also routine meetings with what kind of your probation officer of sorts.So, these diversionary programs that Evan actually alluded to also include those similar requirements. But just take a step back, Jake, in this and think about the wide net that was cast here to ensure that this would be viewed apolitically and also looked at in a way that this person was not going to be treated like a different sort of potential target or defendant. And I remind people unlike what we've been seeing in recent times when a lawyer meets with the DOJ and tries to talk to them about potentially being a target or a defendant, there appeared to be some conversations over some period of time about making sure that the prosecution was aware that their case likely was not as strong as maybe politically people thought it might be and now we've got this result. Still serious charges to have anyone plead guilty to a crime, let alone tax evasion of sorts, but it's pretty routine to have something a diversionary program of a crime of this level or even not having a sentence.",

And so this talking point ought not to carry much weight for the precise reason you indicated. This was somebody who was appointed with an eye towards this very notion. The idea of not having somebody who could be perceived, Jake, as somebody who was in the pocket of or under the wing of the president of the United States.That's the whole essence of this, but you see a very connective tissue here, don't you, between a special counsel that is Jack Smith and one that he actually appointed.

I mean, he's out there publicly admitting to what is alleged in the indictment, which is a federal crime. And so, I would think as we get to the debates, as you mentioned, and you know, on and into the campaign, the other candidates would be able to make this case that we can't go through a campaign with a Republican standard bearer who's carrying around these federal indictments, who's publicly basically admitted to committing the crimes and may have more crimes coming down the pike.

First thing that struck me, of course, was the size as we actually stepped into that vessel, just how cramped five passengers would be inside that chamber for more than eight hours. And then as you saw in that report, some of the components of the technology that felt quite simple, somewhat rudimentary, the game controller, for example, that you saw there that actually operates the vessel.But look, OceanGate has touted its use off the shelf components that really they say helped a streamlined construction of Titan and made it easier to operate. The company has said they did not cut any corners when it comes to actual safety, especially when it comes to the carbon fiber shell that you can see that surrounds Titan. They worked on this vessel with NASA, with Boeing, and many other groups they say to create a safe vessel that they believe can dive 13,000 feet. Now that said, Jake, we have learned that Titan has lost communication with support crew in the past, unable to get messages from the surface which they really rely on when they're underwater. They don't know where they're going because as, you know, there's no GPS on board.",

They can come out to the surface and walk out of that submarine without any ill effects. If it's a little bit of a rough ride to the surface, then so be it as long as they're safe. But you have to remember, while this submarine is very big and heavy on the surface, in the water, it's not much more than mutually buoyant. It will only be slightly negative because that's the way it's designed.And if it's on the seabed with its ballast weights, it will be slightly negative and then it won't take much force for an ROE, for example, to attach a lift line to it and then slowly haul it to the surface. Once it gets up to the surface, any of these offshore vessels with an offshore capable crane that can lift that kind of weight, we'll be able to get the men, get the sub on board and then take them out of the sub. Once they're to the surface, pretty much their safety will be assured, and that's the key thing.

But a few hours before Eric died, Kouri made him a cocktail that prosecutors suggest was laced with a fatal dose of fentanyl, and he took it and drank it.What is a lethal dose of fentanyl had been apparently a search on Kouri's phone? That's according to investigators. Now to that other twist, Kouri, the accused killer, is suing the estate of the dead husband she allegedly murdered. She wants a share of the proceeds from their family home, which is worth maybe a little less than $2 million. They married in the backyard of that house, raised their three kids there. Kouri also wants a slice of the proceeds from the sale of Eric's masonry business, and that's another $2 million or so. Eric and Kouri were married. So why isn't she entitled to that money anyway? Well, not long before he died, Eric Richins, according to paperwork filed with the court, installed his sister, not his wife, as the trustee of his estate, if he were to die. Kouri says they both paid for the house and a prenup protects her inheritance. Now last week, a judge denied her bail saying that if released, there might be an incentive for her to harm herself, family members, or witnesses, and that there is, quote, substantial evidence against her.
