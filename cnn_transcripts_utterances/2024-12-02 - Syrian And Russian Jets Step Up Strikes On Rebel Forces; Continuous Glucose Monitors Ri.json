They think that the U.S. interests are served by keeping Assad there, and they think all the rebels are terrorists. Now, neither of those things is true, but you can imagine in a Trump cabinet that they would have an important voice.So they're going to be telling President-elect Trump, hey, let's support Assad, OK? And then you'll have other people like Marco Rubio and Mike Walter say, oh no, that's crazy, you know, because he's a mass-murdering dictator, and the people don't want to live under a mass-murdering dictator. And I don't know which way Trump is going to go. I hope he sides with the people who realize that Assad is the problem, not the solution, and that there could be no stability, much less peace in Syria, as long as Assad and the Russians are bombing everybody.",

      "sentences": "Continuous glucose monitors have been a game changer for people living with diabetes. It's a device that's used to help them monitor blood sugar levels constantly. Now, though, it's becoming a popular wellness tool for those who do not have diabetes.CNN's Meg Tirrell wanted to find out what that means, how they work. And, Meg, you tried one out for six weeks. Tell us what you found. MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So, you know, these things are medical devices, typically, for people with diabetes requiring a prescription. But earlier this year, they've been cleared for people without diabetes, and they're being marketed as wellness tools. So this is something that is attached to your arm, and you wear it continuously. It has a little wire that monitors your blood sugar. And you can see your blood sugar levels on an app on your phone. The idea is that you can see your glucose reactions to different foods, to exercise, to sleep, to stress. And maybe that can help you make decisions that can make you healthier. So as I tried this, one of the first things I experienced that surprised me was anxiety. I started seeing my reaction to eating an apple or something like that, and seeing the glucose go up relatively quickly. You can see my graph there. It's the second little purple increase. And I was being encouraged by the app to try to avoid those kinds of increases. And so I started trying to game the system and eat a string cheese first or hard-boil an egg. And I had several episodes of hanger that my husband had to experience of me waiting for eggs to be ready so I wouldn't spike my glucose. That is not how these are recommended to be used. But I have talked with several experts who say that could be a worry. If you're somebody who might be anxious around food or particularly have any history of eating disorders, maybe this is not something you should try. For other people, it can provide interesting insights. You know, I talked to Dr. Sanjay Gupta, our colleague, and he says he has seen some spikes from certain foods that's made him want to avoid them. So it can be helpful, but you've got to know yourself before you do it, Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So people have very strong opinions about this, but there's a big gulf in terms of what different sides of medicine think about how useful this is for people without diabetes. Some say, absolutely, you want to avoid those larger increases in glucose.You want to avoid those long increases in glucose. Others say, well, if it's in the healthy range, what does that matter? It doesn't make you more likely to get type 2 diabetes later in life. And the data just don't seem to be in on that yet. So it's fairly early. It can be an interesting experiment. But it's also important to note these cost about $89 per month. So it's not an inexpensive experiment to do either.",
