      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, this has been a five-alarm fire since it started -- since we learned about it several weeks ago. We've been chasing this story along with every other major outlet, but let's be honest, this is a feat of espionage that the US government would be envious of.You know, its fair game -- considered fair game to go after political targets, to listen to their calls. The National Security agency here in the US has done the same to other foreign leaders. However, the scope of this hack is really what is troubling US officials. We are talking every major US telecom provider that has been targeted and they are going after, as you said, senior, senior political figures, the incoming president-elect Donald Trump and his running mate, JD Vance. We've also reported that Senator Chuck Schumer's office has been targeted, so there really are turning over every stone in an effort to try to listen to what senior US officials are saying about policy, what might be changing in the incoming administration. One source I spoke to the other day compared it to as if the US had installed Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant in all of our networks. And, of course, US officials don't trust Huawei. So that's a point to say that everything is compromised right now. It is still very much a fluid situation. We are going to get more names, I think, publicly as the weeks go by. But what we know now is that it is actually a bipartisan issue, Fredricka. The outgoing administration, the Biden administration does not want to hand this over to the Trump administration in the form of a crisis. They are trying to tamp that down right now. We reported on a White House meeting on Friday with senior telecom execs that were briefed by National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan, shared the latest intelligence with them. But the bottom line here, Fredricka, is they actually don't know what they don't know, necessarily. They are still intrusions, parts of the hack that they're trying to uncover, trying to figure out where the hackers are and to try to kick them out because it is very, very difficult to get them out of the systems right now.",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, the thing that has most astounded American officials who have been watching this, I think basically two or three things.First, the Chinese hackers were in the American telecom system for probably a year before they were detected, and they were really only detected because Microsoft, which is not a telecom provider noticed that some of the internet addresses that they were seeing on Chinese sites that were closely linked to this Ministry of State Security Intelligence unit that was doing the hacking, seemed to resolve back at Verizon and AT&amp;T and other telecom makers. Then when they dug in deeper, it turned out that it looks like they had been on basically the receiving end of the system that these companies used to help the government with court ordered wiretaps. Those include both criminal cases and cases of federal investigations into suspected spies that come out of the FISA court, which is a secret court run to do intelligence investigations. That would mean that the Chinese hackers got the phone numbers of those the US was following and thus would know whether they were on to Chinese spies. So it is that kind of thing that is most disturbing.",

We are also seeing many organizations on the ground that are already starting to organize coalitions and networks for example, phone call chains to be activated in the event that immigration enforcement happens in our communities and in sensitive locations. This is happening across the country from Boston to San Francisco, we are seeing these trends as communities are starting to come together to be able to empower everyone in their communities because like I said, this is going to impact all of us when the federal government comes after children, when the federal government is disrupting work places, this is going to affect all of us as we see our nannies, our babysitters, our cleaning ladies being deported. And so what this means for us at Lawyers for Civil Rights is that we have to protect the affected communities and make sure that the federal government is not overstepping their authority by stripping lawful and legal immigrants of their current status because what we are seeing right now is a Trump 2.0 transition team that is interested and invested in stripping people of basic protections, and this really exacerbates and manufactures the immigration crisis.

Vladimir Putin is saying more than 700,000 are currently stationed in and around Ukraine.

We can no longer lose any of our men.\" But for now, the battles continue to escalate and the losses continue to mount, as Vladimir Putin warns the war is increasingly becoming a struggle between Russia and the West.

So I knocked on the door and he said, \"Come on in, kid.\" And I interviewed him and my piece ran a few days later. The point was, I actually got to talk to him about his experience. It was very informative not only for a 19-year-old, but, you know, 43 years later, for me to have talked to him about how he experienced the crisis, which you will learn about in the show, but also the effect on him personally. He had been abused -- physically abused. He had been thrown in jail after Jimmy Carter attempted to rescue all of them. They didn't know why they'd been thrown in jail, but that was the reason -- and he was very grateful to be alive. One of the things that Jimmy Carter said throughout the crisis was, I want them all back alive. Not a single American hostage died. Sadly, eight servicemen died trying to rescue them. But not one of the hostages died. Jimmy Carter lost the election in 1980, largely because of the Islamic Revolution, both the inflation and the hostage drama had undermined his credibility with the American people, but he at least felt very good that every single one of the hostages had come back and President Reagan allowed Jimmy Carter to be the US representative who greeted the hostages as they reached freedom in Germany. So Jimmy Carter lost an election, lost the presidency, but he felt that he had lived up to his moral values in the way he had handled this crisis.",
