It's one that he's polled well on. What can we expect to hear from him when he takes the podium? STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: Well, the Trump campaign basically saying anything you can do, I can do better. So if you're going to hold a rally in Houston, I'm going to have an event ahead of you in Austin. And that is what he is doing here today. His campaign believes that if the Vice President wants to come to Texas, the biggest border state, then they want to be able to put the issue of immigration front and center. And that is what they will be doing with this event today. You can take a look at the signage behind me. It says, end migrant crime. It also says deport illegals now. Donald Trump very much believes this is the number one priority for this country. And he previewed that message yesterday at a speech in Arizona. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're a dumping ground. We're like a garbage can for the world. That's what's happened to a -- we're like a garbage can. You know, it's the first time I've ever said that. And every time I come up and talk about what they've done to a country, I get angrier and angrier. First time I've ever said garbage can. But you know what? It's a very accurate description.

Thank you both for being with us. Barbara, I wanted to ask you about something that MJ mentioned. And that's the approach from the Harris campaign, the belief that it's not about the location necessarily, but it is about the audience. How does this event tonight in Texas translate specifically in those blue wall states in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania? BARBARA BOXER, FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR OF CALIFORNIA: It's going to be very effective because, you know, I've been around for a long time and now, it's very different. When you went -- when you were a presidential candidate and you went to one state, no one else paid attention. But now, everyone pays attention. And the fact that she's going into Texas where there's a very tight Senate race, Ted Cruz versus Allred, this is really very close, like one point race. The fact that she's going to show what has happened in Texas since the Trump ban and he takes credit for it. I just checked it. Pregnancy deaths rose by 56% in Texas after their abortion ban. This is real. So every woman in America, in every state, has to pay attention. And every man who cares about a woman should vote for Kamala Harris.",

And do you think that emphasizing immigration so much in these last few days is the right play?LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I mean, take a look at the CNN poll that came out today. I mean, it's the number two issue. It's consistently the number two issue, whether it's the Wall Street Journal poll, the CNN poll, you name it. In today's CNN poll, he leads on that issue by 16 points. And that is the double-edged sword for Kamala Harris going to Texas given all her issues on the border that she has had over the last three and a half years. So yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense for them to be down there. And look, I think the other issue here is the question of what is the Harris campaign's final message in the closing weeks of this campaign. We started this week with her saying Donald Trump is a fascist, Donald Trump is Hitler. Now, today she's in -- according to the New York Times, looking for a viral moment in Texas on this abortion issue. Well, campaigns who are looking for viral moments 12 days out of an election, that tells me they don't have a concise like message to voters to hand out there.

Let's go to Vice President Kamala Harris in Houston.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And we are here to really highlight that, sadly, the elected leaders of Texas, a lot of them, have made Texas ground zero in this fundamental fight for the freedom of women to make decisions about their own body. So tonight, we will be discussing the impact of that, not only to the women of Texas and their families, but to people around the country because of Trump abortion bans. And I do believe it is critically important to acknowledge that this is not just a political debate. This is not just some theoretical concept. Real harm has occurred in our country. A real suffering has occurred. People have died. And it is important to highlight this issue because this is among the most critical issues that the American people will address when they vote for who will be the next president of the United States. So I will be talking about the harm. I will be talking about those who have been directly impacted. And I will also tonight be talking with the American people about the power that you, the American people, have to make a decision about the future course of our country. And do we all agree that there are just certain decisions the government should not be making for individuals and their families? I also do want to address the comment that Donald Trump made about America being the trash can of the world, whatever he said. Something along those lines. You know, it's just another example of how he really belittles our country. This is someone who is a former President of the United States who has a bully pulpit. And this is how he uses it to tell the rest of the world that somehow, the United States of America is trash. And I think, again, the President of the United States should be someone who elevates, discourse, and talks about the best of who we are, and invests in the best of who we are, not someone like Donald Trump who's constantly demeaning and belittling who the American people are. America deserves better. And I'm happy to take any questions. WOMAN #6: Ma'am, you're here to talk about reproductive rights in Texas, not exactly a swing state in the last two weeks here. But this is an issue that a lot of voters are coming out to vote potentially for you on.

And in the next 11 days is do you want a president who on one hand in the former President Donald Trump, tried to undo the will of the people, incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol, where 140 law enforcement officers were injured and some were killed?
