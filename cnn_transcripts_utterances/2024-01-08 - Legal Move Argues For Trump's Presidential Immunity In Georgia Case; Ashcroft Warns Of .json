Everybody was packing their laptops up, and the chief of the NTSB, the chair of the NTSB, said, nobody move. We have breaking news. She just learned about it moments ago, called everybody in and said, Bob, the schoolteacher, found a 63-pound chunk of the plane, the door plug, in his backyard. Sent two photos.So, something that we're waiting for, Boris and Brianna, in the hours ahead, are photos of that door plug, the biggest piece of the puzzle. But you're right. In addition, smaller items, can you believe it? Not one, but two cell phones that fell from 16,000 feet. At least one of them was found in good working order. And, you know, listen, the NTSB went all over the airwaves Saturday and yesterday calling for people in the Cedar Hills community, it's about a 15-minute drive away from where we're standing here at Portland International Airport, to walk around their neighborhoods. It's a very packed suburban neighborhood, not in the middle of the forest by any means, and start looking for this door plug.

Someone dropped it while they were jogging. But I found it. It was still pretty clean. No scratches on it. Sitting under a bush. And it didn't have a screen lock on it.

It only started flying in October, so you're not talking about the traditional years of wear and tear and maybe something built up over time. This is something that is relatively new. So, what they're going to be doing is exactly what we're talking about.They're looking at the components involved, say how did this actually, how did this actually break loose? Were there related things leading to it? That's why finding the door was so important, because NTSB traditionally sort of brings all these things together and just sort of recreates everything and says, okay, so how did it come together? Was it pressure? Was it the seal on the door? Was it the door? I say a door. It's not a door. This is as if, in very crude terms, if in your home you decided you didn't need an entrance from the kitchen to the dining room and you sealed it all up, that's what this is. It's not a door.

And maybe it had nothing to do with this.So, they're very careful about saying let's look at all of these elements. Let's look at the force of what happened, the sequence of what happened, when it happened, where it happened, and then say what actually related to something else.

And so, if you had a problem where this door plug was not sealing property or was not latched properly or didn't have all the fasteners, you might have indications that you are not pressurizing properly.And, you know, clearly when this door plug came off, now that we've learned that even the pilot's headsets were ripped from their heads and didn't work after that and the cockpit door was slammed into the bathroom door, this was a much more violent event than initially thought. This was, you know, just a catastrophic depressurization. So, you know, those are a lot of things that will take into consideration.

If you had a pressurization problem, if you had an issue over water, you wouldn't be able to divert and get down in a hurry. And they said it couldn't make the route to Hawaii, for example. But, you know, the Federal Aviation Administration has lots of rules of when you can continue to fly something with an issue and when you cannot. And we can only assume that the aviation regulations pertaining to Alaska Airline Operations allowed it to continue to fly because otherwise, obviously, it's an un-airworthy aircraft and that is a huge FAA violation.",

So when you're, you know, getting ready to fly a plane, when you power up the plane, you know, you do, pilots do the walk down and the plane doesn't have its power on often. Then you get in the cockpit, you turn on the power and you power up the plane. That cockpit voice recorder starts recording right then. And it keeps recording until the plane is powered down. You know, basically you turn off the power. Now, in this instance, it got back on the ground and it got on the ground very quickly. So, once it was powered off, that recording would have stopped right there.If someone keeps, you know, -- if the power is still on, it'll keep recording. And after two hours, it'll just record right over what was there before. This is a mistake. Whether the mistake was made by the airline and they didn't power it down, or the mistake was made by the NTSB who powered it up and had it powered when they started their investigation, that remains to be seen. But critical information was lost. But in this case, you can make up for that loss because both pilots are alive and can tell you what happened and can tell you how, you know, violent the decompression was and what happened to their things.

And then I think there's a real question, Brianna, of whether the Supreme Court takes the case or whether they let the ruling stand by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.If they don't take the case at all, this would be a case that I would say would have what we call persuasive authority for a court in Georgia considering this. In other words, the court in Georgia would look at what the judges in D.C. decided, but they wouldn't be bound by what they decided. If the Supreme Court ultimately takes the issue, that might take at a couple months at least to the schedule, if not more.
