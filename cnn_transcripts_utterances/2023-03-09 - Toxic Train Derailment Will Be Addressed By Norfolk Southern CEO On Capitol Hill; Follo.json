And Erica, this really paints the picture as the reason why. You see those blue containers over there?They are located on the property of a factory which is literally right next door to where the derailment happened. The factory owner says because of what's happening here, his workers are too afraid to come to work. And so, the factory's basically shut down. And that's the bottom line here. This has had a huge economic impact on the community here. Folks are going to be watching and asking what Alan Shaw intends to do about it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CARROLL (voiceover): As the cleanup effort continues in East Palestine, Ohio, Mike McKim says, he has had enough. MIKE MCKIM, EAST PALESTINE RESIDENT AND CO-OWNER, MCKIM'S HONEYVINE AND WINERY: Sometimes when the wind is blowing the right way, it's almost unbearable to stay here. CARROLL (voiceover): McKim is one of many residents who is taking Norfolk Southern up on its offer to pay people who live near the derailment site to temporarily relocate for the next two months. The EPA saying in a statement, Norfolk Southern has agreed to provide additional financial assistance. This assistance may include temporary lodging, travel, food, clothing and other necessities. But McKim worry is not just for his home, it's also about the future of his business. He and his wife, Ashley, own McKim's Honeyvine and Winery, it's located about a block from the tracks.",

In response, Norfolk Southern telling CNN, after initial contact Mr. Wang retained an attorney, who then scheduled a meeting with us before cancelling last minute. We have not been able to reach him since, and we of course must go through his attorney. Regardless, we continue to be committed to making it right in East Palestine, and look forward to following through with Mr. Wang as well. The rail company and the EPA say, the cleanup could take up to two months. Wang says, Norfolk Southern is temporarily compensating his employees during that time.

But now, President Biden, as well as Secretary Antony Blinken, have all addressed these massive protests against these judicial reforms that after core (ph) would essentially allow the Israel parliament, the Israeli politicians to overturn Supreme Court decisions.In fact, Lloyd Austin's own trip to Israel was disrupted by these protests. The Pentagon is saying Israeli officials asked him to delay and then rejigger the schedule. Essentially, he met officials all at a complex right by the airport because those protesters, they were blocking, essentially, the main roads leading up to the airport, trying as much as they could to essentially disrupt the normal flow of operations. Then later, we went to the -- to this main highway in Tel Aviv where protesters also took to that main highway -- this massive highway that cuts through all of Tel Aviv, essentially, completely bringing traffic to a standstill for quite some time until police forcibly removed them using dozens of officers, as well as mounted police. Now, the protests today did not get as violent as the protest last week where we saw Israeli police with a much heavier hand, throwing stun grenades, using water cannons. But still, we are still seeing some remnants of those protesters here in the streets now in Central Tel Aviv. We're still hearing people debate behind us over these judicial reforms. But it was really interesting to hear the secretary of defense weighed into this debate. He was essentially quoting President Biden standing right next to the Israeli defense minister. Saying that the genius of American and Israeli democracy is checks and balances and an independent judiciary. It was a rare foray into internal politics by a U.S. official, but a clear message to the Israelis to come into a consensus with the opposition over these planned reforms. Jim, Erica.",

And she says, I was kicked out, and because of that, I am asking for actual damages in excess of $30 million.Now, she goes into details of what happened. She alleges that at one point, the representatives of the Trust and the suit is against the Trust that owns the home and the land. That representatives contacted her and said, you've got to take a short trip, pack your bags, get to the airport. She did, once there, they told her, you're not invited to stay at that home anymore and you are locked out of that home. And then they went on to say that maybe we can reconcile this and do something, so she is alleging that. Now, she filed a second lawsuit with a nondisclosure agreement saying it's not valid. In response, Tiger Woods filed a response trusted for him saying that she was invited in that home, legal word invited, meaning it can be revoked at any time, while the relationship was going on. This is the home that he and his kids live in, and this needs to be decided in arbitration. We do understand it has been in arbitration but the next step is whether that nondisclosure agreement is valid or not.",

It's open grocery stores, bookstores, pop up stores over the past few years. None of them have been that successful.

And it's being driven by income inequality, the shrinking middle-class, and then rising inflation, pushing more folks to shop in the dollar stores.But a new report shows that many communities are pushing back, Cleveland, Birmingham, New Orleans, they've all restricted the growth of Dollar Stores.
