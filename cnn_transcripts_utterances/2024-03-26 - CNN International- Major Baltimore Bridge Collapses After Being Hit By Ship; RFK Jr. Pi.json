The search is underway for six people still unaccounted for following the catastrophic collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, this after a massive container ship collided with it in the early morning hours Tuesday. This is a live picture of what is left of the 1.6 mile four-lane bridge, which crosses Baltimore's harbor, 35,000 people travel across it every day. And you could see the container ship Dali now entangled in the wreckage. A video camera captured the stunning moment of impact watch as that 984-foot ship appears to lose power and veer into the bridge, sending people and cars plunging down into the water below. Up close, you could see the extent of the damage in these still photos. Authorities credit a mayday call from the Dali just moments before the crash for saving lives as workers were able to stop the flow of traffic onto the bridge. Joining me now to discuss former U.S. secretary of transportation under President Obama, Ray LaHood. Good to have you on. Thanks for taking time this afternoon. RAY LAHOOD, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION: Thank you, Jim.",

This happened shortly before 01I want to play some sound from the recording of that call just as it happened, have a listen. We don't have the sound but we did have from the bridge of that ship, what turned out to be a consequential phone call because it allowed them to cut off any additional traffic there.

The Coast Guard is still up in the air, this search operations still underway.But we also had a chance to speak with some people who said that they had family members, intimate family members who were on that bridge behind me when it collapsed earlier this good morning. And obviously, as you can imagine, they're incredibly distressed, very upset, and still at this point, like many of us hoping for more answers. Now I should say, they said that the workers, their family members, who were on that bridge are from Brawner Builders. It's a local construction company, just about five miles away from this site right here. Before I go on, I want to know, Jim, that Brawner Builders when we reached out to them, they declined to comment to CNN. But the first one when I spoke with said that she has at least two immediate family members who are still missing at this time, obviously, incredibly worried. She didn't want to provide their names at this time. But she said, for example, her uncle has worked at this company for many, many years and just absolutely loved every part of his job being out there on these construction teams. The two other women that I spoke to said that actually one of their family members was the one, was one of the men who survived and was actually discharged from the hospital. But frankly, they said that he's just not doing well. You can imagine the mental and emotional toll that this entire situation has taken on him and his family, and, of course, his co-workers and I'll say that his wife was sitting there while I was speaking with one of the family members and she was incredibly distressed, sad, and stoic as this -- she was processing the events that had happened earlier in the day. Jim, I just want to know also that the Maryland secretary of transportation gave insight into what these workers were doing out here overnight and it was not massive infrastructure problems. It was not a huge different repairs. It was road maintenance. They were filling potholes. That was what the secretary said. Again, just an example of how hard some of these folks are working to make sure that these roads are smooth for us. So again, for all the family members and others who no, these people who are still missing and those who survived incredible -- incredibly tragic day.",

But one of the most interesting things that was said during this press conference is that today, they decided to really take a step back and not even board the ship today because of these ongoing search and rescue operations as these coast card divers and search and rescue crew workers tried to find these six missing construction crew workers.And so, one of the things that the NTSB really wants to get their hands-on is the voyage data recorder, kind of like the black box that you would get on an airplane. This is the data recorder or the ships data recorder, which would have vital information on it about what exactly was happening, perhaps some information about those power issues potentially propulsion issues, that the cargo ship was facing in those critical moments before it crashed into the Key Bridge, which you can see just behind me. But they have -- the NTSB says that they have, about 24 people, two dozen people on site here. They're going to be combing through all sorts of things about the owner and the operator of the ship, the safety protocols that were in place. And then, of course, we know about this, this mayday which undoubtedly saved so many lives because the crew was able to get that mayday out. And the officials on the bridge were able to keep cars from getting onto the bridge, right when that collision took place. But, Jim, today, the big headline from the NTSB is essentially that they will be taking the lead. They have lots of questions. There's a lot of information that they are starting to dig through, but they're taking a backseat right now to allow this search and rescue operation to continue to take place, which has now been going on for well over 12 hours now.",

Kennedy, Jr. more of a threat to -- whose voters as he more likely to take from, Trump or Biden's, or do we know? TALCOTT: That's the ultimate debate, you know, a few months ago when he first announced that he was actually going to run as an independent the Trump campaign was pretty concerned because they had seen internal polling where he was taking votes away from them because remember, he really spoke to a lot of Republicans, particularly on his vaccine seen skepticism when it came to COVID. Now, though, the Biden campaigns seems far more concerned as time has gone on, and they actually have an entire operation dedicated to attacking Kennedy, which I think sort of answers that question in terms of who's more concerned, but we still don't know ultimately at the end of the day where he's going to take more votes from.",

He said that he expects, quote, a major and protracted impact on supply change chains given how crucial the port of Baltimore is to both shipping, real traffic, traffic by roads. Our Danny Freeman is there on the ground. Interesting. No answer to that question as to whether there were any vehicles on the bridge as well, either they don't know or there were none. But right now, the number of missing stands at six.",

You know, there are behind these six people who are still missing, and the other two who were on that bridge, but were able to survive miraculously.

So, again, we're waiting for that crucial answer, but at this point still six people missing and that search and rescue operation ongoing, Jim.",
