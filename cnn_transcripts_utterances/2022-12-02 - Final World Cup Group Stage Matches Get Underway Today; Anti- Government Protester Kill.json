Thank you so much.Earlier this week anti-government protestors in Iran publicly celebrated the ouster of their football team in the World Cup treating it as a symbolic defeat of the Iranian regime. But during those demonstrations a young man was killed. Mehran Samak was reportedly honking his horn in solidarity when he was shot in the head. Human rights groups say security forces are responsible. But authorities deny any wrongdoing and have announced the arrest of several suspects according to Iran's state aligned media. Nada Bashir has been closely following this story and all of the unrest and she joins us now. Nada, what more do you know about this?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is another tragic death of a protester amid the ongoing violence, amid the brutal crackdown of the Iranian regime. And time and time again the regime and the authorities in Iran have denied responsibility for the mounting death toll that we are seeing and the injuries that we are seeing sustained by protestors at the hands of the Iranian security forces. And this of course, another case.Mehran Samak reportedly shot dead after celebrating on the streets with many other Iranians after the loss of the Iranian national team against the United States. Now the authorities for their part -- according to the state-aligned Tasmin news agency have denied any responsibility once again. An investigation was announced by the Iranian prosecutor and they have said that they have detained and arrested several suspects they believe are connected to Mehran Samak death following those celebrations in the street of Iran. But of course, this stand in contrast to the message that we're hearing from human rights organizations, namely Iran IHR, which has played a crucial role in the monitoring the death toll in Iran. They pegged that death toll at more than 400 now, though it's difficult for CNN to independently verify that figure of course. But they accuse the authorities of shooting and killing Mehran Samak. They've also earlier warned that there have been instances, including with Mehran Samak, of the Iranian authorities withholding the bodies of protestors. We did see video, according to Iran IHR of many family members and others gathering outside the medical organization demanding that Mehran Samak body be returned to the family. But we have also now some video from the pro-reform news outlet Iran Wire. They show video of one that appears to be Mehran Samak funeral. Family members there and those paying their respects, chanting death to the dictator. Mehran Samak now of course now joining a long list of people who have been killed over the course of these protests since they began in September. Another symbol of the ongoing anti-regime protest movement.",

And here's what a foreign ministry spokesman said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZHAO LIJIAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): The U.S. has a lot of domestic problems. It has adopted a policy of slackness regarding COVID-19. The U.S. leads the world in both COVID-19 infections and deaths. The U.S. is in no position to criticize China's epidemic prevention and control. Facts have proved that China's epidemic prevention and control is scientifically correct and effective.

      "sentences": "So not surprisingly this spokesman, just like all Chinese officials, have not even acknowledged that protests took place let alone admitting the demonstrations actually prompted the changes and adjustments in their COVID enforcement in recent days.So, there seems to be a two-pronged approach going on here in terms of their official response to the protests. On the one hand they have been ramping up their clampdown on any open dissent. We have spoken to some protestors who told us police actually have tracked them town by geo locating their phones to protest locations. So, there was a lot of high-tech surveillance and crackdown going on. But on the other hand, we have seen some notable changes on the ground with officials in many cities lifting long standing lockdowns, reducing or even removing testing requirements of certain segments of the population. And some cases, for the first time people who test positive are allowed to quarantine at home instead of being sent to those mass facilities often in horrific conditions. So, you know, the thing is there's a lot of inconsistencies and also a lack of clarity so zero-COVID is definitely not ending overnight because the underlying challenges facing the government very much remain in terms of the relatively low vaccination rate among the elderly and the lack of medical resources in dealing with a potential surge in severe cases. But there is one change that we have noticed. That is the shifting in their messaging and propaganda. State media for the first time in a long time, they have stopped demonizing the virus. Instead, they have now been saying how the Omicron variant is milder and weaker. So possibly setting the stage for eventual exit from the zero-COVID policy -- Bianca.",

The students were found stabbed to death in a shared off-campus home shocking a small community who had not reported a murder in seven years. Families of the victims and some in the community are growing frustrated with how authorities have handled the case. Police now say that there may have been more people living in the home than they initially reported. But even that is not confirmed. CNN's Veronica Miracle has the latest.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the first time, police tell CNN there may have been six people living at the house where four University of Idaho students were killed. Until now police have only released information about five of the roommates, three of the victims and two other roommates who were not harmed. A fourth victim Ethan Chapin did not live at the home. A spokesperson for the Moscow Police Department tells CNN investigators are aware of a sixth person who could have potentially lived at the residence. That person was not at the residence on the night of the murders. An employee with a property management company for the home tells CNN that six people are listed on the lease, but they would not release the names. It remains unclear if that six- person lived at the property at any point.",
