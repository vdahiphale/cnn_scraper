It may not be a permanent ceasefire, but probably -- it will probably be something less permanent, some kind of a truce. But that is probably the only way of getting some of the hostages out alive. And Lapid, I think, is very serious when he says Netanyahu, we'll give you political cover if you need it for the duration of the truce. And Netanyahu has to make his choice. Netanyahu can pass this through the Knesset, through the government. He can -- he has the majority to do so, but at the same time, he will lose his own personal majority, the majority he won back in November '22, in the last election. And for Netanyahu, the prospect of losing that majority is something that he doesn't want to face. He fought so hard to get a majority. He fought five election campaigns and spent 18 months in opposition until that moment arrived. And now, to give up on that for the hostage's sake is something which is very difficult for him.",

And as you said at the beginning, we're hearing this back and forth between Washington and Jerusalem in where Netanyahu is sort of saying, yes, this our proposal, but the way that Biden presented it was incomplete or inaccurate. And there are all kinds of details in it which are not exactly as Biden has said. And this where we're beginning to see Netanyahu starting to backtrack, to keep his options open, trying to save his majority. I think if Gantz feels that Netanyahu is not serious, then he will resign within a few days, if he thinks there is a chance. And once again, this all about saving the hostages who are still alive in Gaza.

He's somewhere on the ground, probably surrounded by Israeli hostages as a shield. And as far as -- he can stay there. He's seeing the way that Israel's being pummeled on the national state, the way Israel's international credibility and legitimacy have been eroded, how the Netanyahu government is making all the mistakes. So, why should he move? But Hamas has also other members, other leaders, they have a lot to lose by losing their shelter in Doha and Qatar that may happen in incurring the wrath of the Egyptians. There was also the question of the Rafah Crossing going into Egypt -- going from Egypt into Gaza, which is a crucial life and also for Hamas. So, there are ways in which Hamas can be pressured, even Sinwar can be pressured. But it's true that currently he has every reason to toughen it out and to try and get even be better conditions from his perspective. But at some point, he does need to use this bargaining chip that he has. I mean, he kidnapped those hostages so he could barter them for a deal. He is going to have to make a deal at some point. Certainly, as we know that hostages are dying and he won't have that many hostages to bargain with. And it sounds terribly cynical, but this the way that Sinwar is operating. So, I agree that while Sinwar will probably play tough, it doesn't mean that there is no deal to be had.",

We see his media proxies attack the families in the -- on social media for putting pressure on the government for helping Hamas in that way.

It's a second front. There is a war there, but it's a low intensity war. It's a war which doesn't reach more than a few kilometers beyond the border on either side. And now it -- now it's being brought home by the site -- you know, by these scenes of the terrible forest fires because of the weather now being caused by the rockets. But we're still -- I still don't detect on the Israeli side, and I think neither on the side of Hezbollah a real desire to go for an all-out war, because, first of all, Israel's war weary, Israel's still fighting in Gaza. And everybody knows that the war -- that an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah will mean terrible destruction on both sides, in Israel and in Lebanon.  I don't think -- I think Israel doesn't want that. Ben-Gvir obviously talks because, you know, he's a fascist who -- and a populist who likes to talk about burning other countries and flattening other nations. And so that -- you know, we don't take that seriously. But, yes, there is a serious threat of this escalating into an all-out war, and it's very much connected to what's happening in Gaza, because if there is a ceasefire in Gaza, then Hezbollah will probably stop harassing Israel with these rockets, and there may be an opening for some kind of diplomatic arrangement in Lebanon. But since that is all currently linked to what's happening in Gaza, it means that we're constantly looking backward and saying, oh, can this still be -- can there be some kind of deal with Hamas?

Netanyahu could do stuff after dissolving the Knesset for the space. It will take about three months of an election campaign, which he's currently reluctant to do, mainly because of the far-right pressure. It's certainly an alternative for Bibi. But at the same time, he doesn't -- he may not rush to risk two more years in office in the knowledge that he may not win this election.

And let me explain. The prime minister had given a call, Modi had given a call for a 400-seat goal in India's parliament, for him and his allies. But instead, we've seen a kind of slip, a fall down, a stumble, call it what you will, that has taken Modi and his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the BJP, below the majority mark. What this means is that a politician who has never, never, since he was a state politician in Gujarat, and since he's been prime minister, ever been part of a coalition government where he's had to depend on other parties, he will now have to depend on regional allies, state leaders, to basically form the government. So, automatically, that sort of invincibility, that aura around Modi that he's unbeatable has gone. And secondly, it will raise questions, potentially, about whether the government will be stable in the way that Modi would like, because he's dependent on other parties for political longevity.",

How laws are made in India, how laws are passed in India will dramatically change. In the past, we have seen the Modi government pushing through legislations on contentious issues that they believe in. For example, a new citizenship act is a decision that has been taken by the government that not all of its allies were comfortable with. But earlier, the brute numbers of the BJP in the last two terms of Modi government were so large that they were able to take some of these decisions. Now, for example, the Modi government has long wanted a uniform civil court, one law, one sort of family law that would disallow different communities to have their own laws. To push this through, he needs -- it'll be much tougher for him. He needs the consent, not just of his own partners, but the opposition numbers have swelled in parliament. So, that's the first change we're going to see. How India's parliament works and what kind of laws that can be pushed through. Secondly, there's an anticipation. I think somebody described it well. It's a return to normal politics. You see, today, Modi is powerful, but he feels like another politician. And therefore, there's a kind of normalization instead of the kind of cult of personality, the unbridled power in some ways that Modi had wielded in the last two terms.",

And then, a few weeks later, he sort of distanced himself from those remarks and denied that he was referring to Muslims. But when you spoke to people on the ground, I was really struck by what one farmer told you. He said, politics based on religion is worthless.

And people on the ground said to me, we don't want to hear about, you know, these issues. These are not the issues that matter to us. And I am still mystified as to why the prime minister doubled down on those speeches. It didn't do anything for his image internationally or domestically, and it didn't yield any extra votes either. And I'll tell you something very interesting. Right before the campaign, Mr. Narendra Modi presided over the grand opening of a temple. A temple that was built where a disputed mosque once stood, the Ram Mandir. And of course, Lord Ram is worshipped by millions of Indians. But the BJP thought that this temple moment was going to be its defining moment in this campaign. One of the seats that the BJP has lost today is the town where this temple actually came up. And I found that really very instructive message. The BJP has overused, overplayed the religious card -- the religion card rather.

In any case, the opposition did not declare a prime ministerial candidate. And Modi -- we have -- we're a parliamentary democracy, but Modi made it almost presidential. He made it all about himself. And that comes with benefits and risks. When you win, you get all the credit. But when you drop 63 seats, as the BJP has in this verdict, well, then you made it about yourself.

But in terms of the economy, I do actually believe that the message that Mr. Modi will take and I think we'll have to take from this verdict is to focus on the economy and prioritize it in his third term. I should say -- I don't think it's likely, but I should say that there are certain opposition leaders who are saying, don't take the third term for granted. There are whispers about the opposition trying to break away the two or three regional partners that are with Mr. Modi right now. I don't believe that that will fructify immediately, but there's also a that up in the air. But let's assume for a moment that Modi -- the Modi government does go into its third term. I do think that Mr. Modi will try and repair or salvage the legacy that's got that that's got bruised in this verdict by actually focusing on the economy.

And because, historically, in those moments, particularly when there's an administration change, that's when this movement tends to surge. I was very concerned that people weren't focusing on that, and then January 6th was something that really crystallized that.

But he negotiated that I would be able to be off stage and not have to go out in front of these, you know, people who were yelling at him along with all of these other people who were brought together as hateful websites on the internet. And so, representatives of the Westboro Baptist Church were there, and Nazi groups were there, and my dad was there, and I was there. And I looked back on that, and I remembered it as the moment that I sort of began a path where I felt like I'm a spokesman for this cause, and slowly able to represent myself more, and like take control of that narrative. My dad asked me over and over again, you know, are you sure you want to do this? You can back out. You can even quit even up until the day of the show. And that feeling of him trusting me was something that I remember feeling so cared for and really wanting to give back. And it also taught me all these lessons about just how the world sees us. You know, I was really surprised at the end of the interview, listening to myself explain to Jenny Jones that the reason all these people were so angry at us, the reason that they were jeering and sending me hateful e- mails was because they did not understand us. And I -- just throughout all of my adolescence like that feeling of like my family believes something that they believe is true and moral and the rest of the world just despises them for it. And so, we all have to have each other's backs like that was age 13, 14, 16, 17, all the way until college.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I try in the book to make sure to call it white nationalism or the white power movement, because it's this social movement where thepeople know each other, they believe that they're a part of this, it's a big part of their identity, and that's something that's separate from just like racism, or white supremacy, or being xenophobic, or antisemitic, or any of the specific things they believe because they see themselves as a part of this movement that has 60 years of history and goals, like political and violent goals. And then, what they believe is something that they've taken from all these different aspects of white supremacy in our culture and in our history. They believe that race is biological and it predicts all this stuff about people, which just so thousand times over disproven that it's a social context. And yet, they can be quite educated and convince themselves of this. And then, they also believe in an antisemitic conspiracy theory that all anti-racist movements are really being run by Jewish people, and both of those require that you see the world in a quite strange way. And I think there's also a lesson that I've learned there, which is as long as something is serving your community, people can convince themselves of just about anything. I think there's sometimes this sense that people have to be ignorant or uneducated or desperate to be racist or, you know, bigoted in whatever way, and that was never my experience. People have degrees, they have white collar jobs, and yet, they see the world in a way that explains and justifies their existence. It's not the case that people just have to be stupid and therefore, we can like argue them out of it. It is about their own sense of themselves and their commitment to other people that keeps them in something. And I think that is also the way that you change somebody's mind. It's not by -- it's not just by giving them facts. So, I think it often sounds like facts, but it's about getting them to be open to people that they've never considered themselves responsible for, that never considered themselves like as somebody who loves.",

That -- I mean, we could tell in the days after, and we know much more certainly now that members of this organized movement were reallykey on January 6th to sort of driving the crowd, pushing them further. And I think there's a real lesson there in just how a movement like this operates. It's not that they have millions of members. It's not that they're, you know, malicious or something, it's that they believe things that exist in our society. They lean into ideas that are not like from another planet and they amplify them. They drive people who show up wanting to feel a little bit more justified, who want to not be called racist or some name. And they give them a space where they tell them they don't have to change. They don't have to rethink anything. They don't have to even respond to those words. And then, that's also a point I was trying to make in the book that some of the worst things that the media has done in covering the far-right movement is in acting like somebody being a part of this movement who has a bachelor's degree or who seems kind of nice or who watches movies or goes to chain restaurants like that's strange and notable and like, oh, this person is hateful and also seems kind of normal, that's exactly what this movement wants, that's exactly how they want to be covered.

You love them and they love you. And you wrote, for example, the white nationalist movement that I grew up in is constituted by relationships, both between current activists, as well as their equally strong feeling of inheritance and responsibility to those who came before them. It's impossible for me to truly separate an objective sense of this destructive ideology from the fact that I understand their self-identity, love so many of them, and can never really separate myself from their story.

And in a family, in particular, that prided themselves on being the central leadership of this, this movement. And on one level, that just made sense. Of course, if you grew up in a life like that, then you'll lean into these beliefs and you'll justify them. But I had told myself all along that, if the world thought we were wrong, I wanted to justify it. I wanted to seek out all the, you know, supposed facts. So, my family had acted the same way. But then, when I got to the end of that, people in college had walked me through all the stupid statistics and the ways that white nationalists sort of abuse science and have all this like stuff that's just not rigorous and doesn't hold up. And so, at the end, I didn't have facts to support this belief. I didn't have a rational argument for it. And I had to accept that I'd gotten close to a community that made me recognize I didn't want to be a person who hurt them. And there was no misunderstanding. As long as I was advocating this ideology, I was hurting them. And to get to that point and still recognize that I did not want to condemn my family made me face the fact that my beliefs had been so based in identity, in care and love and wanting to be a part of the group of people who had raised me, like every relationship I had had up until I was 21 years old, and that feeling was just so disconcerting.",

It's been traumatic, though, the cultural silencing that's happened there. Students -- I know students who are there now and they are -- they feel policed and intimidated almost all the time just for their identities. The other thing I do want to mention is I think there's an emphasis that I really learned at New College that is not just about the way that history teaches around racism and antisemitism, but I think also the way that the administration is focusing on queer students, like particularly trans students, is something that is not the same issue, but it's remarkable the way that they're demonstrating how connected they feel like those movements are, that at the same time as this administration is banning the teaching of the history of slavery, the history of racism and white supremacy, teaching people that, you know, you can't say anything that makes you feel not proud about history. And at the same time, they're also banning teachers and students from talking about gender, from talking about sexuality. New College was a place that had a large trans population when I was there and still does. And it was a place that really made an inclusive environment in a society that just broadly is not. And the DeSantis administration has directly attacked trans students. They have imposed rules, policing, usage of bathrooms, making student conduct be something that going into the bathroom that does not align with a birth certificate is a criminal offense for some people and then a student conduct violation where professors are meant to sort of monitor students and their presentations and their lives.",

It's something -- thoughts about gender have been something that I've experienced throughout my life, but it was really at New College that I found a community of people who even described a way to live authentically. And it wasn't until years after New College that I decided and realized, like, I really don't want to, you know, keep trying to be something for someone else. I think I eventually realized there's nobody to try to be something for. And so, I've been expanding, exploring my gender identity and my views, they and she.
