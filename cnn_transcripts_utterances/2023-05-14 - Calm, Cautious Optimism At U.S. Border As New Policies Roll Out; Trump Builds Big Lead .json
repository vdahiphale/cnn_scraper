Calm, not chaos. Just over 48 hours after a COVID-era policy, allowing the U.S. to quickly turn away migrants expired, these are now the scenes at the U.S.-Mexico border. For weeks, U.S. officials had feared that an influx at the border, as a result of Title 42 being lifted, would come, but so far, Border Patrol agents say that those numbers really have not come to pass. Still, asylum seekers who are making that dangerous trek to the U.S.- Mexico border, they will now face a reshaped immigration landscape. CNN's Polo Sandoval is on the ground in El Paso, Texas for us. So, Polo, right now things are a bit more calm, but even at the beginning of the week. But migrants are facing tougher immigration policies now than before. What are you seeing on the ground?",

And those fresh pictures here in El Paso really tell you everything you need to know, as far as what the head of the Department of Homeland Security saying this morning that there was no apparent spike in illegal crossings after the expiration of Title 42.In his conversation with our colleague, Dana Bash, this morning, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, saying that they've experienced about a 50 percent decrease in the total apprehensions. The number that was at about 10,000, leading up to Thursday to the expiration of that public health policy. But in the subsequent days, for example, on Friday, that number dropping to about 6,300, according to the secretary, and then 4,200 yesterday. Today, that number is likely to continue to drop. Now to be clear, the system still remains quite strained. In fact, it according to one senior CBP official that cited and recently filed federal court documents, the number of people who are in custody leading up to that expiration certainly at a record number. So the result has been overcrowding in some of these processing facilities. And at one shelter that we visited yesterday here in El Paso, the folks who run that had to turn away some families saying that they are also at capacity. But perhaps this nearly 50 percent drop, Abby, will allow some of the officials on the ground, some of the people at the very frontlines to sort of get their head above water. I tell you what, there is a number that will continue to increase. And that is the total number of asylum seekers that are arriving in America's largest cities. I've been speaking to many of them whose compass is set to places like Denver to Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York, these are numbers that are likely to rise perhaps by a few dozen a day. But if in New York City where I've been covering this for the last year that potentially can rise by several 100 a day. And that's why you have municipal leaders at the local level that are calling not just lawmakers, but on the President of the United States to step in and to do something to deal with the tens of thousands of people who've arrived recently, who whether Republicans and Democrats like it or not, they are here for many years until their asylum cases play out.",

Today, we are here on a Sunday, what are we seeing on the border? It is not, I think, what Biden's critics have expected and what they were saying was going to happen. So does the White House feel better about the situation good about the situation right now? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, PBS NEWSHOUR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I think right now, they feel good about the situation as the Secretary Mayorkas was saying, that they think that their proposed -- their policies are working right now. And I was texting with an immigration lawyer as well as an advocate that are down there in El Paso, also on the border, and they were saying that right now, not much has changed for them in terms of how they're helping migrants or whether or not they -- they're -- the attorney is working for some migrants across El Paso and New Mexico. They said that they think that that's because of those policies that were then put in place when Title 42 was lifted. So the new asylum restrictions that are being challenged from progressive organizations that President Biden put in place, because these asylum restrictions are so limiting for being able to actually seek asylum, that the lawyer was saying that they think that migrants are aware of that, that they know that it's not necessarily easier right now.

But right now, they're really vulcanized in their camps.And Republicans are really doubling down on this partly because of poll numbers like this from Reuters showing that 60 percent of Americans disapprove of President Biden's handling of immigration.

I mean, immigration is going to remain a central challenge for them. There are -- some things they can do about it, many things they cannot do about it. So if we have fast forward to 2024, in the months leading up to the election, this is likely still going to be a major challenge for them. But one thing absent of all this talk about immigration is any talk actually about immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform. There is a discussion going on, on the Hill about this, but it is, of course, unlikely to happen.

And that for many Republicans, they view the next election as existential. What I see in my polling is that they don't just view the next election as competing two different visions for policy that for many Republicans they have a sort of apocalyptic. This is about the survival of the country kind of view and risking it on going back to Donald Trump who has been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the last number of Republican losses.

Three words that Governor DeSantis says in every speech that he gives, and he said it repeatedly yesterday in Iowa, the culture of losing. He is trying to impress upon Republicans that it must be time to reject the culture of losing. So he's not talking about Donald Trump by name, but he's talking about him in spirit in the midterms from 2018 and 2022.Now the question is, can Ron DeSantis bring it? Now is -- we're on the cusp of him announcing his finally, his campaign that's been in the works for quite some time, likely at the end of this month, perhaps in the very early days of June. And he is going to have to show that he is the athlete that he sort of proclaims to be. Of course, he's a baseball player from college. He's going to have to show that he can perform at a very high level. In a short period of time, there is just about six months or so before, you know, voters really begin finalizing their decisions in Iowa and New Hampshire. So he will have to, you know, build this coalition. But I think early polls at this point where you're saying, we should effectively ignore them, and see what the governor is able to do to win over these people. But he has not yet proven that he is able to sort of live up to the hopes and dreams and aspirations that many Republicans thought he would. BARRON-LOPEZ: Also, if that clip that we played of DeSantis is the strongest that he sounds and going after Trump, I mean, he doesn't even really mention him by name. He talks about this culture of losing. And it's really hard to see how by continuing on in that vein that he wins over this sizable chunk of the Republican primary electorate that is very much still wedded to Trump. And when it comes to the culture of losing, one thing there is, to me, the policy still does stick out because of the fact that DeSantis and Trump are aligned on abortion. And that was a massive issue in 2022. And it's going to continue to be a massive issue in 2024. And how do they win in the suburbs or win back more women that they've lost in recent election cycles when they are both aligned on this issue of against more --",

And it will -- I'm told by some DeSantis advisors, once he is formally in this race, they know that he has to engage more directly on this.But they just view no upside now at this point in the Republican primary, because to win, they believe they would like to peel off some of those Trump voters. But I think one thing interesting happened this weekend that when Trump decided not to go to Des Moines, there's a lot of local Republican activists, who were tweeting yesterday and in the Des Moines Register this morning, wondering why he didn't come. There was a tornado watch, not a warning. It expired before the rally. A small crowd was gathering. We know that Trump can draw a big crowd, no doubt about it. It was very interesting that he scheduled his Iowa rally because he has an eye on DeSantis. So as I know, Trump has had the upper hand in this fight, but we'll see if that continues through the summer.",
