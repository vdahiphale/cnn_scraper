They're not looking for this alternative.But I would also say that this is also kind of now what's happening in public is really what's been happening from - behind the scenes from the beginning. I mean remember when he got in, we know one of Donald Trump's biggest donors was one of the biggest donors to his super PAC.

Can he get that message across, not only of just hope and inspiration, but an economic sort of revitalization for those areas. If he can touch on that, with the joy and emotion, then it will be an effective speech. If he doesn't touch on that, then again this is still going to be an issue that they're going to have to figure out a way to drive home.",

He's been, I think, an enormous asset to her. Tonight will be a time where he will really be in the spotlight, both introducing himself, talking about his own life story, which connects, I think, with people all over this country, but I want to - I'm interested to see, how is he going to make the case for Kamala Harris? What does he - what does he think her strengths are? What is it going to sound like, that full-throated case for her? And I think he's going to be terrific.
