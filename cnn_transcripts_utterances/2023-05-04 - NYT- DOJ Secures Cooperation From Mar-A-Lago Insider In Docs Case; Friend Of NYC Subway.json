He shushed his mother, Princess Catherine, and made other funny faces, during the Jubilee Concert. We'll see if any young Royals do anything similar, this time.

We begin, tonight, with a significant turn, in the investigation, involving Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. \"The New York Times\" reporting, tonight, that federal prosecutors have secured the confidential cooperation, of a person, who has worked, at Mar-a-Lago, an insider whose identity is not known. The DOJ is looking at whether Trump ordered boxes of sensitive materials, out of a storage room. And this insider, according to the \"Times\" has provided a picture. Now, keep in mind this is coming, after CNN's exclusive reporting yesterday, that prosecutors are asking witnesses, about the handling of surveillance footage, at Trump's resort. So, let's begin with CNN's Sara Sidner; former Bush counsel, Jamil Jaffer; and former Obama and Biden adviser, Ashley Allison. But first, let's get straight to CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig. Elie, this is a significant development, it seems. What does it mean, when we say cooperation? And how significant is it that this person is on the inside?",

If so, that's a big deal. We also don't know exactly how much information this cooperator has. We sometimes say there are cooperators, and then there are cooperators! So, it's possible this person will help prosecutors, make some specific points, or connect some dots. It's also possible this is -- this person has sort of the key, to the whole question here, and will be able to walk prosecutors through everything they need to know.",

We now know, not only that there may have been classified documents there. The documents may have been moved at times. But there may have been video of this, and something may have happened with that video. Was that video tampered with? Was it modified? Was it not all that provided to the Justice Department?

The guilty-four are all members of the Proud Boys, a militia group. And it included the leader of that group, Enrique Tarrio. The Justice Department, again, successful in proving a conspiracy to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power. So, when you take this all into consideration, this brings the number of guilty verdicts, or guilty pleas, of seditious conspiracy, so far, to 14.

And so, he wasn't allowed to be there.But this is a conspiracy charge. And so, this jury? And I was there, for some of the jury selection, and I watched some of this trial, as it was going forward. This jury is being asked to look at whether there was a plan, or a plot, not whether or not it actually happened. And what they found, with a mountain of evidence? That can only be described as a mountain of evidence. This went on for 18 weeks, with five different defendants. They found that four of the five did commit seditious conspiracy. The thing I found very interesting, and also somewhat surprising, is that Dominic Pezzola is the one person, they did not find guilty, of seditious conspiracy. But we have seen numerous pictures, and videos, of him, breaking into the Capitol, with a police officer's shield. He's been convicted in other things, and four other things, but not seditious conspiracy.
