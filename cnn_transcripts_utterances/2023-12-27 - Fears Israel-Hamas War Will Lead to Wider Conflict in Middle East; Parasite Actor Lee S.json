The 48-year-old actor, who is known globally for starring in the Oscar-winning movie Parasite, was found dead in his car on Wednesday. South Korean police believe Lee died by suicide.We also know that police have been investigating Lee since October for illegal drug use, allegations the actor repeatedly denied. Lee instead claimed that he was tricked into taking drugs and then blackmailed. He brought a lawsuit against the alleged blackmailer, according to South Korean police. Authorities questioned Lee three times over his alleged drug use, most recently on December 23rd, when he was questioned for 19 hours and released on Christmas Eve. Throughout the investigation, Lee's drug tests repeatedly came back negative. On social media, fans have been paying tribute to the star, whose career spanned two decades. In the United States, news of his death was a top-trending topic on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. Lee first shot to international fame in 2019 for starring as Park Dong-ik, the father of the wealthy Park family in Parasite. The film went down in Hollywood history, becoming the first non-English language film to take home an Oscar for Best Picture. It also won in three other categories. A funeral for Lee will be held quietly, according to local media, with bereaved family members and colleagues in attendance. Hanako Montgomery, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Here are some of the other headlines we're watching this hour.A man accused of stabbing two teenage girls at New York's Grand Central Station on Christmas morning is now charged with a hate crime. Along with other felonies, including attempted murder. Police say the teenagers were eating a meal with their parents when the suspect attacked them. One of the victims suffered a collapsed lung. The other was stabbed in the thigh. Officials say the suspect has a history of at least a dozen prior arrests. A judge has agreed to seal a motion to dismiss the case against Brian Kohberger. He's the man accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students back in November 2022. The judge denied a request by the defense to throw out the charges against Kohberger last week. The prosecution is proposing that the trial start next summer. A nearly perfect holiday vacation turned into a nightmare for several cruise passengers after their return flight landed 11 people in the hospital. About 200 British passengers were scheduled to take a charter flight home from Barbados to Manchester in time for Christmas. But shortly after takeoff, the cruise line said freak turbulence forced the flight to make an emergency landing at an airport in Bermuda. The passengers suffered minor injuries and were not able to fly home until the day after Christmas. P&amp;O Cruises apologized in a statement saying, quote: We are very sorry for this disruption. We worked around the clock with the airline and hotels to take care of the guests and to ensure they got home as soon as possible.",
