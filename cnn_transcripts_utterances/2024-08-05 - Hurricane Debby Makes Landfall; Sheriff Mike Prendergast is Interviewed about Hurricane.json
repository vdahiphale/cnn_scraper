      "sentences": "That's the reporting inside Israel. There's a lot of criticism towards Netanyahu for pursuing just an all-aggression campaign instead of taking the opportunity to get some of the hostages out. And inside Gaza there's a real sense of despair because the friction between Biden and Netanyahu has been widely reported. And yet the White House doesn't seem to get - to be able to get Netanyahu to pull back at all. And that's left us with this situation where we've got this high-stakes face-off between Iran and Israel again. Though I've got to add, Iran has been careful in the past not to cause massive destruction inside Israel because of how that could escalate and devolve into a major all-out war. So, they could, once again, try to do something that causes damage without waking an all-out war.",

Millions of people are now bracing for upwards of a month's worth of rain to fall in just the next hours. This is a life-threatening situation according to experts that could become very dangerous very quickly. An extremely rare level four out of four risk for excessive rain has been issued across three states. The catastrophic flooding is expected in the next few days.Let's get right out to Elisa Raffa, who is in Steinhatchee, Florida, where the hurricane made landfall. You are now off of that pier where you've been most of the day and onto the ground. I see the wind is still whipping pretty hard there.",

And you can see this is the Steinhatchee River. Look at the onshore flow of the water coming in, which is this intense wind right now.We've got high tide, the intense wind, and all of that onshore flow that's picking up some of this surge in the tide. I mean you can see just how quickly this water is coming in, inch by inch, incredibly fast, getting that flooding that will eventually wind up crossing the street here. And this is the big concern. Water is always the biggest concern in a hurricane. We are - we are finding - we are finding that some of the storm surge levels are up over six feet over parts of the big bend here up near Cedar Key. We've already found that this morning, plus eight inches of rain or more. So, water is the biggest concern here right along the coast of Florida. And then, as we go inland the next couple of days, we're talking about a crawl for this storm. It will walk three to four miles per hour, and that could dump feet of rain. Catastrophic impacts are really a concern along parts of the coast of Georgia and South Carolina as we get those rain totals again, 20 to 30 inches. So just watching this very closely as the wind and the storm surge continues to pick up here. Guys.",

A little bit later today we anticipate the height tide that will come in and could possibly bring five to seven feet of storm surge right here in this area where we're standing. And, of course, we've had a lot of other things going on across the community. Fortunately, no losses of life, no folks that have had some serious damage to their home yet, but we do have a lot of saturated ground across the community. And with the saturated ground, combined with all these high winds that we're experiencing, including 30 to 50 mile-an-hour gusts, we could see some trees toppling over a little bit later today and knocking down power lines and damaging some of the roofs and some of the other structures across our - our community here in Cirtus County.",

And a lot of times when you kick the tires on a major highway that's being done with Governor Shapiro now, it's a lot different than when you're kicking the tires and you're just piddling around the city.And so I do think that there is some extra light that is being shed on him and his record. But at the end of the day, can he improve marginally your outcome in Pennsylvania? If the answer is yes, then he should be your choice. Now, there are going to be some factors around the first anniversary of October 7th. You know, that's going to come up and happen. Are we going to have campus protests? Those type of things. His response to campus protests. But at the end of the day, I think Josh Shapiro is nimble enough, and a good enough political athlete to add substantial value to the ticket. And one of the questions people have, and I'm just going to be honest with you, Sara, because that's why I come on TV often is, people want to know, can you have three Jews in the White House? Three Jews and a black woman in the White House. And my answer is resoundingly, yes, the possibility of it just excites me because I want people to see how far this country has come. But if it's not Shapiro, then I think that there's no doubt that Mark Kelly is somebody who is robust, who has one of the greatest resumes we've ever seen for anybody who can possibly be vice president of the United States. And one of the things that Mark Kelly has over Josh Shapiro even is that Mark Kelly has the ability to be president on day one. His experiencing in the United States Senate is just amazing. And just respectfully to, you know, all of the candidates for office, you know, there is one endearing virtue that may, in my heart, put Mark Kelly above all the rest of them, and her name is Gabby Giffords. And so there is an abundance of riches of people running for vice president. And I - if I knew anybody in the Harris camp, I would tell them to tune out the noise - we're not listening to Twitter in this particular campaign - and choose somebody who you can - who you can deal with for the next four years and sit in that office with and work together.",

Obviously, she's looking at three individuals that she thinks hopefully will moderate her a little bit because Lord knows that her record and time in office is not one of moderation. But, I mean, listen to what Bakari was saying right now. I mean, even Josh Shapiro's not progressive enough for some of the Democrats out there. And I think that's the question that's going to be for Democrats is, how does she balance out? Is she - whoever she chooses going to be progressive enough to satisfy the far left of the Democratic Party, which is what's driving the party currently in this country. So, that's really going to be the question for her. But does it matter at the end of the day because really it's going to be Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump. I'm not sure that it does.",

A new CBS poll asked Democratic voters who Harris should pick as vice president. Forty-four percent said a liberal, 41 percent, look at this, said that the person needs to be from a battleground state. And then they looked at man, woman, and you can see those numbers there.
