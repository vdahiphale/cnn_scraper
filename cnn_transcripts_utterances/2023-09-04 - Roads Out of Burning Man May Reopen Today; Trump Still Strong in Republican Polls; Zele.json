So we call that loam. Right? And water, as it rains, easily absorbs into that loam or that earthy topsoil.But when you're talking about rain that continuously falls within the desert, it doesn't take much to start pooling up and then mixing in with that clay, creating that very muddy, cement-like mixture that ultimately cost so much thousands of people to get stranded in the desert of Nevada. I mean, just take a look at some of these visuals. The aerial visuals really speak for themselves. I mean, look at these cars. You can see the muddy tracks. And you can see completely abandoned vehicles, because they simply cannot drive. It is too thick. It is too difficult to navigate that type of cement-like mixture that is a combination of the water not absorbing back into the ground -- we call that an impermeable surface -- and simply the amount of rain that fell in such a short period of time. Here's the radar. And you can see, there are no flood watches in effect for the Black Rock Basin. This is known as a playa. In fact we're going to dry things out rather quickly here over the next 24 hours. So as soon as we get the sun to rise this morning, we'll get that typical evaporation that would happen within this playa that you see just North of empire. That shading of white, that is a dry basin across the desert, and it normally evaporates the water when we get that break in the rain. But that simply didn't happen, because the rain continuously fell over the same areas for a period of time on Friday and Saturday.

You listen to people talk. And it's just this constant how, why? Why does this keep happening? Even after seven years of it always happening, to some degree.

The question is, you know, are there going to -- what other factors are going to emerge? So for example, independent voters may end up caring quite a bit about the emerging Hunter Biden scandal. Is that going to tip the scales? Who knows? Is there going to be, as the Trump indictments evolve, is the optics of that going to continue to help Trump within the GOP but hurt him with independents, which is what has happened thus far? I think you see this 60 percent number, right? We should remember, before the indictments, Trump was polling closer to 40 percent, and that's what I would call -- that's what you might call, like, the personality cult. Those are the people that just like Trump, no matter what. After the indictments, there's another 20 percent of Republican voters or so that have come home to Trump, because they feel that he is persecuted; and they need to rally to his defense by nominating him.",

But the idea of, to Coleman's point, if you break down going into ageneral election, which has long been my question, and then you look at the states that really matter -- and you kind of nailed them, where it could actually come down to the fact that this is literally just a Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona type of moment going into the fall of 2024 -- when you look at those dynamics that we're talking about, the kind of four key pillars there, how do those states break based on those dynamics, do you think?",

Even Roosevelt's four consecutive wins, Frankline Roosevelt, not as many -- not as high a share of states voted the same way. So we're looking at a tiny battlefield. And I think one thing that kind of reassures Democrats amid all of this bad news about Biden and the resistance to Biden in the polls, is that in 2022, I think the results clearly showed that Democrats still have an easier path to 270 than Republicans, especially if it's Trump. I mean, Democrats did win the governorship in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with almost 80 percent of voters saying they were dissatisfied with the economy and a majority of voters saying that they disapproved of Biden's performance or didn't want him to run again because of his age.

Right?Saying that that is not a valid way of restricting the -- the districts in Florida, and that's diluting the black vote. That's the role of the judiciary. And it restores faith that the judiciary is not just playing politics by other means but is actually using jurisprudence to uphold the Constitution. Now, in the context of what's been going on, we've seen some other hopeful examples, as well. Just a few months ago, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Alabama's restricting was similarly unconstitutional and where Kavanaugh and Chief Justice Roberts sided with the liberal justices there.

Many of them I think it's important to note, that had to do with the early days of the war, with Ukrainian taxpayers' money, with Ukrainian weapons. But that has still docked (ph) the image of the country, not just as it seeks to get more weapons from its Western allies, but of course, more broadly, Ukraine looks to joining NATO at some point and its more fundamental aim of being able to join the European Union. So Kyiv has been at pains to show that it is tracking down on these corruption allegations, taking them extremely seriously, dealing with them. And whilst Oleksii Reznikov has not been tainted by them at all, this really allows them to draw a line even as arrests are being made and investigations are being drawn to a close, to draw a line under those first 18 months of the war. Now the man taking over, a Crimean Tatar, Rustem Umerov, who is widely seen as a safe pair of hands. This is a man who has, after all, been involved in several prisoner swaps throughout the war. He's a businessman who's also been involved in the Black Sea grain initiative and is widely seen as a very competent man to take over. Let's be clear, what must be arguably one of the hardest jobs in the world going forward. As you said, the 19th month of this war, it isn't just about sustaining the war effort and getting Ukrainian weapons up and going.
