Just ahead, a grim end to 2023, as Ukraine is hit by the biggest wave of Russian air attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion. Then, disqualified again, another U.S. state kicks Donald Trump off the primary ballot for engaging in insurrection. And this is a wow moment, as a rogue wave sweeps away people and cars on the California coast. We will tell you what happened, next.Explosions rocked cities across Ukraine after what officials there called the biggest wave of Russian attacks since the start of the full-scale invasion. In the capital Kyiv, the mayor says three people were killed and nearly 30 were injured. The Interior Ministry reports at least 18 people were killed and dozens injured across the country in places like Dnipro, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and beyond. Among the buildings damaged, hospitals, malls and apartments. Despite the destruction, Ukraine's Prime Minister says air defenses shot down most incoming targets. Nic Robertson joins us now with the details on this massive attack. Nic, why would Russia conduct an attack at this scale now, and what does the attack capabilities and Ukraine's defense tell us about their relative strengths at this time?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think number one, this could be Russian reprisal for the sinking of a tank carrying -- tank and troop carrying assault vessel that Ukraine successfully dispatched almost to the bottom of the sea earlier this week. It could be also that President Putin is now sort of engaging in this election run. Obviously, there is no real challenge to him, but he wants to make it seem as if he is winning on all fronts in Ukraine. When we talk about the number of missiles fired, and the number shot down, 114 out of 158, that means 44 got through, not an insignificant number.And Ukraine relies on its Western partners for its air defense systems. It has multiple different surface-to-air defense systems, the radars that interlock how they track, where they can track Russian aircraft and missile movement. So, it's a complex system, and it requires a lot of ammunition to successfully shoot down all these attacking drones and cruise missiles, which means they rely very heavily for this part of their defense on West -- on these Western allies. And we've seen the European Union and the United States bulk providing hundreds of billions of dollars of committed military aid over a number of years. And what Russia has done here is very sophisticated. It launched 36 drones earlier on in the night in a pattern that Ukraine is used to. They're pretty handy at knocking down those particular drones. And then, they put up, the Russians, about three o'clock in the morning, put up a number of strategic bombers, 18 strategic bombers, which kind of loitered out there for about three hours before they dispatched 90 different cruise missiles from those strategic bombers. But, in the meantime, Russia has also put up some long-range bombers, eight long-range bombers, and they in that same period of time launched eight cruise missiles. They put up MiG-35s, which have the hypersonic cruise missile on board. They launched five of those hypersonic cruise missiles. They launched surface-to-air missiles, S- 300s, S-400s, on Kharkiv with deadly and destructive effects. So, what they're trying to do is outsmart, overpower, overrun Ukraine's air defense system, which is why I think we've heard from the Moldovans, Ukraine's neighbor, today saying, look, you need to support the air defense systems more. This won't have an immediate effect on the front line. But, psychologically and for the spirit of people who know they've got a winter of this potentially ahead of them, it's a tough moment.",

The UN Relief and Aid Works Agency is warning that 150,000 Palestiniancivilians have nowhere to go, as Israel presses its offensive into central Gaza. And there are dozens of reports that more Palestinian deaths from Israeli airstrikes around Khan Younis and Rafah as well as in central Gaza over the past day. Meanwhile, the Israeli Military says poor communications with soldiers in the field contributed to the accidental shooting of three Israeli hostages. It published a report on the incident which says troops failed in their mission to rescue the hostages. Let's go live to Tel Aviv now and journalist Elliott Gotkine for more on this. Elliott, what further details do we learn from this report?",

      "sentences": "Quite a lot of new details, Bianca. What this was effectively for the IDF was a kind of black swan in the sense that not only do they not expect to see three hostages wandering around the battlefield, but they didn't even imagine that such a scenario could unfold. And as a result of that, they've got this tragic sequence of events that ultimately led to Israeli soldiers killing three Israeli hostages. Now, what they say is, in terms of the chronology of the events, is that on December the 10th, soldiers discovered a note saying \"Help\" just by the side of a tunnel shaft. They believed that that was an attempt to try to entrap them, to try to lure them into some kind of ambush as it happened in the past.In another incident on the same day, they heard cries for help in Hebrew. Again, they thought that that could possibly be a way of trying to lure them into some kind of trap. And then, on December the 14th, an Israeli drone captured images of a building on which \"SOS, help three hostages\" had been written. Again, they didn't think that this was genuine. And so, what happened on December the 15th is that three Israeli hostages shirtless, holding up a makeshift white flag, appeared before Israeli soldiers. One of them identified them as a threat. They say that he didn't have great visibility, and he shot towards them killing two of them. The third ran into a building, was crying out for help in Hebrew. The commanding officer told him to come outside, told office -- told soldiers to hold their fire. But because of the noise of a nearby tank, two soldiers didn't hear that order to hold fire. And as a result, they shot this third hostage dead as well. So, what the IDF is saying is, yes, it failed in its mission, and that it is obviously speaking and communicating to its soldiers to allow for these kinds of possibilities. But also, I suppose, making sure that soldiers follow operational procedures that if they see people emerging that are not a direct and immediate threat, as these three Israeli hostages were not, then that they need to take a moment to consider the situation to see if there is another way of dealing with this situation. But, it's also worth noting, Bianca, that since October 7 when Hamas carried out this murderous rampage in Israel and also kidnapped more than 200 people, taking them back to the Gaza Strip, only one Israeli hostage has been rescued. A female Israeli soldier has been rescued alive by IDF soldiers. No other hostages have been rescued alive. The only ones that have been freed have been those that were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel as part of that truce that collapsed on December 1. And that is another reason why the families who still have loved ones in the Gaza Strip, there are more than 100 people still being held in the Gaza Strip, that's why the families of those loved ones are so desperate to see another truce come into effect that will see their hostages returned home. They want them home and they want them home now. Bianca.",
