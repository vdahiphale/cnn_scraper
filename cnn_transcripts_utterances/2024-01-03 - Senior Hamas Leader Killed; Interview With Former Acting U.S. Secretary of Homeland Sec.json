One of the bombings was caught on an Iranian state broadcast. Watch this. You see the panic in the crowd there. The explosions happened about 20 minutes apart.

State media reporting that the first bomb that blew up today was in a suitcase. Joining us now is Josh Rogin, a columnist for \"The Washington Post.\" Josh, thanks so much for being with us on this incredibly dramatic story. First, I want to ask who you think might be behind this attack, because there is a fairly lengthy list of potential culprits. JOSH ROGIN, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  Right. While we can't be sure, this attack has all the hallmarks of and fits a pattern of attacks by Sunni militant groups against Shiite religious institutions inside of Iran. And Occam's razor says it's Sunni extremists behind it. Of course, we can't really know. Either way, the Iranian government is not waiting for the investigation to blame Israel. They're going to blame Israel, whether or not they have evidence of it one way or the other. And the reason they're doing that is because, one, they're already blaming Israel for a bunch of stuff. And, two, they're deflecting from the idea that this could be an internal issue and not an external issue. And so what that means is that the retaliation from the Iranian side is likely to target Israel and possibly U.S. forces around the region. And that's just going to escalate tensions, raise the risk of a wider spillover for war, and make the already dangerous situation in the Middle East only that much more dangerous and risky in the days and weeks ahead.",

So there is real concern that this could very quickly escalate and become a more regional conflict.

It did blame Israel for the killing of the Hamas leader in Beirut, something the Israeli government hasn't really tried that hard to deny. Basically, what's really interesting is that the Hamas leader that was killed in Beirut was the Hamas ambassador to Lebanon. And, essentially, his job was to try to get Hezbollah more involved in this war. And Nasrallah and Hezbollah have been resisting that this whole time. And now that they have killed him on Hezbollah's turf, Israel may have allowed this dead Hamas leader to achieve in death what he couldn't achieve in life, which is to get Hezbollah more involved in the war against Israel. And that's the risk of these targeted assassinations. You take out a terrorist, but you don't really have control over what happens next.",

They are grappling with a record surge of immigration. Here's just one snapshot. In December, monthly migrant encounters at the southern border eclipsed 225,000, the highest in over two decades. And zooming out, each of the past three years has set an annual record for border apprehensions. In Fiscal year 2023, there were nearly 2.5 million. That's fiscal year.

A lot of questions about how those may be resolved, even as the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, reported that there was some progress being made in the negotiations. There are still some major questions about, one, whether a deal can be reached, two, whether it can pass the Senate, and what will happen in the GOP-led House, where the speaker, Mike Johnson, as you heard it, down on the border, has been demanding that the Senate accept the House-passed bill, which is known as H.R.2 that the Democrats say they simply will not accept because of more restrictive border measures. That is the warning from Chuck Schumer today, when he said that he believes that the Senate deal, whatever is produced, will have to be accepted by the House, and they would not accept the House GOP's proposal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  When the House claims to H.R.2 as the only solution, which every Democrat has voted against, I believe both House and Senate -- certainly, every senator voted -- every Democratic senator voted against it. I think every Democratic House member voted against it as well. If not, it was almost everyone. We're not going to get a deal. But I think that if we pass something in the Senate -- look, we're working hard to get that done. And, as I said, it's hard. It's hard. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, the American people, in poll after poll, are saying that we're going in the wrong direction along that border. You have got blue state governors and mayors that are saying we're going in the wrong direction regarding the border. The administration can change course tomorrow if they want to. They don't seem to want to, which is why we now have a legislative battle on our hands between H.R.2 and what the Senate is doing.

So after three years, you would think that they would change their policies and bring some order back, but they haven't. And I think that's what, again, most Americans and particularly Republicans in the House are very frustrated at that. And then there's a whole number of other things, whether you talk about the parole system, the asylum system, and other things, that I believe have been abused by this administration. It all leads to the same point, which is, you're there. You have taken a note through the office to protect the borders, to protect Americans every single day. And I think, by any honest measure or metric, that's not occurring. And the fact that they won't change their policy, they won't -- you don't even need to admit defeat. You just need to say, our strategy hasn't been working, we're changing, and they won't do that. And I think that's where House Republicans are at the moment.",

We will see what the House ends up doing. And then, of course, it goes to the Senate. But the American people have been clear.

It shows the Japanese Coast Guard aircraft did not have permission to be on that runway as the Japan Airlines jet was landing. Now, as we just mentioned, despite that huge fire that you can see there, everyone on that commercial jet survived. The death toll aboard the Coast Guard jet was six people. And this comes as Japan Airlines is revealing that, after the crash, the plane's intercom system failed, crew members apparently using megaphones to direct passengers to safety and somehow got nearly 400 people off that plane in just a matter of seconds.
