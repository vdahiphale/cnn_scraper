CNN's Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid, and CNN's National Correspondent, Kristen Holmes, are both here with me as we are all watching all of this. And right now, Todd Blanche is asking Michael Cohen about one that he lived in a Trump building, the building with Trump's name on it, and still does, and also asking him, your job wasn't just representing President Trump, you also represented his family at times. Michael Cohen said, I have, yes.",

And in fact, at this time, he was doing work, including work for Melania Trump.Now, there was a reference earlier, I'm sure you heard it when you were in court, to a contract that he reviewed for Melania during 2017 related to ...",

Then he was isolated from this person that he cared about trying to figure out how to stay in his good graces and that's what led to this.Now you're going to see the other side of this, which is them pointing out the fact that Michael Cohen has lied a number of times, not always just to benefit Donald Trump, but also to benefit himself at times.",

That's all great evidence and it's supported by Michael Cohen's testimony.

More of our special coverage from the Trump hush money trial straight ahead.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:17:45]   COLLINS: And we are back covering Donald Trump's - live coverage of Donald Trump's hush money trial. As right now Michael Cohen is on the witness stand and is being cross-examined by Todd Blanche, Trump's lead attorney, about his past positive statements about the Trump family, including in 2017 when he said that he missed Donald Trump. And now they are moving into cooperation that Robert Mueller had - that Michael Cohen had, I should say, with the Special Counsel Robert Mueller at the time. Kristen Holmes and Paula Reid are back here with me. And right now, Michael Cohen is confirming that at some point in August 2018, he decided he was going to meet with the special counsel's office and cooperate. He said, Paula, that initially when he met with them, he was still kind of deceptive in some of his answers. But he is talking now about which the prosecution got to this before they finished questioning him, all of his cooperation that he's had with the investigative bodies looking into Donald Trump and his orbit. And suddenly Trump seems interested in this because our colleagues are reporting that Trump is leaning in to look at the screen as Blanche shows Cohen a document to confirm who was at that August 7th meeting, including an FBI agent and others, when he went back in to talk to Robert Mueller. Well, for Cohen, this is just another entity that he has lied to, the special counsel's office. While he did go back and eventually agree to cooperate, he admitted that, yes, the first time he talked to them, he lied. Now, his defense is he lied to protect Trump. But these lies are really adding up over the entire narrative, something that jurors are just going to have to contend with when they go to deliberations.",

This is at that moment where Michael Cohen has testified also about Trump knowing about the release of the WikiLeaks' emails. All this happening at the same time in the 2016 election is when the Access Hollywood tape was coming out. Roger Stone giving them a heads up about that as he testified. All of this is coming up inside this courtroom, just a complete throwback to everything that was happening.

And he says it was on Trump's behalf, but not all of these are on Trump's behalf. Now, Blanche is pushing Cohen asking, was it a lie? I don't know if I would characterize it as a lie.

So now he is conceding. I mean, how is that going to come off to a jury that's watching this?He's getting a little snippy, that was that was expected. He's been trying to put Cohen on the defensive right now. Trump is looking toward Cohen now, leaning back, craning his neck to the right. So this interaction, where Cohen appears to be getting a little agitated so far, he has been pretty calm, pretty consistent on the stand, steady. But he and Todd definitely sparring back and forth and Trump is interested. Blanche is now asking Cohen what he told the special counsel's team about the Access Hollywood tape.",

He's now a partner at Mercury Public Affairs.And Bryan Lanza, I mean, talk about a throwback as we were talking about everything that was happening in those final days before the 2016 campaign. I wonder what you make as someone who used to work on Donald Trump's behalf of the way that the defense, his attorneys here started out their line of questioning for Michael Cohen. BRYAN LANZA, DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: First of all, thank you for having me. Listen, I think that the challenge that anybody has sort of attacking Michael is that just - he's such a target rich environment. And so you have to find the one that sort of gains credibility with the jury the most. And, you know, I mean, I, myself, having worked with Michael in 2016, even interacted with him through 2020, I never found him being a sort of an honest broker. I'm sure people here on this TV can sort of be a victim of many of Michael Cohen's lies. So it's sort of hard to attack, but I think the best way to sort of make it look like it's a financial, it's revenge, it's personal and that sort of extends to Michael's character, where he has no problem lying to the FBI, to the IRS, to everything else. He's sort of a man that's desperate for money now as a result of his lies. And this just becomes an extension of a revenue stream for him that he desperately needs.",

Doug Burgum, who is a hopeful vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump, as they are trying to undermine Michael Cohen, obviously, that's clearly the tactic. And we understand why the defense is choosing that. But also, I mean, Donald Trump is the one who hired Michael Cohen and kept him around and had him as his personal attorney once he became president.",

Listen, when I worked for Donald Trump in 2016 during the presidential campaign, what I found more interesting than anything else is how people bent over backwards to sort of endear himself, to prove himself, to do things for the president or then-candidate Trump to sort of endear himself with his inner circle with him.I never sort of - I did communications. I did the TV part of the 2016 campaign, which is something that the president, then-candidate cared a lot about. I never really felt micromanaging. I felt once in a while he was telling me to go left or go right to sort of steer the ship. But it was never sort of a micromanager. But I will say this, having been around The Trump Org for a number of years before and after the campaign, you do find a lot of people that will sort of bend themselves backwards to try to please the president and Michael seemed one of those. And that's probably why he was most disappointed. He didn't get anything serious in the administration, whereas everybody in the campaign, even back to the convention, knew that Michael Cohen would never get a job in the administration because he just wasn't a serious person.",
