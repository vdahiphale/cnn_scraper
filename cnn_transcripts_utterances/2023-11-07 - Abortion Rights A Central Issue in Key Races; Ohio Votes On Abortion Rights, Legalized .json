They hope to keep that streak going today in Ohio. But in Virginia, one Republican is leaning into the abortion fight convinced he can snap the Republican Party's losing streak on that issue. We're covering those votes and more. Let's start with CNN Sunlen Serfaty tracking the Virginia race. So Sunlen, abortion is not actually on the ballot in Virginia neither is Gov. Glenn Youngkin. But those two things weigh very heavily on the minds of voters in the commonwealth.",

The Governor himself, he has been really heavily involved in this race though and he has made his abortion proposal front and center in this campaign. He has a political operation. They have invested considerable time and money to rally Republicans around the messaging on this in their quest to flip the senate for the Republicans favor.Now, he is pushing for a 15-week ban on abortions with exceptions for rape and incest and life of the mother, that's much more strict than the current law which allows abortions up to 26 weeks with some exceptions, of course. Now, Youngkin, he's been trying to frame this on the campaign trail as the consensus solution to a very polarizing issue. Here's what he said this morning on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   GOV. GLENN YOUNGKIN, (R) VIRGINIA: We've been very, very clear about, I think, one of the tough topics in Virginia and America, which is abortion. And what the other side has been saying is simply not true. We're very clear. I will support one bill, one bill that will protect life at 15 weeks. A bill that will have exceptions for rape and incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. That's the bill will do. Anything anybody else says is an absolute lie. And to call it a ban is such a mistruth and disinformation and they should all be ashamed of what they've said over this campaign because none of it has been true. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Beshear, he has been at the helm during several natural disasters, during the pandemic, through some tragedies here. And all the while, he has really branded those efforts as everyone being on the same team. And so that is why you even hear some Trump supporters in this state say that they like the governor. Still, though, he has a very credible challenger in Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Cameron is endorsed by the former president that is very popular in this state. Cameron has also worked overtime to try to connect Gov. Beshear to President Biden, who is not popular in this state. And what we have seen him also do is confront the governor on issues when it comes to public safety, education and the economy. To give you a sense of how close things were the last time, that was in 2019, just four years ago, Gov. Beshear only pulled off a victory here by 5,000 votes.

And essentially, the reason I'm interested there is because, get this, it'd be the 24th state to legalize marijuana recreationally. All of these states have done so since 2012. They've done it in red states and blue states. Ohio, of course, being a red state. So it's not just blue states that it's happening.And you noted, Boris, you noted, guess how many days we are now until the Iowa caucuses.

JONATHAN CONRICUS, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Yes, the - I think that it's very clear - first of all, thank you for having me. But I think it's very clear that what we are focused on is security. Ever since October the 7th, we've come to the understanding - the hard, sad understanding - that we cannot allow a return to pre-existing conditions before October 7th and that we have to significantly change the entire security environment. We're in the first stage of implementing that now by dismantling a steady and methodical dismantling of Hamas military infrastructure ongoing as we speak in Gaza now. And once we're finished doing that, and there is no more a military threat, then the process of rebuilding will start. And, of course, that'll be something that the national elected echelons will lead. We will implement it.
