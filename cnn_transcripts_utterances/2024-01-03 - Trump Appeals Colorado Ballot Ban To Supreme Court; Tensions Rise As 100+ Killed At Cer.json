His legal team says what happened on January 6th was not an insurrection. Also tonight, on the brink of a global war. After explosions killed more than 100 people in Iran, the president there pointing the finger at the United States. Is the war in the Middle East about to get much bigger? And we're live tonight in Iowa as Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis face some tough questions with days to go before the caucuses here. Who's got more momentum? Let's go OUTFRONT. (MUSIC)",

We are live tonight from Des Moines, Iowa, where CNN will host back-to-back town halls tomorrow night, days away from the Republican caucus.Now, we'll have much more on that in a moment. But we have breaking news tonight at this hour. Former President Trump tonight asking the nation's highest court to keep him on the ballot in Colorado, filing that appeal. The former president appealing the historic ruling by the highest court in Colorado, which deemed him an insurrectionist and held that that made him ineligible to hold public office, according to the Constitution's 14th Amendment in the state of Colorado. According to Trump's filing, Trump's lawyers were right. The Colorado Supreme Court aired in how it described President Trump's rule in the events of January 6, 2021. It was not \"insurrection\", and President Trump way -- and no -- President Trump in no way, quote, engaged in a, quote, insurrection. Now, separate from the issue of being on the ballot, again, to focus on the crucial point here, they're saying it was in an insurrection. His lawyers going on to write that in the days leading up to January 6th and on that day itself, quote, his only explicit instructions called for protesting peacefully and patriotically to support our Capitol police and law enforcement, to stay peaceful and to remain peaceful. Here's Trump leading up to January 6th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)",

I mean, just take a look at Maine, right? Last week, the secretary of state there announced Trump would be cut from the main primary ballot. Trump is appealing that decision as well. And another challenge to Trump's eligibility for office is now before the top court in the state of Oregon. Well, in a moment, I'm going to speak to the former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb. But, first, I want to begin with the breaking news here with Paula Reid. She is OUTFRONT live in Washington tonight. And, Paula, this appeal coming in the Colorado case which was the crucial canary in the coal mine for this, right? Perhaps led to then what happened in Maine.

You had a chance to see the arguments and the details they make. You know, you thought, originally, this could be a 9-0 ruling in his favor. Not whether he's an insurrectionist, right?

I mean, as you highlighted earlier, you know, you can say fighting 16 times, or peacefully twice, and you know, pretend that you didn't mean fight, and that you can sit in your office for three and a half hours, do nothing, and send out a mean tweet about Vice President Pence, and pretend that you didn't incite these people.But, I think the issue is not whether or not Trump participated or gave aid or comfort to insurrectionists, but whether Article Three of the 14th Amendment actually applies to the president. And I think there, you know, sadly, that Trump has the winning hand under the Constitution. The Colorado Republican Party briefed this issue a week or more ago and their petition for cert, Trump slipped his brief in under the deadline. Why the delay? I don't know. But the argument that is essential to both briefs is the applicability of Article Three. The article, as written, does not mention the president or the vice president. The term officer of the United States is used three times in the Constitution, and the way it's used an Article Three says that anyone who is an officer of the United States who has taken an oath to support the Constitution, that's -- that's an oath that comes out of article three. The Trump oath, the president's oath comes out of Article Four and is not an oath to support the Constitution -- those at the precise where it's used in Article Three, and in -- and an Article Three of the Constitution, and the Article Three of the 14th Amendment. But the words that the president says are to protect and preserve and defend the Constitution. So the oath is different, and the two other times that it's mentioned in the Constitution are the appointments clause and the commission cause, which effectively say that the president appoints or commissions all officers of the United States, and as recently as 2010, Justice Roberts made the point in the Free Enterprise versus the Public Accounting Oversight Board that people do not vote for officers of the United States. So I'm sad to say, on this one, that I believe that the president's lawyers are correct, constitutionally. Other people disagree, and there was a battle of law review articles.

He was assassinated by the U.S. under Trump administration four years ago.

This comes just today after an explosion in Beirut killed senior Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri. Hamas blaming Israel. Israel, of course, is not taking direct responsibility. And the leader of Hezbollah now vowing a response and punishment over al-Arouri's death. Lebanon's foreign minister telling CNN they're desperately trying to hold Hezbollah back from war with Israel. The entire region right now is a tinderbox, with growing fears that this war could spread there and far beyond the borders of Israel and Gaza and the Middle East itself.

But still, if you look at what is going on in the region, and not necessarily in Iran, but the two other hotspots connected to Iran. First, Lebanon, and second, Yemen. Those are two major hotspots that can blow up at any minute. In Lebanon, we are all waiting to see whether Hezbollah will retaliate for the assassination of the official Saleh al Arouri by Israel the other day.

There are natural ebbs and flows to these migration patterns, but also we've heard anecdotally from people on the other side of the border that immigration checkpoints on the Mexican side have become more robust. So, that could play a role in preventing migrants from reaching the Texas border as well. But we've also heard, you know, a lot as we talked about Eagle Pass being this central point and these lawmakers, more than 60 of, them turned out here today, really trying to ratchet up the pressure on the Biden administration to do more on immigration.
