      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to INSIDE POLITICS. I'm John King in Washington. Thank you for sharing your day with us. Our borders are not open. The United States tells migrants to turn around. That after Title 42 comes off the books. Already evidence border facilities are stretched way beyond what they can handle.Plus, here's a debt ceiling personality test. The pessimist view a canceled big meeting today pushes the country further towards default. The optimist take, pockets of progress and staff level discussions are more important than camera ready sit downs. And a longshot proposal from a longshot GOP candidate. Vivek Ramaswamy wants to raise the voting age to 25 with a carve out, he says, for service members and first responders. Ramaswamy says young Americans should earn the right to vote. The math, though, shows, it may well be a blatant attempt to help Republican odds. Up first for us, it is a new day at the U.S.-Mexico border and one of uncertainty, both for the thousands of migrants trying to enter the United States and for the border personnel charged with turning them away. Midnight, Title 42 ended, and so did the Biden administration's power to quickly expel people who enter the United States illegally. The Homeland Security Secretary, marking the moment with a warning. Smugglers, he says, are lying. The border is not open. It is TBD if that message lands or if it's simply too late to level off. An anticipated rush to reach U.S. territory. Today, another 5000 detention beds added and gone are the COVID precautions previously afforded all detainees at intake, transfer or release points. Border Patrol Unions tell us right now they are busiest in El Paso, the Rio Grande valley and two areas in Arizona. Many of the migrant stories we're hearing on the ground share something we can all understand, regardless of your politics a universal longing for a better life and a willingness to risk everything for it. Hunger is common. Clothes often just what you see on their backs. Families often broken apart by the long, dangerous journey. Let's get straight to the front lines of this in Brownsville, Texas.  CNN's Nick Valencia is there. Nick, tell us what you're seeing. NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: John, there's actually fewer migrants being received at these nonprofits this morning than there was at the same time here yesterday. I just got on the phone with Team Brownsville. That's the main nonprofit that processes migrants. They help them out after they arrive in the city with basic goods. They're saying that so far today, they've only seen one immigration bus drop off migrants for humanitarian parole. By this time yesterday, we had already seen several buses. Outside this Greyhound bus terminal, though, there are still dozens and dozens of migrants waiting for enough money to get on their way to get to their next destination. And we thought we'd show you inside here just how crowded it is. Despite those numbers spiking a little bit yesterday, it's well within the numbers that they've been seeing the last two weeks. Between 801,000 migrants being processed at the border and handed over to the care of the nonprofit Team Brownsville. Take a look how active, though, it is here inside this bus terminal. These migrants waiting really, just to gather enough money to get on to their next destination. Meanwhile, we just came from the border and we saw limited activity there. It is quite clear that immigration officials are prepared for this so-called surge and an increase in influx of migration, but they're just not seeing it today. We saw a makeshift tent for processing as well as several immigration buses. But so far today is really not the spike that everyone had anticipated. John.",
