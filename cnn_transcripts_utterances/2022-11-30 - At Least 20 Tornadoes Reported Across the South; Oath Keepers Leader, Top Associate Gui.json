Reports of at least 20 tornadoes, most of them in Mississippi, others in Louisiana and Alabama. Storms cutting a path of destruction, washing out a bridge here in Monroe County, Mississippi, a steeple blown right off a church in another Mississippi community. A tornado watch remains in effect this morning for parts of Alabama, and Mississippi. Let's get right to meteorologist Jennifer Gray. What's the latest now, Jennifer, on this storm threat?",

And as these storms continue to just race off to the east, we will continue to see severe weather across the Deep South, portions of Mississippi, Alabama, on in to Georgia the sun will be up in a few hours and we are going to continue to see a real threat for severe weather.So, 21 tornado reports as you mention, 26 wind reports, 27 hail reports. Look at these hail sizes that were picked up in Mississippi, two inch hail was reported in Louisiana, 1.75 so just enormous sized hail with this system, more than 66,000 lightning strikes. Look at it, just racing off to the east. Current temperatures are pretty mild on the front side of the cold, on the backside temperatures are going to be chilly. So, as this races to the east, we'll start to see the winds pick up and cooler temperatures on the backside. Because it's moving so quickly, we are really not seeing huge rainfall totals, we could have some isolated flash flooding involved in some of these heavier south, but we are basically going to pick up anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rain across portions of Northern Alabama, Mississippi, on into Tennessee, and could pick up about two inches of rain or so. We do have these flood alerts across places in Alabama, Mississippi, Birmingham included in that we do have a flood watch there, a couple flood warnings as well. This should all be wrapped up by the time we get into the later hours of the morning, Christine, but that is going to be a threat for the next couple of hours still very real.",

But he was planning.And, Christine, this guy, he is a Yale-educated lawyer.

So I think -- but it also shows a lot of deliberation, right? It shows that they didn't just go straight down the count and go, guilty, guilty, guilty. They went through each, said look, Rhodes was the ringleader he is guilty of the most serious charge.But what is interesting to me, Christine, as well, if they were all convicted of tampering with evidence afterwards, which it carries a hefty penalty as well, but more importantly than I, that is showing that it is the consciousness of guilt we call in law, shows that if you are trying to cover up your social media, trying to get rid of things on your phone, if you are trying to get rid of all the stuff, after the facts, that shows a consciousness of guilt, that you knew what you did was wrong.
