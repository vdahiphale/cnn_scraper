And Trump is now putting the whole ABC event in doubt, questioning on TRUTH Social why he should go through with it. The drama comes as both campaigns begin a sprint to November, blitzing battleground states, the Trump team now promising a campaign on steroids, as his team shifts strategy, scrambling to cut off Harris' post-DNC momentum. In the next hour, Donald Trump is going to hold a campaign event in the critical swing state of Michigan. Let's take you there now to Detroit with CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's there covering the event live. Kristen, this mute issue is quite notable because his campaign was calling for the mics to be muted, but we heard from Trump today, who says that he doesn't care. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think a couple things are going on here. One, Boris, they believe that last debate, the CNN debate, went well for them and they want to replicate that, they being the Trump campaign, Donald Trump as well, but he also doesn't want it to seem as though he can't do the debate if the mics aren't muted. We know that Donald Trump always wants to appear as though he's willing to do anything. So they do appear to be somewhat undercutting each other. Take a listen to what Trump said when asked about this debate issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're thinking about it. We're thinking about it. They also want to change the rules. The deal was we keep the same rules. Now, all of a sudden, they want to make a change in the rules. We agreed to the same rules. I don't know. Doesn't matter to me. I'd rather have it probably on. But the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time. In that case, it was muted. I didn't like it the last time, but it worked out fine. Ask Biden how it worked out. It was fine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You already said yes.

We have CNN's Eva McKend joining us right now. So, Eva, the issue is whether the mics are muted when the other candidate is talking. And I'm not sure if the Harris campaign has responded to what Trump just said about it not really mattering, matter -- it doesn't matter if they're muted or not, but I'm sure they will be looking at this carefully.",

They had a successful debate previously, in their view. And so they want to stick with the game plan. But, listen, Brianna, this back-and- forth just underscores how much is on the line here. We have seen this entire political cycle how much can change over the course of these debates? Nikki Haley had a breakout moment in the Republican primary, and that changed the course of the primary. President Biden suffered mightily during his debate, and he's no longer in this contest. We're hearing from Brian Fallon, a senior communications official with the Harris campaign, and this is what he is telling us. He says: \"Our understanding is that Trump's handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own. We suspect Trump's team has not even told their boss about this dispute because it would be too embarrassing to admit they don't think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.\" So, Brianna, we will have to see how this issue resolves itself, but, listen, both campaigns jockeying in the days ahead to get the best conditions possible their respective candidates.",

I would also note those three states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin that that Trump is going to be campaigning in this week, they have all behaved together since 1988.

So she immediately energized some key components of the Democratic coalition, young voters, voters of color. They came back to life when she took the top of the ticket. And that plays significantly in a place like Georgia. And so that is why they see opportunity there. That is why the Harris campaign does not believe they are only locked into Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin as the only path to a potential victory here. It's still -- this is going to be a very closely fought race. And it still may be true that the Midwest states, the Rust Belt states, are the ones that provide Democrats their sort of cleanest, easiest opportunity. Nothing here is easy. It's going to be a toss-up race, but their most straightforward path. But Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, you are going to see Harris competing as hard in those states as you're going to see her competing in those blue wall states.",

We're two weeks away. Both candidates see it in their interest for what they're trying to communicate to voters that they should be on that debate stage. So I don't envision this being much more than we see in every debate. There are these little opportunities that the campaigns take to try and dominate a news cycle in advance of the debate, see if they can press advantage a little bit, see if they can work the refs who are hosting and moderating the debate a little bit. This happens every single time. We will see where they land. I will just note that, in 2020, in the final Biden-Trump debate that our colleague at NBC Kristen Welker moderated back when the Commission on Presidential Debates was still hosting these debates, that was sort of a mixed bag. It was the mics were muted for the initial opening statement and answer, the opening answer in a given topic. But then all mics were on for some back-and-forth on debate. Maybe that's a modification that we might see take place here and appease both sides. But I see this more as an opportunity to just create a storm, rather than actual negotiations of the rules. KEILAR:  The Harris campaign says, as there have been questions about when is she doing an interview, that she's going to do one before the end of August. That, of course, means she doesn't have that much longer before.",

If she decides to go sort of with a nontraditional outlet or something or somebody who is perceived as like a friendly interviewer in a way and not sort of a tough mainstream media kind of interview, no doubt there will be assessments on that.What I think is really interesting, Brianna, here, is that Kamala Harris is about -- has had about the best five weeks in presidential politics for any candidate that I can remember. But most of it of the five weeks were scripted. So I'm not taking anything away about the success she had at coalescing the Democratic Party around her candidacy, a shortened vet and selection of a vice presidential running mate, a largely successful rollout through the battleground states of that running mate, and then a roll into what is deemed a successful convention, all the while raising $540 million. So, like, that is a very successful first five weeks. But there are these new hurdles and new tests. And this interview is going to be one of them. The debate will be one of them. These are unscripted formats and an opportunity for the country to see how she thinks on her feet as a potential president. And that, I think, are important.

They had the intelligence and the preemptive strikes that targeted Hezbollah's launch sites, and Hezbollah claims that they fired those more than 300 missiles at 11 military sites in the north of Israel and two others in the center of Israel. But despite the fact that the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, said that they succeeded, there's no evidence to support that. And Israel says that it shot down 90 of those missiles and the vast majority that did get through landed without impact, and for the vast majority without injury. So it does seem that this moment of high tension passed. And what was quite remarkable, if you will, that happened in the early hours of the morning. But, by afternoon in Cairo, both Israel and Hamas had their negotiators there for the next round of negotiations at the senior level. The delegations left at the end of the day. U.S. officials are sounding positive about the outcome. It's not the message that we're hearing from Hamas. They are criticizing the deal that's on the table, saying they want to go back to the one that President Biden spoke about back in May that they agreed to in early July. Israel is being very quiet about how the talks have gone for them. But I think the thing that we can take away here is that there is some momentum in the talks, in that the talks are continuing at a technical level to work out the specifics of how you can bridge some of the gaps on whether or not Israel has troops along the border between Gaza and Egypt, how many prisoners -- Palestinian prisoners should be released for how many Israeli hostages that are held. All those niggly details that are absolutely stymying this getting this going anywhere at a technical level, we're told, they are getting discussion. But I think don't expect a result soon. The positivity is positive. But what we're hearing from both sides is not enough to be convincing that we're close to a breakthrough -- Brianna.",
