The powerful storm expected to deliver catastrophic winds of at least 130 miles an hour and potentially, a 20-foot storm surge along parts of the coast. Helene is set to impact much more than just Florida. Eighty-six million people across five states are currently under a combination of hurricane watches and warnings, as well as tropical storm warnings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA:  So, Florida -- we're just kind of the opening act. You're going to see more, so to try to outrun it is probably not something that is advisable. You can go within your own county to higher ground, a shelter, hotel, friends-family house. That is totally sufficient for this. Remember, you hide from wind, but you run from the water.

But we know that can change very quickly as Hurricane Helene inches closer, right now turning at a category 1. But we know it is intensifying and bringing with it those dangerous winds, that potentially life-threatening storm surge you mentioned earlier, and, of course, flooding, which is a major concern for small coastal counties and also small coastal towns just like the one we're standing in. And just taking a look around -- I know, it's dark right now but you can easily see why that is a major concern. We are just steps away from the Steinhatchee River. And on its banks are homes, businesses, and if you can see behind, even boats just out in the elements -- all of it in the path of Helene and its potentially devastating path. Now, we know Floridians -- they're no strangers to these types of alerts and also to these types of preparations. They have been preparing and bracing for days. A great example of this is just right outside of Tampa yesterday we were in a city called Hudson. And there was a sandbag distribution center. People were loading up those sandbags to protect their homes -- not only their own but also their neighbors. We saw volunteers helping load up these sandbags. And very interesting to us was also a small group of men. These were -- these men were also serving their communities, but these men were inmates -- are inmates and are serving time in the Pasco County Corrections System. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is what he writes in his latest piece. \"When most people think about a voter still trying to make up their mind, they probably imagine a person who is highly likely to vote but uncertain about whether to support Harris, Trum, or a third-party candidate. Both political parties, however, are more focused on a different and much larger group of undecideds: potential voters who are highly likely to support Harris or Trump, but unsure if they will vote at all.\" [05:35:00] And Ron Brownstein, CNN senior political analyst and senior editor at The Atlantic joins us now.

Don't forget even in 2020 when we had the highest turnout since before women had the right to vote, 80 million eligible voters did not vote.

This time, if you look at his gains in polls among non-white voters, among Black and Latino voters, especially men, they're primarily among low propensity voters. So the question will be does the Republican Party of Pennsylvania have the experience and the infrastructure to find the two 27-year-old Black guys on a block in Philadelphia who want to vote for Trump, or in Detroit?

The Mets are now on to Milwaukee for a three-game set. The Braves, meanwhile, will start a series Friday at home against the Royals once Hurricane Helene is gone. Right now, Atlanta a game back of the Mets and Diamondbacks in that National League wildcard race. All right. Caitlin Clark's season, meanwhile, coming to an end last night at the hands of the Connecticut Sun. Clark and DeWanna Bonner getting a little chippy early on. Clark thought she was fouled there. Clark the first rookie ever to go for 25 points, five-plus rebounds, and five-plus assists in a playoff game, but it was not enough last night. The Sun beat the Fever 87-81 to finish off the sweep and advance to the semifinals for the sixth consecutive season. But here was Clark though after the game on her rookie season.

Now this may have been legend Diana Taurasi's final game. The 42-year-old got a standing ovation from the Minnesota crowd when she was pulled from the game in the fourth quarter. Taurasi, though, has not said whether she plans to retire. All right, finally, we have our first big case of when NIL money goes wrong. Starting quarterback Matthew Sluka, who led UNLV to an undefeated 3-0 start in a ranking in the coach's poll for the first time in school history, has quit the program and taken a red shirt because he said he didn't get the NIL money that was promised to him. Now, UNLV fired back saying payment demands were a violation of NCAA Pay for Play rules as well as Nevada state law. But Kasie, I'm kind of surprised it took this long for this thing to happen because you have all these coaches saying oh, come play for us -- we'll give you this. And then you have the people who control the NIL money saying well, you know, you can't really do that. So it's unfortunate that this is where we are in college athletics right now, but it is what it is.",
