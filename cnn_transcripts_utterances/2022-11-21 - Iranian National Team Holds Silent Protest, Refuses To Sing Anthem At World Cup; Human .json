Of course, the build up to this treatment for the Iranian team hasbeen marred of colored by the incredible protests that are now into their third month. Protests which have swept the length and breadth of the country of Iran and which have been met with a brutal and violent crackdown by the government. Human rights groups say that hundreds of protesters, including children and teenagers, have been killed. So, for the Iranian national team to stand there and refuse to sing the national anthem was just an extraordinary moment. It was met with what seemed to be cheers and jubilance from many of the Iranian supporters in the crowd. Because they had been asking for some kind of sign, some kind of indication that the players on this national team, on the highest possible profile stage on the back door of Iran, -- of course, it's just on the other side of the Persian Gulf -- for them to condos indicate their support in this way was absolutely huge. Before the game, we saw a lot of Iranian fans coming into the stadium. Quite a few of them were wearing protest T-shirts. A lot of them didn't want to speak to us because they were really, really concerned that there where pro-government raging spotters in the crowd and they just didn't want to be seen talking to the media. But we did find one couple, Iranian born, now residing in California. They spoke to us and told us why they are protesting and why it is so important that the world focuses on this message.
