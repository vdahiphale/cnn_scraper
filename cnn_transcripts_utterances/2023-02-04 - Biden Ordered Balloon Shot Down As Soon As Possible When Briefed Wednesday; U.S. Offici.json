The F 22 fired a single missile, an aim nine Sidewinder, a heat seeking short range missile that took out that jet, single shot, single kill, you can see, rather that balloon, not that jet. There's the missile on the right, the F22 on the left there that pierced the balloon. And the payload that was under it came falling down from a height of 60,000 feet to 65,000 feet, according to a senior defense official.

Keep in mind, this was a payload hanging under a balloon. So they have to figure out what of it held together as it fell from 60,000 feet, nearly 12 miles high and crashed into the ocean below.

And secondly, we could take advantage of our own capability as they're flying over. So I think the questions will have to be, when did we know that this did not pose a significant or any military or national security threat?

The message came in the form of a sidewinder missile, taking the balloon out that we have the capability to react in any way that's in our interest to do so.

And when this thing was destroyed up here, you see that part dropping cleanly away down here toward the ground. I've been doing a lot of math on this to look at where it came from.From over 60,000 feet, recalculating, we've been talking about terminal velocity for a skydiver being about 120 miles an hour. Let's say this weighs as much as a car, which it easily could and more. In that case, with a higher mass, the terminal velocity might be 500 miles an hour. What does that mean? That means when it hit the water down here, really, it's the same as running into a concrete surface. Huge amount of damage would be done to it when it hit if you're imagining this whole intact at the bottom. That's not really very likely. So recovery, although it's only in 47 feet of water, that's good, because even amateur scuba divers go that deeply. If you have a skilled team working here, this is fairly favorable, the weather is favorable. But they're going to have to start sorting through this debris. They'll start by cataloging everything that's normal procedure, figuring out where it is, prioritizing what they want to bring up, that might give them the biggest reward for all of this, and then coming up with a scheme to actually raise it, through a series of cranes going down, maybe airlifted bags where they put them in to lift pieces up, a piece at a time, trying to keep it all in order and seeing what they can pull together out of this. But it really is important to remember, there's a very good chance that it did go in at 500 miles an hour, 600 miles an hour. At that speed, the impact is huge. The damage is huge. There's a lot to be learned from what is left. But if you're imagining this lying at the bottom of the ocean, the way we saw it floating over the country, floating for more than 8000 miles from China, it's not going to be that way.",

This balloon evidently had, or potentially had some type of guidance system probably propellers on a balloon that took it across this, this approach across the country that overflew several military bases, not just the ones in the, in the northwest, but also in the central part of the country and even in the south, some of the Air Force bases and even some of the army bases. So I think they, you know, the U.S. government is looking at what China is doing, how they're doing it. Sometimes China can be very clumsy in their intelligence collection. And I'm sure there our intelligence agencies in our Department of Defense, have learned an awful lot about how China wants to collect intelligence, and where they're collecting it.

And Wolf, I think it's this last phrase further necessary reactions, which is getting international attention and attention across Asia. Exactly what that means is not clear.

There's all kinds of Chinese surveillance that goes on in the United States, much of which is more severe than this, right? For example, the Chinese at various moments have stolen the data of 22 million Americans who got security clearances from the Office of Management - Office of Public Information from the U.S. They have us use at moments things like TikTok and other apps to go, steal the data of private citizens. They've gone into the databases of Marriott Hotel and health care groups. So many of those are more severe than what you could get from the balloon.

So you know, I don't think they can take that argument too far. I have my doubts about whether President Xi Jinping knew about this or would have wanted this happened just before Mr. Blinken was, was coming.

Was this the real time collection that we've heard about? Was this stored collection? A lot of - a lot of questions there obviously. I can tell you having worked in the FBI, you know, a lot of people, when you think about the FBI Laboratory, you think about DNA analysis, firearms analysis, there's actually an entire division called the Operational Technology Division that is responsible for looking at devices, creating devices. You know, when I was an FBI agent, and we had a problem set, a place we wanted to collect information from, we would go to these Tech Wizards and say, create us a device that can get us to where we need to go. On the other side of that equation, you know, working overseas, whenever we would capture a device in an embassy, for example, we would take it to this team and say exploit this, tell us what this is. So it makes sense to me that this is the team that is doing that analysis. Finally, it's worth pointing out that this will be a multiagency effort. This won't just be the FBI, but it makes sense to me why the FBI would be leading this in their location, because there's also Wolf, a public accountability aspect of this.

And China is a really aggressive perpetrator of intelligence activities against the United States.This particular event happens to be out in the open. Usually, these are things that all happen behind the scenes. So when it comes to intelligence activities, these are all of the components that normally would be engaged the intelligence community, the FBI, the Defense Department, particularly its cybercom, which normally would be involved in activities that China is doing against the United States in terms of cyberspace. So these are the agencies that normally would be part of the intelligence of back and forth that goes on. In this case, we have these physical devices that now are going to have to be analyzed.",

But I think the - my reaction to what the Chinese are saying is that really, when we look at how the United States government has reacted to prior Chinese intelligence activities, really, it's been one of under reaction.As Josh was describing the cyberattacks, just pervasive cyberattacks, year after year, theft of U.S. government records, stealing intellectual property from defense contractors, all of that we've used criminal prosecution as a tool. And we've used some diplomatic back and forth. But there really hasn't been any other significant U.S. national security reaction. We now have a new committee actually, that was formed in Congress that is looking at the China threat in particular. So lawmakers have been taking the threat posed by China more seriously. But because this was in the public, it was something that Americans could see with their own eyes as it was traversing over the country. It just has a different reaction where people see it.",

No injuries have been reported but the train was hauling some 20 cars with hazardous materials, according to an NTSB official, but environmental authorities say they have not detected any harmful releases at least not yet. And they say they are no longer concerned about air quality. The cause of this huge derailment is unclear. Let's go to Memphis right now where the police department is firing another officer after the brutal - brutal killing of Tyre Nichols. The officer is the sixth - sixth fired by the department and internal police probe determined he violated several department policies. CNN\"s Nadia Romero has more.",

Let's get you up to date on the police officers situation. Those officers who were on scene, we now have an additional, a sixth police officer who has been fired. This officer Hemphill, former officer now was one of the first to arrive on scene, tried to tase Tyre Nichols, we can see in the video. Was heard saying something like I hope they stomp him. And so that officer has been fired. And you can take a look here at a long list of alleged policy violations, violations of the Memphis City Police Department's policies including personal conduct, truthfulness, compliance issues here and truthfulness is an important one because we know that the original police statements do not match what we saw in the video and that has come into question time and time again. Now we did hear from the attorney representing former officer Hemphill who says that he will cooperate with all of the investigations into the death of Tyre Nichols. I want you to take a look at the five other police officers who have already been fired and indicted. They've been charged several charges here including a murder charge and an assault charge among many others in connection with Tyre Nichols' death. And now we have two EMTs who have been fired and have their licenses suspended. The allegation is that they waited some 19 minutes before administering some of the most basic aid or care tonight - to Tyre Nichols and we know that he died just days later. I want you to hear from his grandmother, the grandmother of Tyre Nichols and her message to the police officers who were involved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
