It was a little bit of that, but it was dark. It reminded me of his inaugural address the American carnage part of it.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's right. Yes. And even his energy, I mean, one of my favorite tweets about it was even Donald Trump is tired of Donald Trump. And that's kind of how he delivered it. It was very kind of somber and dark, not a lot of energy. And what was also interesting was the crowd too, was incredibly flat. You know, usually there is sort of excitement. Donald Trump has all sorts of one liners and hooks that people can grab on to, and a real vision. I mean, if you remember his first announcement, you know, it was racist and xenophobic, but people could grab on to it, it was something that was new and fresh. In here, this is just an also ran, he seems just sort of out of touch. You know, part of it was him pleading, I think, for the people who are turning their backs on them, that maybe he could be an acceptable version of himself, at least during that hour or two of his speech. But we know there's going to be more to come.",

So I would just withhold judgment on anything here. We'll see what happens. He is still the most formidable force in the Republican Party. We will see where it goes from here. There's no question. You can blame him for 2018, 2020, and 2022. But he's still the most formidable force in the Republican Party. What was interesting to me is he started, tried to frame the speech around when I left office two years ago, and draw a contrast.So he's still very early on, when I left office two years ago, and he said, everything's gone to hell. Essentially, in his view, the unemployment rate is significantly lower than when he left office. The COVID cases are significantly lower than when he left office. The deficit, normally a Republican issue is way down under President Biden than when Donald Trump left office. Now, violent crime is up border crossings, a key issue for Trump are up. So there's an opening there, but just the floor -- it was just, like, it was his grievances against Biden, I guess, to find the speech.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. That is something that stuck out to me a lot. Whether that will be a winning message for him is remains to be seen. The only thing that really stuck out to me is how he didn't talk about the 2020 election very much at least as much as we've seen him do in the past. It makes me wonder where his advisors and his ear telling him this is a losing message. Clearly that was resoundingly rejected in the general election, even though it was clearly a winning strategy in the primaries.But you know, I question whether Trump has the capability to look inward at what went wrong in his campaign, what went wrong in these midterms? And if he's able to recalibrate and adjust his message, I don't know that he is. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: And also, when he left office, the Capitol was on lockdown. There was National Guard troops around it. You couldn't -- there was fences around it, there was a military state in Washington, D.C., so that has to be part of the narrative that Trump is obviously not talking about, but he also has investigation after investigation, state investigations in Georgia, in New York, that Department of Justice is investigating him. So ultimately, it's up to voters. But this is the narrative that he is running in.",

But number two, now that he's an official candidate, the Republican National Committee will not pay his legal fees. And so part of my question is, is part of this to raise money? You saw the text Donald Trump on his thing? There are the investigations right there. There are two federal investigations wanting to declassify documents, wanted, did he try to obstruct the transfer of power in the United States.There's a tax trial underway for organization right now in New York. There's the Georgia grand jury investigation, which is getting some really high profile witnesses this week and there is more. Is it almost like to challenge prosecutors?

It's not really clear who there is a lane for that, you know, can fill up a lane that could actually challenge Trump. We saw last time he was able to win because it's a winner take all system and then everybody else who weren't named Trump split the vote. So we'll see.But I think this weakened Trump and the fact that he doesn't have the same megaphone that he used to have with \"Fox News\" with \"The New York Post,\" I think their non-headline was Florida man announces for president at the bottom of the cover of \"The New York Post.\" So there is a whole different dynamic going forward.

Democrats decided to wait until after the election to bring this legislation to the Senate floor believing it would be easier after the election to get 10 Republican votes needed to advance debate. This is the first major test of the post midterm legislative mood as Congress begins a year end session with several major issues looming, including that small thing called funding the government, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hopes the same sex marriage bill is a positive beginning.
