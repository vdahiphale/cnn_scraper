      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Bianna Golodryga in for Isa Soares. Tonight, tensions flarebetween Israel and Hezbollah and Lebanon after a day of deadly cross-border attacks. Then anger and frustration in Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his negotiators will not be re-entering talks with Hamas in Cairo. Plus, a major military success for Ukraine as it destroys a Russian warship in the Black Sea. All this and much more ahead. We begin with growing fears of a full-blown conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon after an escalation and deadly cross-border attacks. Israel's military says a soldier was killed by rocket fire on an army base in northern Israel today. It says at least, eight other people were injured in the attack on the city of Safed. Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility. But Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Hezbollah targets across Lebanon in response. Lebanese sources tell \"Reuters\" and other news outlets that four people were killed, including two children. There's also deepening concern today about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Panic is soaring in Rafah where more than a million Palestinians are seeking refuge. Many say they don't know whether to stay and risk death as Israel threatens a ground offensive or to return to what's left of their hometowns and face a further risk of starvation. The head of the World Health Organization tells CNN that a ceasefire is needed now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: As you know, more than 28,000 deaths now and more than 70 percent are women and children. That alone is enough to stop the war. Because those who are dying are the wrong people and who haven't done anything to bring this problem. So, the best solution for this is to find a political solution. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I don't think we're there, and the escalation that we've seen today over the past 24 hours, strikes in Qiryat Shemona late last night, the IDF responding, Israeli Air Force striking a couple of targets inside of Lebanon late yesterday and then today, Hezbollah, though, they haven't claimed striking this important military base, killing a soldier, seriously injuring reservists, injuring several other people in that -- in the town of Tzfat. And the ID -- and the Israeli Air Force responding, targeting five different Hezbollah sites, command and control. They described those sites as being -- it has that -- the potential to grow from there. And I think where we're at, at the moment is the ball in the sort of military tit-for- tat terms, is in Hezbollah's court. But the diplomacy that's been going on over the past few weeks is hoping to head that off, but I think every time you sort of get to a small climax in the exchanges as we've witnessed over the past 24 hours, it begs the question, is that diplomacy going to -- going to win the day? And certainly, the talk from the head of the -- no, with the chief of staff of Israel's military, General Hezi Levi, talked about, you know, a long operation in the north of more to come. This is -- this is not the end of it. So, this is posturing, yes, would there be an intent to follow through if necessary? Absolutely. Yes, but the language very much feels like posturing and creating a very firm -- a very firm knowledge in the minds of Hezbollah commander, said if they -- if they upped the ante, Israel will do the same.",

There are real fears around the impact that a ground operation by the Israeli military could have on civilian life in Rafah. As we know, some 1.5 million people according to the United Nations are now concentrated in the southern city. Many of them have been displaced a number of times already, they were ordered to move south for their safety and protection. But this is an area now that could not only see airstrikes as it has done over the last couple of weeks, but also now see a fierce ground operation. Now, as you mentioned, Bianna, the Israeli Prime Minister has ordered and directed the Israeli military to prepare for what is being described as a mass evacuation of civilians from the city. But at this stage, no military proposal has been presented just yet, we have little to no detail as to where exactly civilians are expected to be evacuated to. And what we have seen on the ground and what we've been hearing from our colleagues on the ground in Rafah, is that many civilians are now choosing to flee the city, moving back further north into parts of central Gaza that they had previously evacuated. And of course, this is an area that is almost entirely destroyed after more than four months of war and airstrikes. We've seen civilians -- we've heard from Israelis who have been moving back up to areas like Masada to Andel Labella(ph) which have come under heavy bombardment. There was a real sense of fear amongst civilians in Rafah over what is to come now. Of course, U.S. President Joe Biden has said that while the U.S. is not completely opposed to an operation in Rafah, if indeed this is focused on targeting Hamas infrastructure, it cannot and will not support that operation unless there is a credible and executable plan for the protection and safe movement of the civilians. We have just in the last few heard from the French President Emmanuel Macron, warning against this operation, saying that it would, in his words constitute a violation of international humanitarian law and could have severe consequences for the region more broadly. And of course, there are fears that addition to the situation that civilians will face on the ground, and of course, the real fears of bloodshed on the ground heard from the U.N.'s humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths, warning that this could lead to a slaughter in his words, in Rafah. But there are fears about the ramifications this will have more broadly in the region. This has been a key feature of discussions between regional leaders, and of course, in those negotiations in Cairo that Nic was just mentioning there. There are concerns that if we do indeed see a ground operation take place, that could put any sort of  negotiations around a prolonged truce in jeopardy. Bianna?",

On the flight that we just took from Tel Aviv to here, Flight 131, which was named for the 131 days of captivity that the hostages who still remain in Gaza have endured. I spoke with several of these family members, and what they told me is that on the one hand, they are looking for justice. They are looking for accountability. They hope that prosecutor Khan of the ICC will indeed use the evidence that they have presented to file charges against Hamas' leaders. But beyond that, they are also hoping that the world doesn't forget what has happened to their loved ones, and they're also hoping to build pressure not only on Hamas with the hope that sanctions could soon follow on these leaders beyond this ICC filing. But also of course, on their own leaders, and on leaders around the world who are working to try and negotiate a potential ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

REAR ADMIRAL MARC MIGUEZ, COMMANDER, CARRIER STRIKE GROUP 2: The sustainability, we can go for a long time. We've got our logistics train already mapped out to stay here as long as the president needs us to stay here.",

The U.S. doesn't have a great picture of that at the moment. But for now, they say, they're going to continue this mission, this presence in the Red Sea really for as long as it takes.

      "sentences": "Well, there is a very serious debate inside the House Republican conference right now about how toaddress this Senate foreign aid package. Speaker Mike Johnson told a group of closed -- a group of members during a closed door meeting this morning that there's no rush to figure this out, but he still did not reveal his plans. However, he does have a couple options at his disposal. The first one, he could just ignore it altogether. That is something that some of his hard right members are encouraging him to do. But the risk there is that if he doesn't articulate his own plan, that may inspire some Republicans to try to team up with Democrats to use this procedural tool known as a motion to vacate to force a fuller (ph) vote on that Senate aid package. Another option that Johnson has is to rewrite the package, and there are some early discussions about what that might look like. Some of the ideas they're discussing is attaching their own border security bill to the Senate package, that is something that passed the House already, a bill known as H.R.2, it's a very hardline border security bill and that would make it unpalatable in the Senate. So, it's not really an option that would get something to President Biden's desk. There's also some discussion about stripping out some of the Ukraine aid. Stripping out, particularly, the humanitarian assistance, so it only includes military assistance. The thinking there is that perhaps it's more palatable in the Republican conference if it's just a more pared down version of Ukraine. But I talked to some of those hard right Republicans and they say they don't support a dollar for more Ukraine money. And some of them have also warned that they would threaten Speaker Mike Johnson's speakership and his job if he were to put a bill like that on the floor. So, as of right now, no decisions have been made at this moment, though, the speaker is requesting a meeting with President Biden to try to sit down and figure out a path forward yet.",

At least 30 people were detained according to officials. Protesters are calling for the government to put in a place -- to put in place a law to better support the price of crops. Authorities have been increasing security around New Delhi, fearing a repeat of protests in 2020, which saw farmers blocking roads and setting up makeshift camps for months. The demonstrations come as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been busy overseas. Earlier, he inaugurated the first Hindu temple in the United Arab Emirates. Well, a hurricane uncovered a mysterious shipwreck off Canada, and now a winter storm threatens to damage it. The shipwreck appears on the shores of Newfoundland in January, while it's lodged in the shallow waters off the Coast of Cape Ray. The wreck's origins remain unknown and scientists may not have a chance to figure it out. An approaching storm is threatening the wreck. So, what is the storm threat to the shipwreck? Joining us now from the CNN Weather Center is Meteorologist Chad Myers. Chad, what a great time to talk about something that, yes, it is weather related, but there's a lot more to this story.

Now, it's finally on shore, and the problem it's in the surf zone where the waves are coming on shore. Let's get you a little bit closer. So, there's the U.S. Here's Newfoundland. Here's Nova Scotia. All the way in now, it actually landed on a beach and there was a man looking for shorebirds along this beach from Cape Ray and he came along something that was in the water and wasn't there a couple days ago. But right here -- it's not there right now because this is a picture from Google Earth and it didn't exist here a couple of years ago. But now that ship is right there. So, let's get rid of this and we'll show you what's going on. Here's Hurricane Fiona. All these onshore winds, all so much erosion from St. John's all the way down to Nova Scotia. It was a dreadful scene when Fiona came on shore up there. But now another storm system is beginning to move on shore here, and I just talked to some guys there in St. John's and they said a half a meter of snow and the winds are blowing 60. So, this is what the shipwreck looks like. It's an old wooden boat. Talked to the president of the Shipwreck Preservation Society, he said it's at least 115 feet, so probably 35 meters, and it's not even all here. They took some wood cores. They took some samples. They took some metal off the boat, which is likely like a copper or bronze, and they're going to try to figure out what this shipwreck was, or at least what it is now. Now, this is likely a very large sailing vessel. So, it's upside down. Can't see any kind of a mast or where they would have been attached. But so much of this here with these wood pegs coming through here, kind of like dowels holding parts of the ship together. And so, it is going to be a long process before we can actually figure out or if they can figure out what this ship was. There are thousands and thousands of wrecks off of Newfoundland and Labrador. He believes that -- Neil Burgess from the Preservation Society said that there are 700 that we already know of. This actually could be one that they knew of but just got blown around. But now it's getting beat up by the surf along the shore and that's what they don't want to happen because otherwise it'll just come apart into many, many pieces. They want to try to keep this together if they can to get it to possibly a museum because this is kind of a special place up here. I mean, you get up toward Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, this is pristine, pristine area. And so, to have just a ship, kind of, show up on your beach is not something they're used to up there, I'm afraid, Bianna, but --",
