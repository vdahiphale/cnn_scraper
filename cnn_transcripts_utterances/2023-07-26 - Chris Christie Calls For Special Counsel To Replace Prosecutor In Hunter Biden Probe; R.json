The twists and turns from inside the courtroom, and what this all means for the ongoing federal investigation.Plus, Mitch McConnell, standing frozen, mid-sentence, for 23 seconds, before the Senate Minority Leader was escorted away. He did return. But the whole incident is renewing questions, about the 81-year-old's health. And new information, tonight, on the health of LeBron James' 18-year- old son, Bronny James, what we know about the tests that were done before, his cardiac arrest. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE, what was supposed to be a 30-minute formality turned into almost three hours of drama, as tonight, Hunter Biden's plea deal hangs in limbo, raising new questions about where this leaves the President's son, and his legal team. Hunter Biden entered the courtroom today, prepared to plead guilty, to two misdemeanor federal tax crimes, and avoid prosecution, on a gun charge. It all started with normal procedural questions, as Hunter Biden explained his tax troubles, and detailed his history of drug use. But things went off the rails, when it came to the scope of his immunity deal, on potential additional charges. Say for example, illegal foreign lobbying. The Justice Department said it would not make him immune, to those potential charges. But the defense seemed to think that it would. The parties began furiously negotiating, in the middle of court. And the judge later said, she could not accept a plea agreement, today. As the deal began to unravel, Reporters, who were in the room, in the courtroom, said that the President's son grew agitated, and worried. The judge also raised what she called, quote, \"Concerns,\" about the constitutionality of the gun aspect of the deal. Three hours later, Hunter Biden exited the courtroom, after pleading not guilty, and being processed, like any other defendant. House Republicans, who, I should note, tried to block the entire plea agreement, before Hunter Biden showed up to court today, responded this way, on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I think it's all driven by the whistleblowers, and just how credible those individuals are, and the fact that their testimony has not wavered. REP. RALPH NORMAN (R-SC): It collapsed, because it was a sweetheart deal, from a family that has been protected. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Hunter Biden is getting a sweetheart deal that no other American, who wasn't rich, and had a father, as the President, would ever get, ever. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If you believe the whistleblowers, and what they're saying, no, this was a sweetheart deal. It was corrupt, in terms of how it was handled. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You've agreed to everything else. You've had a colloquy that says, 'Do you know what you're getting into defendant? Are you aware of all the things you're giving up here?'\" It seemed pretty clear that based on the absence of information, and a certainty, about the scope of this plea, Biden didn't necessarily have all the details, in place, to know what he was likely doing. And that's when the judge steps in. I will say though, I don't think I've ever -- don't know about you, Shan.

In defense of the defense, I can see how they might have been more comfortable, with ambiguity, saying, \"OK, let this go forward.

And, look, on the political side, people are going to say it's a sweetheart deal. It's going to -- it's evidence that the justice system is working.

We're not even going to file this indictment. We're not going to charge you. But if you do something differently, we reserve the right to do so.\" The judge is normally not a part of that interaction, because it's between the prosecutor, and the defense counsel. People may remember though, consent decrees. When we were at the Civil Rights Division, normally, we'll work with the DOJ, of course. And a local jurisdiction, in say, a pattern and practice dispute, with a police department. And they'll say \"Here, court, here is our contract.

It's not easy to carry that legal burden. The former President can have his Super PAC or his PAC pay for the legal costs. Other people involved in this, whether they are people, like Giuliani, or people like Walt Nauta, don't necessarily have the deep pockets, to handle this.

But his plea deal, unraveling today, is already showing up, on the Republican 2024 campaign trail. One candidate, Chris Christie says he has, quote, \"Seen enough.\" The former federal prosecutor, and former governor of New Jersey, says that the Trump-appointed attorney here, U.S. attorney, on the Hunter Biden case, should be fired.

And what I do know, being on the ground, in Iowa, and New Hampshire, is that the voters on the ground, they're very concerned that we've got a two-tiered justice system that there's one set of rules, for one party, and another set of rules, for another party. And it's not just politics. This actually concerns the foundation of democracy itself. When we start to have a lot of citizens, maybe even majority of citizens, start to question whether this -- whether our institutions of justice, are actually fair? That starts to erode democracy itself. And I think one of the things that is missing in this country is trust in our systems. And one of the reasons that we're running for president is to make sure that we've got leadership, in the White House that can help rebuild that trust, and help America focus, on the issues that matter to every American, like the economy, like energy, like national security.",

Of course, they told Dr. Sanjay Gupta that, that the testing is part of this routine. It's a part of the program, for prospective NBA players. And that's why Bronny James underwent it. Joining me now is CNN Sports Analyst, Christine Brennan. Christine, I mean, you have covered so many young star athletes, in their time.

He's an excellent basketball player.And LeBron has always talked about wanting to play with his son, someday, because they're only 20 years apart, in age.
