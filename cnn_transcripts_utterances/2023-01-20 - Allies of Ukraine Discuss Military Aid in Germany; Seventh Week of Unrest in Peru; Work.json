Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom.\" Ukraine's allies are gathering in Germany to discuss pledges for billions of dollars' worth of advanced weaponry. We look at what Kyiv is getting and what more it wants.Plus, a potential arms race in Asia. Why more people in South Korea say they want their country to join the nuclear weapons club. And as Iran hands down death sentences to protesters, we'll speak with one man fighting to prevent his cousin's execution. Ukraine could be getting a major boost on the battlefield as western allies are set to meet soon at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. Representatives from more than 50 countries will be on hand, hoping to map out plans for military aid ahead of a spring offensive by Russia. The U.S. had already announced another $2.5 billion in aid including Stryker combat vehicles, more Bradley fighting vehicles and HIMARS rocket systems. But Germany is hesitant to offer its advanced Leopard tanks unless the U.S. commits to sending M1 Abrams tanks. A senior Biden administration official tells CNN Germany has the U.S. over a barrel. Meanwhile, nine European countries are pledging their support including Howitzers and ammunition from Estonia. Anti-aircraft guns from Poland and Lithuania, and a squadron of Challenger tanks from the U.K. Still, President Zelenskyy wants more. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator):  We push politically as best as we can, but the most important thing is we push with arguments. Against thousands of tanks of the Russian federation, it is not enough. The courage of our military is not enough, and the motivation of the Ukrainian people is not enough. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

An aim that the Ukrainian government has been appealing for in particular, of course, the new U.S. aid package when it comes to security in (inaudible).Just in fact in the last hour, it is understood that the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Alexei Reznikov, on the sidelines of today's session. Reznikov also been meeting with Jens Stoltenberg focusing in particular on the calls from the Ukrainian military officials and government for increased military support. And of course, we've already heard thanks from President Zelenskyy himself directed towards the United States with regards to the significant aid package announced yesterday. This is what President Zelenskyy had to say in his tweet, \"Thank you to the president of the United States for providing Ukraine with another powerful defense support package worth $2.5 billion dollars. Stryker IFV's, additional Bradley APCs, and Avenger air defense systems are important help in our fights against the aggressor. Thank you to the U.S. people for their unwavering leadership and support.\" But of course, one crucial element remains for President Zelenskyy and that is the supply of more tanks out where the U.S. aid package is extensive. It did not include the supply of those M1 Abrams tanks which President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian government have been calling for. However, the U.S. government has been cleared. It does still support the supply of more modern western tanks to Ukraine. And that is where, of course, do breach a crucial sticking point with regards to the German-made Leopard 2 tanks. Now, Germany has been hesitant to supply those tanks to Ukraine or rather to allow four other countries, third countries to supply those tanks to Ukraine without a similar commitment from the United States. So that will be a key focus for leaders in their discussions today. Kim?",
