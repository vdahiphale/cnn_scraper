President Biden drawing parallels between the Second World War and today's war in Ukraine on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Aviation anxiety. The U.S. and allies warn that China is trying to recruit western ex-military pilots to train their own. Helium hiccup. Boeing Starliner successfully delivers two astronauts to the International Space Station, but not without concerning gas leaks. And combating cancer. The CEO of AstraZeneca discusses precision drug therapy, making weight loss drugs cheaper, and hiring more workers, not less, thanks to A.I. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, world leaders gathered in Normandy on Thursday for the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Twenty heads of state attended, including U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, and King Charles III. They connected the bravery and sacrifice of 80 years ago to the war being fought in Ukraine today, characterizing both not just as a fight to save lives, but also a clash of ideals. President Joe Biden reiterating that democracy needs defending. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're not far off from the time from the last living voices of those who fought and bled on D-Day will no longer be with us. So, we have a special obligation, we cannot let what happened here be lost in the silence of the years to come. We must remember it, we must honor it, and live it. And we must remember the fact that they were heroes here that day does not absolve us from what we have to do today. Democracy is never guaranteed. Every generation must preserve it, defend it, and fight for it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is a very smart and sophisticated scheme by the Chinese government to recruitwestern pilots to teach not at Chinese flight schools, but in-flight schools in other countries, yet, the students are Chinese military officials. The western pilots, including those from the United States, have flight skills that are the envy of the Chinese military. There's no question that Chinese military is very strong and really robust, but is lacking, according to some analysts. When it comes to flight operations, that is where these western instructors come into play, teaching Chinese pilots everything from combat techniques, how to land on an aircraft carrier, but perhaps even more valuable insight into the western ideology of military play, the western technique, the western thinking when it comes to air operations. It is believed the number of western pilots involved in all of this, it numbers into the dozens. This is been an ongoing concern. In fact, recently, NATO and the United States held a conference, a meeting, to discuss this type of recruitment. Obviously, the United States is going to get a lot of attention with all of this, but it's not alone. It's the United States, it's Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, these five eye nations that are also collectively raising these alarms. Julia.",

It's part of a beautiful, and he says, inseparable bond between North and South now fraught tension once again. There used to be a time when we talked about peace, he says. But it's all changed now.

Now, farmer Kim has told us that during moments of heightened tension in the past, the South Korean army has kept him from entering about half of his property because it is so close to the DMZ, in order to keep him and others safe. VALERIO (voice-over):  The question now, how will North Korea respond, especially after a show of force by the United States? A B-1B bomber on Wednesday, flying over the Korean peninsula and for the first time in seven years, engaging in land target practice with live munitions. We asked Kim if he wants to leave. His answer -- KIM YOUNG-BIN, SOUTH KOREAN FARMER (through translator):  I want to move to somewhere else, but I can't afford it. We're very upset that the balloons are making our daily lives inconvenient in our areas seen as a war zone. It's very unfortunate. There's nothing we can do. If I could, I would want to stop them, but it's difficult. VALERIO (voice-over):  So, for Kim, there's no choice. Staying in his field, surrounded by waters from the north.

What they were doing in the meantime is they were shutting off those systems to conserve all of that. And then they would turn them on when they needed the thrusters. So, it all worked fine. They still want to know exactly what's going on with those leaks, why they keep happening. And at the same time, they had a separate issue. They lost five thrusters on the spacecraft's propulsion system on -- just during docking itself. They were able to recover four of them, delayed docking by about an hour. Required some manual control by the astronauts. But they want to figure out what that was about too. Again, they said that it's no issue for the rest of the mission.

In three test flights, SpaceX, first of all, couldn't reach space. And then, when they did earlier this year, they couldn't bring the spacecraft all the way back to earth for a splashdown on the ground. Well, that's exactly what happened on this flight. The super heavy booster splashdown on a controlled landing in the Gulf of Mexico. And then, this Starship vehicle, with visible damage on the way down, as you watch the flap burning away, it would -- the camera would go out, it would come back. There were cheers from SpaceX. The camera cracked at one point, blacked out, came back again, and it executed what appears to be a good splashdown there too. A big, big milestone for SpaceX and a very exciting mission to watch.",
