The other thing Zelenskyy brought up that a lot of people have been talking about is this critical dam here in the south, the Kakhovka dam. The Russians had claimed the Ukrainians were planning to blow it up. The Ukrainians, in turn, are saying that they believe it could be a Russian false flag operation in the making.

You know, Anthony Rapp was asking for $40 million here, and it stemmed from an incident he said in 1986, and the only reason this case could be brought was because of the New York Child's Victims Act which actually expanded the statute of limitations for those who were minors at the time.But there were three charges initially, two of them had already been dismissed. The only charge that was going to the jury was battery. And it all stemmed around what Anthony RRapp said was a party in 1986 at Kevin Spacey's apartment right here in New York City. And Rapp had been in a Broadway show at 14 and it had just ended. So, he said he wanted to meet people because he wanted to get to know other producers and things and Broadway. So, he went to the party. A lot of people there, it was so noisy. He went into the bedroom. He said he sat on the bed and he watched TV. He suddenly realized all the people had left. Spacey came in, very drunk, lifted him like a groom would to a bride, took him to the bed, placed him down on the bed and laid on top of him. Well, in closing arguments, the defense said to the jury the devil is in the details. They turned it all around. We tried to find anybody that went to that party. No one -- we asked Mr. Rapp name some people you met. No one. Laid out the floor plans of the apartment. There was no bedroom. It was a studio. There was a bed right in the middle of the one room. There was no door. And they continually focused on all of the inconsistencies of the testimony. Battery under New York law is a touching. There is not consent, and a reasonable person would find it offensive. The jury was supposed find a preponderance of the evidence more likely than not this happened to find him liable. They did not find that. So, as the defense drove it home, there was no party. There was no touching. There is no valid charge here -- Wolf.",

Protesters say that they are violently detained, placed in overcrowded detention facilities with hundreds of others where they are tortured for days.

Some of them say they have been coerced into signing a confession saying they have been paid by the U.S. and Israel to create chaos in Iran. And even after their release, they don't leave them alone.
