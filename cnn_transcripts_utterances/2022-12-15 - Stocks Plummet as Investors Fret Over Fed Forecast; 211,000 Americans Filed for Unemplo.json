Maybe a bad 24 hours.The market is basically giving a big thumbs down to the idea that the Fed is going to be able to tame inflation without causing a recession. And today's retail sales report really is what kicked off this sell- off in a big way. Retail sales were up, year over year, but that's not adjusted for inflation. And if you adjust for inflation, it implies retail sales were actually down. Month over month, they were down by .6 percent. That was a much bigger decline than was expected. Actually, there was supposed to be a slight increase. So there was no decline expected. This was the worst retail sales report since the end of last year, as you can see on that chart. That is raising concerns that the consumer might be tapped out here because of high inflation. They're dipping into savings, turning to credit cards. And this would be of concern because consumer spending is the engine that drives this economy. And these numbers suggest that that engine is not firing on all cylinders right now.",

And it suggests a lot of employers are reluctant to let go of employees because there's a worker shortage right now.Continuing claims, though, they stayed at the highest level in about 10 months. That's a sign that people are staying unemployed for longer because hiring has slowed down. And the Fed thinks that is a trend that will continue because the Fed, yesterday, they went out and projected the unemployment rate will go from this historically low level today, of 3.7 percent, to 4.6 percent next year. That's not high overall, but it does suggest significant job loss. That would mean that roughly 1.6 million more people would be unemployed than there are right now.",

And they had gone to dinner and they were on the bus, they were singing gospel songs. But he told me his phone, it was going dead. But I did get a chance to pray with him.

OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDICA REPORTER: Well, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi obviously controls the House for now, and she has not indicated whether this is going to get a vote before the end of the year. So it's really unclear when this legislation could eventually become law. But I think the big picture is that TikTok is under growing pressure, political pressure in the United States as it's trying to hammer out a deal with the U.S. government to continue operating in this country.
