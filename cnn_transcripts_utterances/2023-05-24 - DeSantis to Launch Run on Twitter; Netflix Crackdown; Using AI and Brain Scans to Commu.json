Ron DeSantis has made sort of a name for bypassing traditional media. As we all know, everything is heading towards streaming. And this is going to still be covered in mainstream media. But the attacks also kind of write themselves by Trump.Twitter is a platform Donald Trump understands. I think Dan Scavino, his digital guy, is chomping at the bit for how they can disrupt this, what they can, you know, use their army of trolls to try to distract from this launch. So, it's a gamble. It's - if it were advising DeSantis, I think it's too big of a gamble because the first day of the launch is the easiest day of a campaign, straight down the middle, like, no screw-ups is kind of what you're going for. And I also expect to see Trump recycle kind of the Biden attack of like he's in the basement. He's not on camera. He's not out talking to media. So, there is some attacks that write themselves.",

I haven't seen anyone make that issue yet, but it's still kind of a bank shot. I mean Sonia Sotomayor is 68.

So they should lean more into that.I would agree that I'm not sure this is as strong. He's actually taking it from the Trump playbook.

So, this is Netflix sharing globally. Households who share, 100 plus million according to Netflix. And that is out of 233 million households that subscribe. So, a large portion, in fact, do share those passwords. And here's another reason why they're doing it. They're seeing some - their subscriber growth is shrinking, right? So it was up only 5 percent this past quarter from a year ago, 7 percent it was last year, 14 percent, 23 percent. So, this is not the trendline Netflix wants to see.
